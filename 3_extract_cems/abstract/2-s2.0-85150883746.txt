There has been an increasing demand for the development of low-cost and environmentally friendly two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure materials for energy storage and conversion systems due to their superior chemical and physical properties. This study reports a direct and feasible hydrothermal approach to synthesize nickel-doped bismuth-layered double hydroxide as a 2D heterostructure bifunctional electrode material (acts as anode and cathode) for symmetric supercapacitors. The designed electrode can work within a wide and efficient operating potential window, delivering a specific capacity of 450C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an outstanding cycling performance with 93% capacity retention being stable after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivers significant specific energy of 43 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 725 W kg−1. These results are among the superior symmetric supercapacitors reported previously, indicating a potential strategy for designing efficient symmetric supercapacitors for real-life applications.
