Following sol-gel route, hierarchical mesoporous nanostructures of lanthanum chromates (LaCrO3) perovskite oxides are successfully synthesized for supercapacitor applications. The structural behaviors of nano perovskite oxides are investigated using X-rays diffraction, low and high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopes, photoelectron X-ray spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The as-prepared LaCrO3 powders is mingled with activated carbon and subsequently glazed on a flexible carbon cloth current collector (LCO@CC). The electrochemical capabilities of LCO@CC based electrode, such as: cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge:discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are investigated in neutral M LiCl aqueous solutions. Moreover, the fabricated LCO@CC electrode achieves maximum capacitance of 1268 F/g at 2 A/g and retains excellent cyclic ability of 91.5% after 5000 charge:discharge cycles. The efficient electrochemical performances of carbon cloth decorated LaCrO3 electrode are credited to dynamic charge storage mechanism by fast redox reaction of electrolyte-electrode interactions with extremely low charge transfer resistance.
