Two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide Ti3C2 (MXene) is exemplified as the promising electrode material for supercapacitors. MXene was derived by etching of Al-layer from MAX phase (Ti3AlC2), and MoS2 was confined on MXenes through incipient wet impregnation of MoS2 precursor. The prepared MXene and MoS2/MXene materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, BET analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical characteristics of MXene and MoS2/MXene heterostructures were evaluated by different techniques such as cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements revealed that the maximum specific capacitance of the MoS2/Mxene electrodes reaches up to 342 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 0.4 A g−1 in an enlarged voltage window of -1.5 V to 1.5 V. Also, Electrochemical impedance studies show that the incorporation of MoS2 decreases the charge transfer resistance of MoS2/MXene. Overall, the electrochemical performance of MoS2/MXene exhibited excellent reversibility, cycle stability, and rate performance. The obtained results uncover MoS2/MXene as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
