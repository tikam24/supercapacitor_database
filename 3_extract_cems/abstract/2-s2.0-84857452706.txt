Carbon xerogels and Ni-doped carbon xerogels prepared by the sol-gel polymerization were examined to reveal the effect of metallic nickel incorporated in carbon matrix on the physicochemical properties of carbon xerogels and their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor electrode in aqueous 6 M KOH solution. As shown by XRD and XPS measurements, the decomposition of nickel precursor in carbon matrix led to the creation of well-crystalline particles of metallic nickel which gave rise to the changes in the morphology, chemical and porous structure of carbon xerogels. Due to the modification of porous structure the surface area increased from 595 m 2/g via 632 m 2/g up to 660 m 2/g for carbon xerogel, 7 wt% and 10 wt% Ni-doped composites, respectively. The enhancement of the surface area occurred along with diminishing the BJH average pore diameter. The value for nickel free xerogel amounted to 11.35 nm, whereas the value of 5.71 nm was measured for 10 wt% Ni xerogel. The changes in the porous and chemical structure created during the formation of carbon-nickel composites as well as the pseudo-capacitive effects arising from the redox reaction of nickel particles present in carbon matrix brought about a significant improvement of electrode capacitance. Electrochemical measurements showed that in comparison with capacitances measured for nickel free electrode (82.1 F/g calculated using the cyclic voltammetry and 88.8 F/g calculated using the galvanostatic charge/discharge method), the respective capacitances for 10 wt% Ni-doped carbon xerogel increased up to 103.0 F/g and 103.4 F/g. These values correspond to 25 and 16% improvement, respectively. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
