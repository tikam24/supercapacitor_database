In this report, a simple and cost effective hydrothermal method has been used to fabricate Desert rose like heterostructure of NiCo2O4 nanoflakes@PPy nanowires arrangement supported that potential electrode candidate for Ni foam. The Ni foam has been performed that massive ion transport of electrolytes were analyzed by three and two electrode systems. The fabricated heterostructure NiCo2O4/NF@Ppy electrode deliver a high specific charge 1717 Cg-1 and remarkable capacitive retention 98.9% at current density 20 Ag-1 after 10,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapcitor cell (ASC) was assembled by using NiCo2O4@PPy as positive electrode and activated carbon (Ac: carbon black: PVDF) as negative electrode. Therefore, the ASC delivered intensively high energy density (68.9% Whkgâˆ’1) and power density as (1771 Wkg-1) and extraordinary capacitive retention 89.2% after 10,000 cycles at 30 Ag-1.
