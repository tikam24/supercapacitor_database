Semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) have received huge attention for energy conversion and storage due to their unique characteristics, such as quantum size effect, multiple exciton generation effect, large surface-to-volume ratio, high density of active sites, and so on. However, the holistic and systematic understanding of the energy conversion and storage mechanism centering on QDs in specific application is still lacking. Herein, a comprehensive introduction of these extraordinary 0D materials, e.g., metal oxide, metal dichalcogenide, metal halides, multinary oxides, and nonmetal QDs, is presented. It starts with the synthetic strategies and unique properties of QDs. Highlights are focused on the rational design and development of advanced QDs-based materials for the various applications in energy-related fields, including photocatalytic H2 production, photocatalytic CO2 reduction, photocatalytic N2 reduction, electrocatalytic H2 evolution, electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, electrocatalytic N2 fixation, electrocatalytic O2 evolution, electrocatalytic O2 reduction, solar cells, metal-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, metal–air batteries, and supercapacitors. At last, challenges and perspectives of semiconducting QDs for energy conversion and storage are detailedly proposed.
