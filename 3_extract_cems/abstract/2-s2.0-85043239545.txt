Energy storage devices and systems are now playing a major role in electrical systems from small electronics to automotive applications and to the utility power grid. This chapter reviews energy storage devices, management, control, interface, and demonstrations for electrical power systems. Various types of energy storage systems (ESSs) are discussed with a main focus on batteries and ultracapacitors. Different types of batteries and their electrical models are explained. Three major types of ultracapacitors are also discussed. The main concepts of battery management systems, including functions, controls, and hardware, are introduced. Various power electronics-based interface systems for battery and ultracapacitor charging and discharging are presented. Finally, applications of ESSs for the utility power grid, including renewable firming, power shifting, and ancillary services, are discussed.
