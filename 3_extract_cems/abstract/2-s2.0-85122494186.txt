Energy is considered one of the most significant issues in the modern world. Energy production and storage from disposable biomass materials have been widely developed in recent years to decrease environmental pollutions and production costs. Rice wastes (especially rice husk) have a considerable performance to be used as a precursor of electrochemical energy storage (EES) electrodes including the electrodes of batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid EES devices. The low-cost and benign rice wastes including rice, bran, rice husk, rice straw, rice starch, and rice stem have been used to fabricate rice-based biochar. The electrochemical results of the rice biochar electrodes (anode and cathode) in the EES devices have determined that these low-cost and benign EES electrodes not only reduce the production costs but also obtained appropriate electrochemical performance and environmentally friendly behavior.
