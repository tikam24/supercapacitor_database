A major disadvantage of supercapacitors in comparison with batteries is significantly lower specific energy. By assembling of six packaged supercapacitor cells of 3000 F and 2.5 V into a packaged module, a decrease of the maximum specific energy from 4.7 Wh/kg for an individual cell to 2.7 Wh/kg for the module takes place. Such values are related to high performance supercapacitor cells/modules available as commercial products at this time. Elimination of the cell packages and direct connection in series of the six cell coils results in specific energy higher than 3 Wh/kg towards 4 Wh/kg due to reduction in the module's weight. Because the specific energy of a module cannot be higher than that of a component cell, higher specific energy for supercapacitor cells is required. Further increase of the specific capacitance from 15-20 F/g to values higher than 100 F/g by improvement of the manufacturing process can enable higher specific energy. Â©2008 IEEE.
