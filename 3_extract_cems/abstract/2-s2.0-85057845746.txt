Research carried out over the last few decades has shown that nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion require higher performance and greater stability. The nanomaterials synthesized by diverse techniques, such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, microwave, and co-precipitation methods, have brought energy storage and conversion systems to the center stage of practical application but they still cannot meet the capacity and mass production demands. Most reviews in the literature discuss in detail the issues related to nanomaterials with a range of structures synthesized using the above methods to enhance the performance. On the other hand, there have been few critical examinations of use of the electrophoresis process for the synthesis of nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion. The nanomaterials synthesized by electrophoresis processes related to colloidal interface science in the literature are compared according to the conditions to identify promising materials that are being or could be developed to satisfy the capacity and mass production demands. Therefore, a literature survey is of the use of electrophoresis deposition processes to synthesize nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion and the correlations of the electrophoresis conditions and properties of the resulting nanomaterials from a practical point of view.
