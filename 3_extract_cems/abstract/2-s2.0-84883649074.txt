Supercapacitors have been intensively investigated as energy storage systems because they can delivery high power and have long lifecycles. Their storage ability depends on the types and forms of the electrode materials. Recently, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer was used as the precursor of the fibrous carbon materials by electrospinning process. However, PAN was known to be difficult for controlling the pore size and surface properties of the obtained carbon fibers. In addition, carbon fiber s from PAN didn't enhance the efficiency of supercapacitor electrode because most of them consist of micropores. In this study, we utilized the natural ability of the amylase and amylopectin polymer chains within corn starch to assemble into as organized nanoscale lamellar structure, which consists of crystalline and amorphous regions, to obtain porous carbon nanofibers. We also used carbon nanotubes as reinforcements to enhance mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber webs. Carbon nanofiber web implanted with carbon nanotubes consists of highly porous surface structure by controlling the carbonization temperature.Â© 2008 Metal Powder Industries Federation.
