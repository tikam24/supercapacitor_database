Well-defined flake-like polypyrrole grafted graphene nanosheets composites (PPy-g-GNS) were fabricated by the in-situ chemical oxidative grafting polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of the 4-aminophenyl modified graphene nanosheets (AP-GNS), which were prepared via the coupling reaction of the graphene nanosheets (GNS) with diazonium salt. The flake-like PPy-g-GNS composite showed the high conductivity at room temperature. A maximum discharge capacitance of 191.2 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s could be achieved in the three-electrode cell electrochemical testing in 1.0 mol/L NaNO 3 electrolyte solution. It is higher than those of the AP-GNS, pure PPy, and the GNS/PPy composite prepared with the unmodified graphene nanosheets (GNS). The flake-like PPy-g-GNS composites also exhibited the excellent electrochemical stability even after 1000 cycles. It revealed the synergistic effect betweenthe conducting polymer and the carbon-based support. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
