La1-xAgxMnO3±δ (where x = 0.00, 0.04 and 0.08) perovskite samples were prepared by the co-precipitation method as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The characterizations of the prepared samples were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The structural characterizations of the prepared samples reveal that the samples are crystallized in rhombohedral perovskite crystal structure with space group R3c. The electrochemical properties were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The present results show that Ag doped LaMnO3±δ can be used as a promising material in supercapacitor electrodes.
