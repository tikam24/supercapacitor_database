The paper proposes a new architecture for a small off-grid wind-power generation, control, and storage system. This system employs a wind turbine, power electronic converters, supercapacitors, and operates with a variable d.c. voltage in the intermediate d.c. circuit. A significant amount of the generated energy is used to warm water, as an additional storage capacity. Since the voltage across the supercapacitor changes as a measure of stored energy, a new class of power converters and their control has been proposed. An energy management strategy, specific to this scheme, has been implemented. The paper presents the overall design for the system, for power converters and the control strategy. Extensive simulation results are provided. Â©2010 IEEE.
