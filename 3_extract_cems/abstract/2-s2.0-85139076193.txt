The manuscript presents the results of the modeling of a hybrid power supply for powering an autonomous load. The system consists of a fuel cell and a supercapacitor and the control of energy flows is realized with a DC-DC converter. The model is realized in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simplified fuel cell and supercapacitor models have been used to obtain relevant results. The use of these models makes it possible to perform long simulations, with times of the order of minutes.
