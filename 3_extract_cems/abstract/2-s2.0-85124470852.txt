Supercapacitor stores energy through the interfacial contact of ions between electrodes and electrolytes; thus, the surface area and porosity of electrode materials are critical to determining the energy performance of the supercapacitor. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been widely investigated as supercapacitor electrodes, which are generally synthesized by thermal treatment of electrospun precursor polymer nanofibers. In this study, the energy storage performance of CNFs was improved by modifying the chemical structures of precursor polymers. A blend of aromatic polyimide (PI) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was chosen as a precursor and it was crosslinked before thermal treatment to improve the surface properties. Electrochemical properties were measured by assembling coin cells, and CNF electrodes derived from crosslinked PI/PVDF exhibited a specific capacitance of 322 F/g (10 mV/s) and energy density of 11.6 Wh/ kg (0.5 A/g), which showed significantly higher energy storage properties than those of non-crosslinked one.
