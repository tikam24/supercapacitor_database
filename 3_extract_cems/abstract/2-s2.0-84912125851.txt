We reported a low cost and high efficient method to fabricate free-standing sulfonated graphene/polyaniline (SG/PANI) nanocomposite papers. The nanocomposite paper had layered structure, and polyaniline (PANI) was uniformly intercalated into the sulfonated graphene layers. The nanostructured PANI was coated on the surface of individual SG sheets. It was found that the sulfonated graphene actually acted as dopants to dope with the PANI. The SG/PANI nanocomposite papers had thin, lightweight, and flexible characters and its supercapacitor devices displayed excellent electrochemical performance in terms of ratio capacitance and good cycling stability. Its ratio capacitance reached 478 F/g at a discharge rate of 0.5 A/g and its capacitance retention rate maintained 88% of its original capacitance after 2000 cycles.
