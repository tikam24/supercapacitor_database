NiMoO4/g-C3N4 was fabricated by a hydrothermal method and used as an electrode material in a supercapacitor. The samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to study the physical and structural properties of the as-prepared NiMoO4/g-C3N4 material. The electrochemical responses of pristine NiMoO4 and the NiMoO4 /g-C3N4 nanocomposite material were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). From the CD studies, the NiMoO4 /g-C3N4 nanocomposite revealed a higher maximum specific capacitance (510 Fg−1) in comparison to pristine NiMoO4 (203 Fg−1). In addition, the NiMoO4 /g-C3N4 composite electrode material exhibited high stability, which maintained up to 91.8% capacity even after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. Finally, NiMoO4/g-C3N4 was found to exhibit an energy density value of 11.3 Whkg−1. These findings clearly suggested that NiMoO4/g-C3N4 could be a suitable electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
