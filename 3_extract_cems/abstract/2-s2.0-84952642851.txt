Potentiostatic depositions of zinc oxide (ZnO) on titania (TiO2) nanotube substrate have been observed to demonstrate remarkable enhancement in the supercapacitance behavior as reported in this study. Systematic evaluation of the morphology and crystal structure of the electrodeposited ZnO phase was carried out using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments indicated that the electrode can attain a maximum specific capacitance of 304 F g-1 that was partly attributed to the electro-active ZnO phase and partly to the highly permeable, porous, and unidirectional nanotubular TiO2 substrate.
