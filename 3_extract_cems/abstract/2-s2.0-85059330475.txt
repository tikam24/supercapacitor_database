Construction of transition metal oxides-based carbonaceous nanostructures has been regarded as one of the most effective strategies to prepare the electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. In this work, NiCo 2 O 4 embedded carbon nanofibers (NiCo 2 O 4 -CNFs) are synthesized by the combination of one-step electrospinning and following thermal treatment. The obtained NiCo 2 O 4 -CNFs are evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitors. The testing results indicate that the NiCo 2 O 4 -CNFs present high specific capacitance of 836 F g −1 (vs. 38.02 F g −1 for carbon nanofibers (CNFs)) at 5 A g −1 , and outstanding cycling ability with 80.9% retention after 2000 cycle times. Such excellent performances benefit from the integration of electric double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. This kind of NiCo 2 O 4 -embedded carbon nanofibers can serve as a promising candidate for electrode materials for supercapacitors.
