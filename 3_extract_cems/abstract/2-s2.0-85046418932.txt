This paper presents an RF rectifier circuit for electromagnetic energy harvesting system. The double voltage rectifier together with the super capacitor are employed to harvest the electromagnetic energy. The proposed circuit is designed to operate at 5.8 GHz Wi-Fi frequency band. The Schottky diode SMS7630-061 is used to implement the proposed rectifier circuit. The super capacitor 5 V with capacity of 1 F is employed to collect the electromagnetic energy. It is found that the output voltage is greater than 2.8V at 5.5-5.8 GHz.
