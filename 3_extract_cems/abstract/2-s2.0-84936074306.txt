A simple standalone charging station for lithium ion digital camera battery is presented in this paper. This charging station utilizes non-renewable solar energy to charge supercapacitor, as an energy storage device, which in turn charges the Li-ion battery of the digital camera. The supercapacitor charges and discharges very fast compared to normal battery and it utilizes the stored energy to supply the load in the absence of sunlight. This charging station can be replicated in public places like bus stops, railway platforms, petrol pumps, workplaces and remote villages where the electricity supply is not adequate.
