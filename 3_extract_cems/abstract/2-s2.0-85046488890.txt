After twice heat-treating and ball-milling, the dimension of CNTs is shorter and the ends are open. By using the treated CNTs, graphene, and Ni(NO 3 ) 2 , Ni(OH) 2 /CNTs/graphene ternary composites were synthesized through galvanostatic electrodeposition under supergravity field. The ternary composite presents a 3D hierarchical structure, in which graphene as the substrate primarily plays a role of external connection and conduction, while CNTs mainly have an effect on internal conduction. Ni(OH) 2 flower spheres are distributed on the graphene nanosheets. The composite shows excellent performance of supercapacitance due to its special structure. The specific capacitance of Ni(OH) 2 /CNTs/graphene is 2868.5 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 , which is much higher than Ni(OH) 2 , Ni(OH) 2 /graphene, and Ni(OH) 2 /CNTs. In addition, it still could reach 1247.9 F g −1 at a current density of 4 A g −1 . This approach will be significant for the development of energy storage materials with high performance.
