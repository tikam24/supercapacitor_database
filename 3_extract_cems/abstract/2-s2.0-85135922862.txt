The high global demand for fossil fuels and resulting climate-change effects due to air pollution have led to the rapid development of renewable energy sources. Battery and proton exchange membrane fuel cells have high power densities and high energy, and supercapacitors can provide peak power. These devices have the advantages of high thermal efficiencies and no carbon emissions during use, which have far-reaching applications in the fields of hybrid vehicles and ships. To compensate for the slow dynamic response of fuel cells, batteries or supercapacitors are often used as auxiliary power sources to form hybrid powertrains in practice. Therefore, to take full advantage of the hybrid system, energy coordination between multiple energy sources using an energy management strategy is important. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy has been widely investigated due to its simplicity, small operation, good control, and real-time optimization. In this paper, the topologies of fuel cell hybrid power systems are first systematically classified and characterized. Then, the calculation of equivalent hydrogen consumption for a battery, fuel cell, and supercapacitor is reviewed. To reduce overall hydrogen consumption and extend the life of fuel cells and batteries, an equivalent hydrogen consumption minimization strategy is applied to the energy management of hydrogen fuel power systems.
