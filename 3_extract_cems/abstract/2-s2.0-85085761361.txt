In this work, supercapacitive characterizations of the bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanoparticles is studied. BiVO4 is synthesized by the sol-gel method. The single phase of BiVO4 powder obeys monoclinic crystal structure as confirmed from X-ray diffraction. The electrodes of BiVO4 powder were prepared by doctor blade method. Electrochemical characterizations are carried by using cyclic voltammetry gives the maximum specific capacitance 494.1 F/gm at 5 mV/s scan rate. The maximum energy density, power density and efficiency for the optimized electrode is 435 Wh/kg, 1.69 kW/kg and 88.67 %, respectively. According to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curve of the optimized sample, the internal resistance of the BiVO4 electrode was 0.12 Î©.
