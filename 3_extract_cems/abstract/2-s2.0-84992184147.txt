We fabricated asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors using binary materials composed of various ratios of H2Ti12O25 and Li4Ti5O12 as anodes and activated carbon as cathodes to investigate the tenability of their electrochemical performances. The binary materials have two advantageous properties: not only outstanding cyclability derived from Li4Ti5O12, but also excellent rate ability derived from H2Ti12O25. Because of these characteristics, hybrid supercapacitors with an 8:2 ratio of Li4Ti5O12/H2Ti12O25 as the anodes show promising electrochemical performance by complementary synergistic effects of H2Ti12O25 and Li4Ti5O12. Thus, we believe that hybrid supercapacitors containing Li4Ti5O12/H2Ti12O25 (8/2) could be used for high-grade energy storage devices that require longevity and ultrahigh electrochemical performance.
