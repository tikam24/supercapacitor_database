Graphene fiber-based supercapacitors (FSCs), with excellent power and energy density, are promising candidates for powering smart flexible electronic devices. However, the low mass loading of active materials and slow diffusion of ions limit their electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a robust and facile strategy, aimed at constructing nitrogen-doped siloxene/graphene 2D/2D composites (N-SiNs@G) by the pyrolyzation of siloxene/polypyrrole to further enhance the electrochemical performance of fiber electrodes. The carbonization of polypyrrole nanoparticles offers an in-situ nitrogen source for doping siloxene to prepare nitrogen-doped siloxene (N-SiNs), which enhances the electronic conductivity and energy storage capacity of siloxenes. The N-SiNs@G composites exhibit a multi-component synergistic effect for enhancing ion diffusion. Furthermore, the graphene nanosheets maintain the integrity and stability of the hybrid fiber and offer flexibility. The nitrogen-doped siloxene/graphene hybrid fibers (N-SiGFs) electrodes designed in this study showed remarkable electrochemical performance and exceptional mechanical flexibility for fiber-based supercapacitor applications.
