ZIF-67 derivatives show promising applications in energy storage owing to their high surface area and excellent electrochemical performance. In this work, an N-doped carbon-coated CoMoO4 nanoparticle (CMO@NC) polyhedron was prepared by hydrothermal treatment and calcination. The structural and morphological properties of the obtained samples were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. In terms of electrochemical performance, CMO@NC exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 267.3 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor device with CMO@NC as the positive electrode material and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode material was observed to achieve a specific capacitance of 114 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, with a stable operational voltage of 1.5 V and a maximum energy density of 35.4 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1041 W kg-1. The specific capacitance retention can reach up to 82.4 % after 5000 cycles, as determined by GCD measurements, indicating outstanding cycling stability and potential application prospects in supercapacitors.
