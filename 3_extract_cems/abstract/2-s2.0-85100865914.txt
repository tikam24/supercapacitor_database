Poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), as a conductive polymeric material, has been widely used in electrical materials, such as batteries and capacitors. The utility model has the advantages of high conductivity, easy processing, low cost, flexibility and good transmittance. In this paper, the common synthesis methods of PEDOT are briefly summarized, and the applications of PEDOT and PEDOT: PSS modified materials in solar cells and capacitors are reviewed.
