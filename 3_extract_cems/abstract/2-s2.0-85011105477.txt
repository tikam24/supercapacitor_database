The design, modeling, and experimental results of buck-symmetric as proposed for wireless power system are presented in this paper. The systems is based on complementary activate of two Buck converters operating to 500 kHz, by energize a resonant circuit tuned to 100 kHz. The converter arises from a proposal of wireless power transmission for efficient charging of bank-ultracapacitor. The appropriate design of buck-symmetric allow the shaping of sinusoidal signals in a resonant circuit, the simulation and experimental results allow to validate the proposed converter and its power scaling for applications in electric vehicles in the future.
