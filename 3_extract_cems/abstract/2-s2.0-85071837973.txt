The versatility of biochar materials has made constructive contributions in sustainable development but still remains further advance. Herein, focusing on the major application in electromagnetic wave absorption, a novel composite of N/P-codoped 3D carbonaceous framework with loaded Mo-based particles was controllably developed. The two co-doped heteroatoms and Mo-based particles made synergetic effect to construct heterogeneous interfaces and thereby affecting the electromagnetic wave absorbency. The optimal absorbing performance was displayed with the minimum reflection loss of âˆ’50.57 dB and the maximum absorption bandwidth of 7.44 GHz from 9.12 to 16.56 GHz when filler content was only 15%, which is much superior to that of the counterpart one, namely the mono-doped and molybdenum-free sample. Beyond the major trying in electromagnetic attenuation, event for another potential application in electrochemistry, the typical sample also demonstrated its strong vitality as supercapacitor electrode. Benefiting from multicomponent-integrated carbonaceous framework and perfectly crystallized Mo-based oxides, both carriers-transport and charge-transfer simultaneously became easier, and accordingly excellent specific capacitances and long-term cycling stability were delivered. The eye-catching performance in two different fields not only paves a new road for electromagnetic wave absorber, but would possibly make a referable contribution to the design and synthesis of versatile functional materials.
