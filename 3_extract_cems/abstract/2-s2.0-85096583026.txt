The development trend of supercapacitors (SCs) is to realize lightweight, flexibility, wear comfort, aesthetic diversity, and mechanical flexibility. In the present study, a yarn electrode is synthesized by growing conductive metal−organic framework (MOF) nanorod arrays on the reduced graphene oxide-coated polyester (rGO/PET) yarn. The outstanding properties including high specific surface area, good conductivity, hierarchically structured porosity, and stable interface structure are achieved in the obtained yarn electrode, which endows it with great potential in achieving high electrochemical performances including remarkable capacitance (151.9 F g−1 at 3 mV s−1), excellent mechanical flexibility, and long cycling life. A yarn supercapacitor assembled by this yarn electrode liberates good performances including high energy density (0.077 μWh cm−1 at 0.67 μW cm−1) and excellent mechanical flexibility.
