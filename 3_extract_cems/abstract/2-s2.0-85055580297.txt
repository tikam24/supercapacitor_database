A large number of studies have shown that nitrogen-doped carbon can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of renewable energy storage devices. Polyaniline, as a carbon precursor rich in nitrogen heteroatoms, can be pyrolyzed to introduce a high content of structural nitrogen atoms into the carbon skeleton to fundamentally change the global properties of carbon materials including physical properties (e. g. surface polarity, electric conductivity, and wettability) and chemical properties (e. g. basicity and additional pseudocapacitance). Thus, nitrogen doping is extensively applied in the field of Li-ion batteries, Li-sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors to obtain excellent performance. Doping with different kinds of nitrogen configurations (e. g. pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N) shows respective mechanisms for the electrode materials of different energy storage devices. These mechanisms and applications of pyrolytic polyaniline in Li-ion batteries, Li-sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors are illustrated in detail here.
