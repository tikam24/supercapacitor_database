The Manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles uniformly grown on graphene/Ni foam have been fabricated by a simple and effective electrodeposition method as electrode (MnO2/G/Ni foam) materials for electrochemical capacitors. The morphological and structural of the nanocomposites were studied by SEM, XRD and XPS. Electrochemical properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD). The results show the electrode of MnO2/G/Ni foam exhibit a high specific capacitance (1465.25 F g-1 at current density of 2 A g-1), excellent rate performance (998.25 F g-1 at 10 A g-1) and good cycle stability (86.09% after 5000 cycles for 10 A g-1). These results demonstrated that this low-cost and high performance device has broad application prospects for energy storage applications in electrochemical capacitors.
