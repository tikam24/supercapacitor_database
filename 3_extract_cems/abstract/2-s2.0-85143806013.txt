Biomass carbon materials with high rate capacity have great potential to boost supercapacitors with cost effective, fast charging–discharging performance and high safety requirements, yet currently suffers from a lack of targeted preparation methods. Here we propose a facile FeCl3 assisted hydrothermal carbonization strategy to prepare ultra-high rate biomass carbon from apple residues (ARs). In the preparation process, ARs were first hydrothermally carbonized into a porous precursor which embedded by Fe species, and then synchronously graphitized and activated to form biocarbon with a large special surface area (2159.3 m2 g−1) and high degree of graphitization. The material exhibited a considerable specific capacitance of 297.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding capacitance retention of 85.7% at 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH, and moreover, achieved an energy density of 16.2 Wh kg−1 with the power density of 350.3 W kg−1. After 8000 cycles, an initial capacitance of 95.2% was maintained. Our findings provide a new idea for boosting the rate capacity of carbon-based electrode materials.
