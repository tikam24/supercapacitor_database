In recent years, nickel cobalt sulfides (NCSs) have received much attention as promising functional materials in various application fields, mainly due to their much lower price, abundant raw materials and considerable reactive activity with relatively higher electrical conductivity, weaker metal-sulfur bonds and better thermal stability compared to their oxide counterparts. In this review, we will briefly summarize the recent development of NCSs on the aspects of structural design, component optimization and composite preparation. Moreover, we will comprehensively review the recent applications of NCS nanomaterials in various fields (e.g., supercapacitors, batteries, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors and microwave absorption), and some representative examples will be highlighted for different applications of NCSs. Finally, we will outline the common problems and prospects of NCS nanomaterials used in various applications.
