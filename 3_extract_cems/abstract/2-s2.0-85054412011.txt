We report the performance of supercapacitor device model based on double layer reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films as electrode in 1 M KCl. Graphene oxide (GO) films were deposited on ITO-glass use an electrochemical deposition method using 1 mg/ml GO dispersed in water. The film's thicknesses were controlled by number deposition cycles. rGO films were obtained by thermally reduced the GO films at 200Â°C for 1 hour under argon flowing. A pair of 1 cm2 rGO/ITO electrodes was employed as double layer electrodes of supercapacitor device model using a filter paper which was soaked in 1 M KCl as a separator. Performance of the supercapacitor model was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a voltage range of 0.0 volts to +0.9 volts with varied scan rate range of 25mV/s to 125mV/s. The highest specific capacitance of 20 F/kg and specific power of 0.825 W/kg was obtained using device with rGO films that deposited for three voltage cycles.
