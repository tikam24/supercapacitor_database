The world is facing serious environmental problems such as global warming, air pollution, rising energy extraction costs, and declining oil and gas production capacity, scientists are paying more and more attention to environmental protection, saving resources, and developing clean energy. In recent years, electrochromic supercapacitors have cleverly combined the two characteristics of electrochromism and energy storage, so they have received more and more attention and have broad application prospects in the fields of smart windows and smart displays. In this paper, a three-layer electrochromic supercapacitor based on the multifunctional hydrogel is proposed. It consists of the silver conductive film made of silver nanowires, Polymer (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) film and the multifunctional hydrogel based on lithium chloride and acrylamide. The single-layer hydrogel layer has both good conductivity and high ion mobility, replacing the ion conducting layer and ion storage layer in traditional devices, simplifying the device architecture, thereby greatly reducing production costs. The silver conductive film made of silver nanowires has the advantages of simple manufacturing process and high conductivity. PEDOT:PSS is a material with good electrochromic and capacitive activity. The device has a contrast ratio of 35 % at a wavelength of 650 nm at a voltage of -1.8 V, and the area capacitance can reach 0.58 mF/cm2 at a low scan rate of 0.1 V / s. We believe that this novel electrochromic supercapacitor will have huge potential applications in smart electronic products and smart windows.
