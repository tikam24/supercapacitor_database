This review gives an overview of the synthesis, surface and electrochemical investigations over ternary nanocomposite of conductive polymers in the development of new supercapacitors. They utilize both Faradaic and non-Faradaic procedures to store charge, leading to higher specific capacitance and energy density, higher cell voltage, longer life cycle and moderated power density. Owing to a unique combination of features such as superb electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance in aqueous electrolytes, highly modifiable nanostructures, long cycle life and the large theoretical specific-surface area, the use of ternary nanocomposites as a supercapacitor electrode material has become the focus of a significant amount of current scientific researches in the field of energy storage devices. In these nanocomposites, graphene not only can be utilized to provide a substrate for growing nanostructured polymers in a polymer-carbon nanocomposite structure in order to overcome the insulating nature of conductive polymers at dedoped states, but also is capable of providing a platform for the decoration of metal oxide nanoparticles to avoid their agglomeration. In this regard, synthesis, characterization and performance of different ternary nanocomposites of conductive polymer/graphene/metal oxide are discussed in detail. These remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high performance, environmentally friendly and low-cost electrical energy storage devices based on ternary nanocomposite of conductive polymer/graphene/metal oxide.
