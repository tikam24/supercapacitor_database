For on/off-grid DC microgrid, this paper proposes an improved droop control strategy combined with DC bus signaling to split transient and average load power between supercapacitor (SC), battery, and grid. SC converter with virtual impedance droop is responsible for supplying transient load power, whereas battery converter and grid rectifier, both with virtual resistor droop, are responsible for additional average load power in off-grid and on-grid modes, respectively. DC bus signaling is implemented for the smooth transition of DC microgrid from off-grid to on-grid state. The working methods for the proposed control strategy and the design of the system are explained, and theoretical analyses are verified by simulations.
