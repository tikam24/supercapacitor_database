A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising of battery and supercapacitor (SC) has been employed to resolve the issues faced by single storage systems used for electric vehicles (EVs) application. The battery ESS is able to provide better mileage, but unable to deliver a higher speed. Also, battery under high-stress level undergoes degradation and requires frequent replacement. Besides, SC is able to provide higher speed; however, it is unable to deliver the desired mileage to the vehicle. In order to solve it, a HESS is required. Various topologies exist in the literature, which defines the interface between the two ESS to provide optimal use of each. Based on the existing literature, this manuscript provides an overview of various topologies along with detailed comparative analysis based on cost, flexibility, control, efficiency, and size of DC/DC converter. Based on the manuscript and requirements, the selection of interfacing topology can be readily acquired.
