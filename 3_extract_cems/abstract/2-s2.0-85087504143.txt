Functional doping enables conjugated polymers (CPs) to be prevalent electrodes through enhancing the charge transport. However, conventional inactive dopants inevitably weight the electrode and block the access to the theoretical capacity. Herein, we demonstrate the versatile role of sodium anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS) in boosting the charge storage of CPs as both redox dopant and electrolyte additive. Reversible faradic reactions are supplemented both in the bulk polymer and on the interfaces with electrolyte, resulting in battery-like energy storage. As a result, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) exhibits greatly improved specific capacity from 0.4 mAh cm−2 (92.0 mAh g−1) to 1.3 mAh cm−2 (293.3 mAh g−1), together with dramatically enhanced rate capability and cyclic stability. After 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) cycles, AQS doped PEDOT electrode shows a capacity retention of 82.4% in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and even 173.5% with 0.03 M AQS added in electrolyte. The solid-state hybrid supercapacitor delivers a maximum volumetric energy density of 12.1 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 25.1 mW cm−3, with a capacity retention of 89.0% after 10,000 GCD cycles. Our work reveals the great potential of AQS as one-for-two solution to tackle CPs challenges in developing robust high-efficiency electrochemical energy storage.
