Nanosheets structures can be employed as the most promising electrode material to enhance electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Nickel Selenide (Ni0.85Se) nanosheets are synthesized using a rapid microwave synthesis method in a single step. The Ni0.85Se nanosheets possess a high surface area (125 m2g−1) with a hexagonal crystalline structure. It shows magnificent electrochemical properties, such as splendid specific capacitance (2530 Fg-1 at 0.5 Ag−1). An asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated with nickel selenide nanosheets as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 63.5 WhKg−1 at a power density of 404 WKg−1, and after 8000 cycles, only 5% capacitance is lost along with the better voltage window at 0–1.6 V.
