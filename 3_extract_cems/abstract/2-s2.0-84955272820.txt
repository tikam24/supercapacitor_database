We present a facile template method to fabricate NiCo2O4 (NCO) composites with 3D porous structure as electrodes for supercapacitors. SiO2 sol is used as the template to prevent the aggregation of NCO and construct the porous structure with high specific surface area. Meanwhile, the binary metal oxides not only inherit the merits of single nickel oxides or cobalt oxides, but also show superior properties to promote the capacitance. The uniform structure of NCO12 (SiO2/NCO=1:2) is obtained through controlling the mass ratio of SiO2 and NCO. Owing to the dual advantages of porous structure and binary system, NCO12 composites exhibit highly enhanced electrochemical performance compared with those of directly prepared NCO, NCO21 (SiO2/NCO=1:0.5) and NCO14 (SiO2/NCO=1:4). The specific capacitance of NCO12 composite is about 1389 F g-1 at 1Ag-1. At 4Ag-1, the capacitance is still as high as 1090 F g-1 together with capacitance retention of 80% over 2500 cycles. The capacitance and stability are higher than those of most previously reported pure NCO composites, which make it a very promising electrode material for energy storage.
