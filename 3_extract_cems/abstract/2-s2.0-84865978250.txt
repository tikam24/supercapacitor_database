This Letter presents the design, synthesis and characterisation of nanostructured manganese dioxides (MnO2) and their composites as electrode materials for high-capacity micro-supercapacitors. Three MnO 2 samples have been synthesised by liquid-phase reaction processes, and characterised by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, surface area measurement and electrochemical tests. As a result, a preferred composite containing nano-MnO2 powder as active material, acetylene black as conductive agent and polyvinylidene fluoride as binder, exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 160F/g in 0.2M K2SO4 aqueous solution. Then a micro-supercapacitor device with 3D interdigital structure using the composite material as electrodes has been achieved by MEMS fabrication technology. The micro-supercapacitor has well-performed capacitive behaviour under various scan rates and has a large specific capacitance of 30mF/cm2 in terms of footprint area or 50F/cm3 in terms of effective volume, which indicates that the composite is a promising material for energy storage on chips.
