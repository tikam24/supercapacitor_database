In this work, a late-model intrinsically flexible stretchable supercapacitor (IFSS) was proposed, using liquid metal with excellent electron transfer capability as flexible collector, combined with stretchable silicone and well-designed kirigami MXene electrode based on laser cutting process. Systematic mechanical and electrochemical characterization suggested that the steady electrochemical output can still be maintained when the assembled device undergoes different degrees of stretching range from 0 to 100% even under bending or twisting. These results demonstrate that an effective integration of printed liquid metal and silicone with excellent flexibility and stretchability provides a potential avenue for the development of intrinsically stretchable devices.
