In this work supercapacitive performance of electrochemically synthesized Poly pyrrole/Manganese dioxide nano wire (Ppy/NwMnO2) was studied by classical and modern electrochemical techniques. NwMnO2 synthesized hydrothermally and distributed in pyrrole solution for electrochemical synthesis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) graphs show the uniform distribution of nanowires on the structure of polymer matrix. The specific capacitance of Ppy and Ppy/NwMnO2 were calculated 109 and 203 F/g respectively. Galvano static charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are another electrochemical techniques that used for study the supercapacitive behavior of composite electrode. Enhancement the capacitance, conductivity and stability of composite electrode through continues CVs are the features of using nano materials in the structure of polymer film. Fast fourier transform continuous cyclic voltammetry (FFTCCV) studies presented in this work for highlight the performances of composite electrode. Study the nature of composite electrode continuously is one of the advantages that achieved by FFTCCV technique.
