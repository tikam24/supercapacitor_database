In this work, the Co-Ni basic carbonate nanowires were in-situ grown on carbon nanotube (CNT) network through a facile chemical bath deposition method, which could be further converted into active hydroxide via cyclic voltammetry strategy. A series of carbonate nanowire/nanotube with different Co/Ni ratio revealed the different growth status of the nanowires on CNT network. The nanostructures of the as-synthesized samples were examined via powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The Co/Ni ratio of the carbonate largely affected the size of the nanowires, that the low Co/Ni ratio was beneficial for thin nanowire formation and the nanowires loading on CNT network. Subsequently, the electrochemical performance of the Co-Ni basic hydroxides was studied in a three-electrode test system. The nanowires with low Co/Ni ratio 1/2 can form nanowire array on individual CNTs, which exhibited better electrochemical capacitive performance than the composite network with high Co/Ni ratio nanowires after electrochemical activation. The addition of Co enhanced the rate performance of the hydroxide/CNT, especially improved the long cycle stability largely compared to the rate performance of pure Ni converted hydroxide/CNT composite film reported by our previous research. This result is valuable for the design of inorganic electrochemical active composites based on conductive networks for energy conversion/storage applications.
