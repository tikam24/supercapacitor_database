The rapid development of intelligent, wearable, compact electronic equipment has triggered the need for durable, flexible, and lightweight portable energy storage devices. Nanomaterials that are capable of delivering the high specific power density and commensurate energy density are potential candidate for realizing such devices. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a binary nanocomposite WS2@PANI by utilizing hydrothermal and physical blending techniques to assess it as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. The nanocomposite electrode delivered specific capacitance >335 F g−1 @ 10 mV s−1 (two-electrode), achieving energy and power densities of ∼80 W h kg−1 and ∼800 W kg−1, respectively, with capacitance retention of 83% even after 5000 charge-discharge cycles @ 10 A g−1, all of which are superior to the WS2 electrode. Dunns model quantifies capacitive and intercalative contributions that showed the cumulative effect of both to realize a robust, cost-effective, and energy-efficient device. The strategically incorporated PANI broadened the electrochemical window and the device's overall performance, resulting in high specific energy density. We demonstrated that our all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor could be used to illuminate a light-emitting diode and drive a rotary motor. We believe that our WS2@PANI binary nanocomposite will be a potential candidate for energy storage devices.
