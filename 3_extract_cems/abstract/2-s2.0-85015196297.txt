In recent years, applications of ultracapacitor in electrical systems have witnessed a rise due to their high power density. Ultracapacitors are known to possess inherent nonlinear dynamics with long term memory, which can be better, described using fractional calculus. This article addresses possible application of ultracapacitors for the design of very low frequency (VLF) oscillators. The presence of fractional dynamics in ultracapacitors has been studied over wide frequency ranges, and utilized to estimate the VLF oscillation frequency. The proposed approach allows design of oscillators for a set of low frequency specifications.
