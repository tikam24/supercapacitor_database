Failures of uninterruptible power supply critically affect the reliability of data centres, and battery banks contribute to these issues significantly. Given the availability of standby generators, with typical transition times of 15 to 30 seconds, supercapacitor banks with long cycle and calendar life could be usefully utilized to overcome this issue.This paper presents the details of a new circuit topology based on supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) technique, which is adapted to suit the newly proposed 48 V Google architecture for data centres. Built-in DC-UPS capability is available within the power converter itself. This new supercapacitor based technique comes with transformer isolated front end where a rapid SC charger is combined with a modified fly-back AC-to-DC converter topology.
