Specific capacitance and energy density are found increasing greatly after the incorporation of certain amount of copper (Cu) into nickel oxide (NiO) electrode. In this work, a series of binary nickel copper oxides is synthesized directly on flexible lightweight carbon fiber paper substrates as binder-free electrodes. The correlation between the Ni/Cu ratio and supercapacitor performance is revealled. The highest specific capacitance achieved is 1711 F g−1 at a higher discharge current density of 5 A g−1, which is significantly higher than the NiO sample without Cu incorporation. The success in high loading of active material growth on lightweight carbon substrate leads to a very high specific capacitance of 637 F g−1 per total weight of the active material and the substrate at 1 A g−1. The asymmetric supercapacitor full cell, composed of nickel copper oxide as positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide as negative electrode, reaches up to a very high energy density of 70 Wh kg−1. The energy density per total mass of all the active materials and substrates is fantastically high, 40 Wh kg−1, which is of great practical importance in applications. The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the desirable composition and the synergistic effect between nickel and copper.
