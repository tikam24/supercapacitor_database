Mesoporous carbon (SMC) used as electrode material for supercapacitor was prepared by template method using silica sol as template and glucose as carbon source. The pore structure of SMC was characterized by Na adsorption/desorption isotherms. The capacitive characteristics and rate capability of the mesoprous carbon was investigated in non-aqueous Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte. The frequency behavior was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. And the properties of the mesoporous carbon were compared with that of commercially available microporous activated carbon. The results show that the predominant pore size of SMC centers at 6.3 and 19.0 nm and SMC delivers better frequency behavior and rate capability due to larger pore size compared with that of commercially available microporous activated carbon.
