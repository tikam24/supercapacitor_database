The use of transition metal oxides (TMOs) as electrode materials remains challenging because TMOs undergo volume expansion during energy storage. In this work, a core-shell heterostructured nanowire array-assembled hexagonal petal-like CoO encapsulated by MOF-derived Co/N co-doped carbon composite (NF@CoO@Co/N-C) was synthesized on a conductive substrate (Ni foam, NF) using a zeolitic imidazolate skeleton (ZIF-67) as the template via "anchor-etch-calcine"processes. The synergetic function of the heteroatom co-doping, the in-site encapsulation of the carbon matrix, and the unique structural characteristics largely enhance the electrochemical performance. As expected, the NF@CoO@Co/N-C electrode material exhibits an ultrahigh areal capacitance, which is at least two-fold that of its corresponding transition metal oxide. Finally, an asymmetrical-solid-state supercapacitor (ASC) fabricated by NF@CoO@Co/N-C and activated carbon with high volumetric capacity (11.06 F cm-3), high energy density (5.05 mW h cm-3) and a long-term cyclability is demonstrated (94.5% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 10 mA cm-2). This study provides rational guidance toward the design of TMOs electrode materials with extended-life energy storage performance. This journal is
