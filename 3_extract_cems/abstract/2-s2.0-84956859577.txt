A novel hydrothermal process is demonstrated to prepare acetate anions intercalated α-Co(OH)2 that can be delaminated in water without any additional anion exchange processes. Positively charged Co(OH)2 nanosheets with lateral size of hundreds of nanometers and thickness less than 2 nm can be obtained by dispersing the as-obtained α-Co(OH)2 into water followed by sonication. The exfoliated Co(OH)2 nanosheets can be restacked into its original structure with different interlayer d-spacings. A flexible free-standing film with stacking Co(OH)2 nanosheets and graphene oxide (GO) layers can be obtained through flocculation of the Co(OH)2 nanosheets with GO nanosheets suspensions followed by a vacuum filtration, but the content of Co(OH)2 has to be kept under a low value so as to obtain films with flexible nature. Electrochemical tests show that this kind of film is not suitable to be used as electrode material for supercapacitor and lithium ion battery, because the content of active material is not high and the compacted junction between opposite charged nanosheets will prevent the electrolyte from diffusing into the interlayer space.
