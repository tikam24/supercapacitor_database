In this report, we prepared nitrogen-doped microporous carbon (N-MPC) via carbonization of a precursor triazine-based porous organic polymer (POP). The as-prepared POP and N-MPC were characterized by various analytical techniques. The N-MPC presents many advantages for supercapacitor applications, including higher surface area (801 m2 g−1), microporous structure, and uniform pore size. The supercapacitor performance of N-MPC was evaluated in a 6 M KOH electrolyte and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 505 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The electrode showed excellent cycling stability with 89% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 3.0 A g−1.
