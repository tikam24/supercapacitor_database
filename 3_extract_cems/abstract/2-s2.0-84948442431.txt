Free-standing electrodes with high gravimetric/volumetric capacitance will open up potential applications in miniaturized consumer electronics. Herein, we report a simple synthesis technology of free-standing orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5)/graphene composite papers for Li-intercalating pseudocapacitive electrodes. Through a facile polyol-mediated solvothermal reaction, the Nb2O5 nanodots are homogeneously decorated onto the surface of reduced graphite oxide (rGO), which can form a homogeneous Nb2O5/rGO colloidal suspension that can be easily fabricated into flexible composite papers. The heat-treated T-Nb2O5/graphene composite papers exhibit a nanoporous layer-stacked structure with good ionic-electric conductive pathways, high T-Nb2O5 loading of 74.2%, and high bulk density of 1.55 g cm-3. Such T-Nb2O5/graphene composite papers show a superior pseudocapacitor performance as free-standing electrodes, as evidenced by an ultrahigh gravimetric/volumetric capacitance (620.5 F g-1 and 961.8 F cm-3 at 1 mV s-1) and excellent rate capability. Furthermore, an organic electrolyte-based asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled based on T-Nb2O5/graphene composite papers, which can deliver a high energy density of 47 W h kg-1 and power density of 18 kW kg-1.
