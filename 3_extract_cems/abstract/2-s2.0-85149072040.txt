Supercapacitors (SCs) have been recognized as a promising electrochemical energy storage (EES) device, thanks to their high-power density, long lifespan, fast charge-discharge capability, and eco-friendliness. The breakthrough of electrode materials that determine the electrochemical performance of SCs is urgently desired. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging and burgeoning class of crystalline porous polymeric materials, have been found to have huge potential for application in EES devices by virtue of their unique properties including atomically adjustable structures, robust and tunable skeletons, well-defined and open channels, high surface areas, etc. In this feature article, we aim at summarizing the design strategies of COF-based electrode materials for SCs based on the representative advances. The current challenges and future perspectives of COFs for SC application are highlighted as well.
