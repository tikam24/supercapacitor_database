The molybdenum disulfide/reduced graphene oxide@polyaniline (MoS2/RGO@PANI) was facilely and effectively prepared through a two-stage synthetic method including hydrothermal and polymerized reactions. The rational combination of two components allowed polyaniline (PANI) to uniformly cover the outer face of molybdenum disulfide/reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/RGO). The interaction between the two initial electrode materials produced a synergistic effect and resulted in outstanding energy storage performance in terms of greatest capacitive property (1224 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), good rate (721 F g-1 at 20 A g-1), and cyclic performance (82.5% remaining content after 3000 loops). The symmetric cell with MoS2/RGO@PANI had a good capacitive property (160 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and energy and power density (22.3 W h kg -1 and 5.08 kW kg-1).
