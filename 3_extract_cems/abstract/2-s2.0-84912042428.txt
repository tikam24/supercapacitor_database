Currently, tremendous attention has been paid to the rational design and synthesis of unique core/shell heterostructures for high-performance supercapacitors. In this work, the unique ZnO@Co3O4 core/shell heterostructures on nickel foam are successfully synthesized through a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method combined with a short post annealing treatment. Mesoporous Co3O4 nanowires are multidirectional growing on the rhombus-like ZnO nanorods. In addition, the growth mechanism for such unique core/shell heterostructures is also proposed. Supercapacitor electrodes based on the ZnO@Co3O4 and Co3O4 heterostructures on nickel foam are thoroughly characterized. The ZnO@Co3O4 electrode exhibits high capacitance of 1.72 F cm-2 (857.7 F g-1) at a current density of 1 A g-1, which is higher than that of the Co3O4 electrode. Impressively, the capacitance of the ZnO@Co3O4 electrode increases gradually from 1.29 to 1.66 F cm-2 (830.8 F g-1) after 6000 cycles at a high current density of 6 A g-1, indicating good long-term cycling stability. These results indicate the unique ZnO@Co3O4 electrode would be a promising electrode for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
