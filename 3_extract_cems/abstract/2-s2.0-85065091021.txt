Cobalt oxide/titanium dioxide/activated carbon (Co3O4/TiO2/Ac) composite was synthesized using simple sol-gel method before annealing at 300 °C. Fish bladder derived porous carbon used for the composite was synthesized by pyrolysis followed by chemical activation. Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction displayed Co3O4 and TiO2 phases well embedded onto the carbon matrices. Cyclic voltammetry in 6 M KOH electrolyte demonstrated that the composite has an excellent specific capacity of 946 Fg-1 for Co3O4/TiO2/Ac as compared to Co3O4/Ac, TiO2/Ac, and Ac with specific capacitances of 845, 340, and 308 F g−1, respectively at 5 mVs−1. Impedance spectroscopy reveals that the composite has good capacitive behavior with a series resistance of 0.6 Ω. Besides, Co3O4/TiO2/Ac maintains 89.7% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. This study shows that the synergistic effect of the metal oxides and the carbon in the composite can enhance capacitance for practical supercapacitor applications.
