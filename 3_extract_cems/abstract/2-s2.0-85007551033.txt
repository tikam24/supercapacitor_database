A binder-free graphene-nanosheets wrapped Co3S4hybrid electrode is prepared on conductive Ni-foam via a simple two-step hydrothermal process. The physicochemical characterization such as X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electron microscopy revealed the formation of a Co3S4-rGO hybrid electrode with a large specific surface area (30 m2 g−1). The integrated structure of the Co3S4-rGO hybrid electrode exhibits an areal and specific capacitance of 8.33 F cm−2and 2314 F g−1, respectively. The Co3S4-rGO hybrid electrode charges within 30 s, while the energy density remains high as 54.32 Wh kg−1at an outstanding power density of 6.25 kW kg−1with 92.6% excellent electrochemical cyclic stability over 1000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated using Co3S4and Co3S4-rGO as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, which exhibit an areal capacitance of ∼164 mF cm−2with reasonable cyclic stability (89.56% over 5000 cycles). The Co3S4/Co3S4-rGO supercapacitor reveals a high energy density of 1.09 Wh kg−1at a power density of 398 W kg−1, and 0.31 Wh kg−1energy density can be retained even at a power density of 750 W kg−1. The superior electrochemical activities of the Co3S4based electrode suggest considerable promise for high-performance energy storage applications.
