A chemical vapor-phase polymerization (VPP) method was employed to prepare conducting composite poly-3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) film. The samples to be covered with PEDOT are initially coated with a thin layer of oxidant/GO, and this modifying films was transferred to a VPP chamber containing 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomer gas for chemical polymerization. The latter formed PEDOT/GO film was then treated by glucose and highly conductive PEDOT/RGO films was obtained. The conducive results showed that PEDOT/RGO films exhibited conductivity ca. 35.3 S/cm, which higher than pure PEDOT (17.3 S/cm) and PEDOT/GO (14.6 S/cm) films. The PEDOT/RGO films showed specific capacitance ca. 176.7 F/g and kept 84% initial capacitance after 800 cycles, indicating excellent specific capacitance and cycling stability performance. This VPP PEDOT nanocomposites show promising application in supercapacitor and conducting materials.
