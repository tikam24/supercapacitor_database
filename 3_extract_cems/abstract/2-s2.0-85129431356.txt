Realizing high energy-density and actual applications of fibre-based electrochemical supercapacitors (FESCs) are pivotal but challenging, as the ability to construct advanced fibres for accelerating charges kinetic diffusion and Faradaic storage remain key bottlenecks. Here, we demonstrate high-performance FESCs based on hetero-structured polymetallic oxides/porous graphene core–sheath fibres, where the large pseudo-active polymetallic oxide (PMO) sheath is uniformly loaded on a hierarchical porous graphene fibre (PGF) core. Due to the abundant micro-/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, excellent redox activity and good interface electron conduction, the PMO-PGF possesses high areal capacitance (2959.78 mF cm−2) and manageable Faradaic reversibility in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the PMO-PGF-based solid-state FESCs present high energy-density (187.22 μ Wh cm−2), long-life cycles (95.8 % capacitive retention after 20 000 cycles), diverse-powered capabilities and actual energy-supply applications.
