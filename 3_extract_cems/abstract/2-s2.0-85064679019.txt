A self-assembly method using ionic liquids as soft-template and nitrogen precursor, resin as carbon precursor, silica as assistant agent, mesoporous resin spheres as additive, is employed to prepare N-doped core–shell mesoporous sphere and carbon sheet composite (N-CMCS/CS). The obtained N-CMCS/CS possesses thin sheet, core–shell spheres, dual-mesoporous structure, large specific area and a certain of N-doping, which endows it with superior electrochemical performance as electrode material in supercapacitor.
