In order to improve the efficiency of electric vehicles, energy regeneration systems using super-capacitors have been researched. In this paper, an energy regeneration system using two super-capacitors is proposed. This system can reduce the regenerative current to the battery by storing the regenerative power in the super-capacitor. In addition, it reduces the energy loss of the inverter and the motor by changing the input voltage of the inverter according to the rotation speed of the motor. In this paper, the voltage control method and capacitor utilization of the proposed circuit are described. The effectiveness of the bi-directional DC-DC converter in the proposed circuit is verified by the experiment.
