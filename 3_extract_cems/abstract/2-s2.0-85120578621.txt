Nanostructured Ni3S2 is considered to be one of the most promising energy storage materials due to its high theoretical specific capacitance and excellent conductivity. In this work, we prepare dendritic Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays by one-step solvothermal method. The as-prepared samples as binder-free electrode present a specific capacity of 863.55 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor owns an energy density of 33.7 W h kg−1 at 1396.7 W kg−1. Such excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to its unique structure and the direct contact between Ni3S2 and Ni foam, which can ensure rapid ion and electron transfers during redox reactions.
