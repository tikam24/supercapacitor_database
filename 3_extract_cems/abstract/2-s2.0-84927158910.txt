Use of GaAs and GaP porous plates is proposed as a replacement of activated carbon electrodes for supercapacitors. Porous electrodes are prepared by electrochemical etching. Description of the production technique of supercapacitors based on porous semiconductors A3B5 is presented. Area of the porous surface is defined by gas adsorption method. The method for calculation of supercapacitor capacitance created on GaAs and GaP porous plates is described.
