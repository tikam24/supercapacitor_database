Electric vehicles are the recent trend in automobile Industry.replacing the conventional fuel technology for its zero pollution. The main issue faced in an EV is battery charging, where we use static charging technique, which becomes difficult when low battery condition arises while driving. This paper deals with sustaining the battery charge during driving, with the help of Sandwiched piezoelectric transducer below the accelerator, thereby dynamic charging takes place. Accelerator, being the most used part in an electric vehicle, can be used for voltage generation by considering the continuous application of mechanical pressure on it. Whenever the accelerator is pressed, a pressure is exerted at the outer surface of the sandwiched piezoelectric transducer, thus converting the applied mechanical force to electrical voltage, which is used to charge the ultra-capacitor and discharged at a constant rate to the auxiliary or main battery. The sandwiched piezoelectric generator is used in order to have high load capacity and the power output. It has flexible end caps with an amplifier to enhance the output power and a sandwiched piezoelectric substrate to reduce the stress concentration. The normal capacitor has been replaced by ultra-capacitor for better efficiency and large charge holding capacity. This paper deals with the proposed system's structure and the power transfer via sandwiched Piezoelectric Transducer to the ultra-capacitor.
