Fe3O4@carbon nanosheet composites were synthesized using ammonium ferric citrate as the Fe3O4/carbon precursor and graphene oxide as the structure-directing agent under a hydrothermal process. The surface chemical compositions, pore structures, and morphology of the composite were analyzed and characterized by nitrogen adsorption isotherms, TG analysis, FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron energy spectrum, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The composites showed excellent specific capacitance of 586 F/g, 340 F/g at 0.5 A/g and 10 A/g. The all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled using carbon nanosheets in situ embedded Fe3O4 composite and porous carbon showed a largest energy density of 18.3 Wh/kg at power density of 351 W/kg in KOH/PVA gel electrolyte. The synergism of high special surface to volume ratio, mesoporous structure, graphene-based conduction paths, and Fe3O4 nanoparticles provided a high surface area of ion-accessibility, high electric conductivity, and the utmost utilization of Fe3O4 and resulted in excellent specific capacitance, outstanding rate capability and cycling life as all-solid-state supercapacitor electrodes.
