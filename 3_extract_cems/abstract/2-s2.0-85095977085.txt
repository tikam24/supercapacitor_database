In order to reduce the operation and maintenance cost of the tram on the fixed line, this article proposes a global optimal operation and control method based on the fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid tram in each section between stations. This method consists of two parts: the speed optimization method based on the minimal energy consumption, and the hybrid system control method based on the minimal hydrogen consumption. For the speed optimization method, according to the energy consumption function of the tram in different operating stages, the distribution of the energy consumption of each section is obtained, and then the speed curve under the optimal energy consumption distribution can be further obtained; for the hybrid system control method, based on the energy distribution of the tram in each section, as well as the hydrogen consumption function of the fuel cell system (FCS), the optimal output power curve of the hybrid system is obtained based on the Lagrangian algorithm. Finally, according to the testing on the actual line, the results show that the proposed method can realize the online control of the tram, and has a significant effect on the hydrogen consumption and the output volatility of the FCS.
