Developing appropriate stable electroactive electrode materials for supercapacitor application is the challenging issue, which attracts enormous attention in recent decades. In this regard, Fe3O4 nanoparticles are firstly synthesized on chitosan/graphene oxide-multiwall carbon nanotubes (CS/GM/Fe3O4). Then, polyaniline (PANI) is grafted on it via in situ chemical polymerization and named as CS/GM/Fe3O4/PANI. The as-prepared nanocomposites are characterized by Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The capacitive properties of the electrodes are investigated in a three electrode configuration in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte by various electrochemical techniques. The specific capacitance of CS/GM/Fe3O4/PANI electrode is 1513.4 Fg−1 at 4 Ag−1 which is 1.9 times higher than that of CS/GM/Fe3O4 (800 Fg−1). Meanwhile, the electrodes exhibit appropriate cycle life along with 99.8% and 93.95% specific capacitance at 100 Ag−1 for chitosan/GO-CNT/Fe3O4 and polyaniline grafted chitosan/GO-CNT/Fe3O4, respectively.
