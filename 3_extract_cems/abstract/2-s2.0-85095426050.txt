Energy storage devices like a rechargeable battery and supercapacitor need continuous improvement in their performance as there is a long-lasting demand for rechargeable devices which have very high specific energy and charges quickly. In the last three decades, different attempts have been made to improve the performance of energy storage devices. This review article focuses on advancement made in the area of energy storage devices using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coupled with different metal oxide nanoparticles like Graphene/Ni-Fe hexacyanoferrate, rGO-SnS2, MoS2-graphene quantum dots, Co3O4 nanophores, Zn2Ti3O8/rGO, Nb4N5/rGO, V2O5/rGO, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), their mechanism of action and enhanced energy storage capacity. The surface enriched 3D rGO hybrids nano-networks were also explored as the high-performance electrodes material for energy storage devices used in the rechargeable batteries, asymmetric super capacitors and hybrid and pseudo supercapacitors.
