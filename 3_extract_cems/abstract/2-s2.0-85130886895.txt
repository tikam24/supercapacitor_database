In order to promote the application of nanocellulose materials for energy storage, the preparation of electrode materials and separator materials for batteries and supercapacitors was reviewed with concentrations on carbonization and electrospinning technology and the combination of the two methods. It was found that electrospun nanocellulose has the advantages of excellent electrochemical properties and good flexibility, which can be used as composite reinforcement and conductive materials. Carbonization treatment of nanofibers has unique microporous structure and large specific surface area, whose main forms are aerogels, fibrous membranes and thin films. After analyzing the existing problems using nanocellulose materials prepared by electrospinning and carbonization technology, the paper pointed out that the construction of environmentally friendly natural substrate energy storage devices with various forms and structures is one of the future development directions. It is summarized that the preparation of nano cellulose materials by electrospinning and carbonization has a good application prospect in flexible energy storage devices and compact mobile end energy storage equipment.
