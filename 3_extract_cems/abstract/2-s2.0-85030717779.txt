Two-dimensional titanium carbide has gained considerable attention in recent years as an electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high melting point, good electrical conductivity, hydrophilicity and large electrochemically active surfaces. However, the irreversible restacking during synthesis restricts its development and practical applications. Here, Ti3C2Tx/SCNT self-assembled composite electrodes were rationally designed and successfully synthesized by introducing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SCNTs) as interlayer spacers to decrease the restacking of the Ti3C2Tx sheets during the synthesis process. SCNTs can not only increase the specific surface area as well as the interlayer space of the Ti3C2Tx electrode, but also increase the accessible capability of electrolyte ions, and thus it improved the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The as-prepared Ti3C2Tx/SCNT self-assembled composite electrode achieved a high areal capacitance of 220 mF/cm2 (314 F/cm3) and a remarkable capacitance retention of 95% after 10,000 cycles.
