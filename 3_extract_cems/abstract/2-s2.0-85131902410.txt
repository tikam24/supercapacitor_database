With widespread application of flexible electronic devices, the multifunction for supercapacitors has attracted tremendous attention. Here, developed is a novel multifunctional MXene-based pizeoelectrochemical-type pressure sensor based on highly compressible antiwater supercapacitor. This novel design realizes energy storage and pressure sensing functions simultaneously. The outstanding rate performance is realized by the reasonable design of electron and ion transport channels, originating from strong synergistic bridging interactions between silver nanowires (AgNWs) and MXene. Serving as the electrochemical storage device, even at large 500 mV s-1, the cyclic voltammetry curve of AgNWs/MXene aerogel still maintains nearly rectangular characteristics. For the assembled antiwater symmetric supercapacitor, it records a high specific capacitance of 210.5 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, a maximum energy density of 74.7 W h Kg-1 at 400 W Kg-1, and outstanding waterproof cyclic stability of 86.51% in water. Based on elastic AgNWs/MXene aerogel, an antiwater pizeoelectrochemical-type strain sensor is designed, and the device presents stable and sensitive current response while facing external pressure. This study clearly demonstrates that our work promises a new research direction toward the design of next-generation wearable devices that could be used in wirelessly powered wearable devices.
