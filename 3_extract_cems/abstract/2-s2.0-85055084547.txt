In this work, microstructure-controlled synthesis of NiCo2S4 grown on nickel foam by a facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal/solvothermal approach is reported. Based on the basic principle of Faraday supercapacitors, the hierarchical nanostructure of NiCo2S4 is tuned by the supersaturation determined by the polarity of the solvent and the solubility of the product in the solvent. The results of electrochemical measurements indicate that the as-prepared aggregated NiCo2S4 with ordered nanosheets grown on nanospheres have high electrochemical performance and cycling stability. The material presents a high specific capacitance of 2070.5 F g-1 at a current density of 2.2 A g-1. It also exhibits super-high cycling stability (81.2% capacitance retention after 100000 electrochemical charge-discharge cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitors with nanostructured NiCo2S4 and active carbon used respectively as positive and negative electrode materials also present high energy density (53.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 601.5 W kg -1). These results indicate that the hierarchical nanostructure-tuned NiCo2S4 could be a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
