A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle requires fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, controllers and smart control units with their control strategies. The controller ensures that a control strategy predicated on the data taken from the traction motor and energy storage systems is created. The smart control unit compares the fuel cell nominal output power with the vehicle power demand, calculates the parameters and continually adjusts the variables. The control strategies that can be developed for these units will enable us to overcome the technological challenges for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the near future. This study presents the best hydrogen fuel cell vehicle configurations and control strategies for safe, low cost and high efficiency by comparing control strategies in the literature for fuel economy.
