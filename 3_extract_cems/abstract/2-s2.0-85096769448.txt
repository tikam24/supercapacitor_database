Biomass-derived carbon materials are an amazing electrode material for supercapacitor, owing to their abundant, porous structure and composition. Herein, a controllable N content carbon material with hierarchical porous structure was fabricated via an integrated carbonization, activation and nitrogen-doping process. N-rich camellia pollen is used as carbon precursor, while NH4Cl is employed as both activation agent and dopant. The optimal N-doped carbon with higher N content (3.82 at%), suitable pore size distribution and larger specific surface area (810 m2 g−1), provides abundant ion transport channels and exposes more accessible active sites. Thus, a high specific capacitance of 280 F g−1 (1 A g−1) in 6 M KOH (three-electrode system) can be obtained with making full use of N−HPC-1. Moreover, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor delivers high energy densities both in 6 M KOH (13.3 Wh kg−1) and 1 M Na2SO4 (20 Wh kg−1) that can be used for LED lighting. More than that, it is also demonstrates excellent cycle stability in 6 M KOH (85.4% after 20000 cycles at 20 A g−1). In view of the above-mentioned merits, this N-doped hierarchical porous carbon is anticipated to be a promising material for application in supercapacitors and other fields.
