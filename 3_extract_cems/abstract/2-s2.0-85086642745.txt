The electrochemical performance of tin oxide-ruthenium oxide-based (S-SnO2NPs-RuO2@BCC) nanocomposite electrode fabricated using electrodeposition of ruthenium oxide (RuO2) followed by spin coating of synthesized tin oxide nanoparticles (S-SnO2NPs) on bare carbon cloth (BCC) current collector was studied. The prepared electrodes were characterized by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results confirmed the presence of wire-shaped RuO2 and nanosphere S-SnO2 morphology on the BCC surface. The electrochemical measurement showed that the S-SnO2NPs-RuO2@BCC electrode exhibited comparatively higher areal capacitance (794 mF cm−2) than that of the RuO2@BCC electrode (464 mF cm−2) at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 in 1 M H2SO4. Trasatti's analysis also showed that the loading of S-SnO2NPs on the RuO2@BCC electrode enhanced the capacitive capacitance nearly three times to that of the RuO2@BCC electrode. Furthermore, symmetrical supercapacitor (SS) was fabricated using S-SnO2NPs-RuO2@BCC electrodes with the total mass loading ~ 20 ± 0.2 mg cm−2 of S-SnO2NPs. SS displayed maximum areal capacitance of 184 mF cm−2 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 and a capacitance retention rate of 87.5 % after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in PVA-H2SO4.
