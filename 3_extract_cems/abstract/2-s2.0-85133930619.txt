This paper discusses a generic design of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and supercapacitors, which are important sources for energy storage systems (ESS). The main contribution of this study is to compare the available and experimental models for batteries and supercapacitors operating under continuous charge or discharge conditions. Even though the available models show similar behavior to the experimental ones in short-term or pulsed discharge conditions, this situation may be different in continuous discharge conditions. For this purpose, the optimal electrical equivalent circuits of energy storage devices were constituted and modeled in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. Then, the electrical equivalent circuit parameters were approximately calculated with the help of dynamic equations. Finally, the model parameters were estimated using Nonlinear Least Squares Method (NLSM) and Trust Region Reflective Algorithm (TRRA). When the obtained results were evaluated together, it has been observed that the electrical equivalent circuit models (EECM) more accurately reveal the transient and steady states of energy storage devices compared to the available models, especially under continuous discharge conditions.
