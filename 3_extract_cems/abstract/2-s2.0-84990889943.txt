In this study, microporous carbon nanoplate (MCN)/ruthenium oxide (RuO2) hybrid electrodes were fabricated by a facile sol-gel method. The annealing temperature of RuO2 was varied to optimize the electrochemical performance. The hybrid electrodes were designed to be covered with hybrid networks of RuO2 nanoparticles and anchored MCNs. The nanostructured MCN/RuO2 hybrids showed a high specific surface area of 1044.6 m2/g and a Ru particle size of about 3 nm. The prepared MCNs showed a number of microporous structures for electric-double-layer-capacitor-induced capacitance. In addition, the incorporation of RuO2 on the MCNs considerably improved the specific capacitance by inducing pseudocapacitive behavior. The electrochemical performance of the MCN/RuO2 hybrid electrodes was calculated using cyclic voltammograms, which revealed a specific capacitance of 458 F/g and good cyclic stability over 1,000 cycles.
