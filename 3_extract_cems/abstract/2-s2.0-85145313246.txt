Two dimensional (2D) materials with excellent electrochemical property have been extensively studied to fabricate the high-performance supercapacitor electrodes for future energy storage applications. In this present work, 2D MoO3 nanoplates were fabricated and their electrochemical performances were enhanced by the introduction of Fe2O3 NPs in its lattice. As a result, the MoO3-Fe2O3 NC demonstrates the high specific capacitance of. 908 F/g at 10 mV/s based on the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) show the solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.48 Ω and 0.01 Ω respectively. The MoO3-Fe2O3 NC possesses long charge–discharge and high rate capabilities were revealed by Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis. The cyclic stability of MoO3-Fe2O3 NC provides outstanding capacitive retention of 88.8% even after 3000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device based on MoO3-Fe2O3//AC delivered a high energy density of 43.3 Wh/kg and power density of 600 W/kg. Furthermore, the ASC maintains a cyclic stability of 81.17 % after 2000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles.
