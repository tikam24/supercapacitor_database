Flexible electrodes have important potential applications in energy storage of multi-functional portable electronic devices because of their powerful structural properties. Here, fibrous and flexible electrodes comprising hierarchical nanostructure graphene for use in advanced supercapacitors have been fabricated with an electrochemical deposition method in one step. Excellent electrochemical performance of the fibrous and flexible nanostructure material was achieved, with the areal capacitance of 48.83 mF cm−2, according to the galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis at a current density of 0.199 mA cm−2. The electrodes also showed a good cycle performance, with 91.2% of the original capacity retained after 4000 cycles. Such electrodes may provide new design opportunities for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.
