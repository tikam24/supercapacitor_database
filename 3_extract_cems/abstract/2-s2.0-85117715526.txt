Ternary compound for engineering nanoarchitecture of MnCo2S4 has been hierarchically well maintained and attractive surface area was regarded as a potentially efficient technique to grow novel electroactive materials. In this regard, crafting Nano flower-built MnCo2S4 nanoarchitecture with Ni foam network favors short path roots and interconnected for excellent charging transfer and ion transmission, which allows the energetic Faradaic redox procedures by the improves active surface. According to the structural and compositional features, the as-developed MnCo2S4 nanoflower nanoarchitecture exhibits superior electrochemical capacity activities. Impressively, the MnCo2S4 nanoflowers achieve an excellent specific capacitance of 779 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, which causes unique features of structural construction. When tested long-term cycling stability performance, the as-constructed MnCo2S4 nanoflowers achieves excellent capacitance retention 96.5% over 3000 cycling stability performance at a current density of 2 A g−1 with superior conductivity. Considered the above points, the simplistic approach yet unique construction of this MnCo2S4 holds substantial potential energy conversion and high-performance energy storage.
