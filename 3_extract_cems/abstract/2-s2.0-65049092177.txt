A poly(o-anisidine-co-metanilic acid)/activated carbon composite is evaluated as an active material for electrochemical supercapacitors. Poly(o-anisidine-co-metanilic acid) (PASM) is potentiodynamically deposited on an activated carbon (AC)-coated stainless-steel substrate, in a supporting electrolyte of 1.0 M H2SO4 containing dissolved o-anisidine and metanilic acid, at a sweep rate of 50 mV s-1. Scanning electron micrographs show a uniformly deposited, thick PASM film on the activated carbon. Electrochemical techniques, such as impedance analysis, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic experiments, are carried out to investigate the suitability of the PASM/AC electrode for supercapacitor applications. A maximum specific capacitance of 576 F g-1 is obtained for PASM/AC at a 5 mA cm-2 current density. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
