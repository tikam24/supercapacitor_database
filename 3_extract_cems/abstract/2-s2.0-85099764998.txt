Abstract: The unique crystal structure and multiple redox couples of iron titanate (Fe2TiO5) provide it a high theoretical capacity and good cycling stability when used as an electrode. In this study, the electrospinning method is employed to synthesize one-dimensional (1D) Fe2TiO5 nanochains. The as-prepared Fe2TiO5 nanochains exhibited superior specific capacity (500 mAh·g−1 at 0.10 A·g−1), excellent rate performance (180 mAh·g−1 at 5.00 A·g−1), and good cycling stability (retaining 100% of the initial specific capacity at a current density of 1.00 A·g−1 after 1000 cycles). The as-assembled Fe2TiO5/SCCB lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) also delivered a competitive energy density (137.8 Wh·kg−1) and power density (11,250 W·kg−1). This study proves that the as-fabricated 1D Fe2TiO5 nanochains are promising anode materials for high-performance LICs. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
