High-performance activated carbon for electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) has been prepared from cation exchange resin by carbonization and subsequent activation with KOH. The activation temperature has a key role in the determination of porous carbon possessing high surface areas, and large pore structures. The porous carbon activated at 700 C (carbon-700-1:4) has high surface area (2236 m2 g-1) and large total pore volume (1.15 cm3 g-1), which also displays best capacitive performances due to its well-balanced micro- or mesoporosity distribution. In details, specific capacitances of the carbon-700-1:4 sample are 336.5 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and 331.8 F g -1 at 2 A g-1. At high current density as 20 A g -1, the retention of its specific capacitance is 68.4 %. The carbon-700-1:4 sample also exhibits high performance of energy density (46.7 Wh kg-1) and long cycle stability (∼8.9 % loss after 3,000 cycles). More importantly, due to the amount of waste ion-exchange resins increasing all over the world, the present synthetic method might be adopted to dispose them, producing high-performance porous carbons for EDLC electrode materials. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
