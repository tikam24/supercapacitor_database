In this work we have discussed the different types of biomass converted materials like pyrolysis of biomass, biomass-waste, gasification of harmful gases, carbon-based supercapacitor, silica, macadamia shell waste, lithium-sulfur battery, and rice husk, etc. from the different industries and different types of conversion approaches. There are different types of conversion techniques are available for biomass conversion like CVD, hydrothermal process, thermolysis, pyrolysis, combustion, and chemical treatments. The aim of this study to identify the various types of biomass converted materials from different types of industrial waste and also find out the better way to convert into a useful material.
