The increasing development of portable devices for intelligent living promotes explorations into solid flexible energy storage systems. However, obtaining high-performance energy equipment with high-efficiency fabrication processes is still a serious challenge. Herein, a new strategy for the design of high energy flexible solid-state supercapacitors possessing a superior specific capacitance is reported. The electrodes of hierarchical porous nickel vanadium sulfide nanospheres optimized with triethanolamine show an attractive capacitance of 697.4 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and an outstanding cycling ability of 86.1% after cycling at 10 A g-1 3000 times. The asymmetric solid flexible supercapacitor (ASC) equipment delivers a high energy density of 12 W h kg-1 at a power density of 900 W kg-1 and gives rise to a robust superior cycling stability with 100% capacitance maintained over 7000 charge-discharge cycles. This research shows that ternary nickel vanadium sulfide nanospheres show great potential for applications in future flexible electronic devices. This journal is
