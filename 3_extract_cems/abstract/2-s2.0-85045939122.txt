Crystalline high-entropy ceramics (CHC), a new class of solids that contain five or more elemental species, have attracted increasing interest because of their unique structure and potential applications. Up to now, only a couple of CHCs (e.g., high-entropy metal oxides and diborides) have been successfully synthesized. Here, a new strategy for preparing high-entropy metal nitride (HEMN-1) is proposed via a soft urea method assisted by mechanochemical synthesis. The as-prepared HEMN-1 possesses five highly dispersed metal components, including V, Cr, Nb, Mo, Zr, and simultaneously exhibits an interesting cubic crystal structure of metal nitrides. By taking advantage of these unique features, HEMN-1 can function as a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications. A specific capacitance of 78 F g−1 is achieved at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 1 m KOH. In addition, such a facile synthetic strategy can be further extended to the fabrication of other types of HEMNs, paving the way for the synthesis of HEMNs with attractive properties for task-specific applications.
