Honeycomb-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon (HNC) is prepared by using poly(2,6-diaminopyridine) as nitrogen-enriched precursor and silica as hard template. After carbonization and template removal, the obtained HNC possesses an interconnected 3D hierarchical porous structure and a nitrogen level up to 15.31 at.%. Owing to the hierarchical porous structure and abundant active sites in the carbon matrix, the HNC exhibits an excellent capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 398 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and exceptional cycling stability (110.4% retention after 5000 cycles). This work provides a facile and efficient strategy for the large-scale production of nitrogen superdoped interconnected hierarchical carbon framework for high performance supercapacitors.
