Electrochemical energy storage devices are becoming increasingly important in the effort to reduce fossil-fuel consumption in transportation and to expand the use of intermittent renewable energy sources. Energy storage devices are used in a variety of applications, and the electrode materials used, particularly graphene-based nanomaterials, are critical to their effectiveness. It is becoming increasingly popular to use graphene nanostructures as electrode materials for energy storage devices. This review article conveys a comprehensive overview of current progress in the production of chemically derived graphene through the reduction of graphene oxide. Additionally, a brief discussion is provided on the latest developments in the synthesis of graphene-like materials from biomass, including the advancement of new methods. Concerning graphene synthesis, particular emphasis is placed on the various methods used for the synthesis of chemically and biomass- derived graphene for supercapacitors applications.
