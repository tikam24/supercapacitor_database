Multilayered flexible fibers, consisting of carbon black–carbon nanotube fibers, manganese oxides, and conducting polymers, are fabricated for use as electrodes in supercapacitors. Carbon-based fibers are initially prepared by wet-spinning using carbon-based nanomaterials (carbon black and carbon nanotubes) and chitosan as a matrix. Subsequent coatings with manganese oxides and conducting polymers form a multilayered structure. Different MnO2 crystalline structures (ε-MnO2, γ-MnO2) are grown onto the fiber by electrodeposition and different conducting polymers (polyethylenedioxythiophene and polypyrrole) used as a conductive wrapping. Each layer improves the performance of the fiber by adding different functionalities. While MnO2 improves the capacitance of the fiber, the presence of conducting polymers creates a conductive network increasing the capacitance further and conferring cycling stability. Capacitance values up 600 F g−1 and capacitance retention of 90% can be achieved with these multilayered hybrid fibers. A symmetric supercapacitor device, prepared from two hybrid fibers, shows no significant change in properties when the device is bent, demonstrating their potential in flexible electronic devices and wearable energy systems.
