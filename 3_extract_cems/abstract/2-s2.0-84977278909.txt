Highly ultrathin mesoporous Co3O4nanosheets have been successfully designed and constructed on nickel foam substrate via a facile two-step approach, including a hydrothermal technique without any surfactant and followed calcination of precursor. Owing to the unique mesoporous ultra-thin structural features, the capacitance of Co3O4nanosheets electrode was as high as 610 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2, and the cycling stability remained about 94.5% after 3000 cycles at current density of 4 mA cm−2. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor device based on the ultrathin mesoporous Co3O4nanosheets was fabricated and has shown promising energy densities of 136 Wh kg−1 at power density of 0.75 kW kg−1. These results demonstrated that the ultrathin mesoporous Co3O4nanosheets were excellent candidate for electrochemical supercapacitor devices.
