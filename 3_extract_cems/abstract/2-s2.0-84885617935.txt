Improvement of dynamic performance of wind generator systems following severe low voltage condition has been addressed in this article. Dynamic models of cage-generator wind system connected to an infinite bus as well as to a multimachine AC system have been developed. A method of integrating the voltage-current dynamics of the asynchronous and synchronous generators in the multimachine system has been proposed. Decoupled real and reactive power control of supercapacitor energy storage device interfaced through a STATCOM has been implemented. The supercapacitor compensates any unbalance in real power during a disturbed condition, while the STATCOM caters for the reactive needs. Dynamic behavior of the wind generator has been simulated under very low voltage conditions for both the single machine and multimachine system configurations. The studies demonstrate that the supercapacitor STATCOM energy storage system can provide significant low voltage withstand capability for reasonable durations. The electromechanical transients are also effectively suppressed and normal conditions restored quickly. Â© 2012 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.
