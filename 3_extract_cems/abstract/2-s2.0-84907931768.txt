Comparison is presented among supercapacitor, lithium-ion battery and supercapacitive cell in structure, principle and development. In structure, the cathode of supercapacitive cell is similar to that of super capacitor, while its anode is similar to that of lithium-ion battery. Therefore, its cathode can reserve energy in capacitive mechanism and its anode in fast electrochemical mechanism. Although the developments of supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery are both limited by their principle, in the future as their hybrid, supercapacitive cell would be a novel energy storage device concurrently with high power density, high energy density, high discharge voltage and long lifetime. However, before its development two problems, that are the lack of electrolyte with high decomposing voltage and the exhaustion of ions in the electrolyte at high charging voltage should be solved.
