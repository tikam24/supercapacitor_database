Birnessite form of manganese dioxide has been investigated as possible electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. It has been shown that this material exhibits partial sodium cations/protons intercalation which provides pseudo-capacitance leading to a stable value of 145 F/g on 1100 cycles. The use of Mg-doped Na-birnessite as positive electrode of a hybrid carbon/MnO2 electrochemical supercapacitor has also shown an interesting capacitance of 0.12 F, stable on 17000 cycles.
