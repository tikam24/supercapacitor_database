In present work, Co3O4 nanowire is successfully prepared on stainless steel substrate by simple chemical bath deposition method and studied the supercapacitor application. The prepared Co3O4 nanowire is analyzed by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller techniques. Co3O4 nanowire offers high specific surface area of 66.33 m2 g−1 for the intercalation of electrolyte ions. Co3O4 nanowires exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 850 F g−1 at scan rate of 5 mV s−1, and excellent long-term cycling stability (86% over 5000 CV cycles). The symmetric solid-state supercapacitor device is fabricated by accumulating two electrodes of Co3O4 nanowire, which shows superior electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 127 F g−1, specific energy of 24.18 Wh kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (85% over 3000 CV cycles).
