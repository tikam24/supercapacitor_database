The mixed metal oxides with high conductivity and multi-metal centers could easily meet the growing needs of high performance energy-storage materials. Herein, ternary phase aluminum-nickel-cobalt oxide (AlNiCo-O) is facilely prepared by a hot-air oven-based method with a subsequent calcination. The as-obtained AlNiCo-O flower-like network makes fully use of the synergistic effects among the transition metals, and exploits more electro-active surface sites, thereby allowing to undergo the redox reactions more efficient. The AlNiCo-O electrode exhibits better charge storage performances with a remarkable specific capacity of 1008.5 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor based on AlNiCo-O electrode exhibits a high energy density of 63.3 W h kg−1 at the power density of 881.4 W kg−1, good rate capability (41.6 W h kg−1 at 13.3 kW kg−1) and a satisfying cycling performance of 84.27% after 5000 cycles. This work proposes a feasible design of high-efficiency metal oxides for application in hybrid supercapacitors.
