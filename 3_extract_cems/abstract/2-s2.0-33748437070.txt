Novel internal polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell/energy storage hybrid power systems were fabricated to improve the pulse power output of the system by incorporating a supercapacitor element (Ru 2O·0.5H 2O) and a battery element (CeZrO 2) into the cathode catalyst layer of fuel cells. The steady-state performance of the hybrid fuel cell system was similar to that of the conventional fuel cell. However, the peak power output of the hybrid system, which was demonstrated by a potential square-wave voltammetry program, showed a much higher value than that of the conventional fuel cell. The pulse power output of the fuel cells can be enhanced m5arkedly by incorporating a supercapacitor element or a battery element into the electrocatalyst layer. © 2006 The Electrochemical Society.
