Nickel cobaltites (NiCo2O4) continue to attract significant research attention for applications in the renewable energy sector due to their outstanding attributes, such as high theoretical potential and affordable cost. However, capacity deterioration due to low electrical conductivity is known to hamper the functional feasibility of NiCo2O4. Herein, we report a viable strategy to promote the electrochemical performance of nickel cobaltite by incorporating conductive silver nanoparticles, which co-participate with NiCo2O4 in the redox reactions in alkaline electrolyte. The optimal composite with a favorable macro-mesoporous architecture exhibited a specific charge of 832 Cg−1 (1386 Fg−1) and demonstrated good durability in an alkaline medium. A hybrid supercapacitor device composed of NiCo2O4/Ag//activated carbon provided energy density as high as 42.6 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 512 W kg–1. Furthermore, the composite electrode with optimized Ag loading exhibited roughly 1.3 times higher plasmonic capacitance on UV illumination, facilitated by the photo-induced "Ag hot-electron sink" mechanism active in the composite material.
