A novel CoNi2S4 nanoparticle-loaded carbon nanofiber (CoNi2S4-CNF) composite has been prepared via a facile one-pot synthetic strategy. In the composite, CoNi2S4 nanoparticle is intimately contact with CNF, which is beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of CoNi2S4-CNF is 1053.3, 968.7, 893.4 and 841.7F g−1 at 4, 6, 8, 10 A g−1, respectively, which is higher than CoNi2S4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy result indicates that the combination of CoNi2S4 and CNF can decrease the electrochemical reaction resistance efficiently. Moreover, the hybrid super-capacitor assembled by the CoNi2S4-CNF cathode and the activated carbon anode demonstrates a specific capacitance of 111.1F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1.
