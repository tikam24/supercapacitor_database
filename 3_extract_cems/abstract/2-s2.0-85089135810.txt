Metal phthalocyanine-linked conjugated microporous polymers (MPc-CMPs) have huge potential applications in energy conversion and storage systems. However, the inherent low conductivity limits their practical application. Herein, the MPc-CMPs are hybridized with highly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via the easy vacuum filtration method. Interestingly, the composite (denoted as CoPc-CMP/CNTs) shows the flexible feature, which can be served as the flexible binder-free electrode for supercapacitors (SCs). As expected, the flexible CoPc-CMP/CNTs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 289.1 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and good capacity retention of 82.4% over 1350 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1. Furthermore, First-principle calculations are used to elucidate the superiority of CoPc-CMP to other analogues. The good electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect from the high pseudocapacitance and good conductivity of CoPc-CMP as well as the capacitive contribution and good conductivity of CNTs. Our strategy provides a new avenue to develop the high-performance SCs via rational integration of MPc-CMPs with highly conductive CNTs.
