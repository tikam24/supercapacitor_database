Ni(OH)2 ultrafine powders were synthesized by precipitation transformation method. Nanosized NiO was prepared by calcining the as prepared Ni(OH)2 ultrafine powders. The samples were analyzed by thermal gravity (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results show that particle size of the NiO is about 10 nm, the BET specific surface area is 186.3 m2/g with an appropriate pore size distribution. The working voltage of the NiO pseudocapacitor is 0.35 V. At a current density of 60 mA/g, the NiO has a specific capacitance of 243 F/g. By using NiO and mesoporous AC as the positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, an hybrid capacitor was fabricated. The working voltage of the hybrid capacitor is 1.5 V and it has a much better power performance and an energy density of 16.03 Wh/kg, which is 17.2 times larger than that of the NiO pseudocapacitor.
