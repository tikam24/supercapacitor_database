Supercapacitor or often referred to as ultracapacitor is well-known for its long-life cycle, rapid charge-discharge cycles, its ability to bridge between battery and conventional capacitor in terms of power density and energy density values. Carbon allotropes like graphene, carbon nanotube, etc. are widely used as electrodes for supercapacitor mainly due to its large porosity and high electrical conductivity. Pure graphene is very difficult to be prepared in large scale, then Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) is used as an alternative to graphene with properties similar to graphene. On the previous work, it was shown that carbon sheet can act as electrodes for supercapacitor, thus depositing rGO on carbon sheet (C-rGO) as electrode of supercapacitor can be a good choice to increase the capacitance through their high surface area. This research focused on studying the characteristics of symmetric supercapacitor device with C-rGO|C-rGO device configuration in 1M KCl electrolyte system. GO of 0.5 mg/ml was deposited on carbon sheet by using UV-Oven Spraying method, creating multilayer rGO with total of 70 layers. The system then measured in Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge with current variations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 mA. Energy storage characteristics of supercapacitor is then to be determined from the obtained measurement results. The measurement showed that the device has energy density of 0.25 Wh/kg to 0.72 Wh/kg and power density of 250 W/kg to 3,000 W/kg. Based on the value of energy density and power density showed that the device made had met requirements as supercapacitor.
