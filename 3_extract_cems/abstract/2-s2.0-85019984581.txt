Micro-supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices that can complement batteries in miniaturized portable electronics and microelectromechanical systems. Here, we develop a facile method to fabricate a hierarchically structured film as electrode material of supercapacitor. The hybrid PEDOT: PSS/PEDOT film is prepared via a two-step process: PEDOT: PSS film was spin-coated on the substrate in the first step and followed by the vapor phase polymerization (VPP) of PEDOT film on the PEDOT: PSS film in the second step. Each component in the hybrid film provides unique and crucial function to achieve optimized electrochemical properties. Volumetric capacity of composite film (238.63 F/cm3) is much higher than that of pure VPP PEDOT film (87.36 F/cm3). The hybrid film also exhibits excellent charge/discharge rate and good cycling stability, retaining 90.2% of its initial charge after 5500 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performances of such composites indicate a promising future as electrode material for electrochemical energy storage devices.
