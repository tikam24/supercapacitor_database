The electrochemical properties and their relationship with the physico-chemical properties of graphene-based materials have been studied. Graphite was used as the raw material and it was oxidised and then reduced by two alternative approaches, namely thermal and multi-step reduction using ascorbic acid. It was demonstrated that the physico-chemical characteristics of the material are directly related to the synthesis method and greatly influence the major capacitance of the material. It was observed that the materials with lower levels of functional oxygen groups and with a more ordered structure, i.e. similar to graphene powder, are the ideal candidates for use in electrochemical applications as these materials have better capacitance and specific capacitances.
