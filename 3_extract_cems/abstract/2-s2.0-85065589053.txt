As a hybrid supercapacitor, the performance of lithium ion capacitor (LIC) relies on the porosity profile of the carbonaceous cathode as well as the lithiated anode. In this research, chicken bone waste (CBW) was used as a carbon source for LIC cathode. Here in, the CBW was impregnated using either 1.5 M KOH or 1.5 M CH3COOH at 150째C for 24 h, followed by carbonization at 500 째 C and 650 째 C for 1 h. The pore characteristics and morphology of the obtained carbon were examined using N2-physisorption and electron microscope techniques. The carbon samples were then mixed with Super P conductive carbon and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) using the weight ratio of LIC: Super P carbon: PVDF is 85:5:10 to get the homogeneous cathode mixtures. These cathodes were then assembled incorporation with commercial lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) electrolyte and lithium titanate oxide (LTO) anode to obtain full-cell LIC. The performance of full-cell LIC was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as well as the calculation of specific capacitance. The results showed that impregnation using CH3COOH, followed by carbonization at 650째C produced porous carbon with good pore characteristics. Furthermore, this kind of porous carbon stimulates good performance of the obtained full-cell LIC.
