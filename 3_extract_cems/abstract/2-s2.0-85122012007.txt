Energy demand worldwide is rising at an unprecedented pace. This has already shown its impact on the depletion of energy sources and environmental issues (global warming and the weakening of the ozone layer). This growing pattern of energy insufficiency will, of course, intensify in the future. Referring to the literature, significant energy savings can be achieved by controlling the speed of the electric motor system using variable frequency drives (VFDs). Efficient control of induction motor drives provides an excellent opportunity for energy savings. As a result, research into the optimal operation of induction motor drives is escalating and mainly focuses on the Direct Torque Control (DTC) control technique on improving the dynamic operation of torque control. However, the study on the type of energies on improving the dynamic response is least reported. This paper will study the effect of different energy supplies on the dynamic response of torque performance. The standard DC battery and supercapacitor will be used to energize the induction motor through the three-phase inverter and controlled with the DTC control scheme. The results are validated through MATLAB Simulink and it shows the supercapacitor has the better dynamic response in torque response compared to the standard DC battery. The comparative results are presented in a proper mannered way.
