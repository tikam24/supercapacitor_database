Rapid development in flexible electronics creates a growing demand for stable and wearable energy storage and energy harvesting devices. This chapter represents a brief review of textile-based powering systems including nanogenerators, solar cells, supercapacitors, and batteries as an essential component in the emerging wearable and portable electronic devices. Portable hybrid power systems, including nanogenerator-battery and nanogenerator-supercapacitor hybrids, are also discussed.
