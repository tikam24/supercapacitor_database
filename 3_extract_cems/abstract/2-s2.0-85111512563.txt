Redox-active porous polymers are promising electrode materials due to various advantages including high specific surface area and porosity, facile synthesizing route, and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Herein, a simple and cost-effective Schiff base reaction was used to prepare the ferrocene (Fc) containing porous organic polymer (POP) through the formation of a C-N bond between melamine and 1,1′-diacetylferrocene. After successful preparation of the Fc-POP, Fc-POP/PANI nanohybrid was prepared by the hybridization of synthesized redox-active polymer with polyaniline (PANI) as a conductive polymer. Finally, the CNT (carbon nanotube)-containing nanocomposites were prepared by adding various amounts of the CNT to Fc-POP/PANI nanohybrid. All as-prepared electrode materials were thoroughly characterized with usual analyses. The Fc-POP/PANI/CNT20 revealed a high specific capacitance of 494 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 and excellent charge storage retention (92.1%) over 5000 cycles. Also, the fabricated symmetric cell exhibits a high energy density of 76 W h kg−1 and a high-power density of 5840 W kg−1.
