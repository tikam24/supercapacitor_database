This study uses the simple precipitation technique to develop a novel nanocomposite material comprised of samarium hydroxide nanorolls attached to the surface of graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets as active electrode materials for supercapacitors. The unique texture (morphology) of Sm(OH)3 nanorolls attached to the g-C3N4 nanosheets aid in creates a substantial number of active sites during redox reactions. Sm(OH)3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite exhibits a specific capacitance of 586 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 3 M LiOH, though its constituents Sm(OH)3 (227.87 Fg−1 at 1 A g−1) and g-C3N4 (135.55 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1). Benefiting from its morphological structure, the prepared nanocomposite (SCN20) achieved a high cyclability of 97.5% even after 3000 continuous cycles and coulombic efficiency of 95.1%. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was constructed by employing a positive electrode as Sm(OH)3/g-C3N4 nanocomposite (SCN20) and negative electrode as activated carbon (AC), which exhibits a high energy density of 37.23 W h kg−1 with the respective power density of 3.5 kW kg−1. This investigation is about the exciting morphology of the novel nanocomposites and their synergetic reaction existing between them, which bring forth the nanoengineering of as-synthesized active materials for the application in supercapacitors.
