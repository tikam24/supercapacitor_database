The electrochemical stability of metal-nitride (TiN and VN) electrodes is improved by a general strategy involving the addition of a thin carbon shell to the metal-nitride nanowires (NWs), producing TiN@C and VN@C NWs. The carbon shell effectively suppresses any electrochemical oxidation reactions, allowing the metal nitrides to retain their structure, without sacrificing their electrochemical performance for charge storage.
