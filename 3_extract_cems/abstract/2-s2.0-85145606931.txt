Insertion of carbonaceous materials into polymeric matrix is a well-practiced approach for improving mechanical and electrochemical profile. Further, metal sulphides featured with high electrical conductivity and variable oxidation states have emerged as potential candidates for fabricating supercapacitor electrodes. In this work, polymer-derived PPy-rGO-CuS was prepared in the laboratory via in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization technique. The presence of CuS improved redox activity and charge storage capability of the polymer-derived composites. The electrochemical performance of the material, coated over C-paper was evaluated through two electrode symmetric system. The PPy-rGO-CuS composite with 10 % rGO and 5 % CuS (by mass of PPy) illustrated optimum specific capacitance 237.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. PGC5 also elucidated high cyclic behavior with constant capacitance retention up to 2000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles. This enabled to scale up synergistic action among the chemical constituents involved therein. Nonetheless, energy density of PGC5 was recorded 21.1 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. These features markedly affirmed the successful candidature of PGC5 as a high-performance polymer-derived composite electrode material for supercapacitor application.
