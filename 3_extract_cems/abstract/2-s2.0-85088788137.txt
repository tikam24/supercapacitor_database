In this study, a simple and facile electrochemical deposition technique was employed to fabricate fluorine-doped tin oxide-based polydiphenylamine-polyaniline/phosphotungstic acid copolymer nanocomposite modified electrode (FTO/PDPA-PANI/PTA) for high-performance supercapacitors application. Crystalline and morphological structure and coating thickness of PDPA-PANI/PTA nanocomposite on FTO were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and atomic force microscope. The fabricated nanohybrid electrode exhibits superior specific capacitance of 360 Fgâˆ’1 at 1 mA current density. The higher capacitive behavior and cyclic steadiness of FTO/PDPA-PANI/PTA modified electrode were achieved because of the presence of tungsten in the PDPA/PANI co-polymer nanonetworks provide efficient interaction which enhances the fast electron transfer progressions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) studies ensure the capacitive behavior of the electrodeposited nanohybrid modified electrode with a characteristic EIS semicircle in the lower frequency region. Further, a superior specific capacitance with 82% excellent capacitance retention after 1000 cycles, recommends a practical application in supercapacitor device electrodes.
