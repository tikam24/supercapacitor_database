Here, we use the method of electrochemical surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization to prepare VN nanoparticle/GO composites. VN nanoparticles is uniformly distributed onto the surface of GO, which forms an intercalation structure. Synergistic effect of the electrochemical active material of VN and good conductive substrate of GO significantly improves the efficiency of the electrochemically active materials to ensure the electrode behavior of charging and discharging process goes smoothly. In 2 M KOH electrolyte, the electrode material of VN/GO hybrid exhibits good specific capacitance of 109.7 F/g. And after 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate still reaches 93% of the initial capacity.
