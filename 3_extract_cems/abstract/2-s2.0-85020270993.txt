Flake like CuO nanostructures on conductive carbon fabric (CuO/CF) substrate have been prepared by simple, low cost chemical synthesis method. It has been found to be good structural integrity of this nanostructure on the fabric even after several bending and twisting. CuO/CF shows good electrochemical performances in aqueous electrolyte system with specific capacitance 400 F/g at scan rate 10 mv/s, highest energy density 2.2 wh/kg and highest power density 282 w/kg, so it can be considered as a good electrochemical capacitors in energy storage systems.
