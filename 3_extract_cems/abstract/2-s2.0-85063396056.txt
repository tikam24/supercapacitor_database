Electricity meter based on the IR46 standard can integrate accurate measurement and online upgrade of its management function. It is the development direction of smart electricity meter in the next generation. In this paper, a topology of twin-core electricity meter is proposed, which realizes the separation of MCU of metering and MCU of management. For the problem of voltage loss of clock battery of the smart electricity meter, the clock circuit of twin-core electricity meter is designed. The scheme of clock battery with lithium battery and supercapacitor is proposed. It can effectively reduce the occurrence probability of voltage loss of clock battery in field operation. It provides theoretical guidance for the clock circuit's design of smart electricity meter in the new generation.
