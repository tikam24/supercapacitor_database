Cost-efficient microwave synthesisized α-Fe2O3/MoS2/rGO (Fe2MG) composite has been fabricated with promising energy storage characteristics. SEM and TEM analyses corroborate that the spherical α-Fe2O3 nanoparticles are wrapped over MoS2 and rGO sheets. The Fe2MG composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 551 F.g−1 at 1 A.g−1 and improved cyclic stability with only 2.1% of capacitance loss after 2000 charge–discharge cycles at a high current density (30 mA.s−1). The Fe2MG composite is a suitable choice as an electrode material for supercapacitor and other electrochemical applications.
