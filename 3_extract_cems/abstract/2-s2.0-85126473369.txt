The pure graphene aerogel material is a double-layer capacitor material which provides capacitance by the surface area. Its conductivity and specific capacitance require further improvement. In this work, manganese doped graphene aerogels were synthesized by hydrothermal method using manganese chloride as a source of manganese. The effect of manganese content on the structure and properties of the material was studied. It is found that the specific surface area and pore volume of aerogels decrease with the increase of Mn content. The Mn doped graphene aerogel prepared at the current density of 0.1 A/g shows a capacitance of 180 F/g and exhibits pseudo capacitance performance in the three-electrode test. After assembling the button capacitor, the capacity retention rate is 93% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A/g.
