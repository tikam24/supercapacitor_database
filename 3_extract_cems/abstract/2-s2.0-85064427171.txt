Cupric oxide/reduced graphene oxide (CuO/rGO) nanocomposites were synthesized through a chemical reduction method using hydrazine hydrate as the reducing agent. The morphology, elemental composition, and bonding network of the CuO/rGOnanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy respectively. The XRD results reveal lattice spacing and lattice strain from 3.371 to 3.428 Å and 1.05 × 10 −3 to 5.44 × 10 −3 respectively, with the increasing ratio of rGO: CuO from 1:1 to 1:5. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) studyofCuO/rGOas the electrode material showed excellent super-capacitive behavior in H 2 SO 4 over Na 2 SO 4 electrolytes. Moreover CuO/rGO nanocomposites exhibited better capacitance retention in H 2 SO 4 (75.69%) compared to Na 2 SO 4 (12.06%).
