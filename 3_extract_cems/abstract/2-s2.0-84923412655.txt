Two-dimensional materials often show a range of intriguing electronic, catalytic, and optical properties that differ greatly from conventional nanoparticles. Herein, we demonstrate the large-scale preparation of sub-3 nm atomic layers Co3O4nanofilms with a nonsurfactant and substrate-free hydrothermal method. This successful preparation of ultrathin nanofilms highlighted the reconstruction of cobalt-ammonia complexes and synergistic effect of free ammonia and nitrate on film growth control. Subsequent performance tests uncovered that these sub-3 nm atomic layer Co3O4nanofilms exhibited an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1400 F/g in the first galvanostatic charge/discharge test. The specific capacitance of Co3O4nanofilms only slightly decayed less than 3% after 1500 cycling tests. With some parameter adjustments, similar Co(OH)2nanofilms with a thickness of 3.70 Â± 0.10 nm were also prepared. The Co(OH)2nanofilms possessed maximum specific capacitance of 1076 F/g and peak performance attenuation of about 2% after a cycle stability test.
