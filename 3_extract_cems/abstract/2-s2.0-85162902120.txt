Among the existing electrochemical capacitive energy storage electrode materials, the (TiNbTaZrHf)C, (VCrNbMoZr)2N, (CoCrFeMnNi)3O4, (FeCoCrMnMg)3O4 and (FeCoCrMnCuZn)3O4 all have excellent capacitive performance, but the energy density is limited due to the narrow potential window. In order to solve the problem of low energy density of electrochemical supercapacitor, a kind of high-entropy carbides (HEMCs) with broad potential window is designed from generalized analysis of electrochemical window of active elements. This high-entropy carbide contains five active elements of Fe, Co, Cr, Mn and Ni. The prepared HEMC-3 has abundant pores and a specific surface area of 417.8 m2 g−1. The large specific surface area makes the HEMCs have high-rate energy storage performance. Electrochemical tests show that the HEMC-3 presents a potential window of [-1.0, 0.6] versus Hg/HgO, and can obtain a specific capacitance of 169.7 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Due to the designed wide potential window of the prepared HEMCs, the energy density has been greatly improved, which shows a new strategy for developing of electrochemical supercapacitor electrode materials.
