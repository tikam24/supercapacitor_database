An cationic surfactant of Hexadecyl Trimethyl Ammonium Chloride (HTAC) are used to modify morphology of MnO2 by direct electrodeposition. The deposited nanocomposites of MnO2 : HTAC are composed of nanosheets. The manganese dioxide has shown the highest specific capacitance of 350.02 F/g. Specific surface area of the nanocomposites of MnO2 : HTAC at surfactant concentration below 50 mM is larger than pristine MnO2 by BET analysis, which results in that the specific capacitance of nanocomposites of MnO2 : HTAC is larger than pristine MnO2. The MnO2 : HTAC nanocomposites show better cycles performance of charge/discharge than pristine MnO2, because the alkyl chains of cationic surfactants on surface can delay the dissolving of MnO2 materials in electrolytic solution during cycles. By use of HTAC surfactant, both of the specific capacitance and stability for charge/discharge circles of MnO2 electrode materials are highly improved.
