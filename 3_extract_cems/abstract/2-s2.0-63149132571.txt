An asymmetrical supercapacitor was fabricated with a CNTs/SnO2 negative electrode and a CNTs/MnO2 positive electrode. It was tested in charge and discharge to 1.7 V in aqueous electrolyte without showing noticeable current resulting from water decomposition. Physicochemical properties of the CNTs/SnO2 and CNTs/MnO2 nanocomposites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). At a current density of 0.25A g-1, the energy density of the hybrid supercapacitor was found to be 20.3 Whkg -1 which is comparable to that obtained from electric double layer supercapacitors using organic electrolytes (17̃18Wh kg-1) 1,2. The asymmetrical supercapacitor also shows exceptional stability over 1000 cycles with the capacity loss being less than 8%. © The Electrochemical Society.
