This paper proposes the simulation of the combined system of power grid peak load compensation. The described peak load compensation system is designed with using of photovoltaic module as energy source and supercapacitor battery as energy storage. The energy transition from photovoltaic module to load is controlled by optimizer which consists of DC-DC converter and maximum power point tracking controller. The simulation was performed under chaotic load current condition. The simulation results show that the optimizer with supercapacitor battery allows to minimize the influence of chaotic load current dynamics on photovoltaic panel operating point.
