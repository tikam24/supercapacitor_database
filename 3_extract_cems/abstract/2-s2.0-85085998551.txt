Porous and hollow nanomaterials have been an exciting research area for numerous next-generation technological applications. However, it is still a challenge to assemble porous and hollow nanostructures of appropriate composition and characteristics in designed architectures. Here, we report a self-Templated metal-organic frameworks based strategy for the synthesis and engineering of porous and hollow nanostructures in designed architectures by developing graphitic-carbon-intermingled porous Co3O4 nanotentacles, for the first time, on electrospun hollow carbon nanofibers in a designed 3D pattern (3D Co3O4/C@HCNFs). The as-developed nanocomposite sheet, as a free-standing electrode for supercapacitors, shows a high specific capacity of 199 mA h g-1 (1623 F g-1) at 1 A g-1 with good cyclic life and outstanding rate capability. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device supplies an energy density of 36.6 W h kg-1 at the power density of 471 W kg-1 with significant cyclic life and rate capability indicating its potential practical application. This synthetic strategy suggests a simple, cost-effective and convenient route for the synthesis and assembly of porous and hollow structured nanomaterials in designed architectures for diverse applications.
