The electrochemical performance of lithium-ion capacitors with stabilized lithium metal powder/multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite as anode and activated carbon as cathode was investigated by means of galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the introduction of stabilized lithium metal powder can eliminate the majority of the inherent irreversible capacity of carbon nanotubes and greatly improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion capacitors. The lithium-ion capacitors have a specific capacitance of 85.18 F/g at the current density of 0.05 A/g. The maximum energy density and power density reached 140.4 Wh/kg and 5.25 KW/kg respectively in the current range of 0.05~4 A/g. The continuous galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling tests revealed that the lithium-ion capacitors could maintain 82% of the capacity after 3000 cycles. In sum, the lithium-ion capacitors showed an excellent cycle performance with high energy and power density.
