Whisker- like carbon nanotubes (WCNTs) were produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and then purified by graphitization at high temperature. The WCNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Water suspension consisted of WCNTs as functional material and cellulose fibers as matrix was prepared by speed-cutting procedure, and then WCNTs containing composite papers were prepared with the above suspension by vacuum filtration. The conductivity of the composite papers increased from 14.1 S/m to 325.1 S/m after incorporation of the graphitized WCNTs. A supercapacitor cell with two-electrodes was constructed with 1 mol/L LiPF6 as electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of supercapacitor was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results indicated that the supercapacitor has a maximum capacitance of 90 F/g by a scan rate of 1 mV/s. The specific energy and specific power reached 21.3 Wh/kg and 2.1 kW/kg respectively by a current density of 800 mA/g. These showed an excellent application prospect of the modified carbon nanotubes for supercapacitors.
