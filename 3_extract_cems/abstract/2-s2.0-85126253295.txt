A proof-of-principle double-layer symmetrical supercapacitor with nanoporous copper/copper oxide electrodes and an aqueous electrolyte is investigated. The electrodes are manufactured by selective dissolution of Al from a eutectic composition of Cu17.5Al82.5 using 5 M NaOH. The ostensible (i.e., net external) capacitance of a symmetrical two-electrode cell with 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte is assessed over a series of charge/discharge cycles and is about 2 F per gram of Cu in this simple prototype. Capacitance varies during a discharge cycle due evidently to the deeply buried surfaces and pseudocapacitive reactions contributing charge toward the end of a discharge cycle. In principle such a device should have very low ohmic losses due to its highly conductive backbone and would be suitable for applications requiring maximum energy efficiency over repeated cycling. The aqueous electrolyte ensures fire safety but this comes at the cost of lower energy content. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
