Materials engineering plays a key role in the field of energy storage. In particular, engineering materials at the nanoscale offers unique properties resulting in high performance electrodes and electrolytes in various energy storage devices. Consequently, considerable efforts have been made in recent years to fulfill the future requirements of electrochemical energy storage using these advanced materials. Various multi-functional hybrid nanostructured materials are currently being studied to improve energy and power densities of next generation storage devices. This review describes some of the recent progress in the synthesis of different types of hybrid nanostructures using template assisted and non-template based methods. The potential applications and recent research efforts to utilize these hybrid nanostructures to enhance the electrochemical energy storage properties of Li-ion battery and supercapacitor are discussed. This review also briefly outlines some of the recent progress and new approaches being explored in the techniques of fabrication of 3D battery structures using hybrid nanoarchitectures.
