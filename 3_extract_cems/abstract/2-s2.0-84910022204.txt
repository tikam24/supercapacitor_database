Microgrid structure provides economically attractive electricity supply to customers with less impact on the environment. Microgrid losses frequency support when its operation switches from grid connected mode to islanded mode. Hence, controlling of frequency is of utmost importance in islanded mode. During post-fault condition, frequency gets deviated and hence, lack of necessary steps to minimize frequency deviation results in tripping of generators. This ultimately leads to disconnection of utility power at consumer ends. By using energy storage devices efficiently, frequency deviation can be minimized during post fault condition. Storage device can provide energy when grid connection is not available. Because of high power density and high charging/discharging rate, supercapacitor is used as a storage device for providing post fault condition power in microgrid. In this paper, impact of supercapacitor in microgrid to minimize the frequency deviation has been investigated through a number of case studies. Results show that placement or location of supercapacitor has significant impact on stabilizing frequency fluctuation under post-fault scenarios in microgrid.
