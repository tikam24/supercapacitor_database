Aiming at the electricity fluctuation of electric driving equipment, a super-capacitor energy storage system is proposed, which adopts the DC-DC converter with integrated magnetic structure to greatly reduce the size and loss of magnetic component and the current pulse. The energy storage system provides enough power to equipment, stabilizes the supply voltage and optimizes the power quality. The results of simulation with MATLAB/Simulink and experiment show that, the proposed system follows the load current well, replenishes the energy lacked and absorbs the excessive energy timely. The DC bus fluctuation is less than 3.33% of rated voltage during step change of load. Compared with traditional schemes, the proposed system has better performance and practical value.
