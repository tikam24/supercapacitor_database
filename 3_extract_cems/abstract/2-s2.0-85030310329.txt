The hierarchical MoS 2 nanowires/NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets (MS/NCO) supercapacitor electrode materials supported on Ni foam were synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method. The capacitance was investigated by using various electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry, constant-current galvanostatic charge/discharge curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MS/NCO networks show 7 times more capacitance (7.1 F cm −2 ) than pure NiCo 2 O 4 nanosheets by CV at a scan rate of 2 mV s −1 . The specific capacitance of the assembled MS/NCO//active carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor could reach up to 51.7 F g −1 at a current density of 1.5 A g −1 . Also, the maximum energy density of 18.4 W h kg −1 at a power density of 1200.2 W kg −1 was achieved, with 98.2% specific capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. These exciting results exhibit potential application in developing energy storage devices with high energy density and high power density.
