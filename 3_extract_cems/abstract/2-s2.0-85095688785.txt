This work describes the preparation of spinel NiMn2O4 nanodisks decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) via low-temperature colloidal solution method and analyzes their performances as electro-active electrode for electrochemical sensor and supercapacitors. The morphological analysis revealed the well-decorated spinel NiMn2O4 nanodiks over the rGO surfaces. The crystalline, structure, and composition of spinel NiMn2O4nanodisks decorated rGO was studied and extensively used as electrode materials for electrochemical applications. For sensing measurements, the NiMn2O4/rGO composite modified GCE expressed the high sensitivity of 78.56 mA.mM−1·cm−2 with an excellent linear dynamic range of 1.0 μM–500.0 μM towards the acetylacetone chemical. The electrode prepared by NiMn2O4/rGO composite was applied to fabricate the double layer electrochemical supercapacitors. NiMn2O4/rGO electrode showed a reasonably high specific capacitance of 356 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibited the admirable rate capability by maintaining 86% from initial capacity after 5000 cycles. The prepared NiMn2O4/rGO composite and obtained results are the promising electrode materials for achieving high-performance sensing and supercapacitors.
