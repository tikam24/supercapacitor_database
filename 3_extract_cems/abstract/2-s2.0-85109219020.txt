Perovskite (PVSK) has been considered as a promising material for electrochemical energy storage devices. In this paper, the conduction mechanism of rare earth europium-doped perovskite material, Pb1−xEux (Zr0.60Ti0.40)1−x/4O3 as an electrode material for solar cell as well as supercapacitor has been studied. The structural and electrical properties were studied at room temperature for different compositions of Eu-doped PVSK, x = 0.00, 0.03, 0.06 and 0.09. Europium-doped PVSK was prepared via solid-state technique in the higher range of temperature. Structural and surface morphologies were done by X-ray diffraction and SEM. The electrical property has been studied via CIS technique at different frequencies. Study of ac conductivity and impedance analysis affirms PVSK as a potential material for the electrode of photo supercapacitor, a device which helps in the conversion of light energy into electrical and which also helps in energy storage mechanism.
