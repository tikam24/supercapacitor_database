Purpose: The purpose of this study is to design carbon electrode materials for high performance electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) with pores that are large enough and have suitable pore size distribution for the electrolyte to access completely to improve EDLCsâ€™ electrochemical performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study develop an improved traditional KOH activation method, and a series of micro-meso hierarchical porous carbons have been successfully prepared from phenol formaldehyde resin by combining polyethylene glycol (PEG) and conventional KOH activation. Findings: As evidenced by N2 adsorption/desorption tests, the obtained samples present Types IV and I-IV hybrid shape isotherms compared with KOH-activated resin (typical of Type I). The sample AC2-7-1, which the addition quantity of PEG is 25 per cent PF (weight ration) activated at 700? For 1 h is considered as the optimum preparation condition. It exhibits the highest specific capacitance value of 240 F/g in 30 wt% KOH aqueous electrolytes because of its higher specific surface area (2085 m2/g), greater pore volume (1.08 cm3/g) and the maximum mesoporosity (43 per cent). In addition, the capacity decay of this material is only 3.1 per cent after 1000 cycles. Originality/value: The materials that are rich in micropores and mesopores show great potential in EDLC capacitors, particularly for applications where high power output and good high-frequency capacitive performances are required.
