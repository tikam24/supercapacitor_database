Supercapacitor's in electric vehicle is estimated that it would reach nearly 59 billion dollars in the market by 2026, and there is a robust development in lithium related batteries for electric vehicle which is majorily attributing to huge investments, so in this approach This paper describes the electrochemical studies of the electrodes for the application of supercapacitors devices using three electrode system, wide range of studies are going on in the field of supercapacitors to increase the overall cyclic stability and collumbic effeciency, power density energy density etc. in this paper we used reduced graphene oxide (carbon material), 85 percent of the active material, 10 percent of the ketjen black (conducting carbon) and 5 percent of PVDF (polyvenyl difluroide + N-methyl pyrolydine as solvent, and reached maximum efficiency of 95 percent at very early stages for around 5000 cycles.
