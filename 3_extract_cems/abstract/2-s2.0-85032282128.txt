This paper investigates the impact of charge redistribution on supercapacitor charge capacity by experimentally estimating the charge capacity bounds. An analysis of a physics-based RC ladder circuit model for supercapacitors reveals the theoretical bounds and provides guidelines for designing experiments to estimate the bounds. The upper bound corresponds to a long time constant voltage charging process and the lower bound is established using a charging process with the largest possible current. Bounds of two types of supercapacitor charge capacity are estimated: the total charge stored in the supercapacitor that can be released during multiple discharging processes and the utilized charge delivered during one discharging action. The relationship between the utilized charge capacity and the discharge current is examined and different patterns are observed depending on the supercapacitor state of charge. For a fully charged supercapacitor, the utilized capacity increases when the discharge current decreases. For a supercapaictor partially charged by a relatively large current, the utilized capacity is dependent on both the discharge current and the supercapacitor operation voltage range. The difference between the bounds is significant for both types of charge capacity. These observations provide guidelines for optimizing the supercapacitor charging and discharging policies for different applications.
