There is a persistent imbalance between energy demand and supply since renewable energy sources are intermittent. A potential answer to this ongoing problem is the development of suitable materials that could be utilized in storage energy devices. Among all the devices, supercapacitors with efficient electrode material are one of the possible storage technologies. Here in the present work, a cerium selenide/reduced graphene oxide (CeSe/rGO) heterostructure-based electrode is fabricated via hydrothermal technique. The synthesized CeSe/rGO performs well with 810.45 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1.5 A g−1, and an exceptional rate of capability with negligible instability up to 5000th cycles. Additionally, the probable contribution of rGO to the composite's ability to increase supercapacitance through synergy effect of CeSe and rGO has been observed. EIS (Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) was exploited to find out the mechanism of charge transmission for the fabricated material. The electrochemical analysis indicates that CeSe/rGO exhibited the superior performance than the apparently cutting-edge structures.
