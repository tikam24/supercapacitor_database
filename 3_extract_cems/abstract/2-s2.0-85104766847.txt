Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite material is synthesized jointly by carbon assisted method and in situ deposition method with Co3O4 and graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as raw materials.X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and other characterization methods are employed to characterize Co3O4 and Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite materials.Results show that Co3O4 distributes uniformly within g-C3N4 laminates to form a new structure (2D-3D).Electrochemical performance test results show that the specific capacitance of Co3O4/g-C3N4 reaches 1, 071 F•g-1 when the current density is 1 A•g-1, which is 5.9 times that of pure Co3O4.The specific capacitance of Co3O4/g-C3N4 remains 95.5% after 1, 000 cycles when the current density is 10 A•g-1.
