This paper presents the design and simulation of an non isolated DC-DC Cuk converter. The input current control is provided with pulse-width modulation (PWM). A closed control loop is used with two proportional-integral (PI) controllers for the current and voltage. The DC-DC Cuk converter is used with Simulink cells for battery and supercapacitors (SC) to simulate the charging and discharging process for a stationary energy storage device (ESD). Simulations results are presented in Simulink.
