In this study, the dielectric behavior of polyanionic electrically conductive superabsorbent hydrogel based on sodium alginate-g-poly(AM-co-ECA-co-AMPS) was investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS). The dielectric spectra obtained from −70 to 70 °C showed a superposition of three distinctive processes, electrode polarization, charge carrier's transport, and a molecular relaxation process. These dynamic processes were further analyzed along with the effect of both temperature and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) content. The development of a clear electrochemical double layer (ECDL) at the electrode/hydrogel interface strongly supports its possible application in supercapacitors' forms of energy storage. TGA, DSC, rheology, and electrochemical properties were studied. Furthermore, when the composite hydrogel with rGO content of 2.5 % was assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, it displayed a specific capacitance of 756 F.g−1 at 1 A.g−1 and 704 F.g−1 after 5000 cycles with high capacitance retention of 93.2 %. The superior conductivity and porous structure of the rGO composite hydrogel are credited with the hydrogel's excellent electrochemical capabilities.
