Graphene, as a new type of carbon material in the forefront of research, has been applied widely in the area of supercapacitors with the advantages of a large positive specific surface, high conductivity, stable chemical properties and good supercapacitor performance. In this study, an investigation on the electrochemical performance of reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) prepared from various natural graphites was conducted. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and electrochemical performance analysis were performed to characterize the as-prepared GOs and rGOs. The results demonstrated that a reduction modification of GO was necessary to optimize its electrochemical performance. The rGO has a great electrochemical performance with a good repair ability, better oxygen-containing functional group removal effect, lower structural defects, larger average size of the in-plane sp2 region and great specific capacitance.
