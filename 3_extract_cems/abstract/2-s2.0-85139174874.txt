Nowadays, due to increased pollution and fuel prices have made electric vehicles more popular. The electric vehicles are mainly propelled with battery as primary energy source, however its life is affected by high charge discharge currents. The supercapacitor can endure high charging or discharging current peaks and also provides peak power on demand. When these two combinations are used together, the battery pack's endurance is boosted and the battery's life is extended. Because the battery is such an important component of an electric vehicle, it necessitates the installation of a thermal management system to reduce the operating temperature to ambient. By combining a supercapacitor and a battery, a sudden load on the battery is transferred to the capacitor, and battery heating is reduced. The supercapacitor is capable to store significant amount of energy in a short period of time and supply high power to a load without affecting its life span. Furthermore, during regenerative braking, the supercapacitor absorbs energy more effectively than a battery. In this work, the battery and supercapacitor features are utilized to improve energy management and vehicle driving range. It can been seen that the supercapacitor is able to recover 53% more energy during braking operation and delivers instantaneous power to load effectively at fast rate during driving.
