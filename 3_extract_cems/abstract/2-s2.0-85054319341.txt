The development of hybrid supercapacitors is limited due to the low specific capacity of traditional carbon-negative materials. Herein, we synthesized two different Fe-based negative electrodes (FeOOH and Fe2O3), and the relationships between structures and capacitive properties of electrodes are systematically studied. Results demonstrate that the Fe2O3 material exhibits higher electrochemical activity than their FeOOH counterparts obtained under the same conditions. Then, a high energy density asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated by using nanostructured NiCo2S4 and Fe2O3–RGO composite as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The assembled device with an extended operation voltage of 1.6 V achieves a maximum energy density of 53.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 716 W kg−1 and can still operate at a high power density of 11.5 KW kg−1 with an energy density of 14.2 Wh kg−1, thus holding great potentials for future energy storage devices.
