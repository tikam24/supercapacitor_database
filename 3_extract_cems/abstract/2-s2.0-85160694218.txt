The efficient storage of electrons and the type of conduction in semiconductor materials are important factors in determining their electrochemical performance. However, the interaction between these two factors is often overlooked by researchers. In this study, the effects of Ni doping at Co3−xNixO4 nanoparticles on the electronic storage form of the material and resulting changes in the conduction p/n-type are reported. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that n-type conduction with high effective mass of electrons contributes significantly to the redox reaction of electrode materials and is beneficial for improving electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of Co3−xNixO4 (x = 0.67) electrode material is 10 times larger than that of Co3O4 due to enhanced orbital hybridization caused by Ni atom doping. The findings provide new directions for exploring the mechanism of conductive type conversion of materials and offer insights beyond the traditional approach of considering doping content alone.
