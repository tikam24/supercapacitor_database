Mn3O4/graphene (GM) composites were prepared via a simple solvothermal process by mixing Mn(AC)2·4H2O and graphite oxide (GO) suspension in mixed ethanol/H2O. As characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, Mn3O4 nanoparticles with size of 37-50 nm are effectively anchored in graphene sheets. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were adopted to investigate the electrochemical properties of GM composites in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution. In a potential window of -0.2 to 0.8 V vs. SCE, the composites deliver an initial specific capacitance of 161.0 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and increase to 230 F g-1 after 1000 cycles, while significant capacitance fading for pure Mn3O4. At a high current density of 5 A g-1, the specific capacitances of 116 F g -1, 22.5 F g-1 are exhibited for the Mn3O 4/graphene composites and pure Mn3O4, respectively, indicating that graphene greatly enhances the electrochemical performance of Mn3O4. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
