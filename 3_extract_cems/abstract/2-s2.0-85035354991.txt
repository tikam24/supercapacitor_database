This paper reports the synthesis of N-doped carbon foams (NCFs) using simple, environment-friendly, and self-developed freezing method. A robust structure of NCFs along with high surface area, hierarchical pore structure, and nitrogen/oxygen functionalities allows their application as free-standing electrode. Microbial fuel cell equipped with differently prepared NCFs as free-standing anode and metal-free cathode generates significantly higher power density, 35.74 W m−3 than conventional electrodes. Furthermore, NCF with an optimized resorcinol-formaldehyde content shows significantly high-charge storage capacity, 799 F g−1, at 0.25 A g−1 and also delivers a high energy density, 111 Wh kg−1, equivalent to that of a Li-ion battery.
