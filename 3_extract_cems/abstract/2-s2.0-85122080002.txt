Flexible electrodes with excellent energy storage and conversion properties that can be produced by a simple process are highly desirable for supercapacitors. Herein, Cobalt-Nickel double hydroxide (CoNi-DH) micro-nanosheet arrays are prepared uniformly on naturally sedimented Ti3C2Tx films by an etching-deposition-growth process to form a CoNi-DH@Ti3C2Tx heterostructure. The naturally sedimented Ti3C2Tx film serves as the substrate to minimize aggregation of the CoNi-DH nanoarrays to enhance the electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure comprised of the CoNi-DH interconnected nanoarrays promotes electrolyte access. By taking advantage of the excellent electrical conduction and high theoretical specific capacitance, the flexible CoNi-DH@Ti3C2Tx electrode in the supercapacitor delivers a superior specific capacitance of 919.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and remarkable capacitance retention of 89.6% after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. Density-functional theory calculations are performed to investigate the charge density difference and partial density of states of CoNi-DH@Ti3C2Tx and the theoretical assessment suggests that the chemical bonds between Ti3C2Tx and CoNi-DH are critical to the charge transport, electrical conductivity, and structural stability.
