Poor performance of the binder materials that bind the electroactive materials and a current collector in pseudocapacitors often set back the mechanical properties and energy storage capacity of these devices. Development of binder-free supercapacitor electrode is, thus, of paramount importance. In this communication, we report a proof-of-principle concept of developing a new class of binder-free, flexible pseudocapacitor electrodes based on a composite of 2,4,6-tris(dodecyloxy)phenyl-N-methylfulleropyrrolidine derivative and β-Ni(OH)2 nanorods. These electrodes deliver a specific capacitance of 675 Fg−1, 91.18 % of which is retained over 1000 charge-discharge cycles. We demonstrate that these electrodes can achieve specific energy and specific power of 661.5 Wh/kg and 8.8 KW/kg respectively. Based on our studies, we propose that further improvement in the capacitance can be achieved through optimization of the electrode components.
