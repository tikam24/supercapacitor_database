A real-time unified speed control and power flow management system for an electric vehicle (EV) powered by a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is developed following a nonlinear control system technique. In view of the coupling between energy management and HESS sizing, a HESS sizing model is developed in this article to optimally determine the size of HESS to serve an EV using the controller designed. The objectives of the controller are to track the set speed of the vehicle with globally exponential stability and to make use of the HESS wisely to reduce battery stress. The design provides a compound controller by exploiting the physical origins of the vehicles' power demand. The controller and HESS sizing system designed are simulated on a standard urban dynamometer driving schedule and a recorded actual city driving cycle for a full-size EV to demonstrate their effectiveness.
