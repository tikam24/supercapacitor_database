A carbon nanoparticle ionic liquid (CNPIL) as a conductive agent and binder is introduced into an activated carbon electrode to improve supercapacitor performance. It has a high specific capacitance of 223 F g-1, high power density (1.64 kW kg-1 at 83.2 W h kg-1) and high charge-discharge efficiency (97.3%).
