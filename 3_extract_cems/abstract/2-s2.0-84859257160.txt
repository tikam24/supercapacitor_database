A high-performance conducting polymer-activated carbon composite electrode material was prepared by potentiostatic deposition of aniline on a hierarchically porous carbon, which was carbonized from the natural bamboo. The obtained composite combined the contribution of the unique properties of the activated carbon and pseudocapacitance of the deposited polyaniline layer. This active material possessed excellent rate capability and good cycle performance, over 92% of the original capacitance is retained after 1,000 cycles. The energy density of the composite can reach 47.5 Wh kg -1 calculated only by active mass. It can be a good candidate for high-performance supercapacitor. Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.
