Lanthanum (Rare earth metal) doped CuS (La@CuS) at different compositions (0%, 1%, 3% and 5% of La) are synthesized by encapsulation of sodium alginate biopolymer using microwave irradiation method. The prepared various compositions of La@CuS are examined by structural characterizations, particle size and identifications of elements from XRD, TEM and EDX spectrum. The surface morphological studies are conformed by SEM and TEM images. Optical properties and characteristics peak are confirmed with UV, FTIR and Raman spectroscopic tools. In addition to that the electrochemical performances are studied using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) investigations. The specific capacitance is found to be 1329 F/g for 5% of La doped CuS nano spheres.
