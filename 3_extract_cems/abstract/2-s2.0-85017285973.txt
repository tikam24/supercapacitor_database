The battery type CuCo2O4 electrode was evaluated as a positive electrode material for its hybrid supercapacitor applications. CuCo2O4 flowers were prepared on Ni-foam through a simple hydrothermal process and post calcination treatment. The structure and morphology of the CuCo2O4 flowers/Ni-foam was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy. FESEM clearly revealed the flower-like morphology, which was composed of large number of petals. The length and width of the petals ranged from approximately 5–8 μm and approximately 50–150 nm, respectively. The CuCo2O4 flowers/Ni-foam electrode was employed for electrochemical characterization for hybrid supercapacitor applications. The specific capacity of the CuCo2O4 flower-like electrode was 692.4C g−1 (192.3 mA h g−1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The flower-like CuCo2O4 electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacity of 645.1C g−1 (179.2 mA h g−1) at a specific current of 1 A g−1 and good long term cyclic stability. The high specific capacity, good cyclic stability, and low internal and charge transfer resistance of the CuCo2O4 flowers/Ni-foam electrode confirmed the suitability of the prepared material as a positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitor applications.
