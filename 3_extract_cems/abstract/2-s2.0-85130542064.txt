Two-dimensional (2D) V2 C MXene has fascinating potential for use as electrodes in high-energy-density supercapacitors because of its excellent electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. However, it is not feasible to synthesize V2 C by etching vanadium carbon aluminide (V2 AlC) with hydrofluoric acid, which is commonly used for preparing other MXenes. In this work, a modified method is developed for synthesizing high-quality 2D V2 C. A mixture of sodium fluoride (NaF) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) was used as the etching agent, where V2 AlC can be gently etched by a hydrothermal reactor-assisted method. As electrode materials for supercapacitors, V2 C shows the characteristics of electric double layer capacitance. The electrochemical results show high specific capacitance (223.5 F/g in 1 M Na2 SO4 at a current density of 100 mA/g) and good cycling stability (the capacitance retention rate can be maintained at 94.7% after 5000 cycles). This work provides a new method for the synthesis of high-quality V2 C for application in related fields.
