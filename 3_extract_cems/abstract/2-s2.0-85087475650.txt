Here, cerium (IV) molybdate nanoparticles (CeMo2O8) are anchored on the surface of an N, P co-doped reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite by a stepwise sonochemical approach and further investigated as an electrode for supercapacitors. The cerium (IV) molybdate/N, P co-doped reduced graphene oxide symmetric electrode exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 638 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1. The prominent electrochemical capacitive properties of nanocomposite electrode are attributed to the merits of high electrically conductive N, P co-doped reduced graphene oxide and short ion transport channels provided by CeMo2O8 nanoparticles together with the synergistic effect between the two combinations. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor based on CeMo2O8/N, P co-doped reduced graphene oxide electrodes demonstrates a high energy density (29.7 W h kg−1 at 500 W kg−1), good power density (16,000 W kg−1 at 14.3 W h kg−1), and remarkable cycling stability (102.9% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 100 mV s−1). The results clearly show that co-doping small amounts of N and P onto the reduced graphene oxide, through a simple impregnating method, significantly improves the supercapacitive performance of the nanocomposite electrode.
