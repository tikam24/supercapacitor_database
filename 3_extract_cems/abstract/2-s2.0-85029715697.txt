Sphere-feature MoSe2 has been synthesized by using a facile hydrothermal method. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared materials have been investigated for supercapacitors. Electrochemical measurements show that MoSe2 spheres exhibit a specific capacitance of 243 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and still kept 90.3% capacitance after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g, indicating MoSe2 sphere could be a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
