Aerobic recovered carbon fibers (ARCFs) are chosen as functionalized support for both anodic MoO2 and cathodic MnO2 of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Based on the improved surface area, enhanced specific capacitance, and expanded potential window derived from O-containing radicals on the ARCF surface, the potentials of MoO2/ARCF anode and MnO2/ARCF cathode are respectively widened to -1.2 to 0 and 0-1.0 V, and thus the voltage range of ASC constructed by the MoO2/ARCF anode and MnO2/ARCF cathode is 2.2 V. In addition, this ASC exhibits a maximum energy density of 39.4 Wh kg-1 and power density of 5.5 kW kg-1 and owns 93.75% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to develop a high-performance energy-storage device by choosing a functionalized support.
