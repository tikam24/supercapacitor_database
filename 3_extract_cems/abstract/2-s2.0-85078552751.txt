Rational design of electrical active materials with high performance for energy storage and conversion is of great significance. Herein, Cu(NiCo)2S4/Ni3S4, a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical hollow heterostructured electrode material, is designed by etching the well-defined bimetal organic framework (MOF) via sequential in-situ ion-exchange processes. This trimetallic sulfides with unique structure provide large surface area, hierarchical pore distribution and enhanced electrical conductivity, can enrich the active sites for redox reactions, facilitate electrolyte penetration and rapid charge transfer kinetics. As a result, the Cu(NiCo)2S4/Ni3S4 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1320 F/g at 1 A/g and excellent rate performance (only 15% of capacitance is attenuated when the current density is increased by 20 times). Furthermore, a fabricated hybrid supercapacitor of Cu(NiCo)2S4/Ni3S4/AC can deliver a maximum energy density of 40.8 Wh/kg, remarkable power density of 7859.2 W/kg and superior cycling stability (85% retention of capacitance after 5000 cycles), demonstrating great potential for practical applications in energy storage and conversion devices.
