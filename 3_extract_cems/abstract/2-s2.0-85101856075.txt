High performance supercapacitor without binders has attracted wide attention as an energy storage device. In this work, novel NH4V4O10nanobelts were successfully synthesized and decorated into TiN nanotube arrays by a simple hydrothermal method. The as-prepared no-binder electrode hybrids exhibited excellent electrochemical performances with a specific capacitance of 749.0 F g−1at 5 mV s−1and a capacity retention of 85.7% after 200 cycles, which makes it an appealing candidate for electrode materials of supercapacitors.
