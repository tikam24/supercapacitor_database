Low cost porous carbon materials were produced from cheap polymer materials and graphene foam materials which were tested as a negative electrode material in an asymmetric cell configuration with Î±-MoO3 as a positive electrode. These materials were paired to maximize the specific capacitance and to extend the potential window, hence improving the energy density of the device. The asymmetrical device exhibits significantly higher energy density of 16.75 W h kg-1 and a power density of 325 W kg-1.
