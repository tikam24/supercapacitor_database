Energy storage materials are researchersâ€™ interest in recent times due to latest innovations in transportation, communication and electronics. Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors and hydrogen storage systems are the three primary energy storage systems which require active materials with high mechanical strength, porosity, high electrical and thermal conductivity and cyclability. 2D materials such as Graphene and MXenes are extensively gaining interest as electrode materials for energy storage and conversions, compositional materials, electromagnetic interference shielding amongst others. However, there is need to enhance on the pristine 2D materials for better efficiency. The construction of 2D to 3D nanoarchitectures can improve porosity, specific surface area, reduce stacking and ion and mass transport distance. The formation of nanocomposites or heterostructures with the 2D materials is also another interesting technology to improve on their properties and applications. In this review, we examined the synthesis route, the select properties and applications of 2D graphene and MXenes materials, however, the trend towards composite materials and 3D nanoarchitectures are more promising.
