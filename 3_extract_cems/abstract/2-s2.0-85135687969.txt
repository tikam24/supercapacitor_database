Energy storage technology using supercapacitor (SC) materials is crucial for continuous development to overcome the intermittent renewable energy sources. SC materials are required to exhibit specific characteristics of high-power density with long-term lifespan, excellent stability, fast charging, enhanced battery lifetime, and safety. In this work, nickel-doped V3O5 (VN) cathodes on a Ni-foam substrate are synthesized with a simple electrodeposition method to improve the energy storage technology by varying the current densities, reaction times, and electrolyte compositions. The as-prepared cathodes are identified with XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS analyses, and tested with electrochemical measurements such as CV, GCD, and EIS. The Ni dopant improves the specific capacity and energy density of V3O5, which has not been reported previously. XPS analysis confirmed that the existing Ni and V in the surfaces of after-used V3O5 were Ni2+/Ni3+ and V0/V3+/V4+, respectively. Those chemical states will generate surface substitutional defects, altering the metal charges and boosting the charge polarity of cathode during the Faradaic mechanism. Experimental results indicated the highest specific capacity of half cell was achieved at 5529 F/g with a current density of 1 A/g. Based on the stored charge, the calculated energy and power densities were 116.8 Wh/kg and 204.8 W/kg, respectively. In addition, the asymmetrical cell with an active carbon anode exhibited specific capacity, energy, and power densities at 428 F/g, 200 Wh/kg, and 1121 W/kg, respectively in KOH solution. This work has drawn a novel V3O5-based material with a superior energy storage property for the first time as an active material for the cathode in supercapacitor cells to advance the energy storage technology.
