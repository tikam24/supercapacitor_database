The demand for superior energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors, has been growing to meet the application requirements of hybrid vehicles and renewable energy systems. Here, we report a simple method to synthesize manganese chloride (MnCl2)-doped polyaniline (PANI)/single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) nanocomposites for electrochemical supercapacitors. The possible interactions between MnCl2 and both PANI and SWCNTs was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The morphological characteristics of the electrode materials were investigated by field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As-prepared nanocomposites showed higher electrical conductivity of 9.65 S/cm at room temperature and reached nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. A maximum specific capacitance of 546 F/g has been obtained for the nanocomposites at 0.5 A/g current density. Transition metal doping and SWCNTs enhance the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites. The better specific capacitance and charge/discharge rates make them promising candidates as electrodes in supercapacitors, combining high energy densities with high levels of power delivery.
