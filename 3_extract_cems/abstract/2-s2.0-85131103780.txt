The increase of renewable energy generation and the integration with the grid brings some difficulties on the power network worldwide. The main problems on the energy providers are surplus or unregulated energy generation like in partially cloudy or fully sunny days. The main faults on the consumer side can be surplus or unregulated energy demand and in such cases, storage requirements exist for this energy to regulate the energy demand and thereby having a hybrid energy system. In this paper, the focus is on the active power control using a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) on the energy generation side by applying bidirectional power converters and maximum power point tracking (MPPT)control using a boost converter. Supercapacitor (SC) technology is proposed in such a hybrid storage system. A photovoltaic powered hybrid system storing the energy in a battery, and an SC is used to solve the big problems in the source and load side. The HESS is designed using bidirectional converters, and the working principles are given. Also, control algorithms for bidirectional converters are investigated with a detailed literature review to define the best solution for the proposed system. The HESS is designed in MATLAB/Simulink using bidirectional converters and simulated for resistive, battery, SC loads, and also combinations of these loads. Further, a newly proposed power-sharing method is investigated to increase the amount of energy stored with SC. Simulation results of the proposed system given and examined to verify the applicability of the idea.
