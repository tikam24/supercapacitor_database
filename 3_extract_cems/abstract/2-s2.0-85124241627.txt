Fabrication of nanostructured electro-active materials with an ordered organization improved the overall performance of supercapacitor devices (SCDs). In this spirit, we developed Cu(OH)2 nano-flakes that were statistically ordered to resemble flowers. To increase the specific capacitance and kinetics of the electroactive sample, we employed ultra-sonication to fabricate a Cu(OH)2 nanocomposite with conductive and capacitive carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The textural and functional group analyses of the wet-chemically produced samples were completed using the XRD and FTIR techniques. I–V, FESEM, and EDX measurements Analyses of pure Cu(OH)2 and its CNT-based nanocomposites were conducted to evaluate the materials' electrical conductivity, morphology, and chemistry, respectively. The electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared material's electrodes were investigated, and the CNT-based nanocomposite electrode demonstrated an outstanding specific capacity (Csp) and a promising rate of performance. Our CNT-based nanocomposite had a Cs of 733 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 and dropped 8.7% after 4 × 103 cycles. The higher electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite are governed by the nano-flakes-like architecture of the Cu (OH)2 and the more conductive CNT matrix. According to the obtained findings, our manufactured Cu(OH)2/CNT based electrode has great promise for practical applications in next-generation supercapacitor, which are known to be very efficient.
