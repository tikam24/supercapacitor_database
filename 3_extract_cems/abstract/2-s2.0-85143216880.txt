Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXene) have emerged as a family of multifunctional materials due to the high electrical conductivity, good stability, abundant and tunable surface functional groups, showing competitive applications in energy storage and conversion. The surface functional groups and their Zeta negative potential properties facilitate the assembly of positively charged organic compounds between the MXene nanosheets to form a stable hybrid, which endow the MXene-based composite materials better electrochemical performance compared to the individual component. As such, this review exclusively highlights the development of organics/MXene-based composites and summarizes the various strategies for assembling or fabricating organics/MXene-based hybrid composites. Applications of these organics/MXene-based electrode materials in supercapacitors and batteries are also discussed in brief along with analysis of their excellent electrochemical performances and the charge storage mechanisms. Finally, some remaining challenging issues and future opportunities of organics/MXene composites as electrode materials for the high-power and low-cost rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors are also discussed.
