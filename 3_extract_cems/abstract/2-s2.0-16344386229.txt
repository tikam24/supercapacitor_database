Hydrous ruthenium-tin oxides (denoted as (Ru-Sn)O2· nH2O) were synthesized under a mild hydrothermal condition. The mean particles size of pristine RuO2·nH2O, smaller than 3 nm, was decreased with the introduction of Sn into the precursor solutions while it is not significantly affected by varying the Sn content. The textual characteristics of (Ru-Sn)O2·nH2O were analyzed through means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), electron diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). From the ideal capacitive behavior of pristine oxides with the Ru content ≥40 at.%, hydrothermal synthesis favored the formation of hydrous oxides with a novel structure providing excellent pathways for electron hopping and proton diffusion/exchange during the charge storage/delivery process. The introduction of tin oxide was demonstrated to successfully promote the utilization of oxyruthenium species, reaching a maximum CS,Ru of ca. 830 F/g for pristine Ru0.6Sn 0.4O2·nH2O (measured at 25 mV/s). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
