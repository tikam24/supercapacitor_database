An efficient, controllable, and facile two-step synthetic strategy to prepare graphene-based nanocomposites is proposed. A series of Fe3O4-decorated reduced graphene oxide (Fe3O4@RGO) nanocomposites incorporating Fe3O4 nanocrystals of various sizes were prepared by an ethanothermal method using graphene oxide (GO) and monodisperse Fe3O4 nanocrystals with diameters ranging from 4 to 10 nm. The morphologies and microstructures of the as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption measurements, and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that GO can be reduced to graphene during the ethanothermal process, and that the Fe3O4 nanocrystals are well dispersed on the graphene sheets generated in the process. The analysis of the electrochemical properties of the Fe3O4@RGO materials shows that nanocomposites prepared with Fe3O4 nanocrystals of different sizes exhibit different electrochemical performances. Among all samples, Fe3O4@RGO prepared with Fe3O4 nanocrystals of 6 nm diameter possessed the highest specific capacitance of 481 F/g at 1 A/g, highlighting the excellent capability of this material. This work illustrates a promising route to develop graphene-based nanocomposite materials with a wide range of potential applications. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
