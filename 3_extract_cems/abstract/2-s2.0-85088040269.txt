This article is dedicated to the production of composite materials based on carbon nanowalls (CNWs) and micro- and nanoparticles of metal oxides, which today can be used as materials for supercapacitor electrodes due to their high specific surface, mechanical and electrochemical wear resistance. Synthesis of CNWs on the surface of alumina and titanium oxide particles was carried out by chemical vapor deposition in the plasma of a radio-frequency (RF) capacitive discharge of a mixture of argon and methane gases. The obtained samples were examined by using a Quanta 3D (SEM, FEI, USA) scanning electron microscope and NThegra Spectra Raman spectroscope. After PECVD synthesis on aluminum and titanium oxides, the microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of the samples showed different results.
