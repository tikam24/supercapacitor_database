2D Materials have emerged as promising candidates for energy storage devices owing to their superior electrochemical properties, surface area, nano-device integration, multifunctionality, printability, and mechanical flexibility. Here, we summarize research aspects for different materials in the 2D category such as graphene and its derivatives, transition metal chalcogenides, transition metal oxides/hydroxides, transition metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides, and 2D polymers, used for supercapacitor applications. Apart from conventional techniques, this work briefly explores new aspects of synthesizing 2D materials beyond traditionally layered structures such as 2D metal oxides and polymers, broadening the vision for readers to explore novel material systems for enhanced supercapacitor performance.
