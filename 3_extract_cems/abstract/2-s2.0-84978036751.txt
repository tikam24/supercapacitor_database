We demonstrate high aspect ratio silicon nanorod arrays by cyclic deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) process as a scaffold to enhance the energy density of a Si-based supercapacitor. By unique atomic layer deposition (ALD) technology, a conformal nanolayer of TiN was deposited on the silicon nanorod arrays as the active material. The TiN coated silicon nanorods as a supercapacitor electrode lead to a 6 times improvement in capacitance compared to flat TiN film electrode.
