Time constants of supercapacitors are in the range of 100mS to tens of seconds compared to the time durations of power line transients, which are usually within a few hundred microseconds. Therefore supercapacitors should withstand short duration surges with energy values specified in IEEE C62-41 series and IEC 61400-4-5 and similar standards. After experimentally confirming this useful property of supercapacitors, new topologies for supercapacitor based surge-resistant uninterruptible power supplies were developed. Paper summarizes the approach to developing suitable topologies for surge-resistant UPS systems based on supercapacitor energy circulation techniques, despite the lower continuous DC voltage ratings of commercial supercapacitors.
