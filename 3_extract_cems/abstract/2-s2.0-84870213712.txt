With the direct carbonization using polyaniline/activated mesocarbon microbead (PANI/ACMB) composites as the precursor and subsequent activation treatment with 16 M HNO3, the activated nitrogen-enriched novel carbons (a-NENCs) can be prepared. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm at 77 K are utilized to characterize the structure, morphology and physicochemical properties of the a-NENCs. The result shows that the a-NENCs keep the original leechee-like morphology of the PANI/ACMB composites. The supercapacitive performances of the a-NENCs are investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cycle life measurements in 6 M KOH. The results based on galvanostatic charge/discharge tests demonstrate that the maximum specific capacitance of the a-NENCs electrode is 385 F g-1. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance of the button supercapacitor using a-NENCs as electrode active material is as high as 89.5 F g-1 at the charge/discharge current density of 500 mA g-1. These remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high performance, environmentally friendly and low-cost electrical energy-storage devices based on this new material.
