In this article, we propose a simple redox process to in-situ create a cellular architecture on Ni solid sheet by the direct oxidization (O2) and subsequent reduction (H2) at 750 Â°C. Nanocrystalline Ni(OH)2 is fabricated on the micro-porous Ni sheet (MPNS) using cathodic electrodeposition method to form a MPNS-Ni(OH)2 electrode for supercapacitor. The obtained results indicate that the created micro-porous architectures expand the contact interfaces between the Ni(OH)2 and Ni substrate and enhance its supercapacitor performance and cyclic stability.
