Herein, the hydrothermal method is used to synthesize microrod-like morphology of calcium phosphate (Ca2P2O7). The prepared electrode manifests a high specific capacitance of 1174.5 Fg−1 and a specific capacity of 807.5 Cg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. Finally, the potential supercapacitor electrode material shows a maximum power density of 1855.7 W kg−1 and an energy density of 55.23 Wh kg−1 at the current densities of 5 and 0.5 Ag−1, respectively with the three-electrode system. While, the two-electrode system exhibits a maximum power density of 1330.9 W kg−1 and an energy density of 11.7 Wh kg−1 at the current densities of 5 and 1 Ag−1, respectively. The electrode exhibits higher lifetime capacitance retention of 88.74% after 5000 cycles. The b value lies within the range of 0.68–1, which is suitable for both batteries and supercapacitors for transport application.
