This study investigates the effectiveness of CoS2/PPy nanocomposites as electrode materials for supercapacitors. We performed a simple and effective one-step hydrothermal fabrication of these nanostructures on nickel foam as substrate. After accurate characterization, electrochemical studies were performed using various techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The result shows excellent electrochemical behaviour of the synthesized electrode with a specific capacitance of 605.2 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, considerable capacitance retention (∼90.9% after 5000 cycles) was obtained. Next, an asymmetric supercapacitor was developed using a prepared electrode and activated carbon (AC /Ni foam) as cathode and anode, respectively. The device showed a high specific energy of 88.07 Wh kg−1 with a significant power of 4.95 kW kg−1 at an operating voltage of These unexpected results indicate that the CoS2/PPy nanostructure has the potential to become a promising electrode for energy storage systems.
