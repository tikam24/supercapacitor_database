The electrical properties of composite materials based on polyether electrolyte and carbon black have been studied by impedance spectroscopy. Flexible electrochemical capacitors using these composites as active electrode material in association with large area collectors have been built and tested. The influence of the introduction of dispersants and the acid treatment of the carbon surface in the total conductivity, capacitance and electrochemical stability of the composites and devices was evaluated. The performance of the capacitors was characterized by impedance spectroscopy, chronocoulomety and long term cycling tests. The device prepared with composite electrodes containing 10 wt% of carbon black exhibited a capacity of 2,9 Fcm -3 and good stability after 1000 charge / discharge cycles.
