A mechanically-stable non-aqueous proton-conducting gel polymer electrolyte that is based on methacrylate monomers, is considered here for application in solid-state type supercapacitors. An electrochemical cell using activated carbon as active materials and the new gel polymer electrolyte has been characterized at room temperature using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle tests as well as impedance spectroscopy. The use of phosphoric acid ester (instead of phosphoric acid) as a proton donor has led to an increase of both the operation voltage window (up to 1.3 V) and the electrolyte ionic conductivity (on the level of an order of magnitude). The resulting double layer capacitance of the microporous activated carbon was found to be as high as 120 F g-1; even more important, the supercapacitor utilizing non-aqueous proton-conducting gel polymer electrolyte is well-behaved in the wide temperature range (namely, from -40 to 80 Â°C).
