This article deals with the creation of a power supply system of wireless sensors which take measurements and transmit data at time intervals, the duration of which is considerably less than the activation period of sensors. The specific feature of the power supply system is the combined use of devices based on various physical phenomena. Electrical energy is generated by thermoelectrochemical cells. The temperature gradient on the sides of these cells is created by a vortex tube. A special boost DC/DC converter provides an increase in the output voltage of thermoelectrochemical cells up to the voltage that is necessary to power electronic devices. A supercapacitor is used to store energy in the time intervals between sensor activation. A study of an experimental sample of the power supply system for wireless sensors was conducted. Using the model in MATLAB + Simulink program, the possibility and conditions for creating the considered system for a particular type of wireless sensor were shown.
