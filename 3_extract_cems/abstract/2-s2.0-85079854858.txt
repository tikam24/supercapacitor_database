The charging efficiency of supercapacitor under different charging methods is analyzed by using the improved RC model of supercapacitor. A photovoltaic cell charging system for supercapacitor based on Boost cascade Buck converter (BOCBB) is proposed. The former Boost converter is connected to the photovoltaic power generation system, and the conductance increment method is used to track the maximum power point of the photovoltaic cell. The latter Buck converter uses a segmented charging strategy to charge the supercapacitor. Based on this circuit, a complete control method for the supercapacitor charging system is proposed. Finally, the charging efficiency of supercapacitor by photovoltaic cells under different lighting conditions is simulated and analyzed.
