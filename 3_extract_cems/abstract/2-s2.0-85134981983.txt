In this paper, five compounds were synthesized by hydrothermal method by employing morpholine derivatives with different N sites and numbers. These five compounds are [MII(HL1)(H2O)2][(H2Mo12O40)0.5] (M = Co(1), Ni(2)), [MII(HL2)2(H2O)2](β-Mo8O26)] (M = Cu(3), Ni(4), Zn(5)), respectively (L1 = 4-[2-(5-Pyridin-2-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl)-ethyl]-morpholine, L2 = 4-[2-(5-Pyrazin-2-yl-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl)-ethyl]-morpholine). These compounds were characterized through single crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR and PXRD. Compounds 1 and 2 are isomorphic and have a rare [Mo12O40]8- unit. The adjacent [Mo12O40]8- units are connected by bi-nuclear subunits [M2II(L1)2]4+ (M = Co/Ni) to form a 1D structure. Compounds 3–5 are isostructural owning 1D metal–organic chains. The [β-Mo8O26]4- anions are dissociative. Compounds 1–5 can be employed as electrochemical sensors to identify NO2− anions, Cr(VI) cations. In addition, compound 4 has larger capacitance and can be used as a super capacitor. Compounds 1–5 can not only be employed as catalysts for photodegradation of organic dyes, but also as catalysts for photoreduction of Cr(VI), which owns good selectivity.
