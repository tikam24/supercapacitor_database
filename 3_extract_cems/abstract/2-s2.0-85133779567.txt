This article presents an efficient and fast echelon battery equalization method based on wide voltage range bidirectional converter combined with DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) clustering control strategy. Thanks to the wide voltage range and bidirectional buck-boost characteristics of the four-switch bidirectional converter, the battery energy can be reasonably redistributed between the battery and the super capacitor. The converter operating in synchronous rectification mode can not only achieve bidirectional energy flow in a wide voltage range, but also has a high energy conversion efficiency. The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is used to divide all battery cells into groups, and each group may contain one or more adjacent and nonadjacent battery cells. First, the nonadjacent single cells are balanced and integrated into adjacent group with the closest voltage. Then, the groups with different voltages are balanced by group-to-group, thereby realizing rapid balance of the entire battery pack. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, simulations and experimental verification were carried out. The experimental results show that, comparing with traditional battery balancing methods, the proposed method achieves shorter balancing time and higher balancing efficiency.
