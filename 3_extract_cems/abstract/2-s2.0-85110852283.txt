The electric vehicles (EVs), as promising components of sustainable and eco-friendly transportation systems, are being widely adopted to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel and the pollution of environments. EVs are usually equipped with wireless communication modules to support the vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications, and thus an electric vehicular network (EVN) is constituted. However, the electric energy of EVs is extremely limited, and some EVs are possible to exhaust their electric energy before reaching the destinations. More seriously, when the EVs travel into the zones without any charging stations, they cannot be timely charged. With the rapid developments of wireless charging technologies (such as magnetic resonance) and graphene supercapacitor technologies, the reciprocal charges between EVs become feasible, i.e., the EVs with insufficient energy (IEVs) can be charged by the EVs with surplus energy (SEVs). In this paper, the strategies of selecting the local-optimal SEVs for IEVs and rescheduling their travel routes are investigated, and a distributed Reciprocal Charging Mechanism (RCM) is proposed. Both mechanism analysis and simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority of RCM. Specifically, with the proposed reciprocal charging mechanism, IEVs can be charged by SEVs in a charging-station-Absent zone, and the electric energy consumption can be approximatively minimized.
