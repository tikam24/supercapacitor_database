Nanocrystalline molybdenum trioxide has been synthesized by solution combustion method. The combustion temperatures during synthesis played a crucial role in controlling the microstructure, morphology and hence the electrochemical performance. The structural phase transformation from monoclinic β-MoO3 to single phase orthorhombic α-MoO3 has been observed by increasing the combustion temperature from 200 °C to 500 °C. The SEM and TEM images confirm that the samples synthesized at 500 °C are of nanorod-like structure with a size of about 50 nm dia and few microns long. These one-dimensional α-MoO3 nanorods exhibited high specific capacitance of 176 F/g with good cycle stability.
