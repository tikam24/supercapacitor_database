Advanced carbon with great surface properties and structural features has been regarded as the valuable electrodes materials of high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, the SWCNTs/phthalocyanine polymer composite derived self-nitrogen-doped graphene-like porous carbon (SPCM) are synthesized via a simple solution blending and mechanical stirring. Because of the π-π interaction between metal-free phthalocyanine polymer and SWCNTs at the interface, the phthalocyanine polymer grows along the framework of the SWCNTs, resulting in the phthalocyanine polymer is pyrolyzed to form a graphene -like layered structure. In addition, the phthalocyanine polymer has the intrinsic characteristics of nitrogen-rich, thus the SPCM obtained pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, and graphitic-N functional groups derived from self-nitrogen-doping, which contribute to the increased electronic conductivity and surface electrochemically active sites of SPCM. Finally, the SPCM as electrode show an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 228 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent stability (retaining 93% of the capacitance after 2000 cycles).
