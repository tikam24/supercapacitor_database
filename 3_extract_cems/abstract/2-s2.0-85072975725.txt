Advances in multi-electron transfer materials and architectured electrodes are two important strategies for innovations in electrochemicalenergy storage. The attainment of both by interfacial electrodeposition of freestanding PPy-PEDOT copolymer films was reported. The composition of the copolymer was verified by FTIR and XPS spectra. The dispersion and microstructure of PPy and PEDOT were studied by EDX mapping and SEM. The capacitive performances of the copolymer films were studied by electrochemical measurements. The results show the copolymer film is composed of PPy and PEDOT with homogeneous distribution in a certain proportion. The SEM images show the film exhibits heterogeneous microstructure and has an open porous 3D network microstructure. Electrochemical characterization shows that the copolymer film is an excellent supercapacitor electrode material with high specific capacitance, good power capability and cycle performance. The multi-electron transfer nature of the copolymer, the copolymerization synergistic effects and the unique microstructure are responsible for the improved charge-discharge performances.
