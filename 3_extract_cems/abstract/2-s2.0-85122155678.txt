Conducting polyaniline materials have attracted extensive interests as the promising electrodes in electrochemical supercapacitor for easy to synthesis, low cost etc. Whereas, polyaniline commonly suffers from the structure degradation and attenuation in the long-term cycling. In this paper, the ternary activated carbon cloth/MnO2/polyaniline composites are rationally prepared via the electrodeposition technique to enhance the cycle stability and capacitance capability. Meanwhile, the function of deposition time/cycle on the surface distribution and electrochemical performances is explored. The carbon cloth/MnO2/polyaniline-30 sample with abundant nanofibers exhibits a uniform layered structure, delivers an optimized specific gravimetric capacitance of up to 728.7 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, while still presents excellent rate capability with specific capacitance of 620.2 F g−1 at 2 A g−1. Moreover, the capacitance retention of carbon cloth/MnO2/polyaniline-30 sample maintains 87% after 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The glorious electrochemical performances of carbon cloth/MnO2/polyaniline-30 sample not only benefits from the uniform porous nanofiber structure of polyaniline providing more sites for the redox reaction, but also the contribution of MnO2 interfacial layer, generating the synergistic effect. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 128.2 F g−1 at 2.0 A g−1, surpassing most of the reported polyaniline-based supercapacitors.
