An electrode was made using a mixture of graphene powder, epoxy resin, and activated carbon, each of which was 10mg, 1 drop, and 2g. The aim of this research is to determine the effect of graphene-coated electrode capacitance on laminating paper and to investigate their electrochemical performances capacitance of supercapacitors with and without the graphene layer. In this case, we used charging and discharging methods to analysis the capacitance of supercapacitors with and without graphene layer. Based on the charging and usage method, capacitance values with and without graphene are obtained: 16.0 mF and 4.16 mF, respectively. As the usage time with and without graphene obtained was 500 seconds and 8 seconds, the supercapacitor energy storage devices with high specific capacitance was achieved.
