Nanomaterial are being adapted into a number of applications across multiple domains such as cosmetics, optical components, biology, physics, chemistry, polymer science, pharmaceutical drug manufacture, toxicology, and mechanical engineering. Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and its derivatives are widely used in industry as specific alloy and catalyst applications, electrochemical capacitors, display devices, sensors, smart windows, lubricants, battery electrodes, etc. Nanoparticles of MoO3 were synthesized using the salvo thermal method and synthesized MoO3 nanoparticles were characterized by using UV-Visible, XRD, SEM, and cyclic voltammetry analysis techniques at different temperatures. XRD analysis show that particle size increases as its temperature increases and the corresponding strain decreases also. SEM morphology shows its nanorods structure.
