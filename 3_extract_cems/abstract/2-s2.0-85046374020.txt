An on-chip microsupercapacitor (MSC) pattern is obtained by layer-by-layer spray deposition of both manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticle-coated carbon nanotubes (MnO2-CNTs) and MnO2 nanosheet-decorated reduced graphene oxide (MnO2-rGO) on mechanically robust, flexible polyethylene terephthalate. Layer-by-layer patterning of MSC electrodes offers rapid in-plane diffusion of electrolyte ions in electrodes the layered electrode and hence ultrahigh capacitance and energy density of 7.43 mF/cm2 (32300 mF/cm3) and 0.66 μW h/cm2 (2870 μW h/cm3), respectively, are obtained. A robust electrochemical response was measured under multiple bending of the solid-state flexible MSC as well as under repetitive cycles (∼5000).
