Research in modern helicopters is targeted into the increase of their efficiency due to economical and ecological pressures. This paper introduces two innovative methods of absorbing a ratio of the energy remains of the main engine exhaust gases and converting it to electrical energy. The recovered power is then injected to the electrical bus of the helicopter through power electronics converters. The first one uses thermoelectric generators whereas the second one an electromechanical generator. Both of these systems are analyzed, candidate power converter configurations and topologies are depicted and the results of simulations using SABER are evaluated. Â© 2012 IEEE.
