Fabrication and designing advanced porous structures are effective methods to enhance the electrochemical performance of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) for supercapacitor applications. Here, we have developed ternary metal oxide MOFs prepared by a simple chemical bath deposition method. Firstly, a chemical bath deposition process was used to fabricate ZnxCo3−xO4 petal-like nano particles (NPs). So, their structural electrochemical properties were investigated to identify the influence of metal cation contents. Then ternary metal oxides MOFs are synthesized. These binder-free Cu–Zn1.5Co1.5O4 petal-like composite electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance. Its maximum reachable specific capacitance is 330 F/g at 1 A/g. The excellent electrochemical performance of the petal-like electrodes may be attributed to the intrinsic nature of ternary metal oxide MOFs and the porous petal-like morphologies that provide enough space for the storage and diffusion of the electrolyte.
