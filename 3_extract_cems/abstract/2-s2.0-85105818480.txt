Metal doping MnO2 has better electrochemical performance than pure MnO2. We have demonstrated a facile approach for synthesizing Mg-doped MnO2@ carbon cloth via a typical hydrothermal reaction. The intercalation of Mg2+ rapidly increases the operating window to 1.2 V. Compared to other metal ions (Co2+, Fe3+, Bi2+, Al3+, Cr2+) doping, Mg2+ doping further increases the lattice defects of MnO2, achieving more vacancies, and effectively improving the performance of MnO2. As a flexible symmetric solid supercapacitor (FSSSC), the voltage window can be extended to 2.2 V, and the energy density of FSSSC reaches 2.06 mW h/cm3 at 43.94 mW/cm3. The device can illuminate a 2.2 V LED successfully, showing its huge actual application value.
