This paper studies a Ni-based metal-organic framework (Ni-MOF) composite to identify its electrochemical properties when applied to supercapacitors (SCs). The composite contains reduced graphene oxide (rGO) used as the matrix and polyaniline (PANI) to enhance the pseudocapacitance for electrochemical SC's fabrication. An excellent specific capacitance (204 F/g at 0.5A/g) and retention (81% after 5000 cycles) are obtained.
