A biomimetic method has been used for the electrodeposition of carbon nanotubes (NTs) and composite films using a commercial bile acid. Thin films of deoxycholic acid (DCH) were prepared potentiodynamically and galvanostatically from deoxycholic acid sodium salt (DCNa) solutions. The anodic deposition yield has been investigated at different DCNa concentrations. The electrodeposition mechanism involved electromigration of anionic DC- species, local pH reduction at the anode, and precipitation of DCH. It was found that DCNa allowed excellent dispersion of NTs in water. The use of DCNa as a multifunctional agent for NTs dispersion, charging, and binding allowed electrodeposition of NTs and composite MnO2-NTs films. The MnO2-NTs composites were used for charge storage applications in supercapacitors. The MnO2-NTs electrodes showed good capacitive behavior. DCNa is a promising charging dispersant for NTs dispersion and manufacturing of other composites by electrochemical methods.
