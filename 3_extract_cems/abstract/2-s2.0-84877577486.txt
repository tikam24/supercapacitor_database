This work reports the concentration-dependent electrochemical supercapacitor performance change of electrodeposited Fe2O 3 thin films. Structural elucidation and morphological evolution studies are operated in the first stage and in second, electrochemical supercapacitive performances are investigated. The maximum specific capacitance of 540 F/g at 2.5 A/g in 1 M KOH is obtained. The electric parameters including specific energy, specific power and coulomb efficiency are measured using charge/discharge technique and finally, electrochemical impedance measurement is examined for knowing the internal charge transfer resistance. An equivalent circuit associated with the cell, with required parameters, is also designed. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
