High specific surface area activated carbon derived from coconut shell was prepared using low-temperature carbonization followed by KOH activation method. The resulting activated carbon exhibited excellent supercapacitance performance with an obtained specific capacitance of 325 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1. Moreover, the supercapacitor electrodes retained 71% of the initial capacitance at elevated current densities of 100 A g-1 and 89% after 10000 cycles when tested in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Also, the equivalent series resistance of the system was recorded to be only 0.36 O. Meanwhile, testing of the supercapacitor electrodes in ionic liquid based-electrolyte delivered substantial specific capacitance of 198 F g-1 and an ultrahigh power density of 74.2 kW kg-1.
