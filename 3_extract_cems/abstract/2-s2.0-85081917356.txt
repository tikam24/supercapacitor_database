Polyaniline (PANI) film synthesized by cyclic voltammetry method. Rectangular strip of stainless steel (SS) is used to construct low cost electrode for Supercapacitors. PANI films are characterized by Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Chemical structure and electronic behavior of PANI film is carried out by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical performance of PANI film carried out by cyclic voltammetry in 1M H2SO4 giving specific capacitance of 346 Fg-1 at sweep rate 10 mVs-1 with 63% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at sweep rate 100 mVs-1.
