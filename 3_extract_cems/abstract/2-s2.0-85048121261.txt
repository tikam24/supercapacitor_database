In this work, a novel NiO/Co3O4 nanoheterostructure was fabricated via a simple pyrolysis treatment of nickelocene (NiCp2) filled ZIF-67. With remarkable structural features, the obtained NiO/Co3O4 hybrids exhibit high specific capacitance of 405 F g-1 at 1 A g−1 and high cycling stability (97.4% after 1000 cycles at 15 A g−1). Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) were fabricated using the NiO/Co3O4 heterostructure as the positive electrode and active carbon as negative electrode. The operation voltage of ASCs is expanded to 1.5 V in aqueous electrolyte, revealing high energy density (23.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.75 kW kg−1) and high capacitance retention (97.9% after 1000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance of the NiO/Co3O4 nanoheterostructure was attributed to its special hierarchical nanoarchitecture, in which the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and NiO to supply more pathways for accelerating fast electron and ion transfer. This functionalized MOF-driven strategy pave the way to the preparation of various metal oxide nanoheterostructures by varying the type of MOFs and fillers.
