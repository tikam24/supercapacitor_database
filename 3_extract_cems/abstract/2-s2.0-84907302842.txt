This paper proposes the basic average model and the design of the control system for the Half Bridge Current Source (HBCS) Bidirectional DC to DC Converter. This converter is intended to interface a High Voltage DC link and a Low Voltage DC Storage Device in transportation applications. Firstly, the basics of the converter operation, high-level control and the simplified modeling are presented. Then, a cascaded control approach for the whole system is discussed and validated through simulations. Â© 2014 IEEE.
