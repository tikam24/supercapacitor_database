This present study reported the synthesis of a high specific capacity supercapacitors (SCs) carrying a unique porous Ni foam substrate with a novel NiCo2S4 electrode by a simplistic hydrothermal technique. Considered on the physical profile properties, the architecture of NiCo2S4 material delivered abundant electroactive sites, rapid discharge/charge transport and bettermost electrical conduciveness, which provide rise to improved electrochemical performance for better-scale SCs. Meanwhile, the electrochemical profile properties of the as-grown NiCo2S4 material clearly showed a battery-profile redox reaction, which has been distinct from the characterization of carbon-based source products. The battery-profile NiCo2S4 sample gained notable electrochemical performance activities, namely marvelous SCs performance with a excellent specific capacity of ~154.13 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1, higher rate capabilities with ~92.5% of capacity retention at 15 A g−1, and interested cycling performance with ~95.2% of capacity retention at 4 A g−1 after 5000 long-cycles. Therefore, regarding this achieved results, the as-constructed NiCo3S4 was a notable efficient profile for SCs candidate and will have an effectively serving in different advanced energy storage devices.
