In this paper, Super twisting sliding mode control is proposed for the control of a fully active battery-super capacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for electric vehicles. The control parameters are, battery current, super capacitor current. These parameters are regulated using a DC-DC converter on both battery and super capacitor sides. A super twisting algorithm is designed to maintain the currents of both the battery and the super capacitor to their reference values. Battery reference current is generated by a rule based energy management system (RBS) and the super capacitor reference current is generated by Lyapunov stability algorithm which provides DC bus voltage regulation. Simulation results shows that controllers follow the reference values with different power conditions.
