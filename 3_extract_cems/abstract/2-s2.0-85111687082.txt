It is still a challenge to improve the electronic conductivity and expose more active sites of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Herein, the fishbone-like Ni3S2/Co3S4 grown on nickel foam (NCS/NF) was employed as a conductive support for in-situ growing nickel MOF (NiMOF) nanosheets to enhance their electrochemical properties. The as-prepared NiMOF@Ni3S2/Co3S4/NF (NiMOF@NCS/NF) exhibited a high areal specific capacity of 8.7C cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, and the capacity retention remains 65% at 50 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the assembled NiMOF@NCS/NF//AC hybrid supercapacitor achieves an intriguing energy density of 58.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 781.3 W kg−1, and the capacity retention remains 96.2% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. The prominent electrochemical performance of NiMOF@NCS/NF can be ascribed to the remarkable electronic conductivity and specific capacity of Ni3S2/Co3S4 composites coupled with their three-dimensional porous structure.
