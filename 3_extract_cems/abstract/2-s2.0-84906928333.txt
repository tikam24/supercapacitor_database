The pulsed laser welding temperature field for supercapacitor shell structure was analyzed by FEM. The welding heat model parameterswere defined based on the macrostructure of the welded joint taken from the real component. The thermalconductivity andspecific heat were tested to obtain the thermodynamic parameter, respectively. Thehigh temperaturemechanical propertiesat 3 different temperatureswere tested, and the melting point is predicted to analyze the FEM calculation result. The result shows that the pulsed laser welding energy is more concentrated than that of arc welding, the core inside the supercapacitor and the rubber component will not be destroyed by high welding temperature during the whole welding process.
