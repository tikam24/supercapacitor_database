Flower-like NiCo2O4 nanostructures are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method free of any template and catalyst. X-ray powder diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and electrochemical tests are applied to study the structure and electrochemical properties of the material. The results indicate that NiCo2O4 flower-like nanowire array has diameters of about 10 μm, which consists of numerous nanowires with 150 nm of uniform diameters and about 5 μm of lengths. Electrochemical tests show that the discharge specific capacity is as high as 983.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, and the coulombic efficiencies keep above 98.5%. After 500 cycles, it also has higher capacity retention rate. The NiCo2O4 samples as electrode material for supercapacitors exhibits good capacity properties and cycle stability.
