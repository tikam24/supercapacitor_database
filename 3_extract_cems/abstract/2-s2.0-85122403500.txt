Exploring solid biopolymer electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and enhanced dielectric properties is of utmost importance for the development of high-performance supercapacitors. The present work reports on the charge carrier relaxation and transport properties of graphene oxide (GO)-grafted blended solid biopolymer electrolytes comprising chitosan (CS) and potato starch (PS), with LiClO4 as charge carriers and glycerol as a plasticizer. The GO-grafted blended CS/PS solid biopolymer nanocomposite electrolyte (SBNE) demonstrates a significant improvement in the ionic conductivity and dielectric constant as compared with that of GO-free solid electrolytes. This improvement is mainly attributed to the distribution of GO as an interconnected network throughout the SBNE, which aids in faster ion transport by acting as an “ionic highway.” The blended solid biopolymer composite with 9 wt.% GO exhibits maximum conductivity (~ 10−3 S/cm) along with fourfold mobility enhancement of the free ions. The ionic diffusion processes in the GO-grafted SBNE are analyzed based on the anomalous fractional diffusion model. The relaxation behavior of the charge carriers is highly non-exponential in these blended nanocomposite electrolytes. A hybrid solid-state supercapacitor is fabricated based on manganese-substituted cobalt ferrite (MnCoFeO4) nanocrystallites as electrode and GO-grafted CS/PS SBNE, which demonstrates high effective specific capacitance of ~ 288 Fg−1 with a 9 wt.% GO-grafted blended nanocomposite electrolyte.
