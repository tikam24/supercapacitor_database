The usages of electric vehicles (EVs) are increased drastically than IC engine based vehicles in order to protect the environment. During peak power requirement, to diminish the burden on the battery, Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is developed by combining battery with ultracapacitor (UC). HESS based electric vehicles always give better results than the only battery-fed electric vehicle. The transition between the energy sources according to the driving conditions is the key obstacle associated with HESS based EVs. The key objective of this work is to realize a new controller control strategy, to switch the battery and UC according to the electric vehicle requirement. Total four math functions are considered and programmed individually corresponding to the speed of an electric motor called as Math Function Based (MFB) controller, thereafter the designed MFB has combined with conventional controllers formed a new hybrid controller for switching the energy sources according to the speed of an electric motor. In this work battery gets charged from the solar power during sunlight available timings, in the same way, discharges the same amount ofpower to the electric motor. Acomparative analysis is done between two hybrid controllers named as MFB with PID and MFB with PI, based on different factors. All modes MATLAB/Simulation results are plotted and discussed.
