Mesoporous Au@MnO2 was fabricated via a facile self-decomposition process and is used as the electrode material for supercapacitors. Au@MnO2 electrode gave a high capacitance of 906.4 F g−1 with outstanding rate capability and excellent stability (97.2% of the original capacitance was retained after 5000 cycles). A two-electrode cell assembled by Au@MnO2 network and activated graphene oxide/Au mixture delivers an energy density of 62.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 1000 W kg−1.
