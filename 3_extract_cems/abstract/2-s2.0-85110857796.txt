In today's world rely on fossil fuels is the main energy, causing a series of ecological environment problems, people have to put attention to the renewable energy, including solar energy with its access to such advantages as low cost, relatively stable, clean particularly favoured by people, and perovskite high conversion efficiency of solar cells and solar cells that category. As a new type of energy storage element, supercapacitor has the advantages of high specific energy, good cycle stability and environmental friendliness compared with traditional capacitors, while polyvinyl alcohol is easy to process, easy to form film and low price. In this paper, a perovskite solar cell-supercapacitor integrated device preparation method is proposed, and its performance is studied and analysed.
