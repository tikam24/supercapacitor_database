Reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline/ Cu2O-SnO2 (5:2) nanocomposite was synthesised by facile in-situ one step chemical method. Its composition and structural morphology were characterized using powder-XRD, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The capacitive performances were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge – discharge(GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with 0.4 M H2SO4 and a mixture of 0.4 M H2SO4 and 0.4 M CH3SO3H (1:1) as electrolytes. The amelioration of electrochemical parameters was observed in the mixture of electrolytes. The specific capacitance of 230.41 F g–1, energy density of 46.08 W h kg–1, and power density of 1530.39 W kg–1 were obtained. The enhancement of the electrochemical properties was found to be about 20 % with the mixture of 0.4 M H2SO4 and 0.4 M CH3SO3H (1:1) over bare 0.4 M H2SO4.
