This study presents composite electrode materials based on Electrochemically Reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) and Ni-Cu Foam for supercapacitor applications. Constant potential (CP) method was used to form reduced graphene oxide on Ni-Cu foam and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-Ray Photoelectron Spectra (XPS), Raman Spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements. ERGO improves the electrical conduction leading to decrease of the internal resistance of the heterostructure. The ERGO served as a conductive network to facilitate the collection and transportation of electrons during the cycling, improved the conductivity of Ni-Cu foam, and allowed for a larger specific surface area. The irregular porous structure allowed for the easy diffusion of the electrolyte into the inner region of the electrode. Moreover, the nanocomposite directly fabricated on Ni-Cu foam with a better adhesion and avoided the use of polymer binder. This method efficiently reduced ohmic polarization and enhanced the rate capability. As a result, the Ni-Cu foam/ERGO nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 1259.3 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 and about 99.3% of the capacitance retained after 5000 cycles. The capacitance retention was about 3% when the current density increased from 2 A g −1 to 15 A g −1 . This two-step process drop cast and GO reduction by potentiostatic method is nontoxic and scalable and holds promise for improved energy density from redox capacitance in comparison with the conventional double layer supercapacitors.
