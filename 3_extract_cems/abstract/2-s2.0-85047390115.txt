To improve the energy and power densities of carbon-based supercapacitors, more attentions are currently focused on increasing the specific surface area and optimizing the pore size distribution of carbon materials. However, only few researchers are devoted to investigate the effect of surface treatment and electrolyte-wetting on the properties of supercapacitors. Here, phytic acid (PA) is selected as the medium to tune the wettability of graphene hydrogel (GH) to further investigate the effect of wettability on capacitance performance. The PA molecules on PA modified graphene hydrogel (PAGH) play a significant role in ion-inner diffusion and electrosorption onto electrically charged surface. The contribution of pseudocapacitance and double-layer capacitance increased with the content of PA due to the increased redox groups and enlarged electrolyte accessible area. Graphene electrodes with high mass loadings can be prepared by stamping the PAGH slices onto stainless steel mesh. These electrodes can further be assembled into wearable all-solid-state supercapacitors with high volumetric energy density (7.98 mWh cm−3 at 25 mW cm−3 and 5.63 mWh cm−3 at 2.5 W cm−3). In addition, the hydrogel slices can be used as the pixel elements for stamping desired patterns for wearable applications. It provides a new route to meliorate the capacitance performance of carbon-based all-solid-state supercapacitors.
