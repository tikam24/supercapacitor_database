A composite of V2O5 nanowires with reduced graphene oxide (V2O5-NW-G) has been prepared using facile hydrothermal method and tested for charge storage supercapacitor application. Morphological and structural aspects of as prepared materials has been studied using material characterization techniques like transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The nanosized wires like structure of V2O5 anchored on the graphene (rGO) sheets possesses improved electrical conductivity and high surface area. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials have been studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Composite (V2O5-NW-G) exhibits exceptional properties like high gravimetric capacitance of 1002 F g−1 along with good cyclic stability of 83.94% capacitance retention after 5000 repetitive GCD cycles. Excellent energy density of 116 Wh kg−1 has been obtained at the power density of 1520 W kg−1.
