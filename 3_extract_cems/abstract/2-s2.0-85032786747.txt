Interconnected meso/microporous activated carbons were prepared from pumpkin seeds using a simple chemical activation method. The porous carbon materials were prepared at different temperatures (PS-600, PS-700, PS-800, and PS-900) and demonstrated huge surface areas (645–2029 m2 g–1) with excellent pore volumes (0.27–1.30 cm3 g–1). The well-condensed graphitic structure of the prepared activated carbon materials was confirmed by Raman and X-ray diffraction analyses. The presence of heteroatoms (O and N) in the carbon materials was confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. High resolution transmission electron microscopic images and selected area diffraction patters further revealed the porous structure and amorphous nature of the prepared electrode materials. The resultant porous carbons (PS-600, PS-700, PS-800, and PS-900) were utilized as electrode material for supercapacitors. To our delight, the PS-900 demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance (Cs) of 303 F g–1 in 1.0 M H2SO4 at a scan rate of 5 mV. The electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed the poor electrical resistance of the electrode materials. Moreover, the stability of the PS-900 was found to be excellent (no significant change in the Cs even after 6000 cycles).
