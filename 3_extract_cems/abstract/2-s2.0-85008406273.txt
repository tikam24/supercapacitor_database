Herein, we introduce a facile, inexpensive and fast, and additive-/template-free method to fabricate highly stable nickel hydroxide nanofibers for supercapacitor applications. Ni(OH)2 nanofibers were electrodeposited on electro-etched carbon fiber paper by a potential step method (Ni(OH)2-ECFs) and characterized using scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Electrochemical performance of Ni(OH)2-ECF was studied in symmetric two-electrode assembly by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge method, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A specific capacitance of 277.5 F g−1 was achieved for the symmetric supercapacitor based on two identical Ni(OH)2-ECFs. Our findings demonstrate high-rate capability with excellent stability (approximately 100 % capacitance retention) for Ni(OH)2-ECF supercapacitor, originated from the intimate contact between Ni(OH)2 and ECF. Our studies suggest the Ni(OH)2-ECF electrode as an excellent material for supercapacitor applications.
