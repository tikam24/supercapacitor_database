Freestanding carbon-based hybrids, specifically carbon nanotube@3D graphene (CNTs@3DG) hybrid, are of great interest in electrochemical energy storage. However, the large holes (about 400 µm) in the commonly used 3D graphene foams (3DGF) constitute as high as 90% of the electrode volume, resulting in a very low loading of electroactive materials that is electrically connected to the carbon, which makes it difficult for flexible supercapacitors to achieve high gravimetric and volumetric energy density. Here, a hierarchically porous carbon hybrid is fabricated by growing 1D CNTs on 3D graphene aerogel (CNTs@3DGA) using a facile one-step chemical vapor deposition process. In this architecture, the 3DGA with ample interconnected micrometer-sized pores (about 5 µm) dramatically enhances mass loading of electroactive materials comparing with 3DGF. An optimized all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (AASC) based on MnO2@CNTs@3DGA and Ppy@CNTs@3DGA electrodes exhibits high volumetric energy density of 3.85 mW h cm−3 and superior long-term cycle stability with 84.6% retention after 20 000 cycles, which are among the best reported for AASCs with both electrodes made of pseudocapacitive electroactive materials.
