Aircraft monitoring systems offer enhanced safety, reliability, reduced maintenance cost, and improved overall flight efficiency. Advancements in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are enabling unprecedented data acquisition functionalities, but their applicability is restricted by power limitations, as batteries require replacement or recharging and wired power adds weight and detracts from the benefits of wireless technology. In this article, energy autonomous WSN is presented for monitoring the structural current in aircraft structures. A hybrid inductive/Hall sensing concept is introduced demonstrating 0.5-A resolution, <2% accuracy, and frequency independence, for a 5-100-A rms, dc 800-Hz current, and frequency range, with 35-mW active power consumption. An inductive energy harvesting power supply with magnetic flux funneling, reactance compensation, and supercapacitor storage is demonstrated to provide 0.16 mW of continuous power from the 65-Î¼T rms field of a 20-A rms, 360-Hz structural current. A low-power sensor node platform with a custom multimode duty cycling network protocol is developed, offering cold-starting network association and data acquisition/transmission functionality at 50- and 70-Î¼W average powers, respectively. WSN level operation for 1 min for every 8 min of energy harvesting is demonstrated. The proposed system offers a unique energy autonomous WSN platform for aircraft monitoring.
