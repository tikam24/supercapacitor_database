This paper describes three different strategies for supercapacitor discharge which differ from each other in that one of the following parameters is constant: discharge current; discharge power; discharge power part that is not lost due to internal resistance of supercapacitors. The efficiencies of the strategies are compared with each other by performing computer simulations. However, the simulation results correspond to idealized cases, so examples of supercapacitor discharge experiments with constant discharge current and constant discharge power are also presented, the results of which are compared with the results of simulations of the same situations.
