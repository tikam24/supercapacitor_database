The main challenges associated with the electrode material of a supercapacitor are costly synthesis processes and low energy density. To overcome those challenges, herein we report a quick co-precipitation method for the synthesis of a ternary composite using nickel oxide, manganese oxide, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an electrode material. The microscopic structure and morphological characterization of the material were confirmed using x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and field-emission transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of the electrode material was studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge tests; for the ternary composite, the obtained power density was 810 W Kg−1 and the energy density was 45 Wh Kg−1. The specific capacitance of rGO, NiO-Mn2O3, and NiO-Mn2O3@rGO were 524 F g−1, 162 F g−1, and 442 F g−1, respectively. The results showed that the incorporation of rGO with metal oxides led to high electrode performance. Hence, the synthesis method can be adopted for scalable processes to fabricate electrode material for supercapacitors.
