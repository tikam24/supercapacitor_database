Energy storage is a persistent problem. Electrical energy storage is also a critical issue in many portable appliances or systems. Battery technology is well established but comes with certain disadvantages with respect to life and maintenance. Supercapacitor is a latest addition in electrical energy storage devices. Supercapacitor is a pulse current device which can be used in many applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy sources, defenceetc. Selection of stacked and rolled type supercapacitor plays an important role in its effective use in many applications. Prototypes of these two types of supercapacitors have been made. From this, comparative study of rolled and stacked type aqueous supercapacitor is presented in this paper. Â© 2013 IEEE.
