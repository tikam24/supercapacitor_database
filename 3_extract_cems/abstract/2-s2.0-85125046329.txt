NiCo2O4 nanoparticles have been widely investigated in recent times for applications in storage devices especially in supercapacitors due to their high redox activity, high specific capacitance and excellent ion exchange capability. The present work features the molar concentrations effect of Nickel (Ni) and Cobalt (Co) in synthesizing NiCo2O4 nanoparticles as an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors. Properties of the as-synthesized NiCo2O4 nanoparticles are evaluated and compared using various characterization studies such as X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) tools. Based on the results acquired from the mentioned analytical tools, the best concentration ratio is identified and further the optimized sample is investigated using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The electrochemical analysis of the optimized sample suggests that it would be an effectual electrode material applicant for energy storage devices especially in supercapacitors.
