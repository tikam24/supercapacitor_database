Long cycle life has been the key factor that inhibits the practical application of transition metal oxides (TMOs)-based pseduocapacitors, due to their poor electrical conductivity and the limited interface charge transfer between TMOs and conductive substrates. We here demonstrate a novel strategy to address this issue by constructing strongly coupled, few-crystalline MnO2 nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites. The covalent linkage of C–O–Mn at the interface effectively improves the charge transfer efficiency, avoiding the detachment of MnO2 nanosheets from rGO surfaces during the charge/discharge. Meanwhile, the few-crystalline MnO2 nanosheets are able to retain good structural integrity for the long cycling duration at large current densities. In the process of galvanostatic charge/discharge, the resulting composite electrode reveals a specific capacitance up to 234.8 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and a 100% of capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte. These extraordinary electrochemical properties reflect the synergistic role that the interface design and crystal structure control play in optimizing the performance of TMO-based pseduocapacitors.
