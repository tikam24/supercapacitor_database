In this article, the in situ grown cobalt nickel bimetallic oxide electrode materials are prepared by hydrothermal method, and the effects of different metal doping on material properties are analyzed. According to the tests, the material after Ti doping has higher capacity, especially for NiCo2O4/Ti0.02 which has the most stable performance. When the current density is 1 mA/cm2, its discharge time is 828 s, the corresponding electrode area specific capacitance is 1.656 F/cm2, and it increase to 2.200 F/cm2 slowly after 1000 cycles of charge and discharge. Furthermore, SEM, XRD, and infrared spectrum tests are conducted toward the materials with good performance. Observed from the SEM figure, the material is in braided rod-shaped and sea urchins spherical structure. Meanwhile, the fact that the formation of crystal structure and the chemical structure of NiCo2O4 are not impacted by Ti doping can be verified by the result obtained from XRD and infrared spectrum test.
