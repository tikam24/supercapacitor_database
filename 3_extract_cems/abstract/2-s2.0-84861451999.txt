A RuO 2 micro-supercapacitor with a side-by-side electrode configuration structure was designed and fabricated. It was composed of the micro-structure, the micro-electrode, and the functional RuO 2 film on the electrode. The micro-structure was made by the MEMS technology, while the micro-electrode was made by electroplating the functional RuO 2 film on the surface of the current collector. The electrochemical test results showed that the micro-supercapacitor had the specific capacity of 0.012F·cm -2 and the energy density of 0.006J·cm -2. The performance of the RuO 2-CNT (carbon nanotube) composite functional film was studied. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves showed that compared with the RuO 2 film, the RuO 2-CNT composite film greatly decreased the internal resistance, and improved the energy-storage density and the charge-CNT discharge quality of the micro-capacitor. Anyway, the micro-capacitor can satisfy the energy requirements of a lot of microsystems for its great stability and discharge power.
