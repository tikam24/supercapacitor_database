Manganese-nickel mixed oxide thin films were deposited by anodic electrodeposition on stainless steel substrate from an acetate solution using a potentiodynamic technique, at scan rate of 100 mV s-1 and room temperature. The effect of electrolyte pH, varied in the range from 4 to 7, on composition, morphology and capacitance behavior of oxide thin films was investigated. The nickel content in the oxide increased with increasing deposition pH, allowing to investigate the effect of the oxide composition on the capacitive behavior of as-grown manganese-nickel mixed oxides. Oxide films deposited from the electrolyte at pH 6, having a composition close to Ni0.10Mn0.90Ox showed the highest specific capacitance and the lowest charge transfer resistance. After annealing, the oxide had a complex structure of composite nature, consisting of intermixed amorphous and nanocrystalline phases. A birnessite type oxide with turbostratic disorder was identified as the major phase, in the presence of nickel hydroxide as a finely dispersed second phase. Annealing caused a drastic reduction of the charge transfer resistance and a limited increase of the specific capacitance, probably as the result of diverging effects on oxide properties, i.e. enhanced conductivity and porosity sintering. Cycle life testing of this material revealed a 25% increase of the specific capacitance over 5,000 cycles to a final value of 225 F g-1 (1 M Na2SO4, 50 mV s-1, 0.11 mg cm-2 mass loading).
