A facile, scalable, economic and binder free reflux condensation mediated deposition strategy is reported for the direct growth of cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanosheets (positive electrode) and zinc ferrite (ZnFe2O4) nanoflakes (negative electrode) on a highly conducting flexible stainless steel mesh (SSM, 300 mesh) for the first time. Both the electrodes show supercapbattery properties. Individually, Co3O4 nanosheet electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 2083 F g−1 (specific charge capacity 312 mAh g−1) at a high current density of 5 mA cm−2 and also shows excellent cycle stability with 89% retention after 6000 cycles. On other hand, ZnFe2O4 nanoflakes electrode demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 923 F g−1 (specific charge capacity 2100 mAh g−1) at 5 mA cm−2 current density with 94% capacitance retention after 9000 cycles. The electrodes are used for fabricating flexible solid state asymmetric supercapacitor. Interestingly, the fabricated device exhibits higher cycle stability up to 12,000 cycles with only 2% loss in capacitance retention and delivers a maximum energy density of 36 Wh kg−1 even at a high power density of 8.8 kW kg−1. This work reports novel alternative synthetic strategy which could be extended to other metal oxides providing new scientific insights and avenues.
