Energy storage accompanied by high power density is an overshadowing issue of 21st century. In this regard supercapacitor promises a bright future as it can be charged and discharged less than 1s. The potential applications of these supercapacitors are spread over all industries such as electric vehicles, braking systems and quick start/stop systems. This chapter reviews that necessity of supercapacitors, followed by fundamentals and classification. In addition, various potential materials are discussed for fabrication of electrodes. This study also sheds light on future prospects and applications of supercapacitor.
