The diffusion of micromobility applications in urban environments is often hindered by the limited battery autonomy when short and intense cycles of discharge and recharge are involved. Super-capacitors can be a durable alternative power supply with better performances in short and intense power cycles, exploiting the recharging opportunities that are present in smart grids. In this work, the modelling of the storage system is proposed for two technologies (Li-ion batteries and super-capacitors) connected to a bidirectional Zeta converter. The simulated system is comparatively analyzed considering an experimentally acquired current absorption profile from an electric kick scooter powered by Li-ion batteries. The analysis considers the converter efficiency considering the parasitic resistances. The difference in terms of range autonomy, weight, volume, and costs is shown.
