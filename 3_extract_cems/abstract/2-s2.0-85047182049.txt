This paper demonstrates the utility of Ultracapacitor as value addition to the D.C. link of Voltage source converter based FACTS controllers. This has been shown using a 500kV transmission system with three types of devices viz. STATCOM, SSSC and UPFC. A full-scale non linear model of all three devices with 48 pulse configuration is used. Firstly the system is checked under normal operating conditions. Next, the control strategy for control of ultracapacitor in coordination with power oscillations is derived. Then sizing of ultracapacitor bank for integration is done. Finally, a comparative study is carried out for all three types of devices with reference to power oscillation damping improvement.
