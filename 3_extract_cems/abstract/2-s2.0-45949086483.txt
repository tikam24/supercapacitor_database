A series of walnut shells-based activated carbons were prepared by chemical activation method with different ratios of ZnCl2/carbon to produce electrode materials for supercapacitor. The prepared carbon samples were characterized by N2 adsorption at 77 K and FTIR to evaluate surface area, porosity and surface properties. The resultant carbons were of high microporous materials with numbers of oxygen functional groups on the carbons surface. The electrochemical behavior of the carbon electrode-based capacitors using KOH as electrolyte was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results show that the capacitors have excellent electrochemical properties: High specific capacitance of 271.0 F/g, low leakage current of 0.25 mA, small equivalent series resistance (ECR) of 0.39 Î©, high current efficiency over 98% and excellent stability. After 5000-cycle test of charge-discharge, the capacitance can be maintained by 88%.
