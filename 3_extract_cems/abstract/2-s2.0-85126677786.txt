Titanium dioxide has attracted much attention from several researchers due to its excellent physicochemical properties. TiO2 is an eco-friendly material that has low cost, high chemical stability, and low toxicity. In this chapter, the main properties of TiO2 and its nanostructures are discussed, as well as the applications of these nanostructures in the generation of renewable energies to replace fossil fuels. We start with an introduction that explains why TiO2 is suitable for renewable energy technology applications. Next, some renewable energy technologies where TiO2 has been successfully studied and applied are reviewed. Examples of these technologies include supercapacitors, solar cells, hydrogen production, lithium-ion batteries, and sensors. For each of these applications, we highlight their current challenges and discuss how TiO2 nanomaterials can improve the performance of the devices.
