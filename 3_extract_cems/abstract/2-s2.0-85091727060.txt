Highly performance composite material nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres and Ni-Co coordination polymer metal precursor (N-MHCNS700@Ni-Co-MOF) obtained by using hydrothermal reaction Ni-Co coordination polymer metal precursor to assist hollow carbon nanospheres as templates. Then the composite material (N-MHCNS700@Ni-Co-MOF) is calcined under nitrogen to obtain nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres and nickel cobalt metal oxide (N-MHCNS700@NiCo2O4). Material characterization is used to analyze the morphology and structure of the material. The hybrid materials exhibit high specific capacitance (166 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1) and great cyclic stability (approximately 85.6% retained after 5,000 cycles at 10 A g−1). The composite material also have outstanding power density of composite (624.9 W kg−1) and the energy density (42.8 Wh kg−1). Therefore, composite materials can be applied to electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor.
