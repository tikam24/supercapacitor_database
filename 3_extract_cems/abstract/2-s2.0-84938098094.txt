To solve the problem of harmonics and interference when the elevator energy feedback device was applied, an elevator energy-storage system with super-capacitor was studied and designed. The feedback energy can be stored and reused by using bi-directional DC-DC converter. Based on this elevator system, the parameter design method of super-capacitor energy-storage device was discussed in detail and a specific principle was proposed. Simulation and experimental results show that this designed system realizes the effective feedback energy, and 26% considerable energy-saving is reached. Furthermore, there is no negative impact on either comfortable sensation or safety.
