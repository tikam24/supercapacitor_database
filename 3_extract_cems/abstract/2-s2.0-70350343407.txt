The use of supercapacitors as energy storage systems is evaluated in this work. Supercapacitors are compared with other technologies such as compressed air, pumped hydro, superconductors and flywheels. This paper is focused on medium scale energy storage systems (applied to 100 kW photovoltaic generation plants). The supercapacitor is studied in detail, presenting these device structures, how they can be modeled, the balancing, their useful life and their principal applications. The overview is carried out after a detailed reference selection.
