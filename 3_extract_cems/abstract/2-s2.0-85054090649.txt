This paper presents a study by simulation of the performance of a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) integrated to a residential microgrid. The storage system is composed of li-ion battery units and supercapacitors connected in a parallel active topology. An optimization-based real-time frequency-decoupling control strategy is used for the power split and for the assignation of the high-frequency and low-frequency energy components to the storage mediums. The simulation system emulates a photovoltaic generation source with typical intermittence of the injected power, the typical loads of a residential electric grid, and a HESS.
