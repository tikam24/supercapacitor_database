We successfully prepared urchin-like TiO2 material composed of numerous nanorods by hydrothermal method. After that, a cylindrical hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated by using urchin-like TiO2 anode and activated carbon cathode. The energy and power density of hybrid supercapacitor using urchin-like TiO2 ranged from 10.134 to 50.648 Wh kg−1 and from 194.412 to 12224.356 W kg−1, higher than those of hybrid supercapacitors using Li4Ti5O12 anode. It also shows the extraordinary cycle performance of 93.6% at 3.0 Ag−1 after 1000 cycles. As a result, we can conclude that urchin-like TiO2 can be regarded as high efficiency anode for hybrid supercapacitors.
