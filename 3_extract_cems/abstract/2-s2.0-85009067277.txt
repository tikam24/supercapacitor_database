Voltage transients occur in a low-voltage automotive electric system due to switching on and off inductive loads. Many new loads in the system are transient in nature. These transients lead to high voltage ratings of the devices on board. They threat the safe operation of some critical electronic loads in the system. This paper begins with a review of voltage transient related standards for the low voltage automotive electrical system. It then gives a detailed analysis of the load dump transient with test results. The transient buffer concept using a supercapacitor to smooth the voltage fluctuation caused by the high peak transient loads is also discussed.
