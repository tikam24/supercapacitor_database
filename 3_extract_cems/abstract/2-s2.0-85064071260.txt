Te-based transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as supercapacitors are gaining substantial attention with a few reports. The integration of 1T′-Mo6Te6 nanoplates (NPs) into few-atomic-layered two dimensional (2D) 2H-MoTe2 thin film has not been realized in supercapacitive studies. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of 1T′-Mo6Te6 NP/2H-MoTe2 thin film polymorphic structure through metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on Si/SiO2 and thereby, the successful transfer of these polymorphic structure on a flexible nickel (Ni) foam current collector by simple chemical etching protocol for high performance supercapacitors. A layer by layer study of the Mo6Te6/MoTe2 polymorphic structure is carried out by varying the number of transfer layers on the Ni foam. The resultant supercapacitors demonstrate a three-fold enhancement in areal capacitance (1542 mFcm−2 at 10 mVs−1) compared to a single layer transferred electrode, together with remarkable electrochemical stability (96%) and high energy density (140.36 mWcm−2 at 4 mA). These supercapacitors outperform the TMD-based (Te-based) supercapacitors presented in the past, demonstrating the high potential for their application in energy conversion devices.
