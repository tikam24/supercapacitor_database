Nanocellulose materials are promising sustainable and environmentally friendly candidates for green and renewable energy storage applications. Herein, hierarchical Co3O4@CNC nanohybrid structure was fabricated in conjunction with cobalt acetate tetrahydrate and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) as a bio-carbon source using green ball-milling pathway for the first time. For comparison, pristine Co3O4 nanostructure was prepared using a similar method without adding CNC. The structural and morphological characteristics of nanohybrid composites were investigated using X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) techniques. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the nanohybrid composites evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The hierarchical Co3O4@CNC nanohybrid electrode showed the highest specific capacitance of 396 F/g that of pristine Co3O4 nanostructure electrode (was 268 F/g) at a current density of 1.0 A/g for a three-electrode assembly. The hierarchical Co3O4@CNC nanohybrid electrode showed appreciable capacitive behavior with 96% cyclic retention even after 5,000 cycles at 1.0 A/g with energy density of 12.5 Wh k−1 at a power density of 230.5 W k−1. Thus, it is suitable for improving and/or designing active electrocatalysts for enhanced supercapacitor applications.
