A novel chemical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method has been used for the synthesis of hierarchical nanostructured material by growing Cu2O-Mn3O4nanoflakes onto TiO2crumpled micro-nano spheres, which were prepared by hydrothermal method on Ti foil substrate. The nanocomposites of TiO2/Cu2O-Mn3O4are strategically combined into a single entity to synergize and construct a high electrochemical performance of pseudocapacitor electrode. Specific capacitance of the ternary composite electrode achieves as high as 259 F g−1at a current density of 3 A g−1, when cycling performance (no capacity loss over 5000 cycles) is much better than that of TiO2/Mn3O4, TiO2/Cu2O and individual component Mn3O4electrodes.
