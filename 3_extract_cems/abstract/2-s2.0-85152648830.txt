The development of 3D ceramic pseudocapacitive micro-supercapacitors (pMSCs) with patterned design was greatly hindered by the existing fabrication techniques that requires expensive equipment, harsh manufacturing environments, expensive materials and complicated fabrication processes. Herein, for the first time, one step electric discharge direct writing (EDDW) technique has been developed to fabricate 3D pMSCs, which are composed of Mo-MoOx integrated electrodes with designable patterns. The developed 3D pMSCs exhibited a high capacitance of 49.1 mF cm−2 (Scanning Rate: 5 mV s−1) and achieved a good capacitance retention of 96% after 5000 cycles. Additionally, the 3D pMSCs without adding any conductive additives could be operated up to an extremely high scanning rate of 20 V s−1 and retained a high areal capacitance of 6.3 mF cm−2. This simple, safe, low-cost, binder-free, conductive additive free and environmentally friendly fabrication technique of EDDW opens a new strategy for efficient fabricating different kinds of energy storage devices with designable 3D patterns and improved electrochemical performance.
