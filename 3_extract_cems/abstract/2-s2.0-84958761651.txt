Nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbons have been successfully synthesized by direct carbonization of a nitrogen- rich metal-biomolecule framework, zinc glutamate (Zn(H2O)(C5H7NO4)路H2O), as a template without any additional carbon or nitrogen sources. The surface area and pore size distribution of the resultant carbon materials were studied based on the carbonization temperature. These carbons exhibited high specific surface area (as high as 1619.2 m2路g-1 for ZGC-1000). Furthermore, ZGC-1000 also provided a large specific capacitance of 140.8 F路g-1 at a current density of 0.25 A路g-1 when measured in a three-electrode system. It is believed that the presence of the nitrogen-doped nanoporous carbons prepared from the metal-organic frameworks will further facilitate the exploration of such materials as supercapacitors.
