Principle of electric vehicles composite power structure are analyzed and introduced, according to the characteristics of super capacitor and power battery to establish simulation model of vehicular composite power using fuzzy control theory to establish the composite power energy management system control strategy and bring new composite power supply model of electric vehicle driving cycle in different road conditions are simulated, the simulation results show that the control strategy of fuzzy control can significantly improve the working efficiency of the super capacitor and power battery, play the role of the super capacitor peak "cut", extend the service life of the battery; Under the same conditions, the vehicle's power performance and range are improved.
