Ilmenite and leucoxene nanopowders were prepared by ball milling process. Phase structure, surface and particle morphology transformation by ball milling were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Synchrotron X-Ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra was conducted to investigate detailed local structures and oxidation states of prepared powders. Electrochemical properties of the prepared samples were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The prepared leucoxene nanoparticles exhibit feasibility as applicable material for supercapacitor electrode according to significantly improved electrochemical properties with good cycling performance and high capacitance.
