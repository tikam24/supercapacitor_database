Intense efforts have been made to design and prepare hierarchical porous electrode materials because of high specific surface area and fast ions transport. In this work, a facile strategy for the polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)-induced assembly of two-dimensional NiCo-LDHs nanosheets into three-dimensional flower-like microspheres is developed. The multilevel NiCo-LDHs microspheres possess high specific surface area and sufficient porosity. Electrochemical analysis manifests that the multilevel NiCo-LDHs is rather outstanding, which shows a comparatively high specific capacity of 622 C/g at 1 A/g, favorable rate performance and excellent long-term stability. Moreover, an optimized asymmetrical supercapacitor using flower-like NiCo-LDHs as positive electrode yields a maximum energy density of 63.4 Wh/kg at 934 W/kg. This work draws a promising way for the assembly of multidimensional configurations with immense prospect in energy-storage fields.
