In recent years, due to the increased utilization of electrical energy in all aspects of daily life, a huge demand for energy storage systems, for both mobile and stationary applications, has emerged. Electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs) such as batteries and supercapacitors are the most dominant types of such systems which are usually processed from a liquid phase. Simplicity, low cost, high production yield, and ease of scale-up are some of the main reasons which render the liquid-phase techniques preferable to other fabrication methods. In these methods, a printing or a coating technique is usually used for deposition of a suspension/solution which contains the electrochemically active material. This suspension/solution is called 'ink' and typically contains other additives to facilitate the deposition and film formation processes. Binders, Surfactants, and rheology modifiers are some of the key additives of conventional ink formulations [1]. Although additives play critical roles in the processability of the inks and properties of the printed/coated films, their removal (after drying of the film) is necessary for recovering the functionality of the printed/coated materials. Additives intensively degrade the electrical properties, decrease the active surface area, and complicate the fabrication process as their removal requires high-temperature heat treatments. In order to mitigate the undesirable effects of additives on functionality of the liquid processed materials, numerous methods such as application of localized short/pulsed heating techniques [2] and replacing the conventional additives with innovative alternatives like solvent mixtures [3] have been established. Although great attempts have been made, most of the proposed solutions are case-specific, with limited scope of application.
