Conversion of biomass waste into nitrogen-doped porous carbon has been considered as a promising approach to achieve energy storage materials. Nitrogen-doped activated carbon materials have been successfully prepared by molten salt pyrolysis (MSP) using melamine modified-denim fabric waste as precursor. The molten salt medium provides liquid condition to carbonize and activate the denim fabric waste. Melamine produces a large amount of nitrogen element for doping the carbon materials. The obtained nitrogen-doped denim fabric-based carbon materials (NDFC-MSP) are composed of small fibrous fragment and thin sheet, and exhibit a high specific surface area (1975.2 m2⋅g−1) and high pore volume (1.087 cm3⋅g−1). Moreover, NDFC-MSP sample with a high nitrogen content of 6.93 wt.% possesses a maximum specific capacitance of 345.8 F⋅g−1 at 0.25 A⋅g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. It also displays a high specific capacitance of 230 F⋅g−1 at 10 A⋅g−1. The cycle stability shows 95.5% retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 1 A⋅g−1. In addition, the fabricated symmetric NDFC-MSP supercapacitor with a wide voltage range of 1.8 V generates a maximum energy density of 17.0 Wh⋅kg−1 at power density of 225 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.
