The paper presents the design and analysis of pure electric bus powered by Lithium-ion battery and ultra capacitor. For the limited power energy of battery, the ultra capacitor pack is chosen as the auxiliary on-board energy storage device. The system configuration, system modeling and on-road test result analysis will be covered in the paper and the possibility of using ultra capacitors on electric bus to improve the economical efficiency in urban areas will be discussed.
