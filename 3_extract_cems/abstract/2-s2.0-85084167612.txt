Pursuing scalable production of porous carbon with facile and environmentally friendly synthesis methodology is a global goal. Herein, a unique hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (HPGC) with outstanding textural characteristics is achieved by a special synergistic activation mechanism, in which the low-temperature molten state of polymorphisms can induce a high-rate liquid phase porous activation. HPGC with high specific surface area (SSA, ∼2571 m2 g-1) and large pore volume (PV, ∼2.21 cm3 g-1) can be achieved, which also possesses the capability to tune textural characteristics (i.e., SSA, PV, pore size distribution, etc.) within a wide range. Furthermore, the pilot-scale production of HPGC is accomplished, which shows similar textural characteristics to the lab-scale HPGC. Due to the unique structure of HPGC and the capability of the textural control, it can be applicable in a variety of energy storage, energy conversion, and catalysis applications. The applications of pilot-scale HPGC products in supercapacitors and lithium sulfur batteries are highlighted in this work. Furthermore, the synergistic activation strategy can be promoted to other alkali-based carbon activation routes, which can open up new possibilities for the activated carbon production and lead to more widespread industrialized applications of HPGC.
