Supercapacitors have high power density and some advantages than other storage devices. Therefore, the applications of supercapacitors and investigations to develop their materials and chemistry are increasing every day. Also, the engineering and energy storage applications of supercapacitors are being continuously researched. The structural properties of supercapacitors and their technical applications based on an extensive literature review are given in this paper firstly. Then, requirements for module design for supercapacitors are revealed, and module design is carried out and set up. The supercapacitor module design is performed in MATLAB/Simulink software, and the simulation results are obtained for the charge and discharge conditions. Measurements are performed at various load conditions, and results are compared with simulation results and rated with supercapacitor manufacturers' datasheets. The power storage capacity of supercapacitor modules and discharging as a function of time is obtained experimentally. These results give us information about the power density of supercapacitors for different loads, and how long and how much the current can be given. This study can be considered as a preliminary study on supercapacitors to be used in power electronics, renewable energy, and electric vehicle applications, instead of conventional energy storage techniques. The detailed review of the literature and the obtained data in the present paper shed light on further studies to be performed in the field.
