Tremendous progress has been made in the research of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the past 25. years, which has facilitated the progress and development of fundamental research and industrial applications. However, challenges and opportunities remain. At the same time, the discovery and development of graphene in 2004 has had an obvious impact on the applications of CNTs. The progress and development of CNTs provide valuable references for graphene, ranging from synthesis and characterization to applications. Promising materials combining CNTs and graphene are on the rise. The popularity of CNT/graphene hybrids has expanded research and application of carbon nanomaterials. In this chapter, we summarize the challenges and opportunities that exist in the synthesis and application of CNTs and describe the synthesis and application of CNT/graphene hybrid materials.
