Ni3(PO4)2@GO composites were fabricated via a facile chemical precipitation method. More importantly, it was observed from electrochemical measurements that the obtained Ni3(PO4)2@GO electrode showed a good specific capacitance (1392.59 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and cycling stability (1302 F g-1 retained after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1). In addition, a high-voltage asymmetric supercapacitor was successfully fabricated using Ni3(PO4)2@GO and Fe2O3@GO as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor could be cycled reversibly in the high-voltage region of 0-1.6 V and displayed intriguing performances with a maximum specific capacitance of 189 F g-1 at a current density of 0.25 A g-1. Furthermore, the Fe2O3@GO//Ni3(PO4)2@GO asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density of 67.2 W h kg-1 and an excellent long cycle-life along with 88% specific capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The impressive results presented here may pave the way for promising applications in high energy density storage systems.
