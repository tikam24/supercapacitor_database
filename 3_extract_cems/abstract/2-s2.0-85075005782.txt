Electrical storage technology with both high power density and high energy density is the ultimate goal in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Finding novel electrical storage system that combines the advantages of supercapacitor and battery has become the key strategy to achieve this ultimate goal. The supercapattery combines the advantages of battery and the supercapacitor to achieve unification of high power density and high energy density in the same time and space. Served as key electrode materials, supercapattery-type electrode materials possess fast electron and ion transfer channel, which can maximize the utilization of the redox-active cation under the permissible conditions of thermodynamics and dynamics. Developed supercapattery can show energy density of 350 Wh/kg and power density of 2 kW/kg. Supercapattery device can be applied in pulse power supply, electromagnetic ejection, energy recovery, start and stop power and so on.
