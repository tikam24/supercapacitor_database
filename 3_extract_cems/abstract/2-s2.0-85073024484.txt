Synthesis of nitrogen doped mesoporous graphitic carbon spheres with dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles using a single temperature treatment step serves as one of the big challenges in materials research. To date only a few reports have been published on the soft-templating synthesis of mesoporous graphitic carbons. The preparation of graphitic carbons with dispersed Fe2O3 using a single carbonization step at relatively low temperatures is yet to be explored. The first phase of this work shows the potential of graphitization of polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP) stabilized cubic Prussian blue nanoparticles (CPB) in phenolic resin spheres to produce graphitic carbon spheres through a facile St√∂ber-like method. In the second phase, the Pluronic F127 soft template was used along with PVP stabilized Prussian blue nanoparticles (PB) in carbon spheres to generate mesopores and graphitic domains with uniformly dispersed Fe2O3 nanoparticles in these spheres. Due to the presence of graphitic layers, doped N species and Fe2O3 nanoparticles in the carbon matrix, the yielded carbon spheres feature a high surface area and magnetic properties. Moreover, these graphitic spheres exhibited excellent capacitive behavior with rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles and large capacitance up to 247 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 scan rate in 6 M KOH solution.
