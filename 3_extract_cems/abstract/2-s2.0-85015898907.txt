Researchers synthesized a novel MnO2/oxidized carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid fiber through two simple solution processes, with the aim of obtaining the stretchable fiber SCs with high volumetric performance. They assembled a stretchable fiber SC with two hybrid fibers by a simple prestraining-then-buckling method. The stretchable fiber SC was a perfect combination of high volumetric performance, with specific volumetric capacitance of approximately 409.4 F cm-3 at 0.75 A cm-3, and the ability to undergo cyclic tensile strain of 40%.
