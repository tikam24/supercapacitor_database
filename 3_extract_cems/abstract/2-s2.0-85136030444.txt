Supercapacitor electrodes synthesized from activated carbon (AC) has high energy and power capabilities as they have larger surface area, greater conductivity, and also AC has the ability to optimize the properties of supercapacitors. Supercapacitor has gained its attention due to its fast charging/discharging speed and long-term stability than the normal batteries. In this work, GO/PPy/AC composite electrodes was synthesized to increase the specific capacitance and the energy storage capability of supercapacitor through modified hummers' method, sacrificial template polymerization method, and hydrothermal method. Here, the AC was derived from seeds of Ziziphus jujuba and shells of Prunus dulcis. The performances of GO, GO/PPy, GO/PPy/ACZJ, and GO/PPy/ACPD electrodes were evaluated using 6 M KOH electrolyte at different current densities and scan rates. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes were characterized by CV, GCD, and EIS analysis to study the suitability of the electrode material. GO/PPy/ACPD electrode exhibited the specific capacitance of 1217.1, 456.67, 270.44, and 90.88 F g-1 with current densities of 1, 2, 4, and 10 A g-1, respectively. GO/PPy/ACPD has high specific capacitance of 1217.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The enhanced electrochemical performance is due to better surface area and higher specific capacitance.
