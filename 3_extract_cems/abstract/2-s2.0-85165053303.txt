In this study, we investigated the use of electrocatalysts, PMAc, PMAc-g-CNT, Ni/PMAc, and Ni/PMAc-g-CNT for water splitting and supercapacitor applications. Our results showed that the Ni/PMAc-g-CNT catalyst exhibited superior properties in terms of electrochemical activity, stability, and energy storage capacity. The Tafel slope for OER was found to be 471.25 mV decâˆ’1, which was lower than other catalysts studied. The capacitance value of the Ni/PMAc-g-CNT catalyst was 35.23 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density, which was higher than the Ni/PMAc catalyst. These findings provide a novel and detailed insight into the performance of these catalysts and suggest that the Ni/PMAc-g-CNT catalyst is a promising material for both water splitting and supercapacitor applications.
