In order to develop active material with promising properties for supercapacitor, the feather duster-like CNT@WO 3 composite is synthesized by a facial on-step solvothermal method. The as-prepared material shows the superior electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance (496 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and long-lasting cycle stability (96.3% retention after 8000 cycles at 100 mV s −1 ) in 0.5 mol L −1 H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. This simple preparation method and superior performance can make significant contribution in the synthesis and future application in energy storage material.
