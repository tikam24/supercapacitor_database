Herein, we have proposed asymmetric supercapacitor device to achieve empirical electrochemical performance based on binder-free Co9S8 and CoFe2O4 electrodes. The unique architecture and porous surface of the prepared electrodes were analyzed using electron microscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller technique. Electrochemical properties of Co9S8 and CoFe2O4 electrode were employed in a three-electrode cell-configuration that exhibits a capacitance of 817 and 1203 F g−1, respectively. Co9S8//CoFe2O4 asymmetric supercapacitor reveals a high capacitance of 79.11 F g−1 with 28.88 Wh kg−1 energy density and superior cyclic stability over 2500 cycles (∼87%). These results suggest that prepared electrodes have a great potential for practical applications.
