This paper describes the methodology and experimental results for wireless power delivery to a soil-sensors power and data distribution unit from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), using a high frequency inductive power transfer (HF-IPT) link. The configuration features, at the transmit side, a lightweight single-turn air-core coil driven by a 13.56 MHz Class EF inverter mounted on a Matrice 100 drone by DJI, and at the receive side, a two-turn PCB coil with a voltage-tipler Class D rectifier, an off-the-shelf 42 V battery charger and a supercapacitors module for energy storage. The experiments were conducted with a coil-to-coil gap of 250 mm, which corresponds to a coupling factor lower than 5%. In the experiments, a 10 F, 42 V supercapacitors module was charged in eleven minutes with an energy efficiency of 34% from the 80 V DC source that feeds the inverter on the drone to the supercapacitor-based energy storage unit in the sensor module. At higher power (50 W) the HF-IPT system was able to achieve a 68% DC-DC efficiency with a coupling factor of 3.5%. The work reported in this paper is part of a multiple-discipline project which looks to enable the optimal usage of water in agriculture with broader sensing techniques and more frequent sensing cycles.
