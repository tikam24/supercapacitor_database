Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) received great interest in different application due to its super adsorption charcheters and high surface area, the most interesting MOFs is Europium based MOFs (Eu-MOFs), it is a class of versatile porous materials, Eu-MOFs have shown enormous potential for different applications such as Hg2+ ions, Fe3+, pesticides, phenols, dyes and other ions, drugs, hypochlorite, selenite & arsenate, miscellanies material, and anticounterfeiting detection. Eu-MOFs were applied in high technology like supercapacitor (SCs), pH & temperature sensing applications. Moreover, Eu-MOFs were applied in biological system dopamine and histadine, 1-hydroxypyrene (1-HP), various types of antibiotic, enzyme detections, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) detections. Additionally, Eu-MOFs were applied in catalysis for the cyanosilylation and reduction reactions. Eu-MOFs is not only worked in previous application but also worked in gas state for gases and different vapor detections. The present review highlights the recent advances in the field of application, followed by the directions for future research.
