In the present work, supercapacitors based on graphene/Pt films show especially high rate capability (120 F g-1 even at 50 A g -1) and cyclability (no attenuation over 10000 cycles) and peculiar nanosphere morphology after electrochemical cycling. Furthermore, supercapacitors based on the graphene powder with a binder exhibit high specific capacitance (249 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), long cycle life (no attenuation over 40000 cycles) and high rate capability (150 F g-1 even at 50 A g-1), which are much better than those of most graphene electrode materials. These indicate the great potential of the cysteine reduced graphene electrodes in energy storage. Â© 2012 the Owner Societies.
