A novel high-performance supercapacitor electrode material based on graphene/Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (G/PEDOT) hybrid was synthesized via in situ electropolymerization of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) monomer on the graphene nanosheet in ionic liquid for the first time. The morphology characterization of the G/PEDOT hybrid by AFM and SEM demonstrated that the grain-shape PEDOT particles with the average size of 80 nm×40 nm×2 nm were attached to the graphene sheet's surface tightly. The average specific capacitance of 181 F·g-1 of the hybrid was obtained in the potential range from 0 to 0.8 V at 1.0 A·g-1 by charge-discharge analysis and the hybrid showed good charge/discharge reversibility and electrochemical stability as supercapacitor electrode.
