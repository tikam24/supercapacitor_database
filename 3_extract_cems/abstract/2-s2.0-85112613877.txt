Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and ferrites nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential applications in energy conversion and storage devices. In this work, ferrite NPs are prepared by solvothermal method. The NPsâ€™ surface is then modified with nitrosonium tetraflouroborate (NOBF4) enabling to interact electrostatically with the COOH functionalised CNTs in phenol to form printing ink solution. The suspension is covered on ITO substrate by 3D printing method followed by cooling down to around 2 oC to form porous (3D) CNTs-ferrites hybrid electrodes. The surface property of ferrite NPs and CNTs was investigated by zeta potential and FTIR measurements. The specific capacitance of the obtained CNTs-ferrite NPs hybrid material was calculated to be 10 F/g from CV measurement.
