The proceedings contain 33 papers. The topics discussed include: binderless synthesis of nanoknotnet-like cobalt oxide for supercapacitor application; sol-gel prepared vanadium oxide for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue dye; synthesis and characterization of hydrothermally prepared molybdenum disulfide for supercapacitor application; mesoporous cobalt ferrite thin film for supercapacitor applications; extraction of natural dye (specifically anthocyanin) from pomegranate fruit source and their subsequent use in DSSC; electrochemical supercapacitive performance study of spray pyrolyzed cobalt oxide film; synthesis and implementation of polycrystalline ferrite material for smart sensor module; and synthesis, characterization and gas sensing performance of tungesten oxide by hydrothermal method.
