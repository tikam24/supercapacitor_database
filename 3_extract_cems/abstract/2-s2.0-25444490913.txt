The preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNT)-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposite and its application as electrode material for supercapacitor were analyzed. Carbon nanotubes were produced catalytically with Ni particles as the catalyst. Nitric acid treatment was employed to remove the catalyst particles before use. For the preparation of CNTs-PANI nanocomposte, a solution of 1 mole 1 -1 HCL containing CNTs was sonicated at room temperature. The results show that PANI addition is a simple, cheap, and effective method to increase the specific capacitance of the CNTs.
