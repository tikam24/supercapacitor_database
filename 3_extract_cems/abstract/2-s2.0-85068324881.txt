Autonomous hybrid energy systems are a completely green system and are considered asÂ an attractive research problems that utilize all power requirements using energy storage. Deploying green systems is seen as an option to improve power security. For this reason, the main objective is to ensure the efficient production of electricity without interruption. To achieve this objective, we have proposed a precise simulation model that combines solar energy with an energy recovery component (fuel cell).Â A long-term energy storage component includes a water electrolyzer which is regarded as a primary storage and an ultracapacitor storage component deployed as a short-term storage of energy. To reach the correct system operation, an accurate schema approach for energy management unit (EMU) is developed and discussed according to an excess and deficit modes. To prove the reliability and effectiveness of the applied control strategy and its impact on the system operation, the proposed design is simulated using the Matlab/Simulink environment by referring to an experimental data profile extracted from the Tunisian meteorological database with anticipated conditions in a typical mode Weekly working period.
