Poly(3-methylthiophene)/Graphene composites (G-PMT) and poly(3-methylthiophene) (PMT) were synthesized by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization and investigated as electrode material for supercapacitors. The interaction between graphene and polymer chains was characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The morphology of the nanocomposites was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The thermal stability of the composite and the polymer was studied by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) which shows G-PMT has higher thermal stability than PMT. The electrochemical properties were investigated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Cyclic Charging-discharging tests (CC) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode system. GPMT resulted in higher specific capacitance of 240 F/g. The specific capacitance retention after 500 cycles on G-PMT was also higher compared with PMT. These results indicate that G-PMT has good electrochemical performance than PMT hence it is useful for the making of electrode in supercapacitor application.
