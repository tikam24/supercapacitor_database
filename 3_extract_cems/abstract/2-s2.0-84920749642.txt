In this article, the uniform cryptomelane-type manganese oxide with an octahedral molecular sieves structure was prepared under mild hydrothermal condition; the effects of hydrothermal temperature on the micro-nanostructure and supercapacitance properties of manganese dioxide were studied in detail. The structures were characterized by SEM, XRD and TEM; and the supercapacitive behaviors were investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge and discharge tests. The experiment results suggested that: the prepared nanoparticles can be self-organized into dendritic nanostructures, and the nanocluster arrays are composed of nanoneedles or tetragonal prism nanorods; with the increase of reaction temprature, the crystal morphology of manganese oxide was gradually improving, and was trasformed from nanoneedles to tetragonal prism nanorods; the capacitance of MnO2 electrode was a combined contribution of electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance, and the best specific capacitance value of MnO2 electrode was 603 F/g corresponding to the charge/discharge current density of 5 mA/cm2; with the increase of reaction temperature ranging from 100-180â„ƒ, the specific capacitance of manganese oxide gradually decline.
