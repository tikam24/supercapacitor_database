A novel heterogenous Co3O4-nanocube/Co(OH)2-nanosheet hybrid is prepared by a controllable facile one-pot hydrothermal reaction. The resulting Co3O4 nanocubes are highly uniform in morphology, and are distributed uniformly on the individual Co(OH)2 nanosheets. Such unique nanostructural features show significant advantages for applications as flexible supercapacitor electrodes in terms of enhanced durability and capacitance. The as-prepared electrode has offered a large capacitance of 1164 F g−1 at 1.2 A g−1. When being paired with activated carbon, the resulting flexible all-solid-state device exhibited a maximum energy density of 9.4 mWh cm−3. It is worthwhile noting that this as-assembled device showed little capacitance decay after over 5000 cycles with 97.4% retention of its original specific capacitance. Such a high performance outperforms most metal oxides-based electrodes and shows the advantages of the hybrid strategy, which shed light on exploring robust and cheap electrode materials for high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
