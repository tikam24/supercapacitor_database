Efficient and low-cost electrode materials play a key role in improving the performance of energy storage device. In this study, the porous rod-like CuCo2O4 nano-materials are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and subsequent heating annealing procedure. Benefiting from its advantages of the unique porous rod-like architectures with large specific surface area (98.27 m2 g−1), the as-prepared CuCo2O4 electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 778.29 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability (85.79% capacitance retention at 16 A g−1), and ultra-long cycling lifespan (91.65% specific capacitance retention after 4000 cycles) through the three-electrode system test. When assembled into the CuCo2O4//AC-ASC cell device, it provides a maximum energy density of 64.03 Wh/kg at a power density of 800.01 W/kg and extraordinary cycling stability (85.39% retention after 5000 cycles). These results firmly verify that the porous rod-like CuCo2O4 nano-materials have great potential application for supercapacitors.
