In recent years, driven by global environmental issues, a growing number of renewable energy sources (RESs) have been developed. Microgrids have been confirmed as an important part in the increasing penetrations of renewable energy and the shift from a centralized paradigm to decentralized electricity production. The energy storage system (ESS) is a critical component that affects the development of microgrids. Combining advantages from different energy storage technologies, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) can satisfy multiple requirements in microgrids. This paper compares the single battery system with the battery-supercapacitor (SC) HESS and the battery-flywheel HESS in an isolated photovoltaic (PV) power microgrid. Results show that both the SC and the flywheel distinctly reduce the battery charging and discharging powers and the required capacity of the battery. Therefore, the stresses and the needed size of the battery are reduced and the battery lifetime is extended.
