This paper presents the design of an interface circuit for storing power generated by low-frequency vibration based electrostatic energy harvesters. The circuit includes a structure of negative voltage converter with an active diode to minimize the forward voltage drop, and it also includes a boost-buck converter to accommodate a wide input voltage. The circuit has also been optimized to perform resistive matching. The maximum voltage of the capacitor in charging reaches about 1.83 V in simulation.
