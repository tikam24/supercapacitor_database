Recently, much attention has been given to the synthesis and application of 3D hierarchical nanomaterials, which can have superior performance for supercapacitors compared with other nanostructured materials. Herein, unique hierarchical nanoribbon-based 3D fan-like nanostructures of α-MnMoO4 were controllably synthesized for the first time by using a simple method. We have assembled supercapacitors based on the hierarchical nanoribbon-based α-MnMoO4 3D fan-like nanostructures, which display a specific capacitance of 562 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and good cycling stability with 99.8% specific capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. These results further implied that constructing unique 3D hierarchical structures can improve electrochemical properties.
