In this work we report a low cost technique, via simple rapid-mixture polymerization of aniline using an electrospun carbon nanofiber (CNF) paper as substrate, to fabricate free-standing, flexible CNF-PANI (PANI = polyaniline) composite paper. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained products are characterized by FESEM, FTIR, Raman and XRD. As results, PANI nanoparticles are homogeneously deposited on the surface of each CNF, forming a thin, light-weight and flexible composite paper. The resulting composite paper displays remarkably enhanced electrochemical capacitance compared with the CNF paper, making it attractive for high-performance flexible capacitors.
