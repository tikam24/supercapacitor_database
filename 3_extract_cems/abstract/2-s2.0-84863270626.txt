We report here a facile strategy to synthesize the nanocomposite of adenine-modified reduced graphene oxide (AMG) via reaction between adenine and GOCl which is generated from SOCl 2 reacted with graphite oxide (GO). The as-synthesized AMG was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic discharge analysis. The AMG owns about one adenine group per 53 carbon atoms on a graphene sheet, which improves electronic conductivity compared with reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The AMG displays enhanced supercapacitor performance compared with RGO accompanying good stability and good cycling behavior in the supercapacitor. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
