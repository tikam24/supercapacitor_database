We have successfully developed a MOF-based (Co3[Fe(CN)6]2·10H2O) strategy to synthesize Co-Fe mixed metal oxide (Co3O4/Fe2O3) nanocubes (denoted as CFNC). The obtained CFNC is applied as both anode and cathode for high-performance symmetric supercapacitors, exhibiting high energy density of 35.15 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1125 W kg−1 as well as excellent stability. Meanwhile, when CFNC is used as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it requires a low overpotential of 310 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and exhibited excellent stability.
