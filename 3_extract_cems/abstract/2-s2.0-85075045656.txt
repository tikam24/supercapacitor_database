A novel graphene oxide/polyaniline (GO/PANI) composite is synthesized by a facile two-step approach. In this way, graphene oxide (GO) is prepared by modified Hummer’s method and then serves as the substrate for the growth of polyaniline (PANI). With the addition of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), GO is evenly distributed in solution and aniline monomers are easily attached to the surface of GO. At 15°C, PANI not only has good conductivity also can be uniformly distributed on the graphene sheets. The composite exhibits great electrochemical performance when applied in supercapacitors with a specific capacitance of 405 F/g at 1 A/g with 80% content of PANI, which is superior to its individual components. The maximum specific capacitance of 665 F/g has been obtained at 10 mV/s in virtue of the electrochemical double layer capacitance and the pseudocapacitance. This consequent provides a valuable reference for the development of high-efficiency energy storage equipment.
