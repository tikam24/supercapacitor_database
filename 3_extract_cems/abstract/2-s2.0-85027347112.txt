This paper reports the synthesis and enhanced electrochemical performance of polypyrrole (PPY)/polyacrylic acid (PAA)/silver nanowire (AgNW) nanocomposites. In this ternary structure, the AgNWs provide a highly conductive path to the PPY spherical granules and PAA acts as a binder. The deposition of PPY-PAA-AgNWs was carried out on a stainless steel substrate using a dip coating technique. The surface morphology of the films was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of AgNWs on the PPY-PAA granular background that further reduced the charge transfer resistance. The PPY-PAA-AgNWs showed a specific capacitance of 383 Fg-1 at 10 mVs-1 and an energy density of 3.75 Whkg-1 at 0.2 mA, indicating the positive synergistic effect of AgNWs and PPY.
