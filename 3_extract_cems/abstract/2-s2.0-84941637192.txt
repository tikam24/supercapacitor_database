This paper focuses on the use of modeling and simulation for the renewable energy. An energy storage system for improving performance of electric vehicles is presented. The supercapacitor contributes to the rapid energy recovery associated with regenerative braking in electric vehicles. This power system allows the acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle with minimal loss of energy. Short-distance passenger traffic on electrified lines is a domain where brake energy recuperation might reduce the total energy consumption significantly. In this paper the results of a simulation model by Matlab for an urban-metro railcar is presented.
