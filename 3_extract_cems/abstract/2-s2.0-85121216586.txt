g-C3N3 (GCN) have been used as supercapacitor electrode due to its tunable structure and high carbonâ€“nitrogen ratio, However, the poor conductivity and very low surface area remain a challenge for practical applications. The formation of a hybrid structure of GCN with carbon-based materials such as activated carbon (AC), graphene (G), and carbon nanotube (CNT) help to improve its electrochemical properties. In this work, we synthesized GCN-AC, GCN-G and GCN-CNT hybrid structures and studies the electrochemical properties in symmetric two electrode configuration. The obtained specific capacitance of GCN, GCN-G, GCN-CNT and GCN-AC 11F/g, 244F/g, 237F/g and 266F/g, respectively. The energy density and voltage window of the GCN-AC device were enhanced by replacing the conventional electrolyte with ionic liquid gel electrolyte. The ionogel mediated device could achieve an enhanced specific capacitance of 303F/g with an energy density of 46.45 Wh/Kg and power density of 750 W/Kg.
