In this work, the 3D NiO-Ni/ANWs/FTO electrode for micro-supercapacitor application is fabricated by facile electrochemical deposition and post annealing process. At the optimal under annealing conditions, the composite electrodes demonstrate an excellent specific capacity up to 344 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1 based on GCD result in 2 mol L−1 KOH as electrolyte. In particular, our original welding treatment by rapidly annealing process of the 3D ANWs network dramatically increases the lifetime and stability, ∼100% capacitance retention after 20000 cycles. Meanwhile, the NiO-Ni/ANWs composite own high average transmittance in visible and near infra-red regions as high as 82%, which is suitable for fully transparent electronic device application. For on-chip purpose the FTO substrate has perfect compatibility can also be easily replaced by any shape or form p/n-Si, metal, semiconductor, and any other conductive substrates.
