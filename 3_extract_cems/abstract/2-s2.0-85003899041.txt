Chemical doping with heterogeneous atoms is an effective method to improve the intrinsic properties of graphene. In this work, a competitive type of highly nitrogen-doped graphene (HNG) and its composites hybridized with Co3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized via simple pre-mixing followed by a hydrothermal method. The highest nitrogen content achieved was 11.7%, which endowed the graphene with superior electrochemical performance. Co3O4 nanoparticles could be obtained with an optimal size of approximately 80–100 nm and were homogenously anchored on the graphene nanosheets. Because of the synergy between the highly nitrogen-doped graphene and uniform Co3O4 nanoparticles, the HNG/Co3O4 hybrids exhibited enhanced rate capability and cycling stability, which were considerably higher than those of bare HNG and Co3O4. As the current density increased from 0.2 to 5 A g−1, 80.6% of the specific capacitance was retained. Moreover, over 84.5% of the original specific capacitance was maintained after cycling 1000 cycles. This study has demonstrated the significance of nitrogen doping on the performance of graphene-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes.
