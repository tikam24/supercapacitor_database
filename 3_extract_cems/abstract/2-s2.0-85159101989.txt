Lithium trivanadate (LiV3O8) thin films were prepared by polymer assisted spin coating method. Here, the effect on addition of the polymers PVA, PVP, PEG and their combination on the preparation step were explored. The structural and morphological changes were analyzed by varying the substrate temperature, and its effect on the electrical and electrochemical performances were also studied. The thin films exhibited mixed micro and nanorod morphology. The XPS spectrum shows the stable 5+ oxidation state for vanadium. The electrochemical performance of the LiV3O8 thin film made using PVA:PVP and PVA:PEG in the 1:1 ratio outperformed the material made using PVA alone. The aqueous LiNO3 solution served as the electrolyte in three-electrode system. A specific capacitance of 359 F g−1 for a current density of 0.5 A g−1 as well as an areal capacitance of 143.8 F cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 current density was obtained for the material made with PVA:PVP (1:1).
