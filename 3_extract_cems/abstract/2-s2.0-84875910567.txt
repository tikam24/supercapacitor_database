The supercapacitor for power applications is a new device. Supercapacitor modeling is very important part of improving the reliability and power quality of the public electricity supply system. This paper put forward a new equivalent circuit model of asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor. The model consists of the battery model and the double layer capacitor model. A method to identify the circuit parameters is presented. Measurements of asymmetric hybrid supercapacitors for power applications are presented, analyzed, and the equivalent circuit response is compared with experimental results.
