This paper is the first study of the application of non-metallic element modified metal-organic frameworks in supercapacitors. Three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks modified by non-metallic element have a novel flower cluster structure, which effectively improve the structural stability and the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors. The electrochemical performances of the materials modified by the vulcanizing agent are particularly significant with a high specific capacitance of 1453.5F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (retention rate of 89.23% after 5000 cycles). In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor S@Ni-MOF//AC also shows a high energy density of 56.85 Wh kg−1 at power density of 480 W kg−1 and good cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 86.67% after 20,000 cycles at current density 5 A g−1. As a result, metal-organic frameworks materials modified by the non-metallic element make up for the crystal defects, which can be used as promising electrode materials for practical applications.
