MnO2 nanowires were electrodeposited onto carbon nanotube (CNT) paper by a cyclic voltammetric technique. The as-prepared MnO2 nanowire/CNT composite paper (MNCCP) can be used as a flexible electrode for electrochemical supercapacitors. Electrochemical measurements showed that the MNCCP electrode displayed specific capacitances as high as 167.5 F g-1 at a current density of 77 mA g-1. After 3000 cycles, the composite paper can retain more than 88% of initial capacitance, showing good cyclability. The CNT paper in the composite acted as a good conductive and active substrate for flexible electrodes in supercapacitors, and the nanowire structure of the MnO2 could facilitate the contact of the electrolyte with the active materials, and thus increase the capacitance.
