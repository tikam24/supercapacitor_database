We have developed two types of advanced capacitors with much higher energy density than conventional electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). One is a nano-hybrid capacitor (NHC), and another is a 3rd generation capacitor (Gen. 3 Cap.). The NHC and 3rd generation capacitor realize 2 to 3 and 15 times higher energy density than EDLCs, respectively. In addition, these devices have a capacitor-like characteristics such as high input power density and excellent low temperature performance. Accordingly, these capacitors are considered to be suitable energy storage devices for energy regeneration systems in automobile.
