A straightforward preparation of activated carbon from disused composite panels by microwave assisted K2CO3 activation has been attempted. The physical and chemical properties of obtained activated carbons were characterized using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis and electrochemical performance in order to explore the effects of microwave radiation power on structure and performance of activated carbons. As the research shows that the resulting activated carbon possesses the best electrochemical performance with specific capacitor of 246 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 and energy retention of 90% after 10000 cycles at a radiation power of 1200 W. The results illustrated that microwave radiation power reasonably influenced the pore structure as well as the electrochemical performance.
