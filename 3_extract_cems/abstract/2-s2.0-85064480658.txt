Thiourea formaldehyde resin has been condensation-polymerized in the polypyrrole hollow spheres suspension to obtain TF/PPy. Then, TF/PPy has been carbonized at 750 °C to acquire CTF/PPy composites. Scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope images were used to observe the morphology of the samples, TGA, XRD, Raman, XPS, and BET were used to analyze the structure of the materials. The results show PPy was blended with the TF resin, and the obtained CTF/PPy exhibited improved supercapacitive performances compared with CTF. The specific capacitance of CTF/PPy is 226.8 F g −1 at the current density of 1 A g −1 according to GCD curves, much higher than that of CTF. More interestingly, the cycling retention of CTF/PPy electrode at the current density of 10 A g −1 is up to 120.2% after 10 000 cycles. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
