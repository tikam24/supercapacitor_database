The properties and applications of nanocrystalline ruthenium supercapacitor materials were discussed. The factor improving the capacitance of ruthenium containing materials was the electrochemical behavior of the matrices used to dissolve the ruthenium. Ruthenium oxide has a very high charge storage capacity when used in aqueous solutions. The ruthenium material produced by ball milling had a specific surface area of only a few m2g-1 and could be agglomerated into larger grains so it can reduce the electro chemical surface area.
