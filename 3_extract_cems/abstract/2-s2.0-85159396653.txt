The electrochemical efficiency of multiple hybrid electrode substances, such as rGO/MnO2, rGO/MnS2, and rGO/MnO2/MnS2, is improved by adding rGO to MnS2 and MnO2. The developed composites are analyzed using SEM/EDX, TEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman methods. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic measurements are utilized to investigate the specific capacitance and charge–discharge stability of the synthesized rGO/MnO2, rGO/MnS2, and rGO/MnO2/MnS2 electrode materials. When electrochemical performance is measured at 20 mV/s, rGO/MnO2/MnS2 performs better (650 F/g) than rGO/MnS2 (426 F/g), rGO/MnO2 (339 F/g), and rGO (155 F/g). The R ct and R f measurements of the rGO/MnO2/MnS2 electrode were determined to be 16.6 and 6.4 Ω cm2, respectively. These values, which are smaller than those of the rGO electrode (89.7 Ω cm2 and 67.5 Ω cm2), show that the rGO/MnO2/MnS2 displays a lesser impedance, which results in outstanding electrochemical characteristics. The capacity retention of this rGO/MnO2/MnS2 hybrid electrode is enhanced cycling stability, with a value of 97.69% up to 10,000 cycles at 1 A/g. The rGO/MnO2/MnS2 materials are estimated to have energy and power densities of 437 Wh/kg and 3146 W/kg, respectively. The rGO/MnO2/MnS2 combination is shown to be an excellent material for anodes in supercapacitors because of the beneficial relationship between MnS2, rGO, and MnO2. Greater area of surface, a quicker diffusion of ions route, excellent charge transfer, and—most significantly—increased rGO capacitance are among these benefits.
