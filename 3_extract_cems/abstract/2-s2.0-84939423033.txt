Using CNFs as the substrate, CNFs/RGOn films were prepared by layer-by-layer assembly method. Further, a new supercapacitor (S-RGP) was fabricated by these CPGP thin film electrodes which were got by in-situ polymerization of PANI on CNFs/GG films. The characteristics of CRGP film electrodes, such as absorbance, crystallization feature and configuration were analyzed by XRD, UV-visible spectrophotometry and SEM. The CV curve, GCD and EIS electrochemical characteristics of supercapacitors S-RGP were further tested. The results indicate that the surface of CRGP films was nonuniform, and some active substance kept in the gap between PANI and substrates paper leading to less internal resistance in S-RGP supercapacitor. Electrochemical characteristics measurement shows that the S-RGP supercapacitor has lower ESR, and its capacitance performance cannot be affected by bending because of relative flexibility. S-RGP supercapacitors have weak electrochromic properties, for the PANI film is thick and thus lower opaque by in-situ polymerization process of PANI on CNFs/RGOn films.
