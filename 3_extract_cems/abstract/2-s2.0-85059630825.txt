Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials have shown great potential of application in energy conversion and storage. In this work, a novel nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanomaterial has been synthesized by directly pyrolyzing the tetrazine/pyridine/triazine-containing porous organic polymer under inert conditions. Benefiting from the high surface area (574 m2 g-1) and enriched nitrogen doping (5.63 at. % N), the obtained porous carbon nanoparticles (TPOP-900) used as metal-free ORR electrocatalyst possesses better electrochemical performance (E0 = 11 mV; E1/2 = -90 mV vs Ag/AgCl) than that of Pt/C. Moreover, the TPOP-900 served as electrode material for supercapacitor; it exhibits relatively high specific capacitance (250 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (95.75% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
