In this paper, we demonstrate the preparation of a flexible poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) -poly (styrenesulfonate)/reduced graphene oxide (PEDOT-PSS/RGO) film with a layered structure via a simple vacuum filtered method as a high performance electrochemical electrode. The PEDOT-PSS/RGO films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The results indicate that a layer-ordered structure is constructed in this nanocomposite during the vacuum filtering process. The electrochemical performances of the flexible films are characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results reveal that a 193.7 F/g highly specific capacitance of nanocomposite film is achieved at a current density of 500 mA/g. This flexible and self-supporting nanocomposite film exhibits excellent cycling stability, and the capacity retention is 90.6 % after 1000 cycles, which shows promising application as high-performance electrode materials for flexible energy-storage devices.
