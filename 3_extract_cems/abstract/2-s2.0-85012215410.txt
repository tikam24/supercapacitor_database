Nitrogen/sulfur co-doped and hierarchical porous graphene hydrogels (DHGHs) are prepared by facile self-assembly process. The results show that the pH values of preparation process significantly affect the microstructures and electrochemical properties of DHGHs and the mechanism has been discussed. The as-prepared DHGHs can be directly used as binder-free electrodes to assemble full-cell supercapacitor devices. It is surprising that the DHGHs prepared at basic condition (DHGH-12) delivers a specific capacitance of 251 F g−1(0.5 A g−1). Moreover, the DHGH-12 shows rectangular cyclic voltammetry shape at a high scan rate of 3000 mV s−1and symmetrical galvanostatic charge/discharge curves at 100 A g−1which exhibits a specific capacitance of 136.5 F g−1, a high energy density of 4.74 Wh kg−1and high power density of 25.47 kW kg−1. Additionally, DHGH-12 presents superior cycling stability (96.8% retention after 2000 cycles at 20 A g−1) in 6 M KOH solution. Therefore, the novel DHGHs can be considered as promising candidate for high energy density supercapacitors at high rates.
