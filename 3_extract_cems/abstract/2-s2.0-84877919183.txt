Wind is random and intermittent. With the increasing proportion of wind power in power system, large-scale wind power will aggravate the imbalance of the active power output in power systems and influence power quality. This paper analyzed the natural wind characteristics and broke down the active wind power fluctuation, combined with wind power generation plan. A control method of the active power fluctuation was presented based on energy storage technology. Storage technology and PWM converter technology were applied flexibly, according to the technical rule for connecting wind farm to power system, which can bi-directionally adjust the active wind power fluctuation rapidly and accurately, and at the same time eliminates the influence of the fluctuation outside the range of active power. The experimental results verify the correctness of the control strategy. It is an effective solution for regulating and controlling wind power fluctuation, which can not only improve the quality of active wind power, but also save the capacity of the storage system.
