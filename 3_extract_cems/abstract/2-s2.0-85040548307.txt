A low-level distributednonlinear controller for a DC MicroGrid integrated in a Train Station is introduced in this paper. A number of elements are connected to the MicroGrid: two different transient time scale renewables (braking recovery and photovoltaic), two kinds of storage acting at different time-scale (a battery and a supercapacitor), and a load. The model is developed and a complete stability analysis is investigated: power balance and voltage grid stability requirements are both met. A System of Systems approach is utilized to develop the control laws for the DC/DC converters in order to fulfil the dedicated objective each controller has. Simulation results showing the desired grid behaviour are presented.
