Plate-like CuS particles were prepared by a facile chemical synthesis method. The effects of thiourea contents on phase, morphology and electrochemical properties were studied by modern characterization techniques. A mechanism was proposed for morphology evolution from spherical to plate-like with the increase of amounts of thiourea. The precipitation of [Cu4(tu)9](NO3)4·4H2O complex was postulated as a reason for the crystallization of plate-like CuS particles which showed a pseudocapacitor behavior with a specific capacitance of 517 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The appropriate electrochemical characteristics were attributed to the unique structure of plate-like CuS particles, improving the charge transport and electrolyte diffusion.
