The rapid development of wearable and portable electronics has dramatically increased the application for miniaturized energy storage components. Stamping micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with planar interdigital configurations are considered as a promising candidate to meet the requirements. In this review, recent progress of the different stamping materials and various stamping technologies are first discussed. The merits of each material, manufacturing process of each stamping method and the properties of stamping MSCs are scrutinized, respectively. Further insights on technical difficulties and scientific challenges are finally demonstrated, including the limited thickness of printed electrodes, poor overlay accuracy and printing resolution.
