Cobalt vanadate is a kind of promising electrode material for pseudo-supercapacitors because of their higher electrical conductivity, better electrochemical activity, and prominent specific capacitance than single metal oxides. In this paper, cobalt pyrovanadate (Co2V2O7) was primarily fabricated by a facile environment-friendly ionothermal method using a green deep eutectic solvent (DES) and followed the heat treatment in the air. The eutectic mixture discussed here was consisted of a hydrogen bond donor (urea) and acceptor (ChCl) in a 2:1 molar ratio. The as-prepared Co2V2O7 was porous hexagonal nanoplatelets, and its electrochemical performances were characterized by cycle voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and cycling stability tests in a three-electrode system with 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. The specific capacitance of the synthesized Co2V2O7 revealed 304 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Surprisingly, it remained an excellent cycle performance with 103% in 100 charge/discharge cycles. Therefore, we have successfully presented a deep eutectic solvent derived routine to prepare porous hexagonal Co2V2O7 nanoplatelets electrode material.
