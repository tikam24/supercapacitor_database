A unique sandwich structure of Ni3S2/RGO/Ni3S2 consisting of Ni3S2 nanosheets was designed and constructed on nickel foam (NF) by a one-step hydrothermal process. The lower Ni3S2 layer was converted in situ from the Ni foam substrate, while the upper Ni3S2 layer with vertical nanosheets resulted from Ni2+ ions in the solution. This Ni3S2/RGO/Ni3S2/NF nanocomposite was directly utilized as a supercapacitor electrode, which possessed a high areal mass loading of 5.2 mg cm-2, and superior performance: a specific capacitance of up to 16.82 F cm-2 (i.e., 3234.62 F g-1) at a current density of 20 mA cm-2 (3.85 A g-1) and 90% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at the high rate of 100 mA cm-2 (19.23 A g-1).
