In order to increase the electrode surface area and enhance the charge storage capacity, we study the micro electro mechanical system technology to fabricate three-dimensional high aspect ratio micro-electrode structure based on glass. The anodic constant potential method is employed to deposit manganese oxide as electroactive substances on the micro-electrode surface. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge method are both used to prepare electrode electrochemical performance testing, with a two-dimensional electrode without structure for comparison. Experimental results show that three-dimensional electrode structure can effectively enhance the charge storage capacity. At 1.0 mA/cm 2 charge-discharge density, the three-dimensional electrode shows a capacitance of 17.88 mF/cm 2, seven times higher than the two-dimensional electrode. Â© 2012 Chinese Physical Society.
