Porous carbon material UlaC-950-HF(Ula stands for Carex meyeriana Kunth, C is short for carbo-nized, 950 is the optimized temperature, and HF is the etchant) was prepared through direct carbonization of Carex meyeriana Kunth after necessary impurity removal. The precursor self-activated in the process of pyrolysis. The electrochemical measurements of the UlaC-950-HF sample and several other carbonized biomass-based porous carbon materials were carried out. The results revealed that the capacitance of UlaC-950-HF was 113 F/g. In addition, the electrode showed excellent cycling stability as its specific capacitance decreased only by 4 F/g after 4000 voltammetry cycles, showing its potential of being applied in the supercapacitor electrode material.
