A simple and effective mixing carbonization-activation process was developed to prepare rice hull-derived porous Si–carbon materials. The morphologies and pore structures of the materials were controlled effectively without any loading or additions at various carbonization temperatures. The structures of the samples changed from large pores and thick walls after 800◦C carbonization to small pores and thin walls after 1000◦C carbonization. An additional alkali activation–carbonization process led to coral reef-like structures surrounded by squama in the sample that underwent 900◦C carbonization (Act-RH-900). This optimal material (Act-RH-900) had a large specific surface area (768 m2 g−1), relatively stable specific capacitance (150.8 F g−1), high energy density (31.9 Wh kg−1), and high-power density (309.2 w kg−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte, as well as a good rate performance and high stability (capacitance retention > 87.88% after 5000 cycles). The results indicated that Act-RH-900 is a promising candidate for capacitive applications. This work overcomes the restrictions imposed by the complex internal structure of biomass, implements a simple reaction environment, and broadens the potential applicability of biomass waste in the field of supercapacitors.
