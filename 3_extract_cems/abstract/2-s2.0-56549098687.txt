This article will propose different energy storage systems, ranging from 0.91 kWh to 1.56 kWh, suitable for a 30 m long tram. To configure the system regarding energy content, voltage variation, maximum current and power losses, a model of the tram, network and substations power flow has been developed in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Results obtained in energy savings at substation level vary from 24% to 27,6% under the same driving profile and auxiliaries load; while at the end-of-life of supercapacitors, the range varies from 18,1% to 25,1% depending on the super capacitor module used and vehicle load. The effect of the power converter between the energy storage system and the pantograph will be evaluated in terms of efficiency and rated power. Â© 2008 IEEE.
