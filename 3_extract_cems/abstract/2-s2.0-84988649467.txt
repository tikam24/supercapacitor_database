Nitrogen-rich carbon material derived from carbon self-repairing g-C3N4 is self-assembled with graphene oxide (GO) to form a porous structure. Different from the pristine g-C3N4, which has scarcely been employed in supercapacitors because of its low charge mobility, the carbon self-repairing g-C3N4 (C-C3N4) shows an improved electrochemical activity. After carbon-repairing, a delocalized big π-bond can be formed by the homogeneous C-substitution for N atoms or the formation of new interstitial C-N bond. The extending π-conjugation planar layer of C-C3N4 possesses a closer contact with GO to form a three-dimensional (3D) pore structure, which ensures good mobility for electrons and quick access for electrolytes. Under the optimum C-repairing content of 5.99 at%, the C-C3N4@rGO exhibited high specific capacity of 379.7 F g-1 and energy density of 52.7 W h kg-1 at a current density of 0.25 A g-1. Moreover, the electrode kept 85% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles at a high constant current density of 10 A g-1. The active sites of pseudocapacitance can be confirmed in the oxygen-containing groups and the carbon atoms close to the nitrogen by the XPS results.
