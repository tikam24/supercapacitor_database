LiMn2O4/activated carbon composite materials with different proportion were synthesized. And the electrochemical performances of composite electrode materials were investigated in 1 mol/L Li2O4 solution by means of different electrochemical techniques. The cyclic voltammetric curves show that the capacitances of composite electrode materials include double-layer capacitance of activated carbon and the Faraday capacitance of the electrochemical reaction of LiMn2O4. After the composite electrode is synthesized, the response current increases in the potential range of 0 to 0.6 V. In addition, the response current reaches to peak value with 80% activated carbon content. From the charge-discharge curves, it is obvious that the discharge curve of the composite electrode with 80% activated carbon content is linearity relation, and the composite electrode represents good capacitance performance as well the capacitance increases 25% with compounding only 20% LiMn2O4. The results of AC impedance testing indicate that the solution resistance of composite electrode with 80% activated carbon content is only 0.1 Î©, which represents ideal capacitance performance.
