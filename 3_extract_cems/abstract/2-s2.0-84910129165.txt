Novel biological carbon materials with highly ordered microstructure and large pore volume have caused great interest due to their multifunctional properties. Herein, we report the preparation of an interconnected porous carbon material by carbonizing the organic matrix of mollusc shell. The obtained three-dimensional carbon skeleton consists of hexangular and tightly arranged channels, which endow it with efficient electrolyte penetration and fast electron transfer, enable the mollusc shell based macroporous carbon material (MSBPC) to be an excellent conductive scaffold for supercapacitor electrodes. By growing NiCo2O4 nanowires on the obtained MSBPC, NiCo2O4/MSBPC composites were synthesized. When used on supercapacitor electrode, it exhibited anomalously high specific capacitance (âˆ¼1696 F/g), excellent rate performance (with the capacity retention of 58.6% at 15 A/g) and outstanding cycling stability (88% retention after 2000 cycles). Furthermore, an all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor was also assembled based on this NiCo2O4/MSBPC electrode and showed good electrochemical performance with an energy density of 8.47 Wh/kg at 1 A/g, good stability over 10000 cycles. And we believe that more potential applications beyond energy storage can be developed based on this MSBPC.
