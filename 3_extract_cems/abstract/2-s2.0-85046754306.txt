The synthesis of chelated ruthenium(II) complex type Ru(Î·6-HMB) (NHC)Cl (NHC=N-heterocyclic carbene, HMB = hexamethylbenzene) is presented. The ruthenium(II)-NHC complex 6 was obtained in good yield and was fully characterised by NMR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and HRMS analysis. Electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry (CV) revealed reversible redox behaviour at the ruthenium centre in 6. DFT studies and the catalytic activity of complex 6 on transfer hydrogenation reaction of aryl ketones are also presented. The potential hybrid capacitor applications of Ru-NHC complex is discussed and reported firstly in the literature. It was found that the highest performance was found at 20.1 F/g, which is a promising result for energy storage applications.
