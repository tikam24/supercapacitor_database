In the view of developing bi-functional electrode material for integrated electronic devices, the efficient NiFe: WS2 core-shell nanocube electrode was designed for Dye-sensitized Solar cells and Supercapacitor applications. In this work, NiFe: WS2 core-shelled nanocubes were obtained with the assistance of the Kirkendall effect under probe sonication techniques. The NiFe: WS2–2 as counter electrode in Dye-sensitized solar cells yields a power conversion efficiency of 6.4 %, which is higher than bare NiFe (1.5 %) and Platinum counter electrode (4.1 %). Whereas in Supercapacitors, NiFe: WS2–2 showed a remarkable specific capacitance performance of 670.37 F/g, at a Current density of 1 A/g, and demonstrated capacitance retention of 90.05 %, over 5000 cycles. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits an energy density of 56.4 Wh/kg and a power density of 1015 W/kg, at 1 A/g current density. The constructed NiFe: WS2–2//AC device exhibits capacitance retention and coulombic efficiency of 82.60 % and 97.36 %, respectively in the stability test after 6000 cycles. The above fascinating results emphasize that core-shell structured NiFe: WS2–2 is a promising electrode for Dye-sensitized solar cells and Supercapacitor application, thereby paving the way for advancement in hi-tech electronic devices.
