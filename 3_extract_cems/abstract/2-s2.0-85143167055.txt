In this paper, a fuel cell (FC) hybrid emergency system is presented. It contains fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors which are felicitous for different conveyance applications. Abbreviating the hydrogen consumption and incrementing the lifetime of potency sources are the key factors of each energy management strategy (EMS). An incipient proposed EMS depending on a conventional proportional-integral (PI) controller is presented considering FC efficiency to ascertain the operating of the FC stack within its maximum efficiency region. Regarding tunning the controller gains (Kp, Ki), A proposed hybrid metaheuristic optimization technique denominated JSPSOBAT is presented which coalesces jellyfish (JS) optimizer, particle swarm optimizer (PSO), and BAT optimizer. To validate the overall execution of the JSPSOBAT technique, a comparative study with other single and hybrid metaheuristic optimization techniques is presented. The proposed EMS is compared with other EMSs such as state machine control, classical PI control, equivalent consumption minimization, and external energy maximization. The results show that the proposed technique produces the best performance.
