In this paper, ZnO microspheres, which are composed of irregular nanoparticles, have been synthesized successfully from a metal-organic precursor. The average diameter is about 3.5 μm and the specific surface area is 7.53 m2 g−1. Measured by electrochemical tests as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the ZnO powders show high specific capacitances (1017.5 Fg−1 at 5 Ag−1 and 562.5 Fg−1 at 50 Ag−1, respectively) and excellent cycling stability (the specific capacitance was kept at 631.2 Fg−1 and 89.2 % retention after 3000 cycles at 18 Ag−1). These results show that the microspherical ZnO could be a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
