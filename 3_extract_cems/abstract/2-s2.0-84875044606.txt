Ni2P nanoparticles grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were successfully synthesized via the low-temperature solid state reaction method and investigated as electrochemical pseudocapacitor materials for potential energy storage applications. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared Ni 2P/rGO is 2266 F g-1 and the Ni2P/rGO composite also exhibits superior cycling performance when they are used as the capacitor materials. The as-prepared Ni2P/rGO sample demonstrates interesting supercapacitive properties with high capacitance and good cycling performance. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
