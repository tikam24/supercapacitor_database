Full-temperature all-solid-state flexible symmetrical fiber supercapacitors (FSCs) are assembled by using montmorillonite flake/polyvinyl alcohol organic hydrogel (F-MMT/PVA OHGE) as the electrolyte and separator and Ti3C2Tx/ANF-5% (T/A-5) fiber as the electrode, in which T/A-5 fiber is prepared by using delaminated Ti3C2Tx nanosheets as assembled units and 5% of aramid nanofiber (ANF) as the functional additive using a wet spinning method in a coagulated bath with 0.5 m FeCl2 solution. The T/A-5 hybrid fiber exhibits a specific capacity of 807 F cm−3 in 3 m H2SO4 electrolyte, a superior mechanical strength of 104 MPa, and a high conductivity of 1025 S cm−1. The assembled F-MMT/PVA OHGE T/A-5 FSC not only shows a specific capacitance of 295 F cm−3 and a capacitance retention of 91% at a current density of 5 A cm−3 after 10 000 charging/discharging cycles, but also a maximum volumetric energy density of 26.2 mWh cm−3. Meanwhile, the assembled device displays good flexibility and excellent capacitance in a wide temperature range of −40 to 80 °C, the electrochemical performance of the FSC is maintained under varying degrees of bending. This study provides an effective strategy for designing and assembling of full-temperature all-solid-state symmetrical flexible FSCs with the optimal balance of capacitive performance and flexibility.
