It is quite challenging to prepare subnanometer porous materials from traditional porous precursors, and use of supramolecules as carbon sources was seldom reported due to the complex preparation and purification processes. We explore a facile one-pot method to fabricate supramolecular coordination compounds as carbon sources. The resultant CB[6]-derived carbons (CBC) have a high N content of 7.0-22.0%, surface area of 552-861 m2 g-1, and subnano/mesopores. The CBC electrodes have a narrow size distribution at 5.9 Å, and the supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 117.1 Wh kg-1 and a potential window of over 3.8 V in a two-electrode system in the ionic liquid (MMIMBF4) electrolyte with appropriate cationic (5.8 Å) and anionic (2.3 Å) diameter. This work presents the facile fabrication of novel supermolecule cucurbituril subnanoporous carbon materials and the smart design of "pores and balls"for high-performance energy storage systems.
