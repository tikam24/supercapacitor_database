Bio-derived carbon with distinctive electrical conductivity, electrochemical property, and surface chemistry plays a vital role in the field of energy storage applications. In present work, activated carbon (AC) from D. stramonium seed pod in a cost-effective manner and the electrochemical properties were improved by self-doping of heteroatoms (O, N, S). The 1 M of KOH-induced, O-N-S-doped AC possesses high surface area of 1390 m2/g, 3D-interconnected network-like structure. The O-N-S-doped bio-derived AC activated by 1 M of KOH electrode exhibits specific capacitance of 665.8 F/g at 5 mV/s in three-electrode system and 166.6 F/g at 5 mV/s in supercapacitor (SC) device. The cyclic stability of Z3 was found to be 65% for 5000 cycles in three-electrode systems and 79.07% remains after 1000 cycles in a two-electrode device. The fabricated SC device delivers high energy density of 29.25 Wh/kg at a power density of 2700 W/kg. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
