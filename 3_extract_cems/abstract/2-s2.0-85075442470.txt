Vanadium nitride is highly desirable for their good electrochemical performance and wide work potential window, but they are cramped practical applications in supercapacitors due to poor cycling stability. Herein a combined strategy is exploited to fabricate coralloid-like nanostructure vanadium nitride/carbon (VN/C) via a facile hydrothermal method. The structural characterization displayed that nano-VN was uniformly distributed in the carbon scaffold materials to improve the electrode behavior. Those composites exhibited a wide voltage window of −1.1 to 0 V with a specific capacitance of 385 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and exceptional cycling stability (88.9% retention after 10000 cycles). The two-electrode system based on VN/C electrodes obtains a high energy density of 24.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1050 W kg−1. The device also shows perfect cycling stability with 93.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. The coralloid-like VN/C electrode materials can be used in practical applications of the high-performance energy storage device.
