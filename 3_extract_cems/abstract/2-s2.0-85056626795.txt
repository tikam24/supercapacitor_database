Flexible and foldable electronic devices require flexible energy-storage components. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) could store charges without chemical reaction, have fast charging/discharging speed, and high power density. Carbon-based materials such as activated carbon, single-wall carbon nanotubes, and graphene have large ion-reachable surface area and effective electronic transport passages, which enable capacitive behavior with high power density and energy density. An electric double-layer capacitor made using pencil-drawn electrodes on commercial copy papers is reported here. Pencil for electrodes is made with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with well-connected structure. These AgNPs/rGO hybrid structures give high conductivity and reliable charging/discharging properties. The ECs are based on pencil-drawn electrodes on copy papers and biopolymer electrolytes, so these can realize ultra-low cost, foldable, and biodegradable energy sources for flexible and foldable electronic devices in the future.
