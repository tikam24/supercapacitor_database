Al3+-doped δ-MnO2 nano-powders with different doping ratios were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The influence of Al3+-doping on the δ-MnO2 crystal structure and electrochemical performance was characterized by X-ray diffraction，scanning electron microscopy，transmission electron microscopy，X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy，cyclic voltammetry，electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The results suggested that Al3+ ions entered into the crystal lattice of δ-MnO2 to replace some Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions，which enhanced the electrical conductivity and structural stability of δ-MnO2，and thus significantly improved the electro⁃ chemical performance. When the molar ratio of Al3+/Mn2+ in the precursor was 0.45，the synthesized product （A0.45M）showed the best electrochemical performance. A0.45M delivered a specific capacitance of 207.61 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g，which was 2.4 times the capacitance of the pure δ-MnO（2 A0M）. Moreover，A0.45M could maintain a high specific capacitance of 100.81 F/g even after 10000 cycles at 10 A/g，with capacity retention ratio of 81.33%.
