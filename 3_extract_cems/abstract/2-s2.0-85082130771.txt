Taking ast and-alone dc microgrid with multiple hybrid energy storage systems(HESS) as the research object, a hierarchical coordinated control method of HESS based on event-triggered mechanism is proposed. The local layer adopts a virtual resistance droop control and realizes the power distribution of battery and supercapacitor by using low-pass filter. The control strategies based on SOC are proposed to achieve coordinated and safe operation of HESSs. The distributed control layer uses the sparse communication network to regulate the average voltage and proportional current of each HESS to improve the problems of large bus voltage deviation and poor power-sharing accuracy caused by virtual resistance and line resistance. On the basis of the above research, an event-triggered control method based on periodic communication mechanism is proposed. The derivation of triggering function is introduced in detail by using Lyapunov stability theory. By setting pre-judgment thresholds of the triggering function, the triggered times is further reduced during the steady-state of the system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by Matlab/Simulink software.
