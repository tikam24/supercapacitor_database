Activated carbons (AC) from coffee bean waste were prepared by chemical activation, using as activating compounds potassium hydroxide (KOH) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) respectively, impregnation times of 24 and 48 hours, 600 째C and 700 째C as temperatures calcination. After that coals samples were synthesized they were doped with nickel oxide (NiO) in order to modify the electrical properties of the AC, later they were characterized (physical adsorption of using N2, FT-IR, XRD). The AC/NiO composites were prepared by the chemical method and the electrodes were compacted into pellet forms, which were placed in a two-electrode cell using 2M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as electrolyte. Activity electrochemical was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic chronopotentiometry. Finally, the specific capacitance of the supercapacitors (SCS) was determined from AC/NiO. Results of AC/NiO-48-700 째C-KOH and AC/NiO-48-700 째C-K2CO3 materials showed maximum capacitances of: 405. 40 and 394.73 F/g respectively.
