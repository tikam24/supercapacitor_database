In this paper, a distributed energy storage design within an electric vehicle for smarter mobility applications is introduced. Idea of body integrated super-capacitor technology, design concept and its implementation is proposed in the paper. Individual super-capacitor cells are connected in series or parallel to form a string connection of super-capacitors with the associated management unit to form a panel. These super-capacitor panels are shaped to fit the alternative concept of vehicle design, and it solves the design issues and prepares for configurable electric vehicles. Body integration of super-capacitors enhances the acceleration, and regenerative braking performances of the electric vehicle increases the operating life of the Li-ion battery and improves space utilization by giving more area for the main energy source, the Li-ion battery. Integrating super-capacitor into the car body involves special packaging technology to minimize space and promotes distributed energy storage within a vehicle. This pioneering design encourages future configurable electric vehicles. Model of both the Li-ion battery and the super-capacitor employed is studied with its series internal resistance determined at various C-rates. Loss and the efficiency analysis of the bi-directional converter, traits of body integrated super-capacitors system and control of the interleaved bi-directional converter to regulate the power-sharing in the hybrid energy storage system is presented.
