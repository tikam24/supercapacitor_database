The properties of the electric double layer (EDL) are essential for various fields of science and technological applications. In this short review, I discuss the publications devoted to investigating the behavior of electrolyte in contact with rough electrodes. Since the EDL is formed at the electrolyte-electrode interface, the surface geometry directly affects ion distributions. Key effects of rough electrodes are a significant increase in the accumulated charge; a change in the dependence of the differential capacitance on the applied potential; and a constant phase element contribution to the impedance. Finally, I highlight the limitations of existing approaches and suggest possible solutions for improvement.
