Spherical Mn 3 O 4 nanoparticles were synthesized by microwave assisted reflux method at different reaction times (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min). The single phase formation of Mn 3 O 4 nanoparticles was identified through XRD analysis. The FT-IR and Raman spectra revealed the presence of functional groups of Mn 3 O 4 and further support the XRD results. The spherical morphology of Mn 3 O 4 was identified via SEM analysis. The cyclic voltammetry analysis implies that 15 min synthesized Mn 3 O 4 (MN-15) shows the higher specific capacitance of 135 F g -1 among all the prepared Mn 3 O 4 electrodes. The EIS spectra of MN-15 substantiate the less charge-transfer resistance (R ct ) of 0.553 Ω, when compared with the other samples. The discharge capacitance of MN-15 was 103 F g -1 at 0.5 mA cm -2 in 1 M NaNO 3 solution. The cycling stability curve over 100 cycles implies that the discharge capacitance is increased from 47 to 68 F g -1 at 5 mA cm -2 . This capacitance enhancement during cycling is due to the influence of phase or morphological variation of Mn 3 O 4 electrodes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
