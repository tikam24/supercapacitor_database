Due to their outstanding electrochemical properties, transition metal sulfides and hydroxides are often used as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. The Mn-doped Co(OH)2/Ni3S4 electrode material in this study, due to the synergistic reaction mechanism among Co(OH)2 and Ni3S4 and the increased active sites by the addition of Mn, the Mn-Co(OH)2/Ni3S4 exhibits excellent electrochemical property. The electrochemical performance of the Mn-Co(OH)2/Ni3S4 hybrid electrode was measured in an electrode cell made of 2 M KOH solution, showing a superior specific capacitance of 1107.0 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, in addition to the excellent capacity retention rate at 10 A g−1 is 72.7 % of that at 1 A g−1. The performance of the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) assembled with Mn-Co(OH)2/Ni3S4 compound and activated carbon (AC) was measured under the same electrolyte conditions, anwell-specificific capacity (157.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) was achieved, along with superior long-term stable charge/discharge capability (88.9 % of the original specific capacity after 35,000 cycles at 8 A g−1). Meanwhile, the most practical application is when the power density of 410.4 W kg−1, the assembled HSC device has an energy storage capacity of 58.8 W h kg−1, revealing that the developed Mn-Co(OH)2/Ni3S4 has great application potential for supercapacitors in the future.
