In this work, N, S co-doped microporous carbon materials were successfully prepared using human hair and sucrose as carbon precursors via a two-step method that combined hydrothermal treatment and post-KOH activation. The morphology, pore texture, and surface chemical properties of the activated carbon materials were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The electrochemical capacitive behavior of the prepared carbons was systematically studied in 6 mol∙L-1 KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific surface area of the prepared carbons was found to be 1849.4 m2∙g-1 with a porosity that mainly consisted of micropores. Nitrogen and sulfur contents varied from 1.6% to 2.5% and from 0.2% to 0.5% (atomic fraction (x)), respectively. The synergistic-positive effect of N, O, and S-containing groups caused the prepared carbons to exhibit a large pseudo-capacitance. High specific capacitances of up to 200 F∙g-1 at 0.2 A∙g-1 were observed, response to an energy density of 6.9 Wh∙kg-1. At a power density of 10000 W∙kg-1, the energy density was found to be 4.1 Wh∙kg-1. The present work highlights the significance of this new strategy to prepare N, S co-doped carbon materials from renewable biomass.
