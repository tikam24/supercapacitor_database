A simple and efficient way has been developed to decorate multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with RuO2 nanoparticles for use of electrochemical supercapacitor. In this method, RuO2 nanoparticles was directly synthesized and attached onto MWCNTs in the mixture with RuCl3 solution by microwave-assisted irradiation. Energy dispersive X-rays analysis (EDXA) elucidated the presence of ruthenium oxide in the as-prepared composites. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results showed that RuO2 nanoparticles had the narrow size distribution and were attached on MWCNTs. Cyclic voltammetry results demonstrated that RuO2/MWCNTs had significantly greater specific capacitance than that of the pristine MWCNTs in the same medium. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
