Although polyaniline (PANI) demonstrates a great potential as high performance pseudocapacitor materials for supercapacitors, poor cycle stability due to structural instability is the major hurdle for practical applications. Therefore, designing PANI-based supercapacitors with structure matching performances is highly desirable. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) core-shell Fe3O4/PANI coaxial heterogeneous nanonets were rationally fabricated via magnetic field induced self-assembly and in situ polymerization. The as-prepared Fe3O4/PANI nanonets were successfully employed as supercapacitor electrode materials. With the magnetic field derived nanochains from Fe3O4 microspheres as the framework for PANI growth and strain buffer support and the PANI nanofibers as the electrochemically active part, these nanonets realized high specific capacitance, long cycling life, and good rate capability. To be more specific, Fe3O4/PANI nanonets displayed a specific capacitance of 620 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution and capacitance retention of 85% after 2000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1. Compared to other Fe3O4/PANI hybrids, the obtained better electrochemical performances of these Fe3O4/PANI nanonets were a result of the complementary contributions of both componential structures in the designed composite electrode. The strategy renders a possibility for using metallic oxide as the favorable support for conducting polymers to effectively store energy.
