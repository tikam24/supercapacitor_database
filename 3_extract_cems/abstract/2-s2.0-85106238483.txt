With the increasing penetration level of wind turbine generators (WTGs) integrated into the power system, the WTGs are enforced to aid network and fulfill the low voltage ride through (LVRT) requirements during faults. To enhance LVRT capability of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based WTG connected to the grid, this paper presents a novel coordinated control scheme named overspeed-while-storing control for PMSG-based WTG. The proposed control scheme purely regulates the rotor speed to reduce the input power of the machine-side converter (MSC) during slight voltage sags. Contrarily, when the severe voltage sag occurs, the coordinated control scheme sets the rotor speed at the upper-limit to decrease the input power of the MSC at the greatest extent, while the surplus power is absorbed by the supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) so as to reduce its maximum capacity. Moreover, the specific capacity configuration scheme of SCES is detailed in this paper. The effectiveness of the overspeed-while-storing control in enhancing the LVRT capability is validated under different levels of voltage sags and different fault types in MATLAB/Simulink.
