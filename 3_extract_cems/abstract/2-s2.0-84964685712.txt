The proceedings contain 31 papers. The topics discussed include: impact of operating conditions on harmonic and interharmonic emission of PV inverters; a current clamp based high voltage monitoring system; investigation of the thermal drift of open-loop Hall effect current sensor and its improvement; increasing sensitivity on non-contact voltage sensor using time-varying components: a numerical analysis for accuracy assessment; effect of PMU analog input section performance on frequency and ROCOF estimation error; measurement of network harmonic impedance in presence of electronic equipment; HVDC test environment for loss measurements on multilevel converter modules; response of a hybrid supercapacitor - PEM fuel cell system to fast fuel cell energy dips; frequency tracking for efficient phasor measurement based on a CSTFM model; recursive phasor estimation algorithm for synchrophasor measurement; and experimental evaluation of an hybrid communication system architecture for smart grid applications.
