This article presents an artificial neural network (ANN) model of the ultracapacitors based on experimental data acquired from laboratory purposely built test stand for dynamic load cycle tests. Because of a nonlinear description of discharging dynamics in subsequent cycles and a coupling of the terminal voltage and temperatures of a ultracapacitor, the recurrent artificial neural network structure (R-ANN) structure is proposed. As a result, it was presented the accuracy analysis based on the statistical quality indices of proposed modeling approach.
