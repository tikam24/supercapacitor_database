Carbon nanofiber mats (CF) are potential materials for supercapacitors due to their unique properties such as high surface area, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. In this study, CF prepared from new precursors, poly(acrylonitrile-co-crotonic acid) and poly(acrylonitrile-co-itaconic acid-co-crotonic acid) copolymers, were evaluated as substrates for supercapacitors. At first, the precursors were stabilized followed by carbonization. Then the carbon nanofiber mats were used as substrates for in situ polymerization of polyaniline. The electrochemical performances of polyaniline(PANi)/CF nanohybrids were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The PANi/CFs exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 113 F/g and showed better cyclic stabilities over 1000 cycles.
