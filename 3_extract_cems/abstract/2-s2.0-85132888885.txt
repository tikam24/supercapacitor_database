Molybdenum disulfide has a two-dimensional nanosheet-like structure similar to graphene. Through the intercalation of ammonium ions, the interlayer spacing of MoS2 nanosheets is enlarged, which provides a more convenient transport channel for electrolyte ions. Moreover, the intercalation of ammonium ions makes MoS2 form a two-phase crystal structure of 1 T and 2H, which improves the conductivity of the material. The MoS2 nanosheets are loaded with iron oxide nanospheres (MoS2/Fe2O3@CC) via a hydrothermal reaction. This effectively increases the ion transport properties of the electrode material. MoS2 provides an additional intercalation pseudocapacitive reaction for the electrode material, which improves the electrochemical performance of the composite. At the current density of 2 mA/cm2, MoS2/Fe2O3@CC has excellent area specific capacitance (1196.9 mF/cm2) and flexibility. The assembled MoS2/Fe2O3@CC//Ni-MnO2@CC asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 2.03 mWh cm−3 and a power density of 15.6 mW cm−3. The MoS2/Fe2O3@CC anode has a good application value in flexible energy storage materials.
