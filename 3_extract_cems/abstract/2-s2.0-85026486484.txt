Tin oxide (SnO2) nanorod (NR)-fabricated composite capacitors have been developed by vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. The NRs were synthesized on carbon fiber by following hydrothermal synthesis method. Such SnO2 grown woven carbon fiber (WCF) capacitor that contains structural and energy storage functions saves system weight and volume; hence, it could offer benefits to electric vehicle, aerospace, and portable electric device industries. The SnO2-WCF was considered as electrode and exhibited enhanced surface area relative to bare WCF. Energy storage performances of SnO2-WCF capacitors were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, and improved specific capacitance (0.148 F/g), energy density (15.06 mWh/kg), and power density (1.16 W/kg) were achieved at 30 mM of SnO2 concentration. Hence, this study shows that the growth of SnO2 NRs on WCF surfaces offers accessible surface area for electric charge and presented potential application of SnO2-WCF composites to energy storage industries.
