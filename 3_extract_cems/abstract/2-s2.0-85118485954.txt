Increasing the electrochemical stability window and working temperature range of supercapacitor aqueous electrolyte is the major task in order to advance aqueous electrolyte-based supercapacitors. Here, a supramolecular induced new electrolyte of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water co-solvent system is proposed. Adjusting the coordination structure among LiTFSI, DMSO, and water in the electrolyte via supramolecular interactions results in its high ionic conductivity, low viscosity, wide electrochemical stability window, and large working temperature range. The new electrolyte-based supercapacitors can work in 2.40 V working potential and 130 °C working-temperature range from −40 to 90 °C. The devices exhibit good electrochemical performances, especially the energy density over 21 Wh kg−1, which is much higher than that with traditional aqueous electrolytes (<10 Wh kg−1). The work paves a way to develop high-performance aqueous electrolytes for supercapacitors.
