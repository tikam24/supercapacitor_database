Reasonable design of electrode materials is the key to solving the low energy density of the supercapacitors. Transition metal oxide Co3O4 material is commonly used in the field of supercapacitors, but the poor cycle stability limits its practical application. Herein, we report 0.3Mn-Co3O4 nanostructures grown on nickel foam by a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. The morphology of the samples can be regulated by the introduction of different amounts of Mn ions. The specific capacitance reaches 525.5 C/g at 1 A/g. The performance of 0.3Mn-Co3O4 material is significantly improved due to its excellent stability and conductivity, which makes it a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors. A flexible asymmetric device is also fabricated using the sample as the cathode. The assembled capacitor still possesses a desirable cycle stability after charging and discharging of 10,000 times, and its capacitance retention rate can reach 83.71%.
