In this work, a control strategy is developed for different components in DC microgrids where set points for all controllers are determined from an energy management system (EMS). The proposed EMS-based control scheme is developed for DC microgrids with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems as the primary generation units along with energy storage systems. In this work, the concept of dual energy storage systems (DESSs) is used, which includes a battery energy storage system (BESS) and supercapacitor (SC). The main feature of this DESS is to improve the dynamic performance of DC microgrids during severe transients appearing from changes in load demands as well as in the output power from solar PV units. Furthermore, the proposed EMS-based control scheme aims to enhance the lifetime of the BESS in DC microgrids with DESSs and voltage stability as compared to the same without SCs. The proposed EMS-based control strategy uses proportional-integral (PI) controllers to regulate the switching control actions for different converters within the DC microgrid based on the decision obtained from the EMS in order to achieve the desired control objectives. The performance of the proposed scheme was analyzed through simulation results in terms of improving the voltage stability, maintaining the power balance, and enhancing the lifetime of BESSs within a DC microgrid framework incorporated with the DESS. The simulations are carried out in the MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation platform and compared with a similar approach having only a single energy storage system, i.e., the BESS.
