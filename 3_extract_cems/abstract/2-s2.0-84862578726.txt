The capacity of supercapacitor charge storage depends on the size of the electrode surface area and the active material on the electrodes. To enhance the charge storage capacity with a reduced volume, silicon is used as the electrode material, and three-dimensional electrode structure is prepared to increase the electrode surface area on the footprint area by inductively coupled plasma reactive etching (ICP) techniques. The anodic constant current deposition method is employed to deposit manganese oxide on the electrode surface as the electroactive material. For comparison, samples without slot are prepared with a two-dimensional electrode. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) are used to characterize the surface morphology of the electrode structure and the deposited electroactive material. Electrochemical properties of the electrode are characterized by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the constant current charge-discharge method. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively increase the electrode surface area with more electroactive substances, and hence can increase storage capacity of the micro-supercapacitor.
