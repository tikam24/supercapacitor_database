Hybrid electric vehicle needs dedicated energy storage system suitable for its special operating conditions. The nickel-metal hydride batteries and lithium-ion batteries dominate this market, but they also have some drawbacks. The electric double layer supercapacitors have been employed in passenger vehicles, but the drawbacks of those supercapacitors prevent them from the application of energy storage system for hybrid electric vehicles. A technical route of hybrid supercapacitor-based energy storage systems for hybrid electric vehicles is proposed, this kind of hybrid supercapacitor battery is composed of a mixture of supercapacitor materials and lithium-ion battery materials. We developed a supercapacitor battery cell dedicated for energy storage system of hybrid electric vehicles. The advantages of those supercapacitor cells are low cost, long life cycle, high safety, wide working temperature range, high power density and high energy density. The supercapacitor battery pack and supercapacitor hybrid electric vehicle with the developed supercapacitor cells showed great performance improvements.
