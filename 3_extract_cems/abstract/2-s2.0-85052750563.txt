Porous carbon nanosheets were prepared by the carbonization of paper flower via chemical and physical activation. The structural properties of the as-prepared carbons were characterized using the techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, N2 sorption isotherms and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while the related morphological analyses were conducted using scanning/transmission electron microscopy (SEM/TEM). The obtained carbons exhibit a high specific surface area up to 1801 m2 g−1 with a robust porous graphitic carbon layer structure, which provides the merits for potential application in energy storage and dye removal. We carried out potentiostatic and galvanostatic measurements using a three-electrode cell in 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and achieved a specific capacitance of 118, 109.5, 101.7, 93.6, and 91.2 F g−1 at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 A g−1, respectively. The stability at 12 A g−1 was tested to reach 10,000 cycles with capacity retention of around 97.4%. We have demonstrated that the paper flower-derived carbons at activation temperature 800 °C (PFC-800) can be used as a promising electrode material in supercapacitor. PFC-800 can also serve as an efficient sunset yellow dye removal, showing the maximum adsorption capacity for sunset yellow (Q0, 273.6 mg g−1).
