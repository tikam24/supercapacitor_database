This article concerns the application of the isolated symmetry half-bridge bidirectional DC-DC converter in a supercapacitor energy storage system. The guideline to calculate the zero-voltage switching resonance elements is proposed. Meanwhile, a novel state-space averaged model contains duty cycle as control variable is developed. With the model, a phase-shifted plus feed-forward control system is proposed, which can stabilize the primary side voltage of the transformer and reduce the leakage inductor current when supercapacitor voltage declines. Simulation results of the model have been obtained and studied. The proposed design guideline and control strategy is verified by a 500-W prototype.
