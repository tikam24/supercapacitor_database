In present investigation, we report unique and successful fabrication of 3D bi-functional binder free electrode by hydrothermal growth of Fe based metal organic frameworks on nickel foam (MIL-101(Fe)/NF) for supersensitive electrochemical sensor and high capacitance supercapacitor. The materials characteristics were investigated by XRD, FTIR, RAMAN, FE-SEM, and BET techniques. The FE-SEM results revealed the formation of octahedral spindles nanosheets of MIL-101(Fe) fully covered on the nickel foam. In applications involving an electrochemical sensor or a supercapacitor, the binder-free MIL-101(Fe)/NF electrode provided excellent results by modestly avoiding dead mass of binders. The determination capability of MIL-101(Fe)/NF electrode as an electrochemical sensor of lead (Pb2+) ions has been investigated by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique. According to the findings, the MIL-101(Fe)/NF exhibits excellent sensing performance towards Pb2+ ions with low detection limit of 0.169 nM and high sensitivity of 22.6 µA/M. Moreover, the electrode exhibits ideal sensor characteristics such as good selectivity, reproducibility, repeatability and stability. In addition, the structure of MIL-101(Fe)/NF electrode provides elevated electro-active sites, which altogether provides shorter path for electron passage and electrolyte diffusion process, which resulted in a high specific capacitance. At a scan rate of 10 mVs−1, the MIL-101(Fe)/NF electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 210 Fg−1. Capacitance retention of greater than 98% is demonstrated by the fabricated electrode, even after 1000 cycles. The present investigated results and novel strategies to develop multifunctional materials will open innovative avenues for material scientist.
