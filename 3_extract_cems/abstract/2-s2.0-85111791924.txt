The proceedings contain 28 papers. The topics discussed include: electrochemical capacitor performance in energy harvesting applications; hybridation of lead-acid batteries and supercaps: a mean to gain in electrical performances and in life time; tailoring electrochemical capacitor energy storage using direct write dispenser printing; activated carbon in double layer capacitors; combining nanostructured carbon electrodes and ionic liquid electrolytes to develop new electrochemical capacitors; capacitor properties of bundled single- and double-walled carbon nanotubes and their electrochemical doping mechanism; effect of doping ions on capacitance properties of polypyrrole/functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes composites; electrochemical performance of iridium oxide thin film for supercapacitor prepared by radio frequency magnetron sputtering method; and asymmetrical electrochemical capacitors using heteropoly acid electrolytes.
