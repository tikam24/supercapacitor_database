Significant research efforts have been dedicated toward developing environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage technologies as a result of the growing demand for ecologically sustainable energy and the rapid depletion of existing fossil fuels. Pseudo-capacitance behavior of hexaogonal shaped ZnO nanopowders were prepared by a simple hydrothermal route. The XRD analysis revealed the formation of the hexaoganal phase of ZnO nanopowders for prepared samples. The pseudo-capacitance behavior of electrodes coated with crystalline ZnO nanopowders was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) systems. Hexaogonal shaped ZnO nanopowders modified electrode was achieved the highest specific capacitance value of 448 F/g in 0.25 A/g at 2 M KOH. The ZnO modified electrode was shown to be highly stable for 5000 cycles at 0.5 A/g, which is significantly more stable than stability of other prepared electrodes. Over 5000 cycles, the assembly of ZnO@NF//AC@NF as an asymmetric supercapacitor has excellent capacitance retention of 99.5% at 0.5 A/g. This is a low-cost and highly efficient device. It is a promising canditate and alternate supercapacitor for energy storage devices.
