Tungsten oxide was synthesized by microwave irradiation and used for the first time as the electrode material of supercapacitor. As evidenced by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling tests, the microwave irradiation-derived tungsten oxide (WO3-M) shows superior capacitive performances to thermal heating-derived tungsten oxide. This can be attributed to the amorphous structure of WO3-M. WO3-M possesses good cycling performance and high volumetric capacitances, which highlights its potential application as an electrode material in a supercapacitor. Â© 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.
