The purpose of this work was to investigate if it would be feasible to drive electric vehicles across a distance of one kilometer utilizing supercapacitors rather than batteries.An electric vehicle's propulsion system is constructed using a supercapacitor (sc) as a model of how the energy storage system functions.For use as a power transmission to the wheel electric vehicles. The design of the capacity of the sc to suit the 4-seat electric vehicle. In order to run the service for sending and receiving students between the 4 buildings and the library buildings at Dhonburi Rajabhat University, Samutprakarn. The total distance to return was 1010 meters. The findings demonstrate that electric vehicles weighing a total of 405 kg. At an average speed of 10.86 km/h, a supercapacitor can cover 1150 meters in 6 minutes and 21 seconds. To obtain the optimum efficiency, 822.47-W of power must be driven.
