In this study, we have reported a one-step synthesis of a TiO2@MoS2 heterostructure. TiO2@MoS2 was synthesized using a facile and cost-effective method. The as-synthesized TiO2@MoS2 heterostructure was characterized by suitable spectroscopic techniques. The obtained TiO2@MoS2 was utilized as a supercapacitor electrode material. Electrochemical studies show that the TiO2@MoS2 heterostructure possesses a specific capacitance of 337 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in an aqueous solution. Furthermore, an application as a photocatalyst for the photoreduction of toxic hexavalent chromium was reported for the first time. This heterostructure showed the photoreduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ in 120 min with formic acid as a scavenger under direct sunlight. A plausible mechanism of photoreduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ under natural sunlight irradiation using TiO2@MoS2 is proposed.
