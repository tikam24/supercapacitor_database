In this work, CuFe2O4 nanospheres with hierarchically porous structure have been synthesized via a facile solvothermal procedure. The superstructures consist of the textured aggregations of nanocrystals with high specific surface area, pore volume, and uniform pore size distribution.To figure out the formation mechanism, we discussed in detail the effects of a series of experimental parameters, including the concentrations of the precipitation agent, stabilizer agent, and reaction temperature and time on the size and morphology of the resulting products. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of CuFe2O4 nanospheres were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-dischrge studies. The results demonstrate that the as-prepared CuFe2O4 nanospheres are excellent electrode material in supercapacitor with high specific capacitance and good retention. The hierarchically CuFe2O4 nanospheres show the highest capacitance of 334F/g, and 88% of which can still be maintained after 600 charge-discharge cycles. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
