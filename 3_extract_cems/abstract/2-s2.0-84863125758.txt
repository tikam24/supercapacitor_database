In order to improve capacitance in supercapacitors application, activated carbon (AC) was modified by nitric acid oxidizing treatment. Oxygen-containing functional groups (OCFG) were detected by using FTIR techniques. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the samples in 6 mol/L KOH solution. FTIR studies showed that chemical modification promoted the formation of OCFG on the surface of AC. It was found that the contribution rate of pseudo-capacitance to the total capacitance increased significantly with the extent of oxidization treatment. When oxidized by 50% HNO3, AC achieved a specific capacitance of 197.26F/g at a current density of 20mA/cm2 corresponding to an increasing rate up to 20%.
