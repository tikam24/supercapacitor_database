Abstract: Literature concerning the principal problems is analyzed. Basic characteristics of porous structures and methods of their determination are described, in particular, the pore distribution in radii, full porosity, the specific surface area, hydrophilicâ€“hydrophobic properties. The effect of porous structure on the electrochemical characteristics of the following devices is discussed: lithium-ion and lithium-oxygen batteries, fuel cells with proton-exchange membrane, supercapacitors, electrodialyzers, and devices for water capacitive deionization (desalination).
