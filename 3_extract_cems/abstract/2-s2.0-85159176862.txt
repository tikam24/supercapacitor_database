Developing anode materials with high reversible capacity, fast redox kinetics, and stable cycling life for Na+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, the VO2 nanobelts with oxygen vacancies supported on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (VO2-x/NC) were developed. Benefitting from the enhanced electrical conductivity, the accelerated kinetics, the increased active sites as well as the constructed 2D heterostructure, the VO2-x/NC delivered extraordinary Na+ storage performance in half/full battery. Theoretical calculations (DFT) demonstrated that oxygen vacancies could regulate the adsorption ability for Na+, enhance electronic conductivity, as well as achieve rapid and reversible Na+ adsorption/desorption. The VO2-x/NC exhibited high Na+ storage capacity of 270 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, and impressive cyclic stability with 258 mAh g−1 after 1800 cycles at 10 A g−1. The assembled sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) could achieve maximum energy density/power output of 122 Wh kg−1/9985 W kg−1, ultralong cycling life with 88.4% capacity retention after 25,000 cycles at 2 A g−1, and practical applications (55 LEDs could be actuated for 10 min), promising to be utilized in a practicable Na+ storage.
