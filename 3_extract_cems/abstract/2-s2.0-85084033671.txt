In the paper, in order to solve the problem that the response speed of DC power supply of lead-acid batteries for high-frequency devices is slow. Based on a thorough study of the structure and operation mechanism of DC operating power supply, this paper proposes a new hybrid storage power supply system composed of lithium batteries and super-capacitors instead of lead-acid batteries. The advantages of hybrid storage technology applied in DC operating power supply system are introduced in details. At the same time, the energy optimization management of new DC operating power supply is also discussed. The dynamic power sharing between lithium batteries and super-capacitors is realized. At the same time, the dynamic power limitation method of lithium batteries based on Super-capacitor SOC is adopted to dynamically limit the charging and discharging power of batteries and improve the life of batteries. At the last, the superior performance of the proposed new DC operating power supply is verified by simulation.
