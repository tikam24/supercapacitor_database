Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are electrochemical solar cells depending on dye molecules that absorbing the radiation and start generating the photoelectrons. DSSCs are the most harmonious device among the other types of solar cells to be coupled with the energy storage devices such as pseudocapacitors to make a solar-capacitor device because of their electrochemical nature. Pseudocapacitors are electrochemical devices that can store charges through the double layer structure and changing the oxidation state of conducting polymer materials (i.e. Polypyrrole, Ppy). The effect of adding methylene blue dye molecules (MB) to the solar capacitor device was absorbed in the previous work by recording the voltage of the composite materials Ppy+MB under the effect of illumination by 23 mV. In this work, TiO2 as electron transport layer (ETL) was added to the anode electrode to facilitate the movement of photo generated electrons. The results of solar-capacitor device exhibited 570 mV open circuit voltage under the effect of light condition in 400 s. The short circuit current results showed a 2 uA under the light condition. The presented results are hopeful to enhance the performance of solar energy and charge storage devices.
