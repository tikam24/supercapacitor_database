In this paper, new method of trend removal is proposed. This is a simplified method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The method was applied for voltage time series observed during supercapacitor discharging process. It assured the determination of an additive noise component after subtracting the identified trend component. We analyzed voltage time series observed between the terminals of the supercapacitor when discharged by a loading resistance R. The steps of the proposed method are presented in detail. The results are compared with the results obtained for polynomial approximation. Statistical parameters (kurtosis, skewness) of the histograms of the identified noise component were estimated to evaluate the quality of the proposed detrending method. The method was adjusted to the analyzed data by selecting a parameter of the applied envelope function of the EMD method. We conclude that the proposed method is faster and more efficient for detecting the additive noise component than the competitive polynomial approximation. The identified noise component may be used to evaluate the State of Health of tested supercapacitors and therefore requires fast algorithms with efficient detection.
