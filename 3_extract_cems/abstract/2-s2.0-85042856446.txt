Herein, Co3O4 core-shell microspheres are successfully designed and synthesized via a new rapid and energy-efficient room temperature interfacial-reaction and applied to supercapacitors for the first time. Morphological characterizations of the Co3O4 core-shell microspheres are carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), showing their microsphere shape with diameter approximately 1 Î¼m. The unique structure not only provides abundant active sites but facilitates ions and electrons transitive process. As a consequence, the intriguing structural advantages endow Co3O4 core-shell microspheres with outstanding electrochemical performances: 261.1 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g; excellent cycle stability of 90.2% capacity retention over continuous 2000 cycles. When being paired with active carbon (AC), the resulting asymmetrical supercapacitor manifests a high energy density of 16.6 Wh/kg at a power density of 883 W/kg. Overall, this oriented approach provides a new and facile idea to fabricate core-shell or hollow-out structure as high-performance electrode for supercapacitors.
