Two-wheelers are fitted with lead-acid battery to meet intermittent loads such as horn, direction indicators, brake light, etc. These loads are also related to safety of the driver. Typical life of the battery is about two years if maintained properly. In practice, most users do not replace the factory fitted battery once its life is over and continue to use the vehicle compromising safety features. Ultra-Capacitor, with its short charging time is ideally suited for these intermittent loads and has a usable life exceeding that of vehicle. Experiments conducted on entry-level motorcycle clearly indicate that the Ultra-Capacitor module adequately meets the electrical requirements of the vehicle and can be directly substituted for the battery. Advantages are long life, weight and space reduction, no-maintenance and lead-free environment friendly product.
