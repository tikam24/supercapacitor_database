For the first time, cross-linked nanorods of samarium selenide (Sm2Se3) were self-assembled using the chemical route for reliable supercapacitors. The X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques confirmed the formation of crystalline Sm2Se3. The formation of Sm2Se3 across-linked nanorods was confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy technique. The cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to study the supercapacitive properties of the electrode. The highly porous network of the electrode resulted from this assembly exhibited excellent capacitive behavior with a maximum specific capacitance (316 F gâˆ’1) and cycling stability (87%) for 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
