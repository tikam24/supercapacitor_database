Energy-saving strategies and programs have been developed by the appropriate organizations in response to rising concerns about the pollution created by fossil fuels in the environment. Compared to conventional batteries, supercapacitors have several advantages than other, including faster charge and discharge times, higher power density, a longer cycle life, and fever negative effects on the environment. Researchers explored perovskite as a novel class of eco-friendly electrodes for energy conversion devices. In this study, we developed ZnMnO3 via a sol gel route for supercapacitor application. The phases, structure, valance, morphology and surface of the material are determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET), respectively. The electrochemical behavior manifested that the fabricated perovskite exhibited high capacitive efficiency of 889 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The GCD stability test displays the highest capacitive retention of 97 % after 5000 cycles and shows prolong the stability of 50 h. Our findings suggest that the perovskite exhibited the fascinating feature for supercapacitor application to replace the other polluted source of energy.
