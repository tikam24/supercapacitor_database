This study presents the facile preparation of novel MnCo2O4.5 microspindles (MSs) for the first time through a rapid solvothermal method combined with subsequent calcination of the precursor at 450 °C for 4 h in air. The MnCo2O4.5 MSs have an average length of 4–5 µm and diameter of 2–4 µm, respectively, achieving a specific surface area as high as 83.3 m2 g−1. In addition, the size and morphology of the MnCo2O4.5 microstructures could be easily tuned by some parameters including reaction time, volume ratio of ethanol to water, and dosage of urea. The electrochemical performance was further evaluated in three-electrode system, detailed electrochemical characterizations revealed that such MnCo2O4.5 MSs exhibited both high specific capacitance of 343 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycling performance of 81.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g−1 in 2 M of KOH electrolyte, which made it a potential electrode material for an advanced supercapacitor. Furthermore, the present synthetic method is simple and can be extended to the synthesis of other electrode materials based on transition metal oxides.
