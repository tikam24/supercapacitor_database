This paper presents the performance analysis of hybrid fuel cell/battery/supercapacitor electric vehicle using frequency splitting operational state control strategy (FSOSCS) for three different battery state of charge (SOC) levels i.e. high, normal and low. The energy management is carried out with the help of FSOSCS and the control system for fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor. The FSOSCS decides the fuel cell reference power based on battery state of charge (SOC) and load demand as an input. The control system provides the control signals to the fuel cell boost converter and battery buck-boost dc-dc converter. The simulation is carried out in MATLAB/Simulink environment for standard ECE 15 driving cycle. The results indicate that fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor show almost similar behavior for the high and normal battery SOC levels. However when the battery SOC is low, the fuel cell has to deliver more power to meet the load demand and charge the battery.
