MnO2 has been widely studied as the pseudo-capactive electrode material of high-performance supercapacitors for its large operating voltage, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, it suffers from low conductivity and being hardly handle as the electrodes of supercapacitors especially with flexibility, which largely limit its electrochemical performance and application. Herein, we report a novel ternary composite paper composed of reduced graphene sheet (GR)-patched carbon nanotube (CNT)/MnO2, which has controllable structures and prominent electrochemical properties for a flexible electrode of the supercapacitor. The composite paper was prepared by electrochemical deposition of MnO2 on a flexible CNT paper and further adsorption of GR on its surface to enhance the surface conductivity of the electrode and prohibit MnO2 nanospheres from detaching with the electrode. The presence of GR was found remarkably effective in enhancing the initial electrochemical capacitance of the composite paper from 280 F/g to 486.6 F/g. Furthermore, it ensures the stability of the capacitance after a long period of charge/discharge cycles. A flexible CNT/polyaniline/CNT/MnO 2/GR asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with this composite paper as an electrode and aqueous electrolyte gel as the separator. Its operating voltage reached 1.6 V, with an energy density at 24.8 Wh/kg. Such a composite structure derived from a multiscale assembly can offer not only a robust scaffold loading MnO2 nanospheres but also a conductive network for efficient ionic and electronic transport; thus, it is potentially promising as a novel electrode architecture for high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
