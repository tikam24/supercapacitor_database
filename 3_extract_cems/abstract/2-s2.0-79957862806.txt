A series of ordered mesoporous carbon/cobalt oxide composites as electrode materials for supercapacitor were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation method. The results show that the structure and electrochemical properties of the composites depend mainly on the cobalt oxide loading amount in the ordered mesoporous carbon. The optimum loading amount of cobalt oxide is found to be 30 wt.%, and the composite derived from which exhibits 283.52 F/g of specific capacitance at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. The specific capacitances of which are higher than that of OMC and pure Co3O4 at every given scan rate, showing good synergetic effect. Â© (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
