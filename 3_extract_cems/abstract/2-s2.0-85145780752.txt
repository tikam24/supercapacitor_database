In optical storage grid connected system, an improved PI control method is proposed to control the outer loop DC bus voltage of voltage source converter (VSC). According to the super capacitor state of charge (SOCsc), the secondary power distribution control strategy based on interactive control and limit management is proposed. Under the critical charge and discharge mode, the concept of virtual correction current is introduced, and the size of the current value is determined through the positive and negative distribution power of the super capacitor and the interaction rate factor, so as to change the SOCsc in a stable range. Under the limit charge and discharge mode, SOCsc shall be limited and managed to avoid overcharge and discharge. Through the example analysis, the superiority of the proposed improved PI control strategy is verified. Based on the obtained SOCsc, the secondary power is distributed to control its state of charge (SOC) to operate in a relatively stable working range.
