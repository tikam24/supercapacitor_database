Currently, the research of energy storage devices mainly focuses on enhancing their electrochemical performance. Core-shell structured NiCo2 S4 @NiMoO4 is thought to be one of the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to its high specific capacitance and excellent cycle performance. In this work, we report NiCo2 S4 @NiMoO4 nanosheets on Ni foam by a two-step fabricated method. The as-obtained product has a high capacitance of 1035 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The as-assembled supercapacitor has a high energy density of 32.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 3230 W kg−1 and a superior cycle performance, with 70.1% capacitance retention. The electrode materials reported here might exhibit potential applications in future energy storage devices.
