Material research for energy storage is increasing in an effort to find alternative renewable energy devices. A lot of thermal energy wasted in everyday life. Research for various alternative high-capacitance supercapacitor materials continues to be encouraged. SrTiO3 shows good electrical and dielectric properties, as wellas defect induced structure. Modification of local structure using Pb dopant on the SrTi1-xPbxO3 was applied for exploring the scientific information and its potential applications intensively. The synthesis of SrTi1-xPbxO3 was prepared by solid-state reaction method. The powder was then calcined, pressed into a pellet,and subsequently sintered at 860°C. Various fraction of lead (Pb) dopants were carried out in 0.00; 0.02; 0.04; 0.06; 0.08; 0.1 molar ratio. The structure, morphology, and supercapacitor properties of SrTi1-xPbxO3 composite powder was performed by using X-Ray Diffraction, UV-Vis, IV temperature-induced conductivity and CV EIS. XRD data analysis with Cu-Kα wavelength indicated the single phase was identified and a slight change in lattice parameters was observed. Sixfold symmetry of the local octahedral structure also changed to a tetragonal structure after introducing the amount ofPb element. For investigating electrical properties of SrTi1-xPbxO3, I-V meter was applied. Furthermore, electrical conductivity and dielectric constant will be discussed in detail. Loading higher Pb fraction promoted the electrical conductivity measured at various temperatures. Increasing conductivity is one indicator that this system potentially enhanced the electronic exchange of supercapacitor in SrTi1-xPbxO3 system.
