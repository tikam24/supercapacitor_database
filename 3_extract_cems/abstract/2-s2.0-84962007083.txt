With the rapid development of lightweight, flexible and even wearable electronic devices, flexible and highly efficient energy storage devices are needed for their counterpart energy-storage systems. Among different sources, fiber shaped supercapacitors have been considered as one of the most promising candidates because of their significant advantages in power and energy densities, and unique properties of being flexible and weaveable, lightweight, low-cost, and environmentally friendly compared with current energy storage devices. Carbon materials with excellent electrical conductivity, high specific surface area, good corrosion resistance and low density play an irreplaceable role in the development of conventional supercapacitors and the rapid development of flexible supercapacitors also thanks to the advance of carbon materials. Therefore, carbon-based fiber shaped supercapacitors attracted increasing research attention. In this article, we review the recent research progress on carbon-based fiber shaped supercapacitor, including carbon fiber, carbon nanotube fiber and graphene fiber. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and further research trends of the carbon-based fiber shaped supercapacitor.
