The in situ growth strategy provided a multistep method to design and synthesize core-shell heterostructure CoMoO4@CuCo2S4 nanomeshes grown on carbon cloth. Owing to the synergistic effect between CoMoO4 nanosheets and CuCo2S4 nanoneedles in the meshes, such electrodes realize a rapid electron/ion transfer and superior electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, a mechanism for this specific structural material is proposed based on the time factors. The obtained core-shell structured CoMoO4@CuCo2S4 electrode displays an outstanding performance with an initial specific capacitance of 1414 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1 capacitance and 9.8% capacitance decay after 9500 cycles. More notably, the configuration of an asymmetric supercapacitor using optimized active materials and active carbon reveals a preceding energy density of 60.4 Wh·kg-1. Furthermore, the capacitance retention of the device can reach more than 83.3% when it runs for 4000 cycles.
