Energy storage continues to be a growing research topic. Supercapacitors are a good new choice of energy storage devices because they have good performance with high-density values, relatively fast charging, long-lasting lifetime, and are included in environmentally friendly technologies. The development of materials and structures in an extensive manner continues to be studied. Materials that can support energy storage devices have high capacitance, such as Activated Carbon (AC) and Bismuth Phosphate (BiPO4) as electrode materials. However, the energy density of carbon-based supercapacitors is still low. On the other hand, BiPO4 has good crystallinity and stability, high thermal and chemical properties, and has an ideal redox-active specificity as a supercapacitor electrode material. There is a lot of research on supercapacitor materials that have been released. The article summarizes current trends in the development of supercapacitor material synthesis and supercapacitor performance, particularly AC-BiPO4-based electrodes. The use of BiPO4 phosphate metal materials optimized to improve the performance of the supercapacitor electrode material is also proposed. Several supercapacitor material applications and new developments of supercapacitors and prospect analysis are also presented in this report.
