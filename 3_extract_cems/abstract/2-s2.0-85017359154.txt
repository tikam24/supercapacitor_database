The development of Fe2O3 with high conductivity and energy density is crucial for practical utilizations of supercapacitors. Here, we demonstrated the preparation of novel Fe2O3/graphene oxide paper (Fe2O3/GP) hybrid electrode for high density supercapacitors. Due to the characteristic features of large surface areas and fast electron transportation, the specific areal capacitance of the Fe2O3/GP was around 3.08 F cm−2 at the charge-discharge current density of 5 mA cm−2, which is nearly 14 times of the Fe2O3/carbon paper (Fe2O3/CP, 0.22 F cm−2). More importantly, the Fe2O3/GP hybrid electrode also retained about 95% of the initial capacitance after long-term cyclic process. These findings would help us to develop high effective and stable materials for energy storage devices.
