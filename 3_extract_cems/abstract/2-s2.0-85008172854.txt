A simple method to fabricate and assemble micro-supercapacitor by using monolithic 3D graphene as electrode material was studied. The monolithic 3D graphene was prepared by CVD, which is frequently used to produce high quality graphene. For this purpose, a seamless nickel catalyst substrate was created by using polystyrene (PS) as binders to the Ni catalyst particles. The consolidating of the latter was achieved via thermal treatment in inert environment prior to the CVD process thus promoting sintering and interconnecting of the individual Ni particles into a monolithic catalyst structure. The latter was penetrated by carbon atoms produced via decomposition of methane during the CVD process. The obtained wet 3D grapheme after acid etching and rinsing with DI water was directly transferred onto a polyimide (Kapton) film and dried to adhere well with the substrate. The obtained monolithic 3D grapheme has a rough surface composed by numerous graphene flakes. The synthesized high quality graphene flakes are interconnected into a porous 3D structure that contributes to the excellent electrical conductivity and flexibility of the supercapacitor. These qualities enable avoiding the use of metal electron collectors or metal coatings, and still maintaining an excellent performance rate with a high areal energy density and superior power density, compared to the conventional GO or rGO-based MSCs. The capacitance behavior of 3D GP-MSCs has been largely improved with appropriate oxygen plasma functionalization. The 30 s oxygen plasma exposed samples show areal capacitance of 1.5 mF cm-2 at a high scan rate of 10 V s-1.
