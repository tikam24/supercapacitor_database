A large-scale of MoO3/PANI coaxial heterostructure nanobelts have been fabricated for high-performance supercapacitors via a simple and green approach without any surfactant. Herein, the assembly of PANI conductive layer on the surface of the well-crystallized α-MoO3 nanobelts was carried out using ammonium persulfate (APS) as oxidant by in-situ polymerization at room temperature. As-prepared MoO3/PANI coaxial heterostructure nanobelts have been successfully employed as supercapacitor electrodes. It was found that the as-synthesized MoO3/PANI coaxial heterostructure nanobelts exhibited excellent supercapacitor performance with high specific capacitances of 714Fg-1 at a scan rate of 1mVs-1 and 632Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1 in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte, whereas the original α-MoO3 nanobelts just showed initial specific capacitances of 275Fg-1 and 267Fg-1 at 1mVs-1 and 1Ag-1, respectively, which attributed to the synergic effect between the PANI coating and the original α-MoO3 nanobelts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
