In this study, graphene/Mn3O4 composites were fabricated to improve the specific capacitance of graphene based supercapacitor, using two different simple methods. First, Graphene/Mn3O4 composite (GM1) was synthesized through deposition of nanoscale manganese oxide on the surface of graphene under microwave irradiation. Second, a two-step method consisting of mixing and annealing was employed to fabricate graphene/Mn3O4 composite (GM2). The prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) .The XRD analysis revealed the formation of graphene/Mn3O4. Moreover, the presence of Mn3O4 and MnO2 was conformed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. GM2 electrode showed better electrochemical performance, and exhibits the largest specific capacitance of approximately 100 F/g at the scan rate of 30 mv/s in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, other electrochemical measurements of the electrodes were implemented proposing that the graphene/Mn3O4 composite electrodes are promising materials for supercapacitor application.
