We present a new type of electrochemical supercapacitors based on graphene nanowires. Graphene oxide (GO)/polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires are prepared via electrodepostion of GO/PPy composite into a micoroporous Al2O 3 template, followed by the removal of template. PPy is electrochemically doped by oxygen-containing functional groups of the GO to enhance the charging/discharging rates of the supercapacitor. A high capacitance 960 F g-1 of the GO/PPy nanowires is obtained due to the large surface area of the vertically aligned nanowires and the intimate contact between the nanowires and the substrate electrode. The capacitive performance remains stable after charging and discharging for 300 cycles. To improve the thermal stability and long-term charge storage, GO is further electrochemically reduced into graphene and PPy is subsequently thermally carbonized, leading to a high capacitance of 200 F g-1 for the resultant pure reduced graphene oxide/carbon based nanowire supercapacitor. This value of capacitance (200 F g-1) is higher than that of conventional porous carbon materials while the reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanowires show a lower Faraday resistance and higher thermal stability than the GO/PPy nanowires.
