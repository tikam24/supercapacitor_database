To realize low voltage ride- through of direct-drive wind generator under unbalance condition of the grid, through researching system operating characteristics of super capacitor energy storage unit, the small signal model of super capacitor energy storage unit was established, realizing precision control of the charging and discharging to ensure the safe and stable operation of the system. The method determining energy storage capacity of wind generator was put forward. The low voltage running control strategy was studied, such as limiting active output of machine side converter, adjusting the active and reactive power distribution of grid side converter, providing reactive power support for grid. Also a new detection method of frequency adaptive positive sequence voltage component was put forward to provide accurate and fast response signal for converter running and improve the system robustness. The feasibility of direct-drive wind generator with super capacitor energy storage and the control strategy was verified through the simulation results.
