Graphene sheets with high quality and dispersibility were prepared by exfoliation of edge sulfonated graphite. Tosyl-graphene (TsG) dispersion in N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) readily reached up to 16 mg mL-1 without any surfactants. TsG enjoys intact crystal planes and flexible framework. When employed as electrode material for supercapacitor, TsG shows outstanding specific capacitance of 180 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, and excellent cycling stability (only 2% loss after 10000 cycles), which can offer enormously potential for super-capacitors and other highly desired energy storage devices.
