We report on the synthesis and physical property characterization of graphene–inorganic ‘hybrid’ nanomaterials coupled with nano-/microscale transition metal oxide polymorphs namely, cobalt oxides, i.e. CoO [Co(II)] and Co3O4 [Co(II, III)]), for alternative energy storage and conversion devices. Their demand is owed to higher specific capacitance, wide operational potential window, stability through charge–discharge cycling, environmentally benignity, easily processability, reproducibility and manufacturability. To accomplish this, we strategically designed these hybrids by direct anchoring or physisorption of CoO and CO3O4 on two different variants of graphene: graphene oxide which is semiconducting, and its reduced form showing conducting behavior via mixing dispersions of the constituents under mild ultrasonication and drop-cast (or spray-cast) resulting in different combinations. This facile approach affords strong chemical/physical attachment and is expected to have coupling between the pseudocapacitive transition metal oxides and supercapacitive graphene showing enhanced surface activity/reactivity and reasonable areal density of tailored interfaces. We used a range of complementary tools to establish microscopic structure–property-function correlations including scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with selected-area electron diffraction, and resonance Raman spectroscopy combined with elemental Raman mapping. They reveal surface morphology, local (lattice dynamical) and average structure and surface charge transfer/doping due to physically (or chemically) adsorbed cobalt oxide and highlight the surface structure and interfaces. This lays the groundwork to further investigate the electrochemical properties as high-performance supercapacitor cathodes, rechargeable secondary battery anodes and electrocatalytical platforms.
