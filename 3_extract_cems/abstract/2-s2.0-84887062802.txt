Microwave-induced potassium hydroxide activation was used to produce coconut shell-based activated carbon. Surface area, pore size and specifc capacitance value of the carbon produced were analysed to investigate its potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor. The activation process was carried out at 600 W with various irradiation times (10 to 30 min). The activated carbon produced had high surface area ranging from 1244. 0-1768. 8 m2 g-1 compared with the inactivated carbon, 36.5 m 2 g-1. These results were in good agreement with scanning electron micrographs revealing highly porous surface structure. In addition, the specifc capacitance value of the material increased from 94.8 to 156.3 F g -1 compared with the inactivated biomass, 6.4 F g-1. The material produced was found to be suitable as an electrode for supercapacitor.
