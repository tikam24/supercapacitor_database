Applications of the non-line-of-sight vapor deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and atomic layer deposition (ALD), offer unique opportunities to produce well-defined high surface area current collectors, thin films or various nanostructures of active (ion-storage) materials, protective coatings, solid electrolytes and improved separators. These features hold significant promise for solving emerging issues in advanced LiBs and supercapacitors. This paper reviews recent developments and applications of CVD and ALD for these energy storage devices, providing selected examples and outlining critical challenges for further exploration.
