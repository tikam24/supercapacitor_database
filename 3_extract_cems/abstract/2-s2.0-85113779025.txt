Asymmetrical Zn thin foil|carbon cloth two-electrode cells based on 1 M Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous solution have been tested using cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance methods. The Ragone plots have been calculated from constant power measurements data. Very high gravimetric and volumetric energy densities at moderate gravimetric and volumetric power densities have been calculated, nearly 2–3 times higher than those for the best sol–gel method prepared two carbon electrode single cells. It was found that even at high power density (10 kW kg−1), the energy density values are comparable with the results for best CDC and sol–gel methods prepared carbon materials based supercapacitors. It has been observed that studied asymmetrical two-electrode cells demonstrated higher energy densities (~ 70 W h kg−1) than the ionic liquid based symmetrical cells what show energy density up to 47 W h kg−1 and capacitance ~ 120 F g−1. However, the power densities and relaxation times for Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolyte based supercapacitors still need to be increased and decreased, respectively, to meet the needs of very quick short pulses high power energy storage applications.
