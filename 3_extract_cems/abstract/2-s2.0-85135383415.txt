The binary metal oxides are increasingly used as supercapacitor electrode materials in energy storing devices. Particularly NiCo2 O4 has shown promising electrocapacitive performance with high specific capacitance and energy density. The electrocapacitive performance of these oxides largely depends on their morphology and electrical properties governed by their energy band-gaps and defects. The morphological structure of NiCo2 O4 can be altered via the synthesis route, while the energy band-gap could be altered by doping. Also, doping can enhance crystal stability and bring in grain refinement, which can further improve the much-needed surface area for high specific capacitance. Given the above, this study evaluates the electrochemical performance of Ca-doped Ni1-xCaxCo2 O4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8) compounds. This stipulates promising applications for electrodes in future supercapacitors.
