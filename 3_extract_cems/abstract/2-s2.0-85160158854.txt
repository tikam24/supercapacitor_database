Supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are sophisticated devices with key features such as highly reversible charge storage, a wide range of operation temperatures, long cycle life, and the ability to fast charge/discharge at power densities exceeding 1 kW kgâˆ’1. Hence they harmonize the shortcomings of other energy sources such as batteries. Carbon-based supercapacitors store energy via electrostatic ion adsorption at the electrode surface in electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). The EDLC mechanism is mainly known for its electrochemical stability, electrical conductivity, and high surface area. These carbon materials are available in different forms, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, carbon aerogel, graphene, and carbon foam. This chapter explores the various aspects of these carbon-based materials, such as novel synthesis strategies, possibilities of increasing their surface area, choice of electrolytes, and contribution of the pseudocapacitive mechanism, which dramatically improve its electrochemical performance. This discussion will facilitate the researcher in addressing the burning need for high-performance, economical, scalable, eco-friendly, carbon-based materials with outstanding energy storage abilities.
