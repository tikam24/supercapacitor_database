The sodium manganese oxide Na0.7MnO2.05 was synthesized through alkaline hydrolysis of [Mn12O12 (CH3COO)16(H2O)4] followed by thermal calcinations. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) study revealed that the as prepared Na0.7MnO2.05was composed of flat micro-rod crystals. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that Na0.7MnO2.05 is a good electrode material for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance value of the sample is about 121 F·g-1 at the charge/discharge rate of 0.125 A·g-1 in 0.5 mol·L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte.
