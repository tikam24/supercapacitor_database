Charges are stored in the form of electrical energy in a supercapacitor, which is an electrochemical device. Electrochemical energy storage systems such as fuel cells and capacitors have been developed as a result of a growing desire to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels while also reducing our impact on the environment. High power density, long cycle life, and better operating safety are all hallmarks of supercapacitors. Supercapacitors partially fill the gap between regular electrolytic capacitors (high power density) and lithium-ion batteries (high energy density). Because they eliminate a significant number of the drawbacks associated with the use of batteries, they constitute a step forward in developing technologies that are used to store energy. This chapter provides an overview of the different types of supercapacitors: electric double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors. Because of their enormous storage capacity, supercapacitors are frequently used in portable electronic devices and hybrid automobiles. Supercapacitors are becoming an increasingly popular choice to provide interim energy storage for regenerative braking in electric and hybrid vehicles. In order to improve the overall performance of the supercapacitor, different kinds of materials are utilized in the electrodes. This chapter discusses all kinds of supercapacitors, classified according to the energy storage mechanism, electrode configurations, and design. Additionally, a concise summary of the materials and technologies that are used for supercapacitors is provided. Materials such as metal oxides, carbon materials, conducting polymers, and their composites comprise the majority of the focus. The performance of the composites was analyzed using characteristics such as capacitance, energy, cycle performance power, and rate capability, which also provides information on the electrolyte materials.
