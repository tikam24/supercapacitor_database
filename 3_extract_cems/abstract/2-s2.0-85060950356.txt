The highly flexible carbon nanofibers mixed with differently functionalized carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and terephthalic acid (PTA) were fabricated and further applied as a binder-free electrode. The addition of AM-MWNTs possessed higher electrical conductivity and preferable capacitance performance than that of AC-MWNTs due to its better-aligned carbon architectures. Attributed to the sublimation of PTA in carbonization, the resulted self-sustained nano-films exhibited desirable electrochemical performances as high capacitance, good rate capability and excellent cycling stability. By virtue of the lightweight, flexibility and simplicity of operation, the self-sustained nanocomposite electrode we demonstrated will surely favor its application for the development of flexible energy storage devices.
