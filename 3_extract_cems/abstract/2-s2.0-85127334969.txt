The ternary Co-Ni sulfides (Co-Ni-S) with earth-abundance, environmental friendliness, and high theoretical capacitance have been widely investigated in the field of pseudocapacitive supercapacitors. To further improve the utilization of Co-Ni-S to realize higher capacitance, Co-Ni-S was electrodeposited on carbon cloth (CC) that was modified by Co(OH)2 nanoflakes (CC@Co(OH)2@Co-Ni-S). The modification of CC with Co(OH)2 exhibits rough surface, which is beneficial to the electrodeposition of Co-Ni-S, further improving the electrochemical performance. As a result, the specific capacitance of CC@Co(OH)2@Co-Ni-S is higher than that of CC@Co-Ni-S without Co(OH)2 modification. Even after 5000 cycles, the specific capacitance of CC@Co(OH)2@Co-Ni-S is still about 22% higher than that of CC@Co-Ni-S.
