Novel CaTi2O4(OH)2 ultrathin nanosheets were first synthesized by a simple solvothermal method without using a surfactant or template. When the NaOH:TBOT mol ratio was increased, the morphology of the as-prepared sample was found to change from cross-linked nanowires to silk-like nanostructures composed of ultrathin nanosheets, and, eventually, to perfect CaTi2O4(OH)2 nanosheets. A formation mechanism is proposed for the observed evolution of the phase and morphology. The silk-like nanostructures present a nano/mesoporous architecture with a relatively large specific surface area compared to other morphologies. Consequently, capacitors with CaTi2O4(OH)2 silk-like nanostructures as an electrode exhibit a high specific capacity (196.18 mAh g−1 at 10 mA cm−2) and long-term cycling stability (97.3% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2). These properties are attributed to the remarkable electrochemical performance of the CaTi2O4(OH)2 electrode due to the efficient electronic and ionic transport pathways formed because of the specific nanostructure synthesized.
