For high performance supercapacitors, novel hierarchical yolk-shell α-Ni(OH)2/Mn2O3 microspheres were controllably synthesized using a facile two-step method based on the solvothermal treatment. The unique α-Ni(OH)2 based yolk-shell microstructures decorated with numerous interconnected nanosheets and the heterocomposition features can synergistically enhance reactive site exposure and electron conduction within the microspheres, facilitate charge transfer between electrolyte and electrode materials, and release structural stress during OH− chemisorption/desorption. Moreover, the Mn2O3 sediments distributed over the α-Ni(OH)2 microspheres can serve as an effective protective layer for electrochemical reactions. Consequently, when tested in 1 mol·L−1 KOH aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitors, the yolk-shell α-Ni (OH)2/Mn2O3 microspheres exhibited a considerably high specific capacitance of 2228.6 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 and an impressive capacitance retention of 77.7% after 3000 cycles at 10 A·g−1. The proposed α-Ni(OH)2/Mn2O3 microspheres with hetero-composition and unique hierarchical yolk-shell microstructures are highly promising to be used as electrode materials in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
