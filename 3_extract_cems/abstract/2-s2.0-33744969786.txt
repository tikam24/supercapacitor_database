Carbon aerogel was prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol (R) with formaldehyde (F), and sodium carbonate was added as a catalyst (C). Physical properties of carbon aerogel were characterized by infrared spectrometer (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is found that carbon aerogel is an amorphous material with a pearly network structure, and it consists of one or two diffuse X-ray peaks. The results of cyclic voltammetry indicated that the specific capacitance of a carbon aerogel electrode in 6 M KOH electrolyte was approximately 110.06 F g-1. Through the galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement, it was found that the electrode is stable in KOH electrolyte, the maximum capacitance of the supercapacitor with carbon aerogel as the electrode active material was 28 F g-1. Besides, the supercapacitor has long cycle life. Thus, it was thought that the carbon aerogel is an excellent electrode material for a supercapcitor. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
