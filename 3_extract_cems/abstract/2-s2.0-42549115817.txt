The paper discuss the design and performance of a laboratory rig which is used to evaluate different variable/adjustable speed generating system topologies. A programmable torque speed characteristics of a DC machine controlled by a thyristor converter is used as simulator of the different driving engines. The electrical supply is provided by an axial flux permanent magnet generator and AC/AC converter. The converter produces a sinusoidal AC three phase voltage. The system was designed and tuned with PSIM 6 simulation software. Results of laboratory tests of step loads of the conventional adjustable speed generating system and hybrid with additional supercapacitor energy storage are presented. The results confirms the versatility of the test rig for development of an adjustable/variable speed generation systems. Â© 2006 IEEE.
