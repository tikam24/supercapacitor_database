Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and/or polypyrrole (PPy) are mixed with chitosan (CS) binder materials for screen-printing supercapacitors (SCs) on arc atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ)-treated carbon cloth. The performance of gel-electrolyte rGO/CS, PPy/CS, and rGO/PPy/CS SCs processed by a dielectric barrier discharge plasma jet (DBDjet) was assessed and compared. DBDjet processing improved the hydrophilicity of these three nanocomposite electrode materials. Electrochemical measurements including electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltamme-try (CV), and galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) were used to evaluate the performance of the three types of SCs. The Trasatti method was used to evaluate the electric-double layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitance (PC) of the capacitance. The energy and power density of the three types of SCs were illustrated and compared using Ragone plots. Our experiments verify that, with the same weight of active materials, the combined use of rGO and PPy in SCs can significantly increase the capacitance and improve the operation stability.
