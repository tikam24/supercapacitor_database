A promising supercapacitor material based on dialdehyde starch reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline (DAS-RGO/PANI) composite has been successfully synthesized via in situ oxidation polymerization. In this paper, we developed a green and facile approach to the synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) based on dialdehyde starch (DAS) using exfoliated graphite oxide (GO) as precursor. The merit of this method is that both the reducing agents themselves and the oxidized products are environmentally friendly. It should be noted that, besides the mild reduction capability to GO, DAS could also play an important role as a capping reagent in stabilizing as-prepared RGO simultaneously, which exhibited good stability in water. This approach can open up the new possibility for preparing RGO in large-scale production alternatively. Moreover, DAS can reduce GO and polyaniline (PANI) in one pot to obtain DAS-RGO/PANI composite that exhibit good electrochemical properties. In addition, the DAS-RGO/PANI composite achieved the maximum specific capacitance as high as 499 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, which is the highest value reported so far for graphene-doped PANI composite via a green and facile approach of reduced graphene oxide. Low resistance, long cycle life and fast reflect of oxidation/reduction on high current changes are other outstanding characteristics for the designed supercapacitor. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
