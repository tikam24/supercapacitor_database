Polypyrrole (PPy) hybrid composites are prepared with nitrogen-functionalized graphene (NFG) via in situ polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of NFG suspension (PPy/NFG). PPy nanorods with 60 nm in diameter are uniformly dispersed on the surface of NFG sheets. The PPy/NFG composites are used as supercapacitor electrodes, and the electrochemical performances are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The PPy/NFG composite exhibits good capacitive behavior with specific capacitances of 962 and 815 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 and 8 A g−1, respectively. The PPy/NFG symmetric supercapacitor device also presents high specific capacitance, good cycle stability, and large energy density of 57.8 Wh kg−1 at power density of 14.9 kW kg−1. The results demonstrate the PPy/NFG composites can be used as promising supercapacitor electrode materials for high performance energy storage devices.
