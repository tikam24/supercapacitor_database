Three types of conducting polymers, polyaniline (PANI), poly(N-methylaniline) (PNMA), poly(N-ethylaniline) (PNEA) were electrochemically deposited on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) surfaces characterized as electrode active materials for supercapacitor applications. The obtained films were electrochemically characterized using different electrochemical methods. Redox parameters, electro-active characteristics, and electrostability of the polymer films were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV). Doping types of the polymer films were determined by the Mott-Schottky method. Electrochemical capacitance properties of the polymer film coating PGE (PGE/PANI, PGE/PNMA, and PGE/PNEA) were investigated by the CV and potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in a 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Thus, capacitance values of the electrodes were calculated. Results show that PGE/PANI, PGE/PNMA, and PGE/PNEA exhibit maximum specific capacitances of 131.78 F g-1 (≈ 436.50 mF cm-2), 38.00 F g-1 (≈ 130.70 mF cm-2), and 16.50 F g-1 (≈ 57.83 mF cm-2), respectively. Moreover, charge-discharge capacities of the electrodes are reported and the specific power (SP) and specific energy (SE) values of the electrodes as supercapacitor materials were calculated using repeating chronopotentiometry. © 2013 Institute of Chemistry, Slovak Academy of Sciences.
