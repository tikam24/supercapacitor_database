Recently, it has become more popular to use in-situ growth of transition metal chalcogenides for efficacious supercapacitor (SCs) applications. Metal-organic framework (MOF) is considered as a good source of precursor for a transition metal. Herein, Eu-MOF was used as a precursor for Eu transition metal to fabricate EuZrSe3 via the wet chemical method. The various physical and chemical characteristics such as X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), surface Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Brunner-Emmet Teller were utilized to study the phase orientation, crystallinity, morphology, and textual properties of fabricated material, respectively. All the electrochemical parameters like polarization curve (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for estimating various parameters such as specific capacitance (Cs) around 1543 F/g & detected a remarkable energy density of 97 Wh/kg at a current density around 3.0 A/g in 2.0 M alkaline KOH electrolyte. Enhanced performance of the fabricated novel electrode owing to its huge electroactive surface area and excellent electrochemical conductivity and good morphology. Despite its greater specific energy (97 Wh/kg) and high-power density (658.8 W/kg), it also has 93.58 % retention efficiency after 10,000 cycles.
