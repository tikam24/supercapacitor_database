Ordered mesoporous carbon materials were prepared by doping boric acid using a hardtemplating method. The capacitive performance of these carbons was investigated in organic and H2SO4 electrolytes. As demonstrated by structure analysis the prepared carbons possessed parallel mesoporous channels. The pore size increased from 3.3 to 5.7 nm and the molar fraction of oxygenated groups on the carbon surface increased from 2.0% to 5.2% with an increase in the amount of boric acid doping from 0 to 50% (molar fraction). In the organic electrolyte, the carbons mainly showed typical electric double layer capacitive performance and no visible pseudo-capacitance was induced. In H2SO4 electrolytes, BOMC-5 showed the highest specific mass capacitance of 140.9 F·g-1 and the specific surface capacitance of the prepared carbons increased with an increase in the oxygenated groups and this carbon showed visible pseudo-capacitance because of the rapid redox reactions of the oxygenated groups. The capacitance retention ratio depends on the surface chemical properties, which determines the wettability of the carbon surface and the electrolytes. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
