Hierarchical cobalt gallium layered double hydroxide microns flower and sheet was in situ gown on Ni foam via a facile and one-step hydrothermal method. The capacity of preparing Co-Ga-layered double hydroxides (Co-Ga-LDH), as supercapacitor electrode, was evaluated via three electrode system. And different feeding ration of cobalt and gallium was attempted to optimize the better capacity performance. The as-obtained Co-Ga (1:1)-LDH hybrid shows the enhanced the specific capacity 1431.5 C/g at current density of 1 A/g and approximately 74% initial capacity at current density of 20 A/g. A hybrid supercapacitor was assembled consisting of Co-Ga-LDH and reduced graphene (rGO), which show the high energy density 68.07 Wh/kg at power density 825 W/kg. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that cobalt gallium layered double hydroxides was prepared and studied in energy storage field.
