Over the past years, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) have been directly used as electrodes or as a precursor for MOF-derived materials in energy storage and conversion systems. In the wide range of existing MOF derivatives, MOF-derived layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are determined to be promising materials due to their unique structure and features. However, MOF-derived LDHs (MDL) materials can suffer from insufficient intrinsic conductivity and agglomeration during formation. Various techniques and approaches were designed and applied to tackle these problems, such as using ternary LDHs, ion-doping, sulphurization, phosphorylation, selenization, direct growth, and conductive substrates. All the mentioned enhancement techniques aim to create the ideal electrode materials with maximum performance. In this review, we gathered and discussed the most recent progressive advances, different synthesis methodologies, unsolved challenges, applications, and electrochemical and electrocatalytic performance of MDL materials. We hope this work will be a reliable source for future progress and synthesis of these materials.
