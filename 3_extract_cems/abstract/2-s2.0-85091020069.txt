The development of novel materials with improved functional characteristics for supercapacitor electrodes is of current concern and calls for elaboration of innovative approaches. We report on an eco-friendly enzymatic synthesis of a composite based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The redox active compound, sodium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (NQS), was used as a dopant for the backbone of the polymer. Oxidative polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) was catalyzed by a high redox potential laccase from the fungusTrametes hirsuta. Atmospheric oxygen served as an oxidant. A uniform thin layer of NQS-doped PEDOT formed on the surface of MWCNTs as a result of the enzymatic polymerization. The PEDOT-NQS/MWCNT composite showed a high specific capacitance ofca.575 F g−1at a potential scan rate of 5 mV s−1and an excellent cycling stability within a potential window between −0.5 and 1.0 V, which makes it a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
