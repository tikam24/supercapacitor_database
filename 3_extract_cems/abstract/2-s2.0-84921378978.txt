Binary mixtures of ionic liquids (ILs) were prepared and characterized to obtain ILs with viscosity and conductivity properties optimized for use in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors. The bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide anion (NTf<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup>) was the common anion for both ILs in the mixture. Ethoxyethyl was the common substituent on the minor component (solute) and the major component (solvent), as ether substituents have been shown to lower the viscosity of ILs. N-Ethoxyethyl-Nmethylpyrrolidinium NTf<inf>2</inf> was used as the major component for all of the IL mixtures. The solutes were either monocationic or dicationic and made up 10 % of the binary mixture by weight. We report here on the physical properties of the individual ILs and their binary mixtures.
