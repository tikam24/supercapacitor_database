Two-dimensional Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets were functionalized with phenylsulfonic groups derived from in situ generated diazonium ions by the corresponding amine. During the functionalization process, the aryl groups were attached onto the MXene surfaces in the form of strong MXene-aryl (Ti–O–C) linkages. Simultaneously, the intercalation of diazonium ions enabled Ti3C2 multi-layers to be delaminated into separate few-layer nanosheets via weak sonication with low energy. As a result of chemical functionalization for MXene Ti3C2, the dispersibility was greatly improved and the specific surface area increased significantly. The grafted functional groups are still stable up to at least 200 °C upon thermogravimetric analysis measurements. With diazonium ions intercalating and electroactive groups grafting between-in MXene layers, the chemically functionalized Ti3C2 electrodes exhibited an enhanced supercapacitive performance, which acquired a specific capacitance more than double that of pristine Ti3C2 samples and excellent cycling stability (91% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 3 A g−1). This feasible modification scheme can be also extended to functionalize other types of MXenes materials with this or other aryl diazonium ions as surface modifiers and intercalants, thus offering scope for full potential applications of the new 2D materials.
