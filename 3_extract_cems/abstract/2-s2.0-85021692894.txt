The increasing demand for supercapacitors with high energy and power density has attracted extensive attention in designing advanced carbon materials with high accessible surface area, hierarchical porosity, and 2D/3D morphology. Here, we report a new approach to tune the morphology and structure of the nanocarbons by using methyl cellulose as the precursor. Due to the varying effect of different activating agents, the interconnected sheet-like carbon with a high surface area of up to 2285 m2 g−1 and a thickness down to ∼4 nm can be obtained. These important characteristics make the nanocarbons demonstrate a high capacitance of 144 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 20 °C, and an excellent capacitance retention ratio of 64% at 100 A g−1 in ionic liquid. Because of the high fraction of meso/macropores for nanocarbons, an outstanding capacitance of 116 F g−1 can be achieved at 0 °C, with a high capacitance retention ratio of 39% at 100 A g−1. A high energy of 16–17 and 9–10 W h kg−1 can be maintained at 20 and 0 °C when the supercapacitor is charged in less than 1s. The excellent electrochemical response of nanocarbons suggests that the proposed preparation process is promising for developing advanced carbon electrodes.
