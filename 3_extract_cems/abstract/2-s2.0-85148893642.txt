Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is added to MoO3 and TiS2 to develop several hybrid electrode materials, including rGO/MoO3, rGO/TiS2, and rGO/MoO3/TiS2 to enhance the electrochemical performance. SEM/EDX, TEM, XRD, XPS, and Raman techniques are used to study the resulting hybrid electrode materials. The specific capacitance and charge–discharge stability of the synthesized rGO/MoO3, rGO/TiS2, and rGO/MoO3/TiS2 electrode materials are assessed using galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetry testing. The rGO/MoO3/TiS2 exhibits higher specific capacitance of 1043.72 mA h/g at 20 mV/s as compared to rGO/TiS2 (625.61 mA h/g), rGO/MoO3 (567.54 mA h/g), and rGO (154.40 mA h/g), among the examined. All electrochemical measurements were conducted in a 3 M KOH solution. The rGO/MoO3/TiS2 electrode was found to have Rct value of 20.8 Ω.cm2. This value was much lower than that of the rGO electrode (89.8 Ω.cm2), indicating that the rGO/MoO3/TiS2 exhibits much lower resistance, which causes the improved electrochemical performance of the rGO/MoO3/TiS2. The retention of capacitance of 98.56 % after 8,000 cycles at 1 A/g shows that this rGO/MoO3/TiS2 hybrid electrode also exhibits good cycling stability. The rGO/MoO3/TiS2 composites' respective energy and power densities are determined to be 882 Wh/kg and 5773 W/kg. The good electrochemical performance of the rGO/TiS2/MoO3 composite anode is closely related to its structure, in which the TiS2/MoO3 nanoparticles are not only homogeneously anchored on the surface but also embedded in the interlayer of the rGO sheets; hence the volume change and aggregation of the TiS2/MoO3 nanoparticles can be effectively hindered. On the other hand, rGO itself is an electronic conductor; the rGO and TiS2/MoO3 nanoparticles connect closely, which offers large electrode/electrolyte contacting area, short path length for transporting of ions.
