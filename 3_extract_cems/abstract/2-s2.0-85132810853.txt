In this work, the high-performance symmetric electrochemical capacitor based on ruthenium dioxide anchored on reduced graphene oxide nanostructures was developed. The created system consists of the negative and positive electrodes with Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The symmetric capacitor devices electrodes were tested in the potential range of 0 to 1.2 V. As a result, at 2 A/g,the rGO/RuO2 and RuO2 electrodes gained higher energy (41 Wh kg−1 and 31 Wh kg−1) and power densities (1.2 kW kg−1 and 0.98 kW kg−1). After the 2000th cycle,the rGO/RuO2 electrode has such a high cyclic efficiency of 96%, which is considerably higher than the pure RuO2 (88%).This is due to the anchoring of high conducting rGO in rGO/RuO2 nanocomposite. These findings reinforce the idea of graphene-based nanocomposites having as a safe aqueous electrolyte in high-voltage energy storage devices.
