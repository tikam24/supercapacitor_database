Micro-sized copper particles showing distinct morphologies were prepared via reduction of the Cu (II) salt by N-(Phosphonomethyl)iminodiacetic acid (H4Pmida) using a hydrothermal treatment method. Copper was identified as the single phase in the several powders prepared attesting the feasibility of the method to obtain the pure metal phase. The key role of H4Pmida to modify the particles morphology and the plausible mechanism involved are discussed. The in situ as-prepared Cu on Ni foam was used as electrode materials of supercapacitors which showed the interesting electrochemical performance regulated by the pressure employed during the electrode preparation.
