This paper discusses the benefits of using supercapacitors (SCs) when combined with a parallel battery in electric vehicles (EVs), and also demonstrates its feasibility by means of dynamic simulation. A semi-active architecture using a DC/DC converter was chosen, and the implementation of the hybrid energy source was assessed for potential decrease in strain and prolonged battery lifecycle. Data from the literature validated the hybrid energy storage system model and indicated a good agreement. Dynamic simulations were performed using generic models in Matlab-Simulink and ADVISOR, the NYC driving cycle for two types of EVs, that is, for a public transit city electric bus and for an electric car. The outcomes involving the hybridization revealed a substantial decrease in battery charge. The SC power aid and the distance increase in the hybrid system were assessed to be around 26.75% and 87 km, respectively. The results showed corroborated advantages accredited to the hybridization. This later could likewise enable a decrease in the size of the EV battery's main energy source.
