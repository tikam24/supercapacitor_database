Owing to its high safe, high rate and long life characteristics, lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12) anode material has attracted extensive attention in recent years, and many efforts are being made to develop the Li4Ti5O12based high performance hybrid supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. Herein, we prepared the organic cathode material polytriphenylamine (PTPAn) through chemical oxidation and polymerization of triphenylamine (TPAn), and investigated its charge storage mechanism and electrode kinetics with the typical electrochemical methods in an organic electrolyte. It was demonstrated that the PTPAn exhibited the reversible capacity of 85 mAÂ·g-1. The charge storage depended on the reversible adsorption/desorption of anion, which is not controlled by the diffusion process, and thus, can be considered as the pseudocapacitive behavior. Then, the PTPAn cathode was coupled with the Li4Ti5O12anode to form a hybrid capacitor/battery system with high power and improved energy density. Finally, the inherent drawback and the challenge for practical application of such an organic cathode are briefly discussed.
