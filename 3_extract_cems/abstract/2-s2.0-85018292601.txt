There is an intense need for development in the field of hierarchically structured functional materials due to their outstanding and peculiar properties. Herein, three types of hexagonal Mn3O4 micro/nano hierarchical architectures were successfully prepared based on a self-assembly approach via a hydrothermal synthesis route at low temperature, which is sparse in the literature. These three types of hexagonal Mn3O4 micro/nano hierarchical architectures were constructed from different building block nanostructures. The formation mechanisms are discussed, and the electrochemical performances are investigated. Electrochemical studies show that Mn3O4 hierarchical architectures exhibit good specific capacitance and electrochemical stability, making them promising electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors.
