An e-learning methodology is developed and applied to a DC microgrid composed of a fuel cell as the main energy source and two energy storage elements as the auxiliary sources: a bank of supercapacitors and a bank of batteries. Control strategy is based on a combination of flatness and fuzzy logic control. The studied hybrid system is evaluated for the new European drive cycle. Using fully functional stand-alone software, interactive simulations allow the users to evaluate the impact of the energy management and the power control on the efficiency of the DC microgrid.
