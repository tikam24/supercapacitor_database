Global concerns over the damage caused to the environment by fossil fuels, as well as the instability of oil prices, has led to an increase interest in alternate electric power generation from renewable sources such as the sun, wind and geothermal energy. Solar energy is produced by solar panels which are made of materials having the capacity to create a flow of electric carriers when exposed to the solar irradiance. The efficiency of these panels depends on the sun light, and they cannot work at their maximum power point independently, hence, requiring Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT). This MPPT permits to compensate the changes in irradiance and temperature conditions and variations in load demands which cause power imbalances. As such, a photovoltaic system with supercapacitor energy buffer is designed using Psim software. The system consists of a photovoltaic array, a MPPT, a supercapacitor, and a charge controller which is to effectively balance and regulate power in the system.
