Carbon coated MnOx-Ni foam electrodes were successfully prepared using a combined process of hydrogel reaction followed by high-temperature pyrolysis under air or Ar gas conditions. The prepared samples were analyzed by various characterization tools. To evaluate the performances of the carbon coated MnOx-Ni foam electrodes as supercapacitors, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cycle stability were also carried out. The carbon coated MnOx-Ni foam electrodes displayed supercapacitive behavior in 1.0 M KOH with a high specific capacitance value of 354.6 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. The electrode also exhibited remarkable cycle stability. This research provides a valuable and effective approach to enhance the performance of materials applied as supercapacitors.
