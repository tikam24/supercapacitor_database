Supercapacitors (SCs) are energy storage devices with an immense potential to resolve energy related issues. Being a low cost, durable and multifunctional material, graphene and its derivatives are the most promising candidates for SCs. Here, we report the synthesis of N-doped porous reduced graphene (N-pGr) and its use for the fabrication of all-solid-state supercapacitor (ASSC) device. The N-pGr exhibited a specific capacitance of 230 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density and good capacitance retention up to ∼88% even after 10,000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles recorded at 5 A g−1 fabricated in a solid-state supercapacitor. The synergistic effect of the porosity and N-doping is believed to be the underlying principle for the improved charge storage ability when compared to other reports. Significantly, the porous nature of N-pGr contributes in increasing the electroactive surface area for the formation of electrical double layer as well as facilitating the faster movement of electrolyte ions inside the electrode network. N-doping is believed to change the electrical properties of the electrode material and also to participate in the pseudo-capacitance which helped to boost the overall capacitance of the fabricated device. The good capacitance retention provides the room for making robust flexible solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) with the N-pGr material.
