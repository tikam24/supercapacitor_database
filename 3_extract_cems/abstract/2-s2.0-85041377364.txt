A light and binder-free bilayer fabric electrode composed of silicon nanowires and copper nanowires for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) is reported. A lithium ion capacitor is proposed employing pre-lithiated silicon/copper nanowire fabric and activated carbon as the anode and the cathode, respectively. These LICs show remarkable performance with a specific capacitance of 156 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, which is approximately twice of that of activated carbon in electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), and still exhibit a fine specific capacitance of 68 F g−1 even at a high current density of 20 A g−1. At a low power density of 193 W kg−1, the Si/Cu fabric//AC LIC can achieve high energy density of 210 W h kg−1. As the power density is increased to 99 kW kg−1, the energy density still remains at 43 W h kg−1, showing the prominent rate performance.
