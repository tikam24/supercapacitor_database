This paper is about the development and implementation of an electromagnetic transducer in harvesting kinetic energy from an octopus ride. The kinetic energy harnessed from the octopus ride by the electromagnetic transducer is stored in a 1F, 5.5V supercapacitor. The voltage is stored in the supercapacitor is regulated to approximately 4V by a conditioning circuit which uses an LM393 comparator. This research aims to utilize an alternative source of energy to reduce the cost and expenses in maintaing an octopus ride system.
