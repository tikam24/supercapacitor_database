Polyaniline (PANI) in situ doped with gold nanoparticles (Au/PANI) is synthesized by oxidative polymerization as electrode material for supercapacitor. The morphologies and structure of the obtained products are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; and electrochemical behaviors were measured by electrochemical workstation. The results show that the nanocomposites of Au/PANI are fabricated with gold nanoparticles (nano-Au) dispersed well in PANI bulk; and specific capacitance (SC) and rate ability of Au/PANI are improved compared to the pristine PANI due to the introduction of nano-Au. With nano-Au content increasing, SC first increase and then decrease and the maximum SC of Au/PANI nanocomposite is up to 462 F g−1 with the nano-Au content of 1.64 wt %. Finally, both asymmetric and symmetric supercapacitor devices are assembled, exhibiting high energy densities of 8.95 and 4.17 Wh kg−1, respectively. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
