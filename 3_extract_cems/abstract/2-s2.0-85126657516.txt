Textile-based energy storage is an important energy supply element of the microelectronic signal collection system for flexible wearable textiles. The recent research progress of flexible supercapacitors from multiple perspectives of fibers, yarns and fabrics, and states the preparation methods, advantages and disadvantages of supercapacitors of different matrix types are summarized. Focusing on the technological characteristics of textile supercapacitors, analysis the method that should be adopted to improve the performance of materials. Finally, an explanation for the presence of textile-based supercapacitor development and the key work of future which need to overcome is given an analysis and outlook.
