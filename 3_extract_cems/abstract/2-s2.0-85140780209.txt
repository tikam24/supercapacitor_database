Pore modulation via hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) needs investigation due to its crucial effect on surface that influences its multirole utilization of such ultraporous sorbents in applications of energy storage- hydrogen and capacitive- as well as for pollutant abatement- carbon capture and dye removal. Hence, loblolly pine was hydrothermally carbonized followed by KOH activation to synthesize superactivated hydrochars (SAH). The resulting SAHs had specific surface area (SSA) 1462–1703 m2/g, total pore (TPV) and micropore volume (MPV) of 0.62–0.78 cm3/g and 0.33–0.49 cm3/g, respectively. The SAHs exhibit excellent multifunctional performance with remarkably high atmospheric CO2 capture of 145.2 mg/g and high pressure cryogenic H2 storage of 54.9 mg/g. The fabricated supercapacitor displayed substantial specific capacitance value of maximum 47.2 Fg−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH and highest MB dye removal of 719.4 mg/g. Higher HTC temperature resulted in increased surface porosity as higher SSA, TPV benefitted H2 storage and MB dye removal while superior MPV favored CO2 capture. Moderate HTC temperature ensured higher mesopore-to-macropore volume ratio favoring electrochemical performance. Isotherm modelling of the adsorbates was compared using models: Langmuir, Freundlich, Langmuir- Freundlich and Temkin.
