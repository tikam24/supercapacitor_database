The electrochemical energy storage and delivery on the electrodes composed of hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuOx·nH2O) or activated carbon-hydrous ruthenium oxide (AC-RuOx) composites are found to strongly depend on the substrate employed. The contact resistance at the active material-graphite interface is much lower than that at the active material-stainless steel (SS) mesh interface. Thin films of gold plus RuO x·nH2O deposited on SS meshes (RuO x/Au/SS) are found to greatly improve the poor contact between SS meshes and electrode materials. The maximum specific capacitance (C S,RuOx) of RuOx·nH2O, 1580Fg-1 (measured at 1mVs-1), very close to the theoretic value, was obtained from an AC-RuOx/RuOx/Au/SS electrode with 10wt.% sol-gel-derived RuOx·nH2O annealed in air at 200°C for 2h. The highly electrochemical reversibility, high-power characteristics, good stability, and improved frequency response of this AC-RuOx/RuOx/Au/SS electrode demonstrate its promising application potential in supercapacitors. The ultrahigh specific capacitance of RuOx·nH2O probably results from the uniform size distribution of RuOx·nH2O nanoparticles, ranged from 1.5 to 3nm which is clearly observed from the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
