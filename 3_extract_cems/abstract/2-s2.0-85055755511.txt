We reported a facile and easily controllable electrodeposition-and-ion exchange technique for synthesis of Ni3S2/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanocomposites on the surface of Ni foam for supercapacitor applications. When tested as electrode for a supercapacitor, a large surface area of the Ni3S2/CNTs hybrid nanoarchitecture was proven and it showed an excellent specific capacitance of 1643 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, and maintains 999 F/g at 20 A/g. The Ni3S2/CNTs electrode also displayed good cycle stability with capacitance retention of 91.5% after 2000 cycles in 3 M KOH electrolyte. Because of these outstanding properties, the Ni3S2/CNTs nanocomposites are becoming promising candidates for the high performance binder-free supercapacitor electrodes.
