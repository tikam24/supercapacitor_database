The system stability and quality power are the key issues for centralized power system network. In case of integration of distributed generation from conventional and renewable sources to the power system, the stability becomes more vulnerable due to rapid switching, load change and effect of harmonics. In order to control the system voltage and frequency, the control and compensation of electrical power need to be efficient and fast. Due to advancement in semiconductor based power electronic devices, the fast switching shunt power compensators like DSTATCOM, UPFC, and IPFC has made significant impact in power system stability. In this paper Super Capacitor Energy Storage System (SCESS) based DSTATCOM is proposed for both real and reactive power compensation. An experimental setup is tested in the laboratory by using dSPACE DS1104 R and D controller which can be interfaced with MATLAB Simulink. According to test results, this proposed system overcomes the problem of real power compensation and constant DC link voltage of conventional DSTATCOM by exchanging both real and reactive power with the power system.
