In this work, the electrochemical energy storage performance of activated carbon (AC) derived from canola waste (Can) was investigated as a supercapacitor (SC) electrode material. So, in an innovation, activated canola (Ac-Can) was combined with functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) in an optimal ratio. The functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) via Ketoconazole was performed applying a multi-step chemical method. Then, through the electropolymerization process, an ultra-thin film layer of poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) fabricated on the surface of the working electrode. The highly porous surface of the ternary nanocomposite (POAP/FGO/Ac-Can) is recognized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Also, through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, the specific surface area (SSA) of Ac-Can was determined to be 2200 m2·g−1. The Cs of 1350.5 F·g−1 at a current density of 2 A·g−1 and retention of 96.2% initial capacitance after 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles, verified the superior performance of the ternary nanocomposite. Consequently, this research reveals a clear horizon of biowaste-based materials with advantages such as cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and sustainability.
