Higher adsorption capacities of activated carbon (AC) can be evaluate according to pore volume, porosity and surface area. AC with higher pore volume, porosity and surface area desired in the present study in order to enhance the properties of AC supercapacitor. Thus, the present studies focus on the chemical activation process to increase the characterization of AC. The study was using bamboo waste as a precursor and the activation process was conducted using microwave ultrasonic system. The chemical agent used during the process was KOH and H2SO4. Microwave activation was conducted at intensity 100 W and 300 W for 30 min and sonication frequency was constantly set at 200 Hz for 60 min. The sample was carbonized at temperature of 400 ºC and 800 ºC using furnace for 2 hours. Then, AC was characterized for surface area using BET analysis and functioning group using FTIR analysis. The results shown the carboxyl, aliphatic, aromatic and phenolic hydroxyl group are present on raw bamboo while new functional group such as alkyl halide and some of some weak bands appeared which analogous with out of plane bending mode of the C-H or O-H group occur for AC. Active surface area and total pore volume of AC supercapacitor in 5M of concentration for H2SO4 and KOH corresponded to 1167 m2/g, 0.724 cm3/g, 740.10 m2/g, 0.462 cm3/g, respectively.
