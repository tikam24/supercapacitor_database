This report contains SrTiO3 (STO) doped with Mn, namely, SrTi1−xMnxO3 (where x = 0.0, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0) perovskite by high-temperature solid reaction method at 1000 °C, and its composite with iron oxide namely SrTiO3–Fe2O3 by microwave-assisted green synthesis method. The materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and UV–visible spectroscopy. TEM images showed the average particle size of STO (x = 0.0), SrTi0.6Mn0.4O3 (STMO1) (x = 0.4) and SrMnO3 (SMO) (x = 1.0) are 138 nm, 105 nm and 233 nm, respectively. The band gap of STO is found to be 3.88 eV and its band gap engineering has been carried out through doping and composite formation. An optimized band gap of 2.95 eV is found in STO–Fe2O3 composite to be suitable for visible photocatalysts. The decolorization% of methylene blue (MB) dye is found to be 93.66% at 240 min under visible light. The decolorization kinetics was found to be pseudo-first-order kinetics with R2 value of 0.98 with degradation rate constant of 0.02 min−1. The SrTi0.4Mn0.6O3 (STMO2) (x = 0.6) is found to be the optimized supercapacitor material with specific capacitance of 509.60 F/g, energy density of 0.065 Wh/kg, power density of 53.702 W/kg at current density of 0.269 A/g and maximum retention% of 161.74% at 0.5 A/g after the 2000 cycle. The present work will inspire researchers to explore other perovskite composites for photocatalytic and supercapacitor applications.
