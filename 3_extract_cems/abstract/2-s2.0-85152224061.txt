Nanocomposite electrodes containing various dimensional structures of nanomaterials usually exhibit superior performances in supercapacitor applications because of their advantages on greater specific surface area, directional ion diffusion/charge transport roots, and structural durability etc. The novelty of the present study is that it reports recent advances of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, MXene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and layered double hydroxides (LDHs), used for boosting the performance of metal oxide-based electrode (e.g., RuO2, MnO2, NiO, Fe3O4, Co3O4) in supercapacitors applications. Herein, the constituents, structural features, electrochemical behavior and the nature properties of several metal oxide-based electrodes for supercapacitors are reviewed. The 2D material/metal oxide electrodes based supercapacitors have a high commercial potential due to their chemical stability, power and energy densities, specific capacitance, long cycle life, good electronic properties, and efficient ionic transport at the electrode-electrolyte interface as visualized. Finally, the future prospects and challenges for the development of 2D material/metal oxide nanocomposite electrodes in next generation supercapacitors have been summarized.
