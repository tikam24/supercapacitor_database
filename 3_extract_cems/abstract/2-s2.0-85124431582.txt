The implementation of a structure-designed strategy to construct hierarchical architectures of multicomponent metal oxide-based electrode materials for energy storage devices is in the limelight. Herein, we report NiO nanoflakes impregnated on ZnCo2O4 nanorod arrays as ZnCo2O4@NiO core-shell structures on a flexible stainless-steel mesh substrate, fabricated by a simple, cost-effective and environmentally friendly reflux condensation method. The core-shell structure of ZnCo2O4@NiO is used as an electrode material in a supercapacitor as it provides a high specific surface area (134.79 m2 g-1) offering high electroactive sites for a redox reaction, reduces the electron and ion diffusion path, and promotes an efficient contact between the electroactive material and electrolyte. The binder-free ZnCo2O4@NiO electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 882 F g-1 at 4 mA cm-2 current density and exhibits remarkable cycling stability (âˆ¼85% initial capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 mA cm-2). The asymmetric supercapacitor device ZnCo2O4@NiO//rGO delivered a maximum energy density of 46.66 W h kg-1 at a power density of 800 W kg-1. The device exhibited 90.20% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles. These results indicate that the ZnCo2O4@NiO architecture electrode is a promising functional material for energy storage devices.
