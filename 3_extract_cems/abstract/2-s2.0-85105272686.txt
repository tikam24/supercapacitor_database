Prompt development of electronic devices and sensors raised the requirement for design/fabrication of advanced energy sources capable of providing considerable amount of energy for consuming platforms through practical nanotechnological approaches. For this aim, we have developed a highly active 2D nanostructure consisted of reinforced conductive polypyrrole (PPy) with decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with hybrid metal oxide complex of Ni/W (PPy-G-Ni-W) toward supercapacitor applications. The hybrid 2D platform showed remarkable specific capacitance of 597 F.g−1 and 557 F.g−1 using CV and GCD analyses, respectively, through using three-electrode system. The developed supercapacitor exhibited fantastic stability upon maintaining 98.2% of its total performance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Likewise, the applicable two-electrode device using same electrode configurations composed of PPy-G-Ni-W//PPy-G-Ni-W showed specific capacitances of 361 F.g−1 and 342 F.g−1 at scan rate and current density of 2 mV.s−1 and 0.5 A.g−1 using CV and GCD techniques, respectively. Outcome of optimum supercapacitance configuration consisted of two-electrode system exhibits ideal energy density of 14.4 Wh.kg−1 at power density of 275 W.kg−1. More importantly, the device preserved 96.4% of its total specific capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles which highlighting the excellent capacitive capability along with ultra-stability of the developed platform toward real energy applications.
