A low voltage PV fed high gain, high efficiency dc-dc converter for micro-grid applications, supported by both the battery and Ultra Capacitor (UC) storages is proposed in this paper. The proposed system allows the use of both low voltage battery and low voltage UC, which are connected in parallel with the low voltage solar PV for fast changing solar irradiation condition due to fast cloud movements. This obviates the requirement of high gain bi-directional converters. The presence of storages ensures the operation of the front end dc-dc converter at rated condition even during low solar irradiance condition. The use of the battery and UC for stable and transient operation respectively reduces overall storage size. The control strategies for grid connected as well as islanded mode operations and the algorithm for control of storages in the proposed system are also included. The overall system efficiency observed to be high due to presence of high efficiency dc-dc converter in the system. Representative analysis, simulation and experimental results are included.
