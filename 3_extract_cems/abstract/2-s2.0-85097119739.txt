Zero-dimensional (0D) materials derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are characterized by large specific surface area, high porosity and adjustable aperture. In recent years, they are widely used in lithium ion batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors and other energy storage devices. Electrode material is a key factor in determining the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. The application of zero-dimensional materials derived from MOFs in supercapacitors has broad prospects. In this paper, we reviewed the research progress of 0D materials derived from MOFs in supercapacitors. We summarized the current problems in this field, finally we look into the prospects of the future research trends.
