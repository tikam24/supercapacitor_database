High quality graphene nanosheets were prepared using simple triple solvent system and probe assisted ultrasonication technique for the first time. Structural and morphological evidences confirmed the formation of high quality, hexagonal crystal structured and sheet like architectures of graphene. Electrochemical analysis confirmed the phenomenal capacitor characteristics in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with better electrochemical stability and with a specific capacitance of 36.26 F/g at the sweep rate of 10 mV/s that was achieved for the graphene nanosheets. Moreover, the stable electrochemical activity was mainly due to the non-aggregation effects of graphene nanosheets and it is believed that such a nanostructure prepared by this simple approach would be a promising candidate for supercapacitors.
