Cross-linked porous carbon nanofiber networks were successfully prepared by electrospinning followed by preoxidation and carbonization using low-cost melamine and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) as precursors. The structures and morphologies of the nanofiber networks were investigated using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and N2 adsorption/desorption. The carbon fibers had an interconnected nanofibrous morphology with a well-developed porous structure including micropores, mesopores and macropores, high-level nitrogen doping (up to 14.3%), and a small average diameter (about 89 nm). Without activation, the carbon nanofibers had a high specific capacitance of 194 F·g–1 at a current density of 0.05 A·g–1. Cycling experiments showed that the specific capacitance retained approximately 99.2% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at a current density of 2 A·g–1, indicating an excellent electrochemical performance.
