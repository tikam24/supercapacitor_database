One-dimensional (1-D) α-MnO2 nanowires/spherical activated carbon composite, namely the α-MnO2 nanowires growth onto the surface of activated mesocarbon microbeads (a-MCMB), has been prepared by using a simple hydrothermal synthesis method. The α-MnO2 nanowires are found to be less than 50 nm in diameter and have a characteristic length up to 2 μm. The novel α-MnO2 nanowires/a-MCMB composite when used for supercapacitor electrode material exhibits a specific capacitance (Cs) of 357 F g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous neutral solution. The Cs based on the α-MnO2 nanowires is estimated to be as high as 890 F g−1. A good cycling stability of this composite material is also demonstrated for supercapacitor application.
