A facile and expandable methodology was successfully developed to fabricate laser-induced graphene from novel pristine aminated polyethersulfone (amPES) membranes. The as-prepared materials were applied as flexible electrodes for microsupercapacitors. The doping of amPES membranes with various weight percentages of carbon black (CB) microparticles was then performed to improve their energy storage performance. The lasing process allowed the formation of sulfur- and nitrogen-codoped graphene electrodes. The effect of electrolyte on the electrochemical performance of as-prepared electrodes was investigated and the specific capacitance was significantly enhanced in 0.5 M HClO4. Remarkably, the highest areal capacitance of 47.3 mF·cm−2 was achieved at a current density of 0.25 mA·cm−2. This capacitance is approximately 12.3 times higher than the average value for commonly used polyimide membranes. Furthermore, the energy and power densities were as high as 9.46 µWh·cm−2 and 0.3 mW·cm−2 at 0.25 mA·cm−2, respectively. The galvanostatic charge–discharge experiments confirmed the excellent performance and stability of amPES membranes during 5,000 cycles, where more than 100% of capacitance retention was achieved and the coulombic efficiency was improved up to 96.67%. Consequently, the fabricated CB-doped PES membranes offer several advantages including low carbon fingerprint, cost-effectiveness, high electrochemical performance and potential applications in wearable electronic systems.
