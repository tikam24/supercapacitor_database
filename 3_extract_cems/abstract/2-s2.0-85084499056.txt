Surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) optical fibre sensors can be used as a cost-effective and relatively simple-to-implement configurations for in situ high sensitivity electrochemical measurements. In this paper, we briefly introduce the principle and implementation of electrochemical plasmonic optical fibre sensors based on a tilted fibre Bragg grating imprinted in a commercial single-mode fibre and coated with a nanoscale gold film, and our recent studies of in situ and continuous monitoring the electrochemical activities (the potential and the stored charge) of supercapacitors for energy storage devices.
