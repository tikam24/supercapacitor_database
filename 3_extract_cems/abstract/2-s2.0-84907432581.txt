In this paper, we report a facile synthesis method of mesoporous nickel cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) nanowire-reduced graphite oxide (rGO) composite material by urea induced hydrolysis reaction, followed by sintering at 300 Â°C. P123 was used to stabilize the GO during synthesis, which resulted in a uniform coating of NiCo2O4nanowire on rGO sheet. The growth mechanism of the composite material is discussed in detail. The NiCo2O4-rGO composite material showed an outstanding electrochemical performance of 873 F g-1at 0.5 A g-1and 512 F g-1at 40 A g-1. This method provides a promising approach towards low cost and large scale production of supercapacitor electrode material.
