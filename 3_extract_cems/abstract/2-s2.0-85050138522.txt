This article introduces the analysis of car start-up power supply with novel main circuit design combining perspective circuit and component solutions. The application area is automotive industry and car service companies. This design combines the use of switched power converter with a lithium-titanate accumulator (LTO) and supercapacitor (EDLC) as energy storage elements. The main topology of the power supply is realized as full-bridge resonant LLC switched converter in connection with two-phase interleaved PFC circuit, which are not presented here. The main aim of the presented paper is description and verification of control circuitry for auxiliary storage elements. Initially, main circuit components are listed. Consequently, the control scheme is shown and designed within OrCAD PSpice simulation tool. The proposed control scheme is consequently verified together with the model of proposed power supply. Working characteristics of the designed converter are modified in order to achieve requested parameters and highest possible efficiency. [1], [3]
