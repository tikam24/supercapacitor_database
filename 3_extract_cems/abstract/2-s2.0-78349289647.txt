The local DC power distribution system of More Electric Aircraft is one of the cores of the electric power transmission. Because the mechanical source (turbine engine) is unidirectional, the system is not totally reversible. Some storage and dissipation systems are necessary to store or/and dissipate the returned energy to maintain the dc bus voltage. Different power-management strategies are proposed and compared. The development of experimental test benches is necessary to validate these strategies. In this paper, we present a 3-kW test bench, emulating a unidirectional source that supplies a bidirectional load with the help of a hybrid system using supercapacitors and a dissipation system. The experimental validation of the power-management strategies is presented in this paper, too. Â© 2010 IEEE.
