The synergistic effect between metal ions and increasing the surface area leads to the fabrication of supercapacitor materials with high capacities. It is predicted that transition metal selenide compounds will be ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, the defects of poor conductivity and volume expansion of the compounds are fundamental problems that must be solved. In this work, we successfully synthesized the cobaltâ€“nickel selenide nitrogen-doped carbon (H-CoNiSe2/NC) hollow polyhedral composite structure using ZIF-67 as a precursor. The CoSe2 and NiSe2 nanoparticles embedded in the NC polyhedral framework offer a wealth of active sites for the whole electrode. Moreover, the presence of the NC structure in the proposed composite can simultaneously lead to improved conductivity and reduce the volume effect created during the cycling procedure. The H-CoNiSe2/NC electrode provides high specific capacity (1131 C/g at 1.0 A/g) and outstanding cyclic stability (90.2% retention after 6000 cycles). In addition, the H-CoNiSe2/NC//AC hybrid supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh energy density and power density (81.9 Wh/kg at 900 W/kg) and excellent cyclic stability (92.1% of the initial capacitance after 6000 cycles). This study will provide a supercapacitor electrode material with a high specific capacity for energy storage devices.
