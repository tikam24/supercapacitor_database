Mesoporous carbon electrodes have been doped with Co–B nanoparticles via a chemical reduction approach and successfully used for pseudocapacitor application. The morphology is investigated by powder X-ray diffractions (PXRDs), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The TEM image displays that the Co–B is highly dispersed along the mesoporous carbon support which are critical for the pseudocapacitor application. Cobalt–boron/highly ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays (Co–B/MCNAs) are investigated by cyclic voltammetry, charge/discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-synthesized Co-B/MCNAs exhibit remarkable pseudocapacitive activities including high specific capacitance (531 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1), good rate capability (315 F g−1 at 50 mV s−1), and excellent cycling stability. This value is about 2.7-fold and 1.7-fold higher than MCNAs and Co–B, respectively.
