Buck-boost SiC converters are widely used in special vehicle to supply stable electrical power for weapon system from power batteries. In order to improve the dynamic performance of short term large power demand, DC converter are often used in parallel with super capacitor at output terminal. In such dual source (power battery and super capacitor) application scenario, the conventional soft-switching control method for converter may cause oscillation during the startup process. In addition, the conventional current sampling and discrete control strategies is no longer applicable for the high-frequency control of SiC power switches. In order to solve the above problems, a new soft-switching control method is proposed in this paper. By adjusting the duty ratio limitation based on the voltages of input and output terminals before starting operation, the DC converter can start output stably and smoothly in the dual source scenario, and the interconnection of switching period and discrete control strategy can be decoupled while ensuring the sampling accuracy and control performance. This method has been verified by simulation and experiment.
