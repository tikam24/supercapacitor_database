Renewable energy is essential in the transition towards a secure, competitive and sustainable energy system. In this context, several sources of green energy (photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind generator,...) are often associated to provide energy to the grid. The availability of this energy is a major challenge. Thus, to ensure the continuity of produced energy and to limit the exchanged power fluctuations, the use of a storage systems becomes a necessity. The main idea of the presented work is to replace the DC-bus capacitor of a three phase PV inverter by supercapacitor. This storage unit aims to ensure the continuity of supplying energy, the stability of the grid and the transfer of energy. The control of exchanged current between hybrid inverter and the grid is obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy was verified using MATLAB/SIMULINK software.
