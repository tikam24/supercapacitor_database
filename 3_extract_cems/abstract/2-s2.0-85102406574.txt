High-density resistivity meter is a common instrument used in shallow geophysical exploration. At present, the structure of the centralized high-density resistivity meter is bulky, while the distributed instrument needs more than 7 core cables, and the long measuring line needs to relay power supply to the intelligent electrode to provide enough voltage, so it is not convenient to use in the field. Aiming at the above problems, a new type of distributed high-density meter is developed, which can realize the power supply, communication, and measurement functions of distributed high-density meter and carry out multi-channel measurement through the time-division multiplexing of a two-wire cable and the short-time power supply of supercapacitor. Finally, the performance of the instrument was verified by experiments.
