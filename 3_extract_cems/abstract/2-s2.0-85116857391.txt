Laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology featuring low-cost, high-efficiency and scalability has presented great advantages in micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) fabrication. However, the limited capacitance of LIG based MSCs is still hindering their further development. Herein, we introduce joule heating as a critical in-situ treatment merged with the assembly of laser-induced graphene paper based MSCs (LIGP-MSCs) toward capacitive enhancement. By increasing heating-treatment temperature from ∼20 to 500 °C, the number of nanopores in LIGP continuously increases, attributed to the gradual decomposition of amorphous carbon components. The resulting joule-heated LIGP (J-LIGP) with improved specific surface area (160.97–533.49 m2/g) and pore volume (0.179–0.553 cm3/g) as well as superhydrophilic surface is highly suitable to be employed as J-LIGP-MSCs microelectrodes. By investigating process dependent performance, the J-LIGP-MSCs heated at 500 °C for 60 min delivers a significantly improved specific areal capacitance (CA) of 13.71 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s, which is approximately six-fold higher than that of unheated LIGP-MSCs. By further exploring and optimizing the process efficiency, J-LIGP-MSCs with a CA of 12.61 mF/cm2 has been achieved by 550 °C heating for only 5 min. Along with superior mechanical flexibility, cyclability and structural modularity, the proposed in-situ joule heating treatment is finally proved to be a universal approach for consistently enhancing the CA of LIG based MSCs processed under various chemical modifications.
