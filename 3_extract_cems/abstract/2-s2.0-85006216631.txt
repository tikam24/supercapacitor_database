A primary challenge of gel electrolytes in development of flexible and wearable devices is their weak mechanical performances, including their compressive stress, tensile strength, and puncture resistance. Here we prepare an ionogel-mask hybrid gel electrolyte, which successfully achieves synergic advantages of the high mechanical strength of the mask substance and the superior electrochemical and thermal characteristics of the ionogel. The fabricated supercapacitor can maintain a relatively stable capacitive performance even under a high pressure of 3236 kPa. Meanwhile, with the good thermal stability of the composite gel electrolyte, the solid-state supercapacitor can be operated at high temperatures ranging from 25 °C to 200 °C. The ionogel-mask hybrid gel can be superior tough gel electrolyte for solid-state flexible supercapacitors with durable advantages in both high temperatures and pressures.
