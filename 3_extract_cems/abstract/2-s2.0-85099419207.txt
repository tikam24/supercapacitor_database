Cleaner and greener energy sources have proliferated on a worldwide basis, creating distributed energy systems. Given the unreliable nature of the renewable sources such as solar and wind, they are traditionally based on inverters interfaced with legacy AC grid systems. While efficiency, output waveform quality and other technical specifications of inverters keep improving gradually, only limited attention is given to widening the input range of inverters. This paper presents a new supercapacitor assisted (SCA) technique to widen the input range of an inverter without modifying the inverter itself. Developing a prototype version of a 24 V DC input capable supercapacitor-assisted wide input (SCASWI) inverter using a supercapacitor circulation front end and a commercial 12 V DC line frequency inverter is detailed in the article, explaining how the SCASWI inverter technique doubles the input voltage while maintaining the useful characteristics of the commercial inverter. The new technique has the added advantage of DC-UPS capability based on a long-life supercapacitor module.
