Multiferroic perovskite materials are considered brilliant & suitable materials for power storage and electrical energy conversion because of their excessive power efficiency, temperature stability, and occasional dielectric loss. The electric houses of such multiferroic substances are modify-made through ferroelectric and ferromagnetic parts and feature unfolded first-rate avenues in an electrochemical supercapacitor, photovoltaic, and optical tool applications. Dopants significantly optimize such materials' magnetic and structural properties owing to suitable applications like capacitors, multi-aspect capacitors (MLCs), and strength capability gadgets. This survey features the logical progressions announced in transition metal doped barium titanate multiferroic ferroelectric ceramics for energy applications by optimizing their magnetic properties. This paper begins off evolved with a quick advent of Barium titanate and a dialogue at the outcomes of diverse dopants with the aid of using extraordinary synthesis techniques, and their outcomes on structural and magnetic homes also are depicted. Ultimately, this assessment summarizes the diverse doping outcomes, which paves the manner for destiny studies in this multiferroic substantial for sustainable tool applications.
