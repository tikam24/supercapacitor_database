A novel and facile strategy is developed to fabricate highly nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) based layered, quasi-two-dimensional nanohybrids with ultrathin nanosheet nanocrystals using a low-temperature, solution processing method for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. High N doping can be achieved together with one of the lowest oxygen content in chemically reduced graphene and related nanohybrids at low temperature by large-scale residue defects of chemically reduced graphene. The layered, quasi-two-dimensional nanohybrids or heterostructures of ultrathin Ni(OH)2 nanosheet nanocrystal/N-graphene can be applied in supercapacitor electrodes with ultrahigh capacitances of ∼1551 F g-1, excellent rate performance in the scan measurements (from 2 mV s-1 to 100 mV s-1) and in the discharge tests (from 1.5 A g-1 to 30 A g-1) and good cycling stability. Moreover, the capacitance of Ni(OH)2 nanosheet/N-graphene nanohybrids is two and one orders of magnitude higher than that for pure nanocrystals and for the physical mixture of nanocrystal/N- graphene, respectively. Electron transfer in supercapacitor electrodes based on nanohybrids is over 100 times faster than that in electrodes from pure nanocrystals and several tens of times faster than that in electrodes from nanocrystal/N-graphene mixtures. This low-temperature method may provide a low-cost, solution-processable and easily scalable route to high-performance graphene nanohybrid electrodes for energy applications. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.
