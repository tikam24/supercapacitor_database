An acidification-hydrothermal method was developed to synthesize α-MnO2 nanowires, which was subsequently treated with ethanol, resulting in γ-Mn2O3 nanowire bundles on a large scale. The electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry, which indicated that the α-MnO2 nanowires in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte was of an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor at the scan rate of 10 mV S -1 in the range of 0.0-0.85 V. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
