The structural stability of electrode materials is the crux of significantly improve the electrochemical performance of pseudocapacitor electrodes. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of NiCo2S4 with core-shell and micro-porous structure on nickel foam as an efficient anode material for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) via hydrothermal and co-sulfurization processes. The NiCo2S4 electrode shows a remarkable specific capacitance of 850.2 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, and retains 93.6 % original capacitance after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4 electrode also have excellent electrochemical performance when used as an anode of asymmetric NiCo2S4//Active Carbon (AC) supercapacitor, which generates an energy density as 38.1Wh Kg−1 at 700 W kg−1 and 84.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. This work provide an efficiently method to suppress volume expansion during sulfuration reaction by core-shell structure, which potential application in transition metal sulfides electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.
