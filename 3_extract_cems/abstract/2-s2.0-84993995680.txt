Hierarchical mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanoflowers with large specific surface area have been prepared through a simple, low cost and green method. The electrochemical performances of the NiCo2O4 electrode materials have been investigated, and the results show that NiCo2O4 electrode materials exhibit high specific capacitances of 1635 F/g at 2 A/g, low internal resistance ~0.24 Î©, and remarkable long-term cycling stability, demonstrating its excellent electrochemical performances for supercapacitors. Such enhanced electrochemical performances and the facile synthetic method of NiCo2O4 electrode materials can offer great promise in next generation supercapacitor applications.
