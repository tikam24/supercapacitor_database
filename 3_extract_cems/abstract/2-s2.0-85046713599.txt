The aim of this work is to study pressure sensing effect of the developed flexible solid-state supercapacitor which uses conductive carbon black/polyisoprene composite electrode and PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte. Electrochemical characterization of supercapacitor has been performed to evaluate the performance of the supercapacitor as energy storage device and the gravimetric capacitance has been calculated to be 4.09 F g−1 (4.4 mA g−1). Further the pressure sensing effect has been investigated at various pressure values and during cyclic compression. Capacitance increase is found to be 818 ± 29 µF at pressure of 1 MPa. The increase is caused by higher interface area between electrode and electrolyte surface under uniaxial pressure. The results show that deformation of flexible solid-state supercapacitor can contribute to its performance and this type of device could be considered for use in energy harvesting systems.
