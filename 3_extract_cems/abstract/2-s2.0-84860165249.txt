Electrochemical supercapacitor is also called supercapacitor for short. As a new-type energy storage device, it possesses a wide application prospect. In order to utilize the supercapacitor properly, optimize its performance and simulate the whole energy storage system, it is essential to propose a model to describe the supercapacitor's working property accurately. In this paper, the basic working principle of supercapacitor is introduced. The various kinds of models of supercapacitor are reviewed and each model's trait and suitable applied boundary is analyzed in details. Some experiments aiming at equivalent circuit model which is used widely in engineering are fulfilled and relevant results and model's structure are also discussed deeply. Through analyzing the state-of-art of supercapacitor's modeling research and existing deficiency, the development tendency and research emphasis are expected.
