Sponge-like activated carbon with hierarchical pores and 3-dimensional (3D) connected skeletons has been fabricated by direct carbonization of super absorbent polymer followed by KOH activation. The pore size and shape of the porous carbon could be modulated by variation of carbonization temperature, which significantly affected the electrochemical performance. Specifically, the porous carbon obtained at an activation temperature of 700Â°C shows excellent capacitive performance in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte: a high specific capacitance of 243 F/g at a current density of 1A/g, and a high capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 cycles.
