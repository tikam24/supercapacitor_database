The ZrO2/PVDF-PAN composite membranes based as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polyacrylonitrile(PAN) with different ZrO2 contents were prepared by electrospinning. The morphology and specific surface area were characterized by SEM and BET, respectively. The results show that the morphologies of the composite membranes depend on the ZrO2 content. With the increasing of ZrO2 content, the surface of fibers becomes unsmooth and the specific surface area and liquid absorption rate increase, and they reach the maximum when the ZrO2 content is 0.4% of the mass of PVDF and PAN. To study the effect of ZrO2 content on electrochemical performance of composite membranes, super-capacitors were fabricated with the composite membrane as separators. Test results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) show that composite membrane with 0.4wt% ZrO2 possesses excellent electrochemical performance, in which the specific capacitance value and ionic conductivity reach 126.0 F/g and 9.31Ã—10-3 S/cm, respectively.
