The processability, conductivity, and stability of polyaniline (PANI) for supercapacitor application can be improved by altering the polymerization, oxidation state, and activating conditions. In this work, PANI has been created and coated concurrently on a different substrate via a one-step electrochemical polymerization method for supercapacitors application. Concentration of 0.2 M was used to exploit the condition parameter of the PANI-WE (PANI-Working electrode). The PANI-WE was then conducted by varying the substrate which are carbon, stainless steel, and carbon felt via electrode pretreatment and activating agent. The pretreatment enables the incorporation of large amount of active energy storage materials in the supercapacitor devices. The PANI compositeâ€™s potential to store energy was conducted with two different electrolytes of C6FeK4N6 and H2SO4 and compared. The electrodes made of PANI-Carbon felt with treatment using H2SO4 as both activating agent and electrolyte had the highest specific capacitance. Due to the synergistic relationship between PANI and carbon felt, PANI-Carbon Felt demonstrated better electrochemical performance than pure PANI. As a result of its good porosity and quick pseudocapacitive charge storage response, PANI increased capacitance in this circumstance, whereas carbon felt aided in improving conductivity and stability. Carbon felt gives highest yield of PANI with a weight of 0.0274 g due to the porous morphology of the carbon felt which has a high surface area and porosity.
