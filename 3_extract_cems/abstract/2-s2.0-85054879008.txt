The CuS/MnS composite hexagonal nanosheet clusters were fabricated through a one-step facile hydrothermal method without any surfactant. The adding of CuS plays a role of template for the growth of CuS/MnS composite, as CuS can induce the growth of MnS, forming a stable three-dimensional cluster structure composed by hexagonal nanosheets, which provides easy access of electrolyte, effective electronic transmission and stable circulation structure. The as synthesized CuS/MnS composite electrode (3 h) shows a high specific capacitance (1144 F g-1 at 1 A g−1), which is five times higher than that of either CuS or MnS electrode under the same conditions, excellent rate property (567 F g-1 at 50 A g−1 and 40.8% rate retention even at 100 A g−1), and good cycling stability (85.9% of the initial capacity after 10000 cycles). So, the CuS/MnS nano-composite should be a promising candidate electrode material for supercapacitors.
