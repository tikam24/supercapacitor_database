Graphene has shown superiority for advanced carbon electrodes in supercapacitors, characterized by high power density but limited energy density. Combining pseudocapacitive materials with graphene can alleviate the problem. This work synthesized the three-dimensional strutted graphene (SG) via the ammonium-salt-assisted sugar-blowing method, and the self-supporting MnO2/SG porous monolith was then constructed via growing manganese oxide (MnO2) nanorod array on the SG support in hydrothermal process. When tested in supercapacitor, the MnO2/SG hybrid electrode achieved a high specific capacitance of 343.6 F•g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A•g-1, exhibiting excellent cycling stability with 83.8% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The symmetric supercapacitor further showed a high energy density of 11.93 W•h•kg-1 at a power density of 500 W•kg-1. The impressive result indicates a promising prospect of the excellent MnO2/SG hybrid to be applied to electrochemical energy storage.
