The paper presents a model of the drive system of an electric vehicle with a hybrid energy storage system. Electric drive consist of a permanent magnets synchronous motor supplied by a battery and a supercapacitor. Bi-directional DC/DC converter shall be responsible for transfer of energy from a power supply unit to the motor and its recovery during braking. The time characteristics of motor electromechanical values and parameters of power supply system were recorded during simulation testing carried out for various conditions of operation.
