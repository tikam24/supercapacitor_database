The Control Rods Drive Mechanism (CRDM) power system is a significant subsystem to ensure the safety operation of nuclear reactors. During the operation of the CRDM, factors such as the load fluctuation of the reactor and the voltage turbulence of the power supply will affect the operating state of the CRDM. In view of the weak robustness of the CRDM power supply, this paper proposed a hybrid power system based on adaptive dual-droop frequency dividing coordinated control, which can not only compensate for the voltage and current fluctuations caused by the power supply interference and the load switching of the drive motor, but also can realize the self-balance of external energy replenishment and energy storage unit inside the system, thereby effectively improves the stability, safety and reliability of the CRDM operation.
