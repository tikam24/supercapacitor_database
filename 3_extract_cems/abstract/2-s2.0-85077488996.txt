Ni-Co sulfides are prepared using a two-step method, including a solvothermal method for synthesizing precursor and a subsequent sulfuration treatment. Effect of sulfuration time on the formation of Ni-Co sulfides is investigated. Experiment results show that sulfuration time affects crystallinity, morphology, pore structure, specific surface area, and then the electrochemical properties of Ni-Co sulfides. So controllable preparation of Ni-Co sulfides can be realized by adjusting the sulfuration time. Optimum sulfuration time can lead to an increase in the crystallinity and electrical conductivity along with the excellent electrochemical properties of Ni-Co sulfide.
