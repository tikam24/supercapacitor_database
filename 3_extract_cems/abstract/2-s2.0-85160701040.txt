The optimization of supercapacitive properties in carbon materials derived from cheap and sustainable wood scraps exhibits great application potential. Herein, in support of interfacial groups, polyaniline nanospheres were in situ constructed in the internal pore structure of wood scraps; further, the B and N elements were imported by carbonized and hydrothermal methods. The doped B regulated the species of N doping to improve the electrical conductivity of carbonized wood scraps, and it endowed a certain pseudo-capacitance. Coupled with the fine double-layer capacitance from the hierarchical structures constructed by carbonized nanospheres and wood scrap channels, a high specific capacitance of 406 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, high energy density (17.71 Wh kg−1 at 250 W kg−1) and cycle stability (93.04% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) were performed simultaneously. This study provided a new strategy to improve the supercapacitive performance of bio-carbon materials in terms of structure and conductance.
