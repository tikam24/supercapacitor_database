Freestanding electrodes fabricated with hierarchical core-shell micro-/nano-structured materials synthesized from redox-type metal oxides show enormous potential for portable electronic devices. In this, a novel and facile strategy for the preparation of petaloid and origami-lantern shaped MnO2/Co2CH@C hierarchical porous core-shell nanorod arrays is proposed. The fabricated electrode based on MnO2/Co2CH@C hybrid composite exhibits superior capability of 2022 mF cm−2 under high current density of 5 mA cm−2, which can be explained by the well-oriented petal-like and origami-lantern shaped nanosheets as well as the 3D core-shell porous hierarchical structure. Additionally, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor equipment is assembled on basis of the synthesized hierarchical MnO2/Co2CH@C hybrid, exhibiting an energy density of 15 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 255 W kg−1. Notably, the multifunctional instrument can be operated by the assembled device for 8 min, while monitoring time, temperature and air humidity in a portable outdoor environment. Moreover, a blue indicator can also be operated for 9 min long, evidencing their potential commercial applications. Overall, this work demonstrates the promising potential of the synthesized novel origami-lantern shaped and highly oriented hierarchical composites for electrochemical energy storage applications.
