A series of SnS/Graphene (SnS/G) nanocomposites at various concentrations of graphene were synthesized by a wet chemical route and the prepared composites were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) for its structural and morphological investigation. Results show that the prepared SnS nanoparticles in the composite are 30nm sized and uniformly dispersed on graphene sheets. To test the supercapacitance behavior, electrochemical measurements were carried out in 6M KOH electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 984F/g was observed for SnS/G-c at 5mVs-1 scan rate. Galvanostatic charge/discharge curves showed an excellent cyclic stability with higher charge/discharge duration, and hence could be used for high performance supercapacitor applications.
