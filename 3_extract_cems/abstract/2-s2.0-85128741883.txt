In this paper, NiO/reduced graphene oxide (NiO/RGO) composites were synthesized, and the strong bonding between NiO and RGO stemmed from alkaline hydrothermal treatment and calcination in air. NiO nanoparticles were coated on RGO to avoid volume expansion during electrochemical processes. Due to the high electron transfer rate of RGO and the effective bonding of NiO nanoparticles to RGO, the NiO/RGO composites show a high specific capacity of 68.9 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an excellent cycling stability of 86.7% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. In general, this work offers an attractive route to synthesize NiO/RGO composites. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
