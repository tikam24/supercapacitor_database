With the aid of large Seebeck coefficients, over 1 mV K-1, redox-free ionic conductors have the potential to be used as a component of thermally chargeable supercapacitors and/or thermopiles. To date, most ionic conductors reported exhibit p-type polarity; therefore, it is challenging to develop thermoelectric (TE) supercapacitor modules comprising both p- and n-type TE legs due to the lack of n-type ionic conductors. Herein, we found that the intrinsically p-type polarity of alkylmethylimidazolium chloride (Rmim:Cl)-based ionic hydrogels could be converted into n-type, using poly(3,3-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonyl) (PEDOT:PSS)-conducting polymer electrodes. Complementary characterization of the TE voltage response and absorption spectroscopy suggests that "negative"interfacial polarization is induced under asymmetric heating. This results from the ion exchange between PEDOT:PSS and Rmim:Cl upon creating the interfaces and the high affinity of Rmim:PSS compared with PEDOT:Cl, which results in the n-type TE response. Our findings offer a useful method for tuning the polarity of TE supercapacitors by tailoring the ion/electrode interactions despite the use of an identical electrolyte. This journal is
