A relative newcomer to the energy storage market, the Lithium Ion Hybrid Super Capacitor is a novel technology breaking new ground in the technology sector. The (LIC) or (LIHC) is fast evolving as the missing link between the Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) and the Lithium Ion Battery (LIB), being a distinct hybrid of the two technologies. The LIHC combines both energy and power with far longer life and safety features. The use of LIHC capacitors has already woven itself into many industry applications including but not limited to hybrid vehicles, remote area charging solutions, energy harvesting and storage and communications technologies. Mass deployment of LIHCs seems inevitable given the uptake in design processes with the pros outweighing the cons and with higher volume production increasing rapidly. In this paper we will model the Lithium Ion Capacitor characteristics and explore how they perform against an equivalent rival, the standard EDLCwith specific focus on the instantaneous initial charge performance of Lithium Ion Capacitors compared to the other. The focus of this study model is the behaviour of a standard EDLC Super-capacitors Equivalent Series Resistance, “ESR” versus an LIHC Super-capacitor “ESR” of comparable specification in the initial seconds of state of charge.
