As a novel component used for energy conversion and storage, supercapacitors have been in the spotlight nowadays owing to the urgent need for energy, and the research and development of electrode materials plays a crucial role in the final performance of supercapacitors. MOFs can be used as an excellent electrode material due to its remarkable advantages such as considerable specific surface area, abundant active sites, controllable pore size distribution, and easy synthesis. In this paper, the latest research progress of MOFs, MOFs derivatives and MOFs composites in the field of supercapacitors is elaborated respectively, and the future research direction of MOFs-based electrode materials is also prospected.
