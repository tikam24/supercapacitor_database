Rare earth based metal-organic frameworks (RE-MOFs) are gaining importance in energy storage applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of two new RE-MOFs (Ln-H2PDA, Ln=La and Sm) under hydrothermal conditions using pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (H2PDA) linker. The single-crystal analysis revealed that La-H2PDA MOF crystallizes into monoclinic system with P 21/c space group. Sm-H2PDA MOF also has the same crystal system, which is confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction pattern. These MOFs are evaluated for their charge storage behaviour using conventional 3-electrode system. Both La-H2PDA and Sm-H2PDA delivered high specific capacity of 220 C g−1 (488 F g−1) and 711 C g−1 (1580 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, a symmetric Swagelok device (Sm-H2PDA∥Sm-H2PDA) has been fabricated using Sm-H2PDA MOF as working electrodes. The maximum energy density and power density delivered by this device are 18 Wh kg−1 and 3744 W kg−1.
