Battery and supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has been widely known for solving a power density problem of a conventional battery storage system for electric vehicles (EVs). Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising solution for the EV charging. In this paper, the frame of wireless charging is given for EV applications and a charging power control method for the HESS to achieve the constant current charging of the main battery is proposed. A small power test equipment is implemented and the effectiveness of the charging power control is verified by the experiment. This result shows the importance of the SC bank for the WPT charging system and the need for optimized power coordination control of the HESS.
