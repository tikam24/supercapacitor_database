Graphene materials (GMs) as supercapacitor electrode materials have been investigated. GMs are prepared from graphene oxide sheets, and subsequently suffer a gas-based hydrazine reduction to restore the conducting carbon network. A maximum specific capacitance of 205 F/g with a measured power density of 10 kW/kg at energy density of 28.5 Wh/kg in an aqueous electrolyte solution has been obtained. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor devices exhibit excellent long cycle life along with ∼90% specific capacitance retained after 1200 cycle tests. These remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high performance, environmentally friendly and low-cost electrical energy storage devices based on this new 2D graphene material. © 2009 American Chemical Society.
