Increasing the energy efficiency in hybrid energy storage-based electric vehicles is among the important research areas. Energy sharing in such vehicles is possible with an efficient and optimum energy management system. In this study, a Jaya-based modular energy management system is proposed to optimize power sharing between battery and ultracapacitor for an electric vehicle. In this system, battery is connected to DC bus directly, and ultracapacitor is connected via a bidirectional DC-DC converter. This converter provides the power flow between the DC bus and the ultracapacitor as well as perform the proposed energy management system algorithm. The designed modular energy management system has the feature of being easily integrated into a battery-only electric vehicle, and two-way power transfer between the battery and the ultracapacitor has been successfully achieved. At the same time, real-time implementation of Jaya-based energy management system is experimentally tested for the first time and compared to rule-based energy management system. The proposed Jaya-based energy management system reduces the total loss amount by 24.5% and the battery current root mean square value by 28.8% compared to the rule-based method. The results show that the proposed method can be successfully applied for real-time energy management system applications.
