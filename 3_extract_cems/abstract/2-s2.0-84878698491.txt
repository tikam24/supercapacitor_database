Manganese oxide/single-wall carbon nanotubes (MnO2/SWNT) composite was co-deposited by the potentiostatic method on a graphite slice. Morphological and structural performances for MnO2/SWNT composite were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The wall surface of SWNT was wrapped by ramsdellite MnO2 nanoparticles to fabricate MnO2/SWNT coaxial nanotubes, which further interconnected other MnO2 particles to form the porous MnO2/SWNT composite. The electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge and discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum. A high specific capacitance of 421 F g-1 was obtained for overall MnO2/SWNT composite electrode at the constant current density of 1 A g-1 in 3 mol L -1 KCl solution.
