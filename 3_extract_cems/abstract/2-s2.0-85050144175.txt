Isolated DC microgrids gained more popularity in serving the remote locations due to their numerous merits. As the isolated DC microgrids are primarily dependent on renewable energy sources (RES), the reliability become major issue. Thus storage system and diesel generator (DG) are employed to overcome this issue. DG is more reliable and cost effective solution in this regard. But it suffers with cranking delay and fuel efficiency under variable loading condition. Even though variable speed diesel generators are deployed, still the startup delay (cranking delay) and inertial issues of RES are inevitable. In addition to this, dynamic fluctuations in DC bus directly affects the battery life. A novel configuration is proposed in this paper by considering the supercapacitor as DC link capacitor between DG side converter and DC-DC converter so that it can address aforementioned issues along with reduction in number of converters utilized. A new power control strategy is also developed by using modified control schemes to achieve the effective coordination and power management among all the sources. Simulation of proposed configuration is executed in real time digital simulator (RTDS) to validate its effectiveness under various scenarios.
