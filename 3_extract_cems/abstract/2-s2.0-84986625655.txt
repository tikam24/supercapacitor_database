The efficiency of silicon carbide (SiC) nanocauliflowers (NCs) as electrode material for supercapacitor application has been investigated in detail in the present work. The SiC NCs were deposited on Ag coated porous alumina (AAO) substrates via a DC magnetron cosputtering technique at room temperature. The Ag coated porous AAO substrate acts as an excellent current collector and also enhances the high specific capacitance of SiC NCs up to ∼300 F/g at 5 mV/s. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device delivered a high specific capacitance (188 F/g at 5 mV/s), good cycling ability (97.05% capacitance retention after 30,000 cycles), high energy density (31.43 Wh/kg), and also a high power density (∼18.8 kW/kg at 17.76 Wh/kg) in a voltage range of 1.8 V. These observed excellent electrochemical performances of the present SiC NCs based device suggest it has tremendous potential as supercapacitor electrodes in energy storage applications.
