In this study, first time the nanometric powder of La2Ti2O7 (abbreviated as LTO) is taken as the electrode material for supercapacitor. The prepared material is characterized by various characterization techniques to know its structural and textural properties. The specific capacitance of the La2Ti2O7 is calculated from charge discharge curve. The Nyquist plot, bode plot and the plot of real capacitance vs. imaginary capacitance is well in support of supercapacitive activity of La2Ti2O7. The La2Ti2O7 exhibits 71 F/g of specific capacitance in 2 M KOH with 95.7% retention after 5000 cycles is due to the effective access of electrolyte to the redox sites owing to its layered structure. As these finding are new to the scientific community and demonstrate the great potential of La2Ti2O7 as electrode material for supercapacitor, the current findings may give a new pave in the area of supercapacitor research.
