MoO2 and MoO3 with specific morphologies are synthesized on flexible carbon cloth through a facile hydrothermal method as supercapacitor electrodes. The prepared prismatic MoO3 shows a specific capacitance of 54.7 F g−1 in 1 M LiOH electrolyte. Moreover, the prepared MoO2 presents a spherical profile with hierarchical porous structure. Each MoO2 sphere is stacked with several layers of MoO2 “spindle” which is further built by amounts of MoO2 nanoparticles. A high specific capacitance of 381.0 F g−1 is achieved for the MoO2 sphere electrode, 7 times higher than that of MoO3.
