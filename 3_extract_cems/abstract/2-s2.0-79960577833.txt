Supercapacitor, with high power density and long cycle life, has unique advantages and development prospects in avoiding regeneration failure, improving the braking force in high-speed range and realizing catenary-free operation in urban railway. First, the characteristic curves of the vehicle and characteristics of supercapacitors are studied. Based on matching their characteristics, a power distribution control strategy for on-board supercapacitor energy storage system is proposed. A simulation model and a 3kW experimental platform are set up, in order to simulate single vehicle and single substation. Both of the simulation results and experimental results have verified the feasibility of the control strategy. Â© 2011 IEEE.
