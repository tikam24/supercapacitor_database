The hierarchical core-shell structure CuCo2S4@NiCoAl-LDH/NF composite with 3D mesoporous network structure was designed and prepared, where the NiCoAl hydrotalcite (NiCoAl-LDH) was as shell, and the CuCo2S4 nanotube array on Ni foam (NF) as core. Owing to the unique architecture and integration of respective merits from each component, the core-shell material displayed a large surface area, high conductivity, short ion diffusion path and rapid interfacial charge transmission. So, the CuCo2S4@NiCoAl-LDH/NF electrode showed superior electrochemical performances with a high specific capacitance of 938C g−1 (1876 F g−1) at 1.0 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (retention of 91.11% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The eminent performances suggested that the CuCo2S4@NiCoAl-LDH/NF with 3D mesoporous network core-shell structure was one of the candidates as electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
