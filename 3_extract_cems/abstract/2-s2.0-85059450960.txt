Polypyrrole, a conductive polymer, has been recognized as a promising material for preparing advanced energy storage devices. And an energy storage material based on tubular graphitic carbon nitride is introduced to fabricate supercapacitors electrodes. In this study, freestanding core-shell NFC/PPy/TGCN composite film was successfully fabricated by simple polymerization followed by vacuum-induced self-assembly. The obtained electrodes delivered high areal capacitance of 2.53 F cm −2 at the current density of 5 mA cm −2 , equivalent to a specific capacitance of 158 F g −1 . The environmentally friendly aspects of the proposed method coupled with low-cost of fabrication and excellent electrochemical performances make it the future of energy storage devices.
