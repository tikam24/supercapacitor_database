With the technological advances in wearable and portable electronic devices, the demands for associated technologies including flexible energy storage devices increase. Among many types of energy storage devices, flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are highly attractive in comparison with others as they exhibit high power density, high storage density, and mechanical stability. In particular, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are being widely used as the electrode materials for FSCs, owing to their mechanical strength and outstanding electrical performance. Herein, we classified CNT-based FSCs according to the structural types of CNTs and the materials incorporated. The unique structures and properties of the three types of CNTs (single-walled CNTs (SWCNT), double-walled CNTs (DWCNT), and multi-walled CNTs (MWCNT)) are compared and the mechanisms of FSCs are discussed. Finally, a summary of the overall electrochemical properties and current development of the reported FSC electrodes based on SWCNT, DWCNT, and MWCNT are presented thoroughly.
