In independent photovoltaic illumination system, the supercapacitor model group consisting of six 100 F/2.7 V monomers plays a part in energy transfer between the solar cell and storage battery. The six monomers were in series when the open circuit voltage was higher than 17.5 V, otherwise the six monomers were divided into three groups and each of which was constituted of two series monomers. Then the supercapacitor model group in the way of series by six monomers was responsible for charging up the storage battery. Real-time monitor was implemented by the LabVIEW data acquisition system. The results indicated that the characteristics of constant voltage and intermittent slow pulse in the charging process were carried out by using supercapacitor for energy transfer. Besides, the process of charging conformed to the optimal current acceptance curve of storage battery and it can not only improve the reception of solar energy but also prolong the service lifetime of storage battery.
