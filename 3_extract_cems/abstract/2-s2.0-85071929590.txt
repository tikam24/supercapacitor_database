In this paper, a novel non-coupled non-isolated double-input bidirectional high-gain converter is proposed for integrating hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) to DC micro-grids. The converter does not use the traditional techniques such as coupled-inductor or multi-winding transformer to achieve high-gain, hence problems such as voltage spikes or circulating currents are not present. It also has the ability of charging and discharging battery and supercapacitor independently. Moreover, it only utilizes six switches, which is less than its counterparts use. In addition, unlike other high gain converters it uses only three active switches in every mode, so conduction losses are decreased by a steep rate. The steady-state analysis of proposed converter is presented, to validate the analysis, detailed PSPICE simulations were carried out for calculating the precise gain of converter and power losses in several cases. Finally, a lab prototype of the converter is constructed, and experimental results are presented.
