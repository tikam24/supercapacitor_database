Herein, we have constructed a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) with outstanding energy density (ED) using MoS2-rGO and CuO@MnO2-rGO hybrid electrodes as the negative and positive electrodes respectively. The CuO@MnO2-rGO electrode represents significant electrochemical properties, such as significant specific capacitance (Csc) of 421.30 F g−1, superior rate capability, and outstanding durability. Furthermore, the MoS2-rGO electrode displays superior electrochemical behavior containing a good specific capacitance (Csc) of 329 F g−1 with a satisfactory rate capability of 56% and significant durability. Due to the excellent specific capacitance (Csc) and remarkable rate performance of CuO@MnO2-rGO and MoS2-rGO electrodes, the FASC illustrates outstanding electrochemical performance consisting of supreme cycle life (only 8.1% loss after 10,000 cycles), an outstanding energy density (ED) of 165.66 Wh kg−1 and a power density (PD) of 1992 W kg−1.
