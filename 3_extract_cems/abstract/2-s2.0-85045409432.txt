A 3D printing approach is first developed to fabricate quasi-solid-state asymmetric micro-supercapacitors to simultaneously realize the efficient patterning and ultrahigh areal energy density. Typically, cathode, anode, and electrolyte inks with high viscosities and shear-thinning rheological behaviors are first prepared and 3D printed individually on the substrates. The 3D printed asymmetric micro-supercapacitor with interdigitated electrodes exhibits excellent structural integrity, a large areal mass loading of 3.1 mg cm−2, and a wide electrochemical potential window of 1.6 V. Consequently, this 3D printed asymmetric micro-supercapacitor displays an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 207.9 mF cm−2. More importantly, an areal energy density of 73.9 µWh cm−2 is obtained, superior to most reported interdigitated micro-supercapacitors. It is believed that the efficient 3D printing strategy can be used to construct various asymmetric micro-supercapacitors to promote the integration in on-chip energy storage systems.
