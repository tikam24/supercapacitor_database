Recently, the various 2D two-dimensional structural materials were synthesized and fabrication of electrodes for widely used in electrochemical capacitors, catalysis, electronics and energy renovation via hydrothermal reaction process. These materials provide the greater surface and ultrathin sheets morphology and enhances the asymmetric supercapacitor applications. V2O5@N-MWCNT and V2O5@N-MWCNT/CMC composite synthesized via hydrothermal process exhibited the sheet like morphological and larger surface properties for improved the supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical properties of the composite's electrodes were explored by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. The composite materials were demonstrated a specific capacitance 138F g−1 at 1A g−1 applied current density, which is much superior than that of pristine V2O5 materials. Furthermore, the composite electrodes show the excellent cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles with 98.6% retention in presence of 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The enhancement of electrochemical behaviour due to the increasing surface area and morphological properties of synthesized composite.
