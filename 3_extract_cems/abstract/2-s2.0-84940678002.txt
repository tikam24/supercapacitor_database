The design and synthesis of unique core-shell heterostructures for high-performance supercapacitors have exerted a tremendous fascination and have recently attracted intensive attention. In this paper, a three-dimensional ZnO@Ni(OH)2 core-shell heterostructure is controllably synthesized through an electrospinning method combined with a hydrothermal approach. The as-prepared ZnO@Ni(OH)2 heterostructures are investigated for their use as electrodes for supercapacitors, which exhibit excellent electrochemical performances such as ultrahigh specific capacitance (2218 F g-1 at 2 mV s-1) and superior rate capability even at a high scan rate. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with the as-obtained ZnO@Ni(OH)2 hybrid as the positive electrode and the porous carbon microfibers as the negative electrode yields a high energy density of 57.6 W h kg-1 with a power density of 129.7 W kg-1. Hence, the ZnO@Ni(OH)2 hybrid holds great promise for high-performance energy storage applications.
