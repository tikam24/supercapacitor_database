Supercapacitor installation of energy storage elevator was analyzed. A method adopting traffic flow difference to calculate supercapacitor capacity was proposed. The method draws traffic curve in one day from actual conditions. Combined with charging and discharging energy equations of supercapacitor, supercapacitor capacity range which meets continuous operation of the elevator is determined. A reasonable supercapacitor capacity is determined starting from the actual data, thereby the cost of the system is reduced. Energy management strategy by bus voltage detection was adopted. Three states were analyzed including motor, renewable generator and grid false and corresponding control strategies, respectively. The system simulation model was built in MATLAB/Simulink. Results show that system control strategy can effectively achieve energy allocation.
