α-Form CoxNi1-x hydroxides with different Co/Ni ratios were synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method under mild conditions. The effects of Co/Ni ratio on the structure, morphology, and supercapacitive properties of α-form CoxNi1-x hydroxides were investigated in detail. α-Form CoxNi1-x hydroxides had structures similar to those of hydrotalcite and α-Co(OH)2, and they exhibited better electrochemical performance than α-Co(OH)2 on testing by XRD, FTIR, and electrochemical performance (when x ≠ 0). The highest specific capacitance at 1 Ag-1 for α-form CoxNi1-x hydroxides (for x = 0.2) is 1696.7 Fg-1. An asymmetric supercapacitor packaged with Co0.6Ni0.4 hydroxide and activated carbon as positive and negative material, respectively, had an energy density of 23.5 Whkg-1 at a power density of 412.5 Wkg-1.
