This paper focuses on the optimization of the sizing of the on-board storage system in an electric vehicle. The source studied is composed of a combination of two Li-ion battery technologies (a high-power density battery and another high energy density). The interest of this hybridization will be illustrated by comparing the performance of this solution with that of a conventional source (high power battery). A study on the various possible hybridizations is detailed. Following this study, a report is drawn up on the interest of each hybridization according to constraints related to the type of mission, desired autonomy, weight, volume and lifespan of the storage system. The conclusion of this work led us to the need for a very precise choice of the auxiliary storage system. The latter must ensure sufficient autonomy to respect the constraints linked to the aging of the source.
