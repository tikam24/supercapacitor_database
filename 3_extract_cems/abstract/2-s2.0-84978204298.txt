In this work, we report a novel battery-type electrode of three-dimensional hierarchical Co3O4@NiMoO4 flower-like hybrid arrays on Ni foam synthesized with the combination of hydrothermal and post-annealing treatment. The Co3O4 nanowire arrays are utilized as scaffolds and interconnected NiMoO4 nanosheets are grown on the surface. The as-prepared Co3O4@NiMoO4 hybrid arrays exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacity (636.8 C/g at 5 mA/cm2) and cycling stability (84.1% retention over 2000 cycles at 20 mA/cm2). The assembled hybrid supercapacitor device based on Co3O4@NiMoO4 and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes can achieve a high energy density of 58.5 Wh/kg at 389 W/kg, suggesting the great potential for applications in supercapacitors.
