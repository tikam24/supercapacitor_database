This paper initiates the implementation of ultra-capacitors (UCs) and static synchronous series compensators (SSSC) as an effective supplementary control strategy for interconnected power system (IPS) system. Initially, the two-area traditional hydro-thermal (TATHT) system is deliberated as an investigative model and for a step load perturbation of 10% (10%SLP) on area-1 the entire analysis is carried out. Tilt-Integral-Derivative with filter (TIDF) based on fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) is suggested as the frequency regulator to the TATHT system whose efficacy is revealed with the different controllers. Moreover, the TATHT for investigative analysis is deliberated with time delays (TDs) as the practical constraint for realistic investigation. Later, the UCs-SSSC devices are incorporated with the TATHT and the investigative analysis reveals a significant amelioration in the system performance.
