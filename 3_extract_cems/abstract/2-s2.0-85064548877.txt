In this study, the synthesis of WO3 using different acids was carried out to test its electrochemical performance and applicability in electrochemical charge storage devices like supercapacitors. Hydrochloric acid (W1), sulfuric acid (W2) and nitric acid (W3) were used to synthesize WO3, which was deposited on a carbon cloth substrate via a hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization confirmed the formation of hexagonal WO3 in all three samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to analyze the morphology, size and shape of the deposited material, and different nano structures, such as nano spheres, nano rods and hexagonal platelets, were observed, which confirms the effect of different acids on the morphology, shape and size of the particle. Electrochemical characterizations using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests suggest that the samples exhibit charge-storage capability and can be utilized as active materials in energy storage devices. Sample W2 exhibits highest specific capacitance of 778 Fg − 1 at 5 mVs − 1 scan rate while W1 showed the lowest specific capacitance (500 Fg − 1 at 5 mVs − 1 ) of all three samples. The effect of acid on WO3 parameters and consequently its electrochemical performance has been discussed further.
