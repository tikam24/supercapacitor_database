By carbonizing a filter paper carrying hydrated manganese oxide, a new MnO/C composite was prepared. The surface morphology and crystal structure of the composite were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction technique. The electrochemical characteristics of the composite was evaluated by cyclic voltammetrty and galvanostatic. charge-discharge method. The MnO/C composite electrode has a high specific capacitance (248 F/g at 50 mV/s), excellent power characteristics (1.6% decrease in specific capacitance from 10 to 1000 mV/s), and long-term cycle stability (6.4% decreases in specific capacitance for 6000 charge-discharge cycles). These results imply that the MnO/C composite electrode is an excellent candidate for supercapacitors.
