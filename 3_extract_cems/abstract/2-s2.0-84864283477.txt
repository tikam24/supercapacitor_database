Cobalt nickel double hydroxides (Co xNi 1-x LDHs) nanoparticles were synthesized by a polyvinyl pyrrolidone-assisted chemical co-precipitation method. It was found that the ratio between Co and Ni had a significant effect on their electrochemical activities. The specific capacitance of 2614 F g -1 was achieved when the atomic ratio of Co to Ni was equal to 0.57:0.43. This Co 0.57Ni 0.43 LDH sample had a BET specific surface area of 109.8 m 2 g -1 and total pore volume of 0.6036 cm 3 g -1, and its pore size distribution was mainly in the range of 1.5-5 nm, which led to the high liquid-solid interfacial area and further increased the utilization of the active materials. Additionally, the Co 0.57Ni 0.43 LDH electrode exhibited a good electrochemical stability with 86.4% of the initial capacitance over 1000 consecutive cycles at 5 A g -1. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
