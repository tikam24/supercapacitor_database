Novel CoMoO4 and Ni1/3Co2/3MoO4 nanosheets were synthesized by a time-saving solvothermal method with medium conditions, and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). Enhanced specific capacitance (1032.39 F g-1 at 4 A g-1) and good cycle stability (remaining 85.18% at after 1000 cycles) are observed in aqueous KOH electrolytes of Ni1/3Co2/3MoO4 nanosheets, which could be ascribed to the high charge accommodation, small ion-transport resistance, and good electrical conductivity of the ultrathin nanosheet structure. In addition, the as-prepared CoMoO4 nanosheets exhibited good electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose.
