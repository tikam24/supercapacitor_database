We report on preparation and evaluation of Carbon-nano-spheres (CNS) for their implementation as a high performance supercapacitor electrode by integrating with polyaniline (PANI). Initially, CNS were obtained on combustion of 1,7,7-trimethyl bicycloheptan just by one step green synthesis route. The obtained specimen was subjected to electron microscopy, BET and Raman spectroscopy. Analysis revealed that, obtained material was spherically interconnected network of CNS having hetero-structured molecular phases of sp2 and sp3 distributed randomly within nano-sphere. The measurements were performed with different scan rates by cyclic voltammetry. By and large, nano- composite exhibited a specific capacitance of - 1470 F/g in a medium of 1 M HCl with high cyclic stability. Details of the analysis are presented.
