Here, a novel yuba-like porous carbon microrod is prepared via a simple and facile strategy by using the fluffy fibers of celosia cristata petals (FCCP) as the raw material. The optimized carbon microrod (FCCP-CM-900) possesses unique yuba-like structure, high specific surface area (1680 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (0.98 cm3 g−1), and effective nitrogen (∼4.52 at.%) and oxygen (∼5.49 at.%) doping, which can enhance the wettability and conductivity (7.9 S cm−1). As the electrode material for supercapacitor, FCCP-CM-900-based supercapacitor presents high specific capacitance (314.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) in 6.0 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The FCCP-CM-900-based symmetrical supercapacitor displays high energy density (18.6 Wh kg−1 at 233.4 W kg−1) and outstanding cycling stability (98% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) in 1.0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. In addition, served as oxygen reduction electrocatalyst, the FCCP-CM-900 also exhibits excellent catalytic activity, good durability, together with high methanol tolerance in alkaline electrolyte, which makes it a highly efficient air cathode material toward zinc–air cell.
