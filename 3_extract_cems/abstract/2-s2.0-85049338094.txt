In this paper, a high gain multiport bidirectional DC to DC converter is proposed. It has applications in hybrid electric vehicles and AC/DC microgrid system. Converter has bidirectional power flow capability and inter source power sharing. It can be used for both equal and unequal voltage sources.There are three inputs ports, one for the source, second is the storage port, and third one is used for the ultracapacitor to reduce the battery size in peak hour loading. Coupled inductor is used for high gain capability. Depending on the battery and ultra capacitor charge and discharged, three operating modes are defined. Operation and analysis is discussed for all three operating modes. Converter modeling and simulation is performed using SIMULINK (MATLAB). Converter has high gain in all the operating modes. To validate the simulated and theoretical results a prototype of 500 W, 1 A is developed using hardware in the loop simulation dSPACE (DS1104) system.
