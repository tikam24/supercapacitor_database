Taguchi optimization technique is used for obtaining optimal chemical composition of active materials to achieve maximum specific capacitance and minimum ESR for cobalt oxide-based electrode for supercapacitor. The study is based on interaction effect of three control factors which are mass loading of Co2O3, PVDF and MW-CNT, respectively. A regression model equation is also developed and validated experimentally. Optimum level of the control factors for maximum specific capacitance is found as Co2O3-40%, PVDF-10%, and MWCNT-30% and for minimum ESR is found as Co2O3-40%, PVDF-20%, and MWCNT-5%, respectively. The results can lead to new insights into development of supercapacitors with enhanced performance.
