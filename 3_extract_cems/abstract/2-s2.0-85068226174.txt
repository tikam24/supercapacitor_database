In order to compensate the power of pulsed power source, an ultracapacitor-battery active hybrid pulsed power source is proposed based on the bandwidth control strategy. Firstly, the pulsed load is defined and its static and dynamic characteristics are analyzed. Secondly, the mathematical model of hybrid pulsed power source is established and its working mechanism is introduced. Thirdly, an active hybrid pulsed power source based on the bandwidth control of Butterworth second-order low-pass filter is designed. Finally, the hybrid pulsed power source is verified theoretically under the SIMULINK simulation environment, and an experimental platform is set up to verify the proposed pulsed power source. The simulation and experiment results indicate that the pulsed power source adequately meets the loadrequirements of both energy. The ultracapacitor has significant effect on the battery power compensation with 1.7 A current output at the pulse time, which optimizes the battery discharge process, so that the battery current fluctuation is only 0.5 A with the almost smooth current curve.
