The present study reported the performance of free-standing carbon nanofibers decorated with copper-metal-organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs). A green electrospinning technique was utilized to obtain nanofiber sheets that were carbonized and activated to produce activated carbon nanofiber sheets (ACNFs). These ACNFs consist of inherent oxygen functionalities of the lignin that can aid the growth of MOF structure on it in a single step, which motivated us to do this work. Cu-MOF particles were in-situ grown over the surface of ACNFs using a hydrothermal-assisted technique. The developed materials were characterized using FESEM, Raman Spectroscopy and BET analysis in order to identify morphological, porosity, and surface area transformations. Along with these, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) studies were performed to compare the electrochemical performance of the Cu-MOF, ACNF, and Cu-MOF@ACNF as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Among three electrodes, the Cu-MOF@ACNF sheet reveals a higher specific capacitance of 303.2 F/g compared to ACNF (203.3 F/g) and Cu-MOF (68.2 F/g) at the same current density of 1 A/g. Based on the higher performance of Cu-MOF@ACNF two types of symmetrical devices, i.e., aqueous (using electrolyte-impregnated filter paper) and solid-state devices (using a polymeric gel electrolyte), were fabricated. The all-solid-state supercapacitor device was found to feature high flexibility, stand-alone characteristics, and excellent performance as an electrode with a working potential window of 0â€“2.0 V. The device demonstrates a high energy density of 78.71 Wh/kg and a power density of 1050.0 W/kg, along with high coulombic efficiency (99.8 %) after 10,000 cycles. The achieved performance is superior to many published reports, revealing that the developed composite materials hold prospect for applications in green and high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
