Diatomite-templated carbon was prepared with diatomite as template and furfuryl alcohol (FA) as carbon resource, which was further activated with potassium hydroxide as activating agent. The prepared carbon materials were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption. Simultaneously, the electrochemical properties of the porous carbon before and after activation were studied. The results show that the porous carbon after activation has higher degree of disorder in chemical structure and better electrochemical properties rather than the one before activation. The specific capacitance of the porous carbon was in the range from 45.0 to 69.2 F·g-1 by the current density of 1 A·g-1and the capacitance retention remains more than 45% by the current density of 20 A·g-1. These results show that the porous carbon after activation has good electrochemical performance and it's an ideal material for electric double layer capacitor. KEY WORDS
