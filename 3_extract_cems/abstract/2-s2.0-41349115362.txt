Supercapacitors are electrical energy storage devices, which offer high power density, extremely high cycling capability and mechanical robustness. Recent technology improvements enabled supercapacitors to be an interesting option for short-term high power applications, such as in industry, automotive and traction drives, regenerative energy systems, medical and telecommunication equipment. Due to the decomposition voltage of the organic electrolyte of approximately 3 V, the maximum cell voltage of supercapacitors is limited. To obtain higher voltages, a series connection of supercapacitor cells is necessary to form a supercapacitor module. Looking at real modules, series connections of supercapacitor cells lead to unequal voltage distributions because of the capacitance manufacturing tolerances and differences in self-discharge rates. For current in-production cells, the spread of capacitance and discharge rate is up to +20% around the nominal values. To guarantee an adequate life expectancy of the module, differences in cell voltages caused by the statistical distribution of the individual parameters have to be minimized by cell equalization circuits. Different equalization concepts are known from literature, with varying cost and packaging implications. This paper has been analyzed the deficiency of the electric double layer capacitor which existed in the energy storage, introduced the principle of series equalization technology, and development background of one. Summarized the domestic and foreign energy storage of electric double layer capacitor on the development condition of the equalization technology, the application domain, the different form, discussed the existed issue, these questions mainly included the equalization speed, the precision, the efficiency and so on, in view of these questions, proposed some new ways, finally forecast equalization technology of the electric double layer capacitor.
