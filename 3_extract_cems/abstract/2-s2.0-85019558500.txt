Object of this paper is the feasibility study, technical and economic, of an electric public transport service where fast charge stations are equipped with EES composed by batteries and/or super-capacitor, with relative power electronics, management and control, to improve the technical-economical dimensioning, for different possible operating conditions. To this purpose, referring to a real case, a simulator of the charging station was made, inclusive of the storage subsystems (Li-ion battery model and supercapacitors model), the interface towards the network (AC / DC converter), the interface to the vehicle (DC / DC converter, of different types). For the above service, which provides, in certain moments of the day the simultaneous presence at the terminal for all buses, were identified two types of charging station: one at the terminal and a second one to be placed in some of the bus stops. The final' goal is optimizing, for both cases, the storage system necessary to guarantee the charging with a smoother, more levelled supply from the network.
