In the present era Nitrogen (N) doped polymer composites are more in demand due to catalysis, energy harvesting devices as supercapacitor, Li-ion batteries, solar cells, fuel cell and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in metal air batteries and defect engineering applications. N doped polymer moieties were modified by using various synthesis techniques followed by chemical bath deposition (CVD), arc discharge method, solvothermal method, pyrolysis, plasma treatment. The confirmation of N doped polymer moieties modified structure, relevant defects and morphologies of the samples were foreseen by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) followed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) elemental contribution. In principle based on lone pair electrons of doped N provided additional negative charges it improved the specific capacitance of pristine sample preferred various electrochemical applications. Structural defects caused due to N doping may act as polarization centres. The N atom has more electronegativity as compared to carbon. Dielectric properties demonstrated increased dielectric permittivity with reduced loss. Obtained results showed N doping is a regulative tool to control the dielectric properties. We emphasized in the present review, synthesis roots, characterization techniques and recent applications of N doped polymer moieties.
