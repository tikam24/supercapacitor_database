Materials with synergistic functionality are of great importance in consumer electronics. We report on the preparation and assessments of Te @ PANI composite for energy conversion and storage application. Initially, (5â€“15%) Te @ PANI composites were synthesized by the facile, room temperature, time and cost-effective solid-state synthesis technique followed by characterizations using Fourier transform infra-red, UV-Visible, energy dispersive spectroscopic including X-ray diffractometry and field electron scanning microscopy. Te exfoliates polymeric segments of PANI by bonding benzenoid rings through sulphonated impurity sites which have a profound impact on symmetry molecular bond vibrations. Its analysis is presented. In photophysical application, both dark and luminescent I-V measurements have been performed that showed a linear variation with minimum photo-resistance offered by 10% composite and reaching current > 10 mA under 1.5 V biased conditions. In storage response, Te @ PANI supercapacitor devices are dominating in inductive coupling over capacitive coupling by ten times. Corresponding shunt impedance is seen to be favourably lower for 10% composition, and respective charge transfer impedance has also followed identical behaviour over other classes of samples. The quality factor of the device for 10% is found to be almost twelve times better. However, at a low scan rate (10 mV/s), the presence of Te has changed the tendency of ion migration, thereby, reducing the magnitude of ion current by about three times with an increase in Te from 5 to 15%. Thus, fabricated composite demonstrated synergistic aspects of energy.
