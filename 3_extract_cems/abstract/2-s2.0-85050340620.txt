Standalone operation of a photovoltaic generating system under fluctuating solar irradiance and variable load conditions necessitates a storage energy unit. This study presents an approach to voltage regulation of DC bus for the photovoltaic energy storage by using a combination of batteries supercapacitors (SCs). The advantages of the proposed control strategy over the conventional control strategy are faster DC link voltage restoration under transient conditions and effective power sharing between the battery and the SC that improves battery lifetime. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
