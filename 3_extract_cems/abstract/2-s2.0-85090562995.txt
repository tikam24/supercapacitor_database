The use of organic compounds to meet the growing demand for new energy storage systems has attracted great attention, because they have the advantages of abundant resources, flexibility, and sustainability, which can be used as supercapacitor electrode materials. In this work, based on the synthetic metal polyphthalocyanine, carbon nanotube-doped conjugated cobalt (II)-polyphthalocyanine film was further used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The results show that the obtained CoPPc-CNT has good electrochemical performance. The results show that by combining an organic material with a carbon matrix to prepare a composite material, the electronic conductivity can be effectively improved for supercapacitors.
