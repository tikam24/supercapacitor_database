The demand for power density has promoted the application of supercapacitors, and one hot study task for supercapacitors is high-energy-density electrode materials, such as transition metal oxides or sulfides. Here, composites of ZnCo2O4/NiCo2S4 (ZCO/NCS) nanosheet arrays on hydrophilic carbon cloth were synthesized and were used in high-performance supercapacitors. The ZCO/NCS composite electrodes were obtained via electrochemical deposition using a mixed solution of MOF-drived ZCO nanoclusters and Ni, Co, S sources. It was found that the acid etching pretreatment for 20 min of the ZIF-8/67 templates would lead to better electrochemical performance of the derived product (labeled as ZCO-20) and the composites with NCS (labeled as ZCO-20/NCS) as well. The effects of deposition conditions on the morphologies and electrochemical properties of the ZCO/NCS products were also investigated. The results showed that the ZCO-20/NCS deposited at −0.9 V for 10 min exhibited a high specific capacitance (2385 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and excellent rate retention (1868 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, and 990 F g−1 even at 50 A g−1). Further, ZCO-20/NCS was used to assemble a quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with activated carbon (AC) and PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. ZCO-20/NCS//AC ASC showed a good specific capacitance (161 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 131 F g−1 at 10 A g−1), high energy density (57.28 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1 and 46.50 W h kg−1 at 10 A g−1), high power density (8.0 kW kg−1 at 10 A g−1) and good cycle retention (91.5% after 5000 cycles). Thereby, ZCO-20/NCS could serve as a promising supercapacitor electrode material in the future.
