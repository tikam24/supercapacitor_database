This paper presents a new approach for supercapacitors (SCs) characterization using temporal method taking into account the influence of the dynamics constraints, such as number of cycles and rms value of DC-current ripple. This characterization is done using supercapacitor cycler BT2000 test bench. From experimental data, the parameters of the supercapacitor (SC) (series resistance and capacitance) are calculated from the voltage response compared to current input. The contribution of this paper is focused on the parameters dependence study according to the dynamics constraints listed previously (number of cycles and rms value of DC-current ripple). Finally, the experimental results, which show a dependence of series resistance (ESR) and capacitance (C) compared to these constraints, are presented.
