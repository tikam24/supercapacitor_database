This paper reports the facile hydrothermal approach to synthesize porous CuO nanosheets. Their crystalline phase, metallic vibrations, topography, morphology, pore size distribution and magnetic behavior has been studied in detail. Magnetic properties of nanosheets were studied at 300 K using vibrating sample magnetometer which indicates the superparamagnetic behavior with saturation magnetization of 2.46 emu g−1 for as prepared 2D nanostructures. The electrochemical spectroscopy of these sheets reveals that as prepared sheets have a specific capacitance of 1057 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 which is retained up to 93% even after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, photocatalytic activity along with electrochemical properties of the as-obtained nanostructures were studied for various organic dyes. The high value of saturation magnetization, high specific capacitance and better dye degradation properties of the developed CuO nanosheets make the developed materials good for application in energy storage devices, astonishing electrode material and photocatalyst for degradation of organic dyes in visible light.
