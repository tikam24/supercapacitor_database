Transition metal sulfides have been widely explored as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Unfortunately, the slow redox reaction kinetics and severe volume changes during charge/discharge result in compromised electrochemical performance. In this work, a nickel-cobalt sulfide hollow nanosheet array decorated with cerium oxide nanoparticles (NiCoS/CeO2) has been constructed using a cobalt zeolitic imidazolate framework-L as the template coupled with subsequent solvothermal synthesis. Benefiting from the advantages of the hollow and hierarchical NiCoS nanosheets with a large number of accessible active sites and fast charge transport pathways, as well as CeO2 layers with rich oxygen vacancies and strong interaction between NiCoS and CeO2, NiCoS/CeO2 exhibits a high specific capacity of 1278.1 C g−1 (1 A g−1), which is approximately 1.9 times that of NiCoS. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using NiCoS/CeO2 and activated carbon shows an excellent storage capability (34.9 W h kg−1 at 850.0 W kg−1) and an impressive cycle life (91.9% capacitance retention after 10 000 charge and discharge cycles at 10 A g−1).
