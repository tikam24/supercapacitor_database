Supercapacitor has higher cycle stability and higher energy density than lithium battery. In order to obtain better electrochemical performance, it is important for the electrode materials to obtain high chemical stability and large ion adsorption specific surface area. Graphene was prepared by the wet chemistry method. The polypyrrole was deposited on the surface of graphene with the constant potential in-situ electrochemical deposition method. The microtopography of electrode material was characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The supercapacitor electrochemical properties were investigated by the electrochemical workstation. And the same time, the deposition solution concentration, deposition time were discussed. The excellent specific capacitance with the value of 388 F/g was obtained when the deposition solution concentration was 0.2 mol/L pyrrole and deposition time was 22.5 min.
