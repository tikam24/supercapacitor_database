Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) are regarded as reliable supercapacitor electrode materials due to its high conductivity and excellent chemical activity. In this work, NiCo-LDH was synthesized via electrode position techniques, followed by one-step phosphating to convert the hydroxide into a phosphide. The obtained NiCoP shows 3D porous nanosheet stack structure, which provides a larger specific surface area and more active sites. The as-fabricated electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (1142.84 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capabilities (62.07% of the initial specific capacitance at 10 A g−1), and outstanding cycle stability (maintains 74.5% of initial capacitances after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1). Owning to superior electrical conductivity and excellent redox activity of phosphide, its voltage window and cycle stability are significantly improved compared with NiCo-LDH. In addition, NiCoP was used as the positive electrode and rGO as the negative electrode to fabricate the NiCoP//rGO asymmetric supercapacitor, which delivers a voltage window of 1.5 V and a high energy density of 14.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 753.6 W kg−1.
