Nowadays world alternative energy sources become more popular. They have a lot advantages like low pollution level, independence of main grid although alternative energy sources have disadvantages and main of them is the unpredictability and inconsistency produced energy. This problem solving is use energy storage devices. Choice of storage devices depends on application. Sometimes flexible solution is necessary. For this purpose was created topology of universal converter. The model of this topology was built in MATLAB Simulink environment. Control system was made although. Result of simulation satisfied. Converter system can stabilize voltage of battery and supercapacitor. Advantages of this topology are: absence of bulky and expensive reactive components. Disadvantages of this topology are difficult control system and a lot of transistors. Â© 2014 IEEE.
