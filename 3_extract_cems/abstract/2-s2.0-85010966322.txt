Wireless energy transmission to medical implants via ultrasonic waves is a promising technology with significant potential benefits over systems relying on radio frequency (RF) transmission in terms of (i) charging efficiency (ii) safety concerns. This paper discusses the design of an ultrasonic link to transfer energy from an external acoustic transmitter to an in-body deeply implanted medical device (IMD). Experimental results show that the rectified wave is able to convey enough power to completely charge a 0.22 F supercapacitor in 210 s.
