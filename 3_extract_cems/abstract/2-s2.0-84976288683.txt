We report the fabrication of a high energy-power density Li-ion hybrid supercapacitor (Li-HSC) using rice husk derived activated porous carbon as cathode and insertion type Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) as anode. Nanoporous carbon chemically activated with KOH (RHDPC-KOH) and H3PO4 (RHDPC- H3PO4) exhibited high surface area and improved porosity characteristics. With optimized electrode mass loading, the fabricated Li-HSC exhibited excellent electrochemical properties with a maximum energy density of ∼57 Wh kg-1 and ∼37Wh kg-1 for LTO/RHDPC-KOH and LTO/RHDPC-H3PO4 configuration respectively. The obtained energy density of 45 Wh kg-1 for RHDPC-KOH -based Li-HSC, even at a high power density of ∼4.3 kW kg-1, is far superior to several porous carbon-based Li-ion capacitors reported. Furthermore, the device showed excellent cyclability with capacity retention of ∼92% of initial capacity even after 2000 cycles, at high current density of 2 Ag-1.
