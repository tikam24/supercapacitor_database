We report an improved performance of a carbon-based supercapacitor using etched stainless steel (SS) current collector deposited with platinum nanoparticles (PtNs) over bare SS current collector/un-etched SS current collector deposited with PtNs. The PtNs grown on the etched surface of the current collectors provides a better contact with the surface of activated carbon monoliths electrode prepared from pre-carbonized fibres of oil palm empty fruit bunches. X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, the energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to investigate the different properties of bare SS current collector and the modified current collector. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge results consistently suggest that the deposition of PtNs on the etched surface of the current collector causes an increase in specific capacitance of 10% (from 105 to 115F g-1), 4% (from 141 to 146 F g-1) and 6% (from 142 to 150 F g-1) respectively. Correspondingly, the specific energy increases from 4.12 to 4.51Whkg-1 and specific power from 173 to 196Wkg-1. Also EIS and GCD results respectively show a decrease of 47% (from 1.332 to 0.710Ω) and 44% (from 1.75 to 0.974Ω) in equivalent series resistance.
