In order to solve the energy management problems of an electric vehicle based on fuel cell and ultracapacitor. Firstly，the models of fuel cell and ultracapacitor are established，including the performance degradation model of fuel cell. Secondly，an optimal energy management control strategy based on power following strategy is proposed. The required power is decomposed into the target power of fuel cell and ultracapacitor by partial differentiation of quadratic utility function and combined with Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Finally，the multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm and Pareto solution set iterative algorithm are used to solve the internal optimal balance coefficient，and the vehicle economy and fuel cell durability are both improved. The simulation results show that compared with the traditional power following strategy，the proposed optimal-power following strategy can reduce the equivalent hydrogen consumption by 2%，reduce the fuel cell degradation by 92.66%，the vehicle can travel 88.52 km and only 1.2 kg hydrogen is consumed.
