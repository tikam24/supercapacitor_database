Tungsten doped vanadium pentoxide (W-doped V2O5) nanobelts were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route and combination of calcination. The results revealed that W atoms were successfully doped into the crystal lattice of V2O5 matrix, indicating that the homogeneous solid-solutions of W-doped V2O5 nanobelts were obtained. The electrochemical properties of W-doped V2O5 nanobelts as supercapacitor electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) methods. W-doped V2O5 nanobelts exhibit the excellent capacity and good rate capability. Their specific capacitance are 407, 381, 350, 328, 295 and 273 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g−1, respectively. W-doped V2O5 nanobelts also show excellent energy densities of 246, 217, 212, 199, 178 and 165 W h kg−1 at a power densities of 0.99, 1.98, 3.96, 9.90, 19.80 and 39.60 kW kg−1. The specific capacitance of W-doped V2O5 nanobelts is much higher than the previous values of V2O5 materials, achieving the aim of improving the specific capacitance of V2O5 nanobelts.
