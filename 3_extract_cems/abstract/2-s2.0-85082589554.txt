Design and fabrication of energy storage systems (ESS) is of great importance to the sustainable development of human society. Great efforts have been made by India to build better energy storage systems. ESS, such as supercapacitors and batteries are the key elements for energy structure evolution. These devices have attracted enormous attention due to their potential applications in future electric vehicles, smart electric grids, etc. This paper first addresses the fundamental principles, structure and classification of supercapacitors and batteries, and then focus on the recent advances on these devices made by India especially from Centre for Materials for Electronics Technology (C-MET), a scientific society under the ministry of electronics and information technology, government of India. Also the current global market scenario and market in India are also discussed in detail to recognize the most appropriate energy systems for the emerging economy like India.
