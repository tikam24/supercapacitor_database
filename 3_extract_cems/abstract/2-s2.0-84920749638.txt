This article reported the electrochemical performance of a microspheres carbon/MnO2(CMS/MnO2) composite prepared by an in-situ self-limiting deposition method under hydrothermal condition. The morphologies and structures of the prepared materials were characterized by scan electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), and the electrochemical behaviors were tested by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), respectively. The results reveal that MnO2 homogeneously grow onto the surface of CMS to form a hydrangea-like microstructure. MnO2 has a typical K-Birnessite-type crystal structure and the content of MnO2 in the composite is 62 wt% and a specific capacitance of 266 F/g was obtained. Upon the prolonged synthetic time, the specific capacitance of resultant CMS/MnO2 materials increased and then levels off, because MnO2 nanosheets coated and grown on the surface of CMS step by step.
