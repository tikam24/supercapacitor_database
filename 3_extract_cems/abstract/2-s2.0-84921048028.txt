A series of nitrogen-containing micropore-donimated materials, porous triazine-based frameworks (PTFs), are constructed through the structural evolution of a 2D microporous covalent triazine-based framework. The PTFs feature predictable and controllable nitrogen doping and pore structures, which serve as a model-like system to more deeply understand the heteroatom effect and micropore effect in ionic liquid-based supercapacitors. The experimental results reveal that the nitrogen doping can enhance the supercapacitor performance mainly through affecting the relative permittivity of the electrode materials. Although microspores' contribution is not as obvious as the doped nitrogen, the great performances of the micropore-dominated PTF suggest that micropore-dominated materials still have great potential in ionic liquid-based supercapacitors.
