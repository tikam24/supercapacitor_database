Porous carbon bricks have been synthesized by carbonizing self-assembled polymer bricks of poly(divinylbenzene-co-4-vinylbenzyl acetate) (P(DVB/VBA)). The synthesis process consists of (a) the preparation of colloidal polymeric nanoparticles by miniemulsion polymerization, (b) the self-assembly of such polymeric nanoparticles into brick-like aggregates by evaporation, and (c) carbonization. The resulting carbon bricks (denoted as SC, standing for carbons prepared from self-assembled polymer bricks) have hierarchical porous structures with a high specific surface area of 616 m2 g-1 and an average pore size of 5.2 nm. KOH activation of SC endows the ASC (activated SC) with an ultrahigh specific surface area of 2385 m2 g-1 and an average pore size of 2.7 nm. Both SC- and ASC-based electrodes as supercapacitors exhibit superior capacitance performance (207 F g-1 for SC and 319 F g-1 for ASC at a current density of 0.5 A g -1), good rate capacitive behavior and excellent cycling stability. Such performances highlight the potential of SC and ASC as electrode materials for widespread supercapacitor applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
