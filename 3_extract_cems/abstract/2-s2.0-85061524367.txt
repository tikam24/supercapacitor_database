Electric Energy Storage Systems are pivotal for cleaner and sustainable development, applications ranging from transport electrification to electric power generation from renewable sources require some form of energy storage. Supercapacitors (SC) or Electric Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) with their remarkably long life cycles and high power handling capabilities have a growing presence in the energy storage market. With their complementary attributes compared to batteries, EDLCs provide a potent solution for hybrid electrical energy storage and even replace batteries in certain power applications. The lower energy density and a linear voltage-charge relation, limits the use of supercapacitors. In this paper a simple and efficient method to overcome these issues and increase the energy utilization of SCs and thereby downsizing the number of SCs required for an application has been presented with simulation and experimental results.
