In order to ensure the safe operation of the 1500V DC power supply system of the subway, the DC circuit breaker needs to periodically detect the instantaneous tripping characteristics on the spot with a large current DC power supply unit. To achieve the tripping action, the device is required to generate a large current of 10000 A or more, but the capacity of the AC power required by the device generally cannot meet the detection requirements. Therefore, this paper proposes a low-voltage and high-current DC power supply design based on battery-super capacitor hybrid energy storage. The feasibility of the scheme is verified by theoretical calculation and simulation analysis.
