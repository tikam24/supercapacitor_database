The SiO2@Co3O4/GA composite with double-coating structure was successfully synthesized through an in situ self-assembly method. Microstructure measurements showed that the SiO2 film coating the Co3O4 and then anchored on the plicated GA together to realize coating again. In this preparation process can form more stable Si–O–Co so its performance has a marked improvement. This structure not only can improve the capacitance of GA but also can effectively reduce the large volumetric expansion and aggregation of Co3O4. The electrochemical performance were charactered by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The SiO2@Co3O4/GA exhibited a high capacitance of 620 F g−1 at the current of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. After 1000 cycles, it displayed a good cycling ability of 94% capacitance retention. The excellent performance due to the interaction between SiO2 and Co3O4 in the in situ self-assembly preparation process. The joint effort make it more stable and sustainable. Its superior performance suggest that SiO2@Co3O4/GA has an tremendous potential in energy application.
