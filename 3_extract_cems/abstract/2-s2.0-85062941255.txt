High electrochemical performance of asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) depends on exquisite nanostructure design and synthesis of electrodes, including structural controllable design and synthesis of high theoretical performance materials and nanocomposite materials. Herein, a template-free hierarchical core-shell nanostructure of CoNiO2@NiAl-layered double hydroxide (NiAl-LDH) and α-Fe2O3 with a hollow spherical structure composed of nanoparticles are successfully prepared. The CoNiO2@NiAl-LDH as the cathode electrode and the hollow spherical α-Fe2O3 as the anode electrode of the ASC devices exhibit superior electrochemical performance. The gel of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and KOH acts as the solid electrolyte and the separator to assemble into the all-solid-state flexible ASC devices. Two of the CoNiO2@NiAl-LDH//α-Fe2O3 ASC devices in series are fabricated to meet the voltage requirement of mobile energy equipment, which exhibit a maximum energy density of 65.68 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 369.45 W kg−1. Interestingly, in addition to many advantages that the solid electrolyte in ASC devices already have, we find that it can be an alternative way of solving the problem of iron oxide cycling performance, and of course it can also be used as a reference for other materials with poor cycling performance.
