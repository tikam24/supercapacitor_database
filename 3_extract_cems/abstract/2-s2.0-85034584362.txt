This work reports the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical properties of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs). MNPs were prepared by a simple solvothermal method at 200 °C for 8 h using three different concentrations of poly(vinyl)pyrrolidone (PVP). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the prepared samples reveal agglomerated like-sphere shape with mean particle sizes of ∼ 50–90 nm. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) from TEM confirm the formation of pure phase Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles. The existence of PVP on the surface of the prepared samples is confirmed by high resolution X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Consequently, the electrochemical performances of MNPs prepared using different PVP concentrations were evaluated by using the three-electrode cell system within 6.0M KOH. The results show that the specific capacitances was determined to be 396, 344, and 327 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and 197, 95, and 75 F/g at a current density of 3.0 A/g for MNPs samples prepared using 0.5 g, 1.0 g, and, 1.5 g of PVP, respectively. MNPs electrode showed the high power density of 777.65 W/kg with 7.36 Wh/kg of energy density addressing in high power density SC region. The cycle stability after 1000 cycles was also tested at 3 A/g and demonstrated the improvement of stability as increasing the amount of PVP. This indicates that the addition of surface element polymer plays a role in the cycle stability of supercapacitor devices.
