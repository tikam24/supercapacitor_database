The present-day energy demand is growing research interest in synthesizing new hybrid electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. The main focus is on the development of new electrode materials which could be easily available, synthesizable, low-cost, environmentally friendly, with worthy electrochemical performance. In this scenario, a simple one-step synthesis of MnO2 is carried out via the solvothermal method. This MnO2 is mixed with a molecule of phenanthrenequinone (PQ). MnO2, PQ, and MnO2-PQ composite are characterized by FT-IR, XRD, TGA, and BET techniques and confirmed the formation of MnO2-PQ composite. The electrode is made by drop-casting the electro-active materials such as MnO2, PQ, and MnO2-PQ on a graphite sheet wherein a graphite sheet acts as an electrode and a current collector. These electrodes are studied in a three-electrode and also in the symmetric cell configuration in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte via CV, GCD, and EIS techniques. The device is constructed in Swagelok system exhibits a high energy density of 140 W h kg−1 at a power density of 6000 W kg−1 in the voltage range of 0 to 2 V. A coin cell is built using two MnO2-PQ-GS hybrid electrodes in an aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. The cycle life of the coin cell showed a retention capacitance of 74 % after 5000 cycles at a high voltage of 2 V, even at a high current density of 5 A g−1. EIS results carried out before and after 5000 cycles show that the cell works even at 5000 GCD cycles.
