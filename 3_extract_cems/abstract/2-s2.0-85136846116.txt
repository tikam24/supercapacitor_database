Design and fabrication of impressive and novel electrode materials for energy storage devices, especially supercapacitors, are of great importance. Herein, bimetallic CoSe2/FeSe2 hollow nanocuboid nanostructures derived from Co/Fe-Prussian Blue analogues (denoted as CoSe2/FeSe2 HNCs) are successfully designed and fabricated as a remarkable positive electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. The bimetallic CoSe2/FeSe2 HNC nanostructures can have increased active sites and short electron-ion diffusion pathways. Bimetallic CoSe2/FeSe2 HNCs@NiF as a positive electrode showed efficient supercapacitive properties with a great specific capacity of 332.75 mA h g−1 (1197.90 C g−1) at 1 A g−1, retaining 80.61% of its initial capacity at 20 A g−1, considerable longevity (91.47% of its initial capacity after 10 000 cycles) and an excellent coulombic efficiency of 98.49%. Also, the designed and fabricated CoSe2/FeSe2 HNCs@NiF||AC@NiF hybrid supercapacitor device using bimetallic CoSe2/FeSe2 HNCs@NiF (positive electrode) and activated carbon@NiF (AC, negative electrode) exhibited an efficient energy density of 63.62 W h kg−1 and a superior durability of 91.14% after 10 000 cycles.
