Capacitive deionization (CDI) is water desalination, purification, and concentration technology based on the theory of electric double-layer capacitors. The most important thing in CDI technology is the choice of electrode materials. In response to the strategic needs of sustainable development, people are more and more interested in new electrode materials that are green, low-cost, and simple to prepare in order to achieve industrial applications. In this work, single layer graphene oxide was successfully loaded onto activated carbon fibers (SGO@ACF) by a simple coating method to obtain novel CDI electrode materials. The composition, structure, morphology, and performance of SGO@ACF were analyzed by various technologies. The specific surface area of SGO@ACF is as high as 1532.73 m2 g−1. The electrochemical performance investigated by the CV, EIS, and GCD techniques revealed that the SGO@ACF electrode combing the merits of SGO material and ACF efficiently obtained the amazing specific capacitance of 188.36 F g−1, good electric conductivity, and favorable cyclability. Moreover, the CDI behavior of SGO@ACF electrode evaluated by the batch mode experiments in the 700 mg L−1 of NaCl solution demonstrated high salt adsorption capacity of 14.74 mg g−1. With its highly simplified electrode processing, binder-free and outstanding CDI performance, the SGO@ACF electrode has been demonstrated to be a promising material for CDI desalination applications.
