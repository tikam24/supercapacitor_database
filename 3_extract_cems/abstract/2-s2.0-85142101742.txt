The construction of integrated electrodes has been considered as a sensible strategy to boost the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors, which feature improved electron and ion transfer kinetics. In this work, a facile and easy-controlled synthetic methodology has been established to assemble hierarchical honeycomb-like copper-molybdenum sulfide nanosheets (Cu−Mo−S NSs) on a three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel foam substrate as integrated cathodes for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). As expected, the Cu−Mo−S NSs deliver exceptional electrochemical properties including an areal capacity of 1.39 mAh cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2, a superb rate capability (0.86 mAh cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2), and especially, a prominent cycling lifespan with 95.3 % capacity retention after 10000 cycles. Moreover, the as-obtained Cu−Mo−S NSs are used as integrated cathodes to pair with iron oxide particles encapsulated in reduced graphene oxide (Fe2O3@rGO) as anodes for assembling Cu−Mo−S NSs//Fe2O3@rGO HSCs, which can deliver superior energy density of 79.04 Wh kg−1 and exceptional cyclic stability with 94.9 % capacity retention after 10000 cycles.
