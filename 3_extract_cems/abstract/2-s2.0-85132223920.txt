Global economic growth and rapid industrial development have resulted in a severe energy problem. Renewable energy sources have been replaced by alternative and sustainable energy sources. Super capacitors are one of the most important types of energy storage devices. The development of supercapacitor electrodes with maximum performance is currently the most important research topic in this area. Here we present the results of hydrothermal research on rare earth-based nanocomposites of Lanthanum-Nickel La2O3 -NiO-based electrodes for electrochemical super capacitor applications. XRD, FTIR, TG/DTA, SEM, TEM and EDAX techniques are used to examine the physico-chemical characteristics such as crystallographic structure, vibrational characteristics, thermal stability morphology, chemical composition, and its features respectively. According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV) investigation, the prepared nanocomposite materials have a Specific capacitance of 704 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s. EIS analysis demonstrates the RsValues ofLa2O3 (0.11549 Ω) NiO(0.1937 Ω) La2O3 -NiO(0.641 Ω) increased conductivity of nanocomposite material. According to galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests, the La2O3 -NiO electrode has a maximum specific capacitance of 564 F/g at 1 A/g current density in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This result proved that the prepared (La2O3 -NiO Nanocomposite), electrode material used for practical application, which shows good capacitive retention of 93.4%even after 2000 cycles. More ever asymmetric device constructed superior cyclic stability of 77.2%of capacitive retention even after 2000 charge discharge cycle.
