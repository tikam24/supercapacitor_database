In this study, the influence of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)−Tricalcium Aluminate Hexahydrate (C3AH6) cement nanocomposites on electrochemical properties was investigated. The rGO-C3AH6 nanocomposite samples with various of rGO laoding, such as, C3AH6_rGO-1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 wt.% were easily synthesized by a rapid cement hydration method. The maximum specific surface area and average pore size diameters were 74.20 m2/g and 11.72 nm for C3AH6_rGO-20%. The charge tranfering in C3AH6_rGO nanocomposites was described using band alignments model occurring between C3AH6 and rGO. Interestingly, the increasing of both dielectric property and stability in frequency of C3AH6_rGO composite samples can be explained by the high density of free electron charges on the rGO surface. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of C3AH6_rGO electrodes had excellent capacitive properties displaying the storage charge mechanism of a hybridsupercapacitor behavior. The large rGO content of the C3AH6_rGO nanocomposite capacitor with electrolyte interfaces showed excellent electrochemical performance. The highest value of 80.479 F g −1 was obtained from C3AH6_rGO-20% at a current density of 0.2 A g −1 with cycling stability of 96.51% after 1000 cycles.
