Memristive neurodynamic systems find many potential applications in mixed analog-digital multichip neurogrid and integrated photo-supercapacitor nanotube arrays. Analysis and design of memristive neurodynamic systems have attracted a large amount of research interest. In this study, some new neurodynamic approaches are proposed for stability analysis of delayed memristive neural networks. Some less conservative stability criteria are established by considering the memristor multiport effect, which is ignored in the previous literature. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of these stability criteria.
