As a new kind of power storage, supercapacitors have attracted much attention due to their short charge and discharge time, good cycle performance, large power density, and environmental friendliness. However, the main drawback of supercapacitors is lower energy density than batteries, as well as high cost per unit energy. Herein, the metal-organic frameworks compound [Zn 3 (OH)(BTC) 2 (C 4 N 2 H 11 )(H 2 O)] n was used as carbon precursor to prepare the nitrogen-doped porous carbon (ZMFC-T) by one-step carbonization process. We investigated the influences of carbonization temperature on the specific surface area, pore size distribution and electrochemical properties. The results show that the ZMFC-800 has a specific surface area of 1557 m 2 g −1 , an average pore size of 3.85 nm, and nitrogen content of 5.25%. In the 1 M potassium citrate electrolyte solution, the stable voltage window is 2 V and the energy density is 65.28W h kg −1 . In potassium citrate electrolyte, ZMFC-800 has a strong charge storage capacity and high energy density. This work sheds a new light on the potential for developing superior nitrogen-doped porous carbon for energy storage devices.
