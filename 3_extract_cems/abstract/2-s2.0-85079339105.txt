A novel carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced holey graphene oxide film (RHGOF) sandwich structure has been fabricated to enhance its electrochemical properties. CNTs are grown by a catalyst assisted chemical vapor deposition technique, interpenetrated between the RHGOF layers. A RHGOF/CNTs hybrid film is used as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. The grown CNTs in the graphene layers structure act as spacers and bridges to increase the counductivity of RHGOF, while the grown CNTs on the surfaces of the graphene contribute to increase the specific surface area of RHGOF. The results demonstrate that the synthesized porous, flexible and binder free hybrid electrode has advantages of higher ion diffusion rate, longer diffusion length and larger ion accessible surface area as compared to the pristine graphene which results in an extra ordinary galvanostatic charge-discharge specific capacitance of 557 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, with excellent rate capabilities and superior cyclic stabilities.
