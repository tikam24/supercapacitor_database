The microrods and microballs of NiCo2O4 are successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method. The effect of ammonium hydroxide and ammonium fluoride on the surface microstructure is observed. The prepared microrods and microballs of NiCo2O4 are analyzed by various analytical tools like powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties are studied by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), using the workstation Biologic SP-200. The maximum specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4 microrods electrode is 1671 F/g. The areal specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4 microrods electrode is 284 mF/g. The energy density and power density of microrods of NiCo2O4 electrode are 19 Wh/Kg and 282 W/kg, respectively. The equivalent series resistance (Rs) is 0.62 Î© for NiCo2O4 microrods.
