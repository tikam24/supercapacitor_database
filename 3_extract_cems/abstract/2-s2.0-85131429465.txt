Due to the similarity in chemical structure, lignin has presented great potential in the synthesis of bio-based phenolic resin. Herein, a facile and scalable synthesis strategy for a novel cage-like lignin-based phenolic resin was proposed through direct spray drying of the mixture of phenolic resin and unmodified lignin. The as-prepared lignin-based phenolic resin was pre-carbonized and carbonized using KOH to produce mesoporous carbon materials (LPRAC) that were further employed as supercapacitor electrodes. The results revealed that the lignin addition led to the noticeable change of the resin shape from perfect sphere to cage-like structure owing to the surfactivity and hydrophilicity of lignin. The cage-like structure promoted the KOH-activated pore generation and expansion in the carbonization process, resulting in the significantly increased specific surface area of the phenolic carbon and the intensified mesoporous formation. The electrochemical performance determination indicated that the specific capacitance of LPRAC-20% (20% lignin addition) was 217.3 F/g at 0.5 A/g, which was considerably higher than that of the lignin-free phenolic carbon (122.6 F/g). Moreover, the LPRAC-20% also exhibited preferable capacitance retention and excellent cycling stability. Accordingly, the present work offers a simple and scalable approach to prepare cage-like mesoporous carbon with excellent electrochemical performance from lignin-based phenolic resin and thus provides a promising route for lignin valorization in energy storage materials.
