We investigated different molar concentrations of cobalt precursor intercalated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as possible electrode materials for supercapacitors. Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanocubes intercalated reduced graphene oxides (rGO) were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. It has been found that the Co3O4 particles with a cubical shape are decorated on rGO matrix with an average size of âˆ¼45 nm. The structural crystallinity of rGO-Co3O4 composites was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Raman spectroscopy confirmed the successful reduction of GO to rGO and effective interaction between Co3O4 and the rGO matrix. The electrochemical performances of rGO-Co3O4 electrodes were examined using cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge techniques. The maximum specific capacitance (278 F g-1) is observed at current density of 200 mA g-1 in the C2 electrode resulting from effective ion transfer and less particle aggregation of Co3O4 on the rGO matrix than in the other electrodes. C2 exhibits good rate capability and excellent long-term cyclic stability of 91.6% for 2000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance may result from uniform intercalation of cobalt oxide over the rGO. These results suggest that the Co3O4 intercalated rGO matrix could play a role in improved energy storage capability.
