Improved Bio-nanocomposite Materials for Emerging Energy Challenges. Nanocomposites derived from biorenewable sources have emerged as an important material for applications as diverse as energy storage, medicine, and environmental remediation. These nanocomposites have a high surface-to-volume ratio, facilitating easy fabrication, useful mechanical properties, and high thermal stability. As part of a two-volume set (1410 and 1411), this volume focuses on the principles, production, and applications of bio-nanocomposites, biomimetic nanocomposites, and additional nanostructured materials from biobased precursors. Chemists and engineers working in chemistry, materials science, nanotechnology, and chemical engineering will find these chapters useful.
