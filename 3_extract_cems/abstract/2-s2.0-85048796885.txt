In this work, the uniform C/NiCo2O4 mesoporous nanoneedle arrays grown on Ni foam (NF) as a composite electrode are synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal and annealing processes. Due to the introduction of the carbon originating from glucose in hydrothermal process, the electrochemical performances of the hybrid electrode are effectively improved compared to the NiCo2O4. The unique structure is beneficial for facilitating ion transport between electron and electrolyte and accelerating the redox reaction, which makes the composite deliver prominent electrochemical properties, including a high areal capacitance (4.974 F/cm2 at 2 mA/cm2), remarkable rate capability and cycling stability. In addition, the C/NiCo2O4 electrode has a bright prospect for high performance supercapacitor applications because of excellent electrochemical performances and an easy synthetic method.
