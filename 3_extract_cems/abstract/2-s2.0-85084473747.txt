Electrospinning is one of the most effective ways of preparing nanofibers with a broad spectrum of potential applications. Its products can be used in air filtration, oil-water separation, sensors, carbon dioxide capture, supercapacitor, lithium-ion batteries, catalysts, tissue engineering, drug delivery, enzyme immobilization, and in many other fields. In this review, the mechanism, basic setup, and processing parameters are presented. Different kinds of methods for mass preparation and production devices are summarized and compared. Applications of electrospun nanofibers in different fields are also briefly discussed.
