A control-orientated model of the electrical architecture for a hybrid electric fuel cell sports vehicle is presented. Creating a control model is a critical first step in understanding the dynamic behaviour of the system and the subsequent design and verification of the control algorithms. The proposed control strategy is made up of both feedback and supervisory control elements. The high voltage bus management system is verified by means of incorporating the solution within a complete non-linear powertrain model of the vehicle. Simulation results are presented that show the performance of the vehicle for both high driver demand manoeuvres and conventional European and US legislative drive-cycles.
