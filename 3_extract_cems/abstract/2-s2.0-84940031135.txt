A novel core-shell structured Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6-Co3O4 hybrid material was synthesized in a hydrothermal condition from the microporous Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6 microrod precursor. Due to the unique nano/microstructures, the assembled asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor (Co11(HPO3)8(OH)6-Co3O4 and graphene) showed a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 1.84 F cm-3 at 0.5 mA cm-2 and an excellent cycling stability with only 1.3% ca decay after 3000 cycling. The device delivered a maximum power density of 105 mW cm-3 at a current density of 1.5 mA cm-2 and possessed a maximum volumetric energy density of 0.48 mW h cm-3 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2. The device also exhibited excellent flexibility.
