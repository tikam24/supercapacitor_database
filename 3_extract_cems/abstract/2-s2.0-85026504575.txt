A high specific energy and specific power can be attained for the supercapacitor devices with the aid of optimum potential. The use of a flexible approach employing a solid-state device structure is always beneficial for advanced technological applications. Hence, effort has been made towards the fabrication of a complete solid-state symmetric and flexible supercapacitor device based on environmentally friendly and abundant iron sulfide as an electrode material, which has been obtained using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method operated at room temperature (27 °C). An operating voltage of 2 V was achieved for the flexible device with a bending stability of 100% over a bending angle of 175° along with the LED glow working model. These outcomes can give new vision towards the construction of solid-state and flexible devices using a simple and low-cost method with potential ability towards roll-to-roll technology for commercialization.
