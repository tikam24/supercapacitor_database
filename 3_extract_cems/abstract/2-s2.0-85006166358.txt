A novel Ni@NiCo2O4 core/shells structure consisting of the Ni microspheres skeletons and nanosheet-like NiCo2O4 skins was designed and investigated as the electrochemical electrode for supercapacitor. Due to the unique architecture with Ni microspheres as the highly conductive cores improving the electrical conductivity of electrode and external nanosheet-like NiCo2O4 shells as the efficient electrochemical active materials facilitating the contact between the electrode and electrolyte, the as-prepared Ni@NiCo2O4 exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 597 F g−1 (1 A g−1) as well as remarkable capacitance retention of 96% (3000 cycles). These impressive results pave the way to design high-performance electrode materials for energy storage.
