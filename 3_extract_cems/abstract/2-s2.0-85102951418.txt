Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are one of the most promising electronic circuit elements in electronic devices as they are designed for use as energy storage components, decoupling capacitors, ripple current filter elements, and in many other applications. The materials used for MSCs have been greatly restricted since only a few materials or material combinations are capable of operating at the required high frequencies with high power and sufficient stability for long-term operation [1]. By using graphene and its derivatives as electrodes, here we demonstrate that MSCs with ultrahigh power density will push further the monolithic integration and the realization of smart multifunctional autonomous system-on-a-chip.
