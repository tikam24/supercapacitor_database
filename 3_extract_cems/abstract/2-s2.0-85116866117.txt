The manganese oxide (a-MnO2) nanoparticles are highly recognized for their utility toward the development of supercapacitor applications. In the present study, a-MnO2nanoparticles were synthesized by simple and low cost chemical precipitation method and the obtained a-MnO2nanoparticles are annealed at 500 Â°C. The structure and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized through XRD and SEM techniques. The functional and electrochemical behavior of the manganese oxide nanoparticles were investigated by FTIR and cyclic voltammetry techniques. XRD spectrum shows that the synthesized a-MnO2nanoparticles are in tetragonal structure and the crystalline size of the nanoparticles was calculated as 41.49 nm using Scherrer formula. The Mn-O bond is observed at 534 cm-1and 575 cm-1through FTIR technique. The CV characterization shows the a-MnO2nanoparticles to have a good capacitive behavior, which predicts the potential application in energy storage.
