Using electrodes with subnanometer pores and ionic liquid electrolytes can improve the charge storage capacity at the expense of the charging rate. The fundamental understanding of the charging dynamics of nanoporous electrodes can help to avoid compromising the power density. In this work, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the charging mechanism of subnanometer pores in ionic liquids. Different from the traditional view that a smaller pore results in slower charging, a non-monotonic relation is found between the charging rate and pore size, in which the charging process is accelerated in some subnanometer pores. Our analysis uncovers that the mechanism of the charging enhancement can be attributed to the transition of in-pore ion structure.
