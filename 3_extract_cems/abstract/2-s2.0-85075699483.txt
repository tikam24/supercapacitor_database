With a large-scale usage of portable electric appliances, a high demand for increasingly high-density energy storage devices has emerged. MoO3 has, in principle, a large potential as a negative electrode material in supercapacitive devices due to high charge densities that can be obtained from its reversible redox reactions. Nevertheless, the extremely poor electrochemical stability of MoO3 in aqueous electrolytes prevents a practical use in high capacitance devices. In this work, we describe how to overcome this severe stability issue by forming amorphous molybdenum oxide/tantalum oxide nanotubes by anodic oxidation of a Mo-Ta alloy. The presence of a critical amount of Ta oxide (>20 at. %) prevents the electrochemical decay of the MoO3 phase and thus yields an extremely high stability. Due to the protection provided by tantalum oxide, no capacitance losses are measureable after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles.
