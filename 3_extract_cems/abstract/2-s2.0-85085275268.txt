Binder-free electrode of CuCo2S4 composite with three-dimensional (3D) porous structure grown directly on Ni foam is obtained by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The optimal CuCo2S4/NF material shows unique cross-networked hierarchical structure and excellent electrochemical performance, with a high specific capacitance (3252 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and a superior cycling performance (91.8% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 8 A g−1). The superior electrochemical performance is related to the binder-free 3D heterostructure of the open geometry, which provides enrichment of pored-structure and an excellent channel for a more sustainable and efficient energy storage and conversion.
