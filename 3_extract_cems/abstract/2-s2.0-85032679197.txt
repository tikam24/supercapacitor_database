Amorphous carbon nanotubes (a-CNTs) manganese di oxide (MnO2)-poly pyrrole (PPy) ternary nanocomposites have been synthesized by a simple chemical route. The as prepared samples have been characterized with different characterization tools that include field emission scanning and high resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman, Fourier transformed infrared as well as UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of all the as prepared pure and hybrid samples have been studied in detail. It has been seen that the ternary hybrid shows efficient electrochemical performance with high value of specific capacitance with good stability even up to 2000 cycles. The superior performance of the hybrid samples can be attributed to the strong synergistic effect between the components resulting electron shuttling along PPy main chains and inter-chain raising built-in continuous conductive network. The ternary composite approach offers an effective solution to enhance the device performance of metal-oxide based supercapacitors for long cycling applications. These studies can well speculate the existence of another supercapacitor hybrid for the use in environment friendly electrode and thus a pollution free nature.
