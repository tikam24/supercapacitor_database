Nanostructured Mn-Ni-Co oxide composites (MNCO) were prepared by thermal decomposition of the precursor obtained by chemical co-precipitation of Mn, Ni and Co salts. The chemical composition and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical capacitance of MNCO electrode was examined by cyclic voltammetry, impedance and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The results showed that MNCO electrode exhibited the good electrochemical characteristics. A maximum capacitance value of 1260 F g-1 could be obtained within the potential range of -0.1 to 0.4 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 6 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
