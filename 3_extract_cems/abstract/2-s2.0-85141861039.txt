In this work, pure TiO2 and Cu (0.5, 1, 2%)-doped TiO2 composites prepared by electrospinning technique followed by calcination at 900 °C, and having high pseudocapacitive and dielectric characteristics were reported. These nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and dynamic water sorption vapor measurements. The structural characterization of these nanostructures highlighted good crystallinity including only the rutile phase. The electrochemical characteristics were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, which were performed in a KOH electrolyte solution. Among the Cu-doped TiO2 nanostructures that were prepared, the one containing 0.5% Cu exhibited superior electrochemical properties, including high specific gravimetric capacitance of 1183 F·g−1, specific capacitance of 664 F·g−1, energy density of 45.20 Wh·kg−1, high power density of 723.14 W·kg−1, and capacitance retention of about 94% after 100 cycles. The dielectric investigation shows good dielectric properties for all materials, where the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss decreased with the frequency increase. Thus, all the interconnected studies proved that these new materials show manifold ability and real applicative potential as pseudocapacitors and high-performance dielectrics. Future work and perspectives are anticipated for characterizing electrochemical and dielectric properties for materials including larger amounts of Cu dopant.
