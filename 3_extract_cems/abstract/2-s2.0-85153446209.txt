Nanomaterials have unique properties and features because of their small size. Functionalized carbon nanomaterials have exceptional and unique properties for diverse applications. They are used in pharmaceuticals, specifically in analyzing and curing malevolent cells, infectious diseases, tissue engineering, and disorders in the central nervous system. These types of unique features are beneficial to infiltrate biomembranes and decrease their toxicity. This chapter recapitulates several pharmaceutical applications of nanomaterials for the healings of numerous diseases. In this chapter, CNTs will be functionalized into covalent and noncovalent functionalized CNTs. Its potential applications in treating difficult issues in pharmacy and connected risks in nanodrugs will also be discussed. There is wide use of CNTs in the various field like water treatment, environmental remediation, batteries, supercapacitor, electric cable and wire, textile, solar cell, microelectronic, optical power detector pharmacy, and medicine because CNTs have large surface areas and adsorbing capacity. It is substantially important for the local and worldwide conspirators while providing ecological remedial measures.
