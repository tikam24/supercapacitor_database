The utilization of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is advantageous to reduce environmental problems and increase its value as a source of carbon. Carbon nanotube (CNT) was synthesized by pyrolysis of POME and ferrocene mixture at 900Â°C under a flowing nitrogen atmosphere. CNT is nanosized and has high electrical conductivity; it is compatible as electrodes for energy storage devices such as supercapacitor. The study investigated the process for the upscaled formation of CNT from POME. The synthesis consists of POME polymerization, pyrolysis, and CNT characterization. Additionally, before pyrolysis, the CNT collecting system was applied in tube furnaces. The result showed that this process produced 1.2 g of CNT, a diameter of 47-100 nm, and a surface area of 635.5 m2.g-1. XRD analysis, 2 of 26.58 indicated structure of graphite C (002), Raman spectra resulted ratio IG/ID of 1.16 indicated higher graphite than disorder. CNT was characterized and applied as electrode material for supercapacitor which exhibits a specific capacitance of 13.98 F.g-1.
