Hybrid energy storage system(HESS) based on wind power generation system(WPGS) plays an important role in smoothing wind power fluctuations. In consideration of limited advantage of single energy storing dielectric, the hybrid energy storage system has a good application prospect with its merits complementation. In this paper, take super-capacitors(SC) and batteries for example, the advantages and disadvantages of different topology structures of power type and energy type are analyzed. Firstly, The HESS topology is built. Then, the model of wind power and principle of bidirectional DC/DC converters for charging and discharging is introduced and a current control is designed. Lastly, fuzzy sliding control strategy of hybrid energy storage system was set. Fuzzy controller can eliminate chattering of sliding controller, and it is used to smooth the power fluctuations and optimize power distribution among each energy unit, according to their different characteristics. A simulation model of the system is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK for WPGS. The results show that the proposed energy management strategy can be used to smooth power fluctuations, and optimize power distribution effectively.
