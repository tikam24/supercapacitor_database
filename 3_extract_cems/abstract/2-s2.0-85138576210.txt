The increasingly depleted fossil fuels have brought unprecedented energy crises and environmental hazards, so the developments of novel renewable clean energy resources have become an urgent need for social development. In recent years, the rise in 2D nanomaterials has brought new hope for energy conversion and storage. These unique 2D nanomaterials have a large specific surface area and a high surface atomic ratio. Among many energy solutions, the photo-/electrocatalytic process of hydrogen production is widely studied as practical applications of energy conversion. Hydrogen evolution reaction is the conversion of solar energy into hydrogen energy. The design and synthesis of high-efficiency hydrogen production photo-/electrocatalysts are particularly important for improving energy conversion performance that has become a hotspot for scientists to study in pursuit of this goal. The stabilization of metal-phase 1T-MS2 (M = molybdenum/tungsten), its heterojunction liquid-phase synthesis, photocatalytic properties, and the supercapacitor properties of the synthesized structure is studied. For use in supercapacitors, transition metal dichalcogenides-based materials including metallic and semiconducting phases have gained great scientific interest. The large specific area and sheet-like morphology allow layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) nanomaterials to store charges by intrasheet and intersheet double layers over individual layers of TMD.
