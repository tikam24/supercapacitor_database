The supercapacitors (SCs) are suitable for short-term fast power regulations, while the batteries are suitable for long-term slow energy management of microgrid (MG). As SCs and batteries complement each other's deficiencies, the SC-battery hybrid energy storage systems (SBHESS) have been commonly used for mixed applications of fast transient and slow long-term power regulations. The SC reduces the stress of fast power variations on the battery, which prolongs its lifetime. However, it increases the cost of the energy storage in comparison to the case that battery is just used. Therefore, the drawback of SBHESS is its increased cost. The sizes of SC and its converter, which directly determine their costs, should be enough to handle primary frequency control (PFC) in the worst cases of shortage and surplus power generation that the MG ever experiences. In this paper, the potentials of Photovoltaic (PV) systems, smart LED lighting loads (SLEDLLs), and thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) in PFC is used to decrease the participation share of SC in the PFC and hence decrease the sizes and costs of SC, and its converter. The simulation results show that with the coordination of SBHESS, SLEDLLs, PVs, and TCLs, the required sizes of SC and its converter are decreased by 64% and 50%, respectively. Also, for a 10-year period operation, the total cost of SC and its converter is decreased by 51.5%.
