Carbon materials are generally employed as supercapacitor electrodes due to their low- cost, high-chemical stability and environmental friendliness. However, the design of carbon structures with large surface area and controllable porous structure remains a daunt challenge. In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) hybrid aerogel with different contents of MoS2 nanosheets in 3D graphene aerogel (MoS2-GA) was synthesized through a facial hydrothermal process. The influences of MoS2 content on microstructure and subsequently on electrochemical properties of MoS2-GA are systematically investigated and an optimized mass ratio with MoS2: GA of 1:2 is chosen to achieve high mechanical robustness and outstanding electrochemical performance in the hybrid structure. Due to the large specific surface area, porous structure and continuous charge transfer network, such MoS2-GA electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance, good rate capability and excellent cyclic stability, showing great potential in large-scale and low-cost fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors.
