A controlled interfacial synthesis has been used to obtain ε - MnO2 of varying surface area between 50 and 160 m2 g -1 and pore volumes between 0.3 and 0.4 cm3 g -1. The synthesis conditions have been shown to have a marked effect on pore size distributions. These materials have been cast into composite electrode films. The differences in pore size and surface areas of the films are compared to those of the precursor powders. After assembly in supercapacitor test cells with aqueous neutral electrolyte, Specific capacitances have been assessed through galvanostatic cycling giving initial values as high as 448 F g-1, dropping to 260 F g-1 after 5 cycles but showing no further degradation over 200 cycles. © The Electrochemical Society.
