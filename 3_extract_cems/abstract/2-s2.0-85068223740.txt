By utilizing a facile microwave process, ternary nickel cobalt iron oxide (NiCoFeO4) nanorods were synthesized. A comprehensive investigation of morphological, structural and surface chemistry of the nanorods has been carried out. The electrochemical investigation of NiCoFeO4 nanorods shows superior supercapacitive characteristics achieving a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 1263 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and cyclic stability retaining 97.2% of capacitance after 2000 cycles. Asymmetric supercapacitor based on NiCoFeO4 nanorods displays a high-power density of 10 kW/kg, energy density of 9.8 W h/kg, coulombic efficiency of 95.5% and capacitance retention of 94% after 4000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor is featuring an outstanding potential for practical supercapacitors due to high surface area nanorod morphology and mixed transition metal oxide synergetic effect.
