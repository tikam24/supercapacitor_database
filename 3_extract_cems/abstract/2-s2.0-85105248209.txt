Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks have been considered as promising electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors because of their large accessible surface area, abundant active sites, and fast ion and electron transfer rates, but their relatively low conductivities hinder their application. Herein, 2D/2D NiCo-MOF/GO (NCMG) hybrid nanosheets are prepared by a simply ultrasonic method. GO nanosheets are evenly dispersed onto the surface of NiCo-MOF, constructing a conductive network, which not only enhances the electronic conductivity of NiCo-MOF nanosheets, but also efficiently prevents their aggregation. Benefiting from the unique structure of NCMG, its specific capacity is up to 413.61 C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) constructed by NCMG and activated carbon presents a maximum energy density of 36.83 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 374.99 W kg−1. The results demonstrate that NCMG hybrid nanosheets have the promising potential application for efficient energy storage devices.
