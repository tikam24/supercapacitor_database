Widespread deployment of a proof-of-concept technological solution for power system performance improvement can be accelerated through onsite demonstration and pilot projects. Digital real-time simulation with power hardware-in-the-loop in controlled lab environment is the precursor to de-risk the timely and efficient execution of field demonstration and pilot projects. However, the detailed process of development, characterization, and calibration of such high fidelity simulation testbed needs to be documented in a reproducible and publicly accessible manner to leverage across broader research and development communities. This paper presents such a laboratory testbed to study black start capability of a run-of-river hydro + ultracapacitor hybrid system. Beside the high-fidelity model of the islanded grid with hydropower unit, the testbed includes the energy storage, grid following inverter, and grid emulator hardware. Several aspects such as storage characterization, control and various parameter settings necessary to capture frequency transients during load restoration are described in a comprehensive manner, which led to an effective and timely execution of black start field demonstration with an actual hydropower plant.
