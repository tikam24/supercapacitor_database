Two polymer solutions of polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and Ni(CH3COOH)2 in dimethylformamide were electrospun into ternary composite nanofibers, followed by stabilization and carbonization processes to obtain porous carbon/nickel composite nanofibers with diameters of 100-200 nm. The study revealed that carbon/nickel composite nanofibers were successfully prepared, which allowed nickel particles with diameters of 20-70 nm to be uniformly distributed in the carbon nanofibers. It was also observed that the fibrous structures with particles embedded formed and the fibers broke into shorter fibers after sintering. X-ray diffraction indicated that embedded particles crystallized with the face centered cubic structure. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis revealed that carbon/nickel composite nanofibers with meso-pores possessed larger specific surface area than that of carbon nanofibers. The specific capacitance of the composite nanofiber electrode was as high as 103.8 F/g and showed stable cyclicity (73.8%).
