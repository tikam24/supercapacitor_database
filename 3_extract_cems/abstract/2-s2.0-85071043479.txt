Binary metal oxides with superior charge capacity and electrochemical activity have gained great interests. In this work, monodispersed CoMoO4 nanoclusters on the ordered mesoporous carbons were fabricated by a facile self-developed impregnation method. The synthesized hybrids possess improved wettability, high specific surface area (>700 m2/g) and regular mesoporous channels (âˆ¼4 nm), resulting in improved electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. These well-dispersed CoMoO4 nanoclusters exhibit a significant specific capacitance up to 367 F/g in the aqueous KNO3 electrolyte and good reversibility with a cycling efficiency of 99.8%. It is proposed that the mesoporous structure can facilitate the diffusion of electrolyte ions and then accelerate the electrochemical utilization of CoMoO4 nanoclusters. The results demonstrate that the produced binary metal oxide nanoclusters with excellent capacitance and good retention can be used as promising electrodes for the environment-friendly supercapacitors.
