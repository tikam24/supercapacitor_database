In order to give full play to the advantages of power battery and super-capacitor in the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), a new control strategy based on the subtractive clustering (SC) and adaptive fuzzy neural network (AFNN) was proposed to solve the problem of power distribution between the two energy sources when the driving schedule changes. Firstly, we used the SC to determine the structure of AFNN. Secondly, in order to improve the learning efficiency of AFNN, the back-propagation hybrid least square algorithm was applied to optimize the antecedent and conclusion parameters of network. Finally, the fuzzy membership function and rule set automatically generated by the neural network were used to the power distribution control of HESS in HEV. We verified the SC and AFNN control strategy by simulation and experiment based on the ADVISOR 2002 simulation software and the experimental platform, and the results show that the proposed control strategy can give full play to the advantages of HESS, and improve the energy storage performance of HEV.
