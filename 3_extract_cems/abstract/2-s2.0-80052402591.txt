Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorods/rGO sandwich is fabricated on chemical vapor deposition graphene film/polyethylene therephthalate substrate for flexible supercapacitor electrodes. Studies show that ZnO nanorods in the electrodes prevent aggregation of rGO sheets and help forming a porous structure. Specific capacitance of 51.6 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s is achieved for the rGO/ZnO nanorods/rGO sandwich, showing that such composite is promising for application in flexible supercapacitors.
