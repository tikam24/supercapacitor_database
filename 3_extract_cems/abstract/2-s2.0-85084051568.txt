In this paper we present a general approach for the full packaged 2032 coin cell supercapacitor (SC) based on activated carbon (AC) electrode material and Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte. Electrochemical properties of the coin cell supercapacitor were analyzed using VSP 300. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor showed a relatively high specific capacitance of 90.4 F/g. interestingly, high power density of 1968.56w/kg coupled with using neutral electrolyte that promotes stability, safety and life cycle. The obtained power is due to the cell configuration.
