The project consists on the analysis, design, simulation and implementation of a 3kW half bridge current source resonant converter, for energy storage applications in electric/hybrid vehicles. There is an existing prototype of a 3kW Half-Bridge Current-Source Hard-Switching converter in the electrical machines laboratory of the University of Rome. However this circuit is not working under resonant operation. The project consists on modify and adapt the full circuit to attain resonant operation of the system. In addition, to adapt the power stage, and in order to implement the control action, a filter and measurement circuit will also be designed and implemented. Furthermore, the existing system and the control algorithm will be combined with a fuzzy logic controller which is designed by another student from the University of Rome (Stefano Leonori), so an energy management system for an electric/hybrid car is going to be designed.
