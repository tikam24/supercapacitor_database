Cathodic electrosynthesis has been utilized for the fabrication of γ-Fe2O3 films, containing chitosan additive as a binder. The films were studied by X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry data showed that the iron oxide films exhibit electrochemical capacitance in the voltage window of -0.9 to -0.1 V vs SCE in 0.25 m Na2SO4 and 0.25 m Na2S2O 3 aqueous solutions. The highest specific capacitance (SC) of 210 F g-1 was achieved using 0.25 m Na2S2O 3 as electrolyte, at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. The SC decreased with increasing film thickness, scan rate and cycle number. Heat treatment of the films at 140 °C resulted in increasing SC. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.
