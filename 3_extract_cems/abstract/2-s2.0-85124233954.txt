Mixed metal oxides gain potential interest as the conversion of energy and electrode material for storage. Some notable attributes like supremacy on power and energy density, long cyclic stability, and quick reaction to form supercapacitors are essential, like energy storage devices. Contemplating those views of supercapacitors, in the present investigation, the new manganese vanadium oxide has been synthesized by microwave synthesis and followed by a hydrothermal process with an open-faced hollow sphere-like structure. It contains a high surface that gives more electrochemically active sites for energy storage and multivalence response. The sample has been characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy for confirming phase, characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy for morphological features. Electrochemical analyses of as-synthesized samples are investigated thoroughly to anticipate the view of that system's approach in an energy storage device. The specific capacitance is analyzed to be 340F/g in 0.5A/g current density and 1900F/g at 2 mV/s scan rate. This mixed metal oxide depicts higher stability and up to 1,000 cycles, which is 91% at a current density of 10A/g. It displays a high energy density of 13Wh/kg at the power density of 3500 W/kg in the current density of 8A/g. The potential value-specific capacitance, rated capacity, and long cycle stability make it a prominent candidate to fulfill the urge to engineering new advanced materials for energy storage applications.
