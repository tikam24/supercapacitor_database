In this paper, a simple scheme of the supercapacitor based on (RC) circuit is modeled and characterized using experimental methods. Then, computer simulations and experimental results showed very good agreement which demonstrates the accuracy of the adopted model. An example of hybrid photovoltaic/supercapacitor stand-alone system is considered in this paper. Dynamic model of photovoltaic system component is developed and validated with experimental results. In addition, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control for photovoltaic and the supercapacitor state of charge (SOC) control are also addressed in this work. Based on the dynamic component models, a simulation model for the considered hybrid energy system has been developed using MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results show the primary role of the supercapacitor when the load changes rapidly. Â© 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
