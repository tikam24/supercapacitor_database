Carbon aerogels hold great promise as the electrode materials for energy storage owing to their desirable porous structures and specific surface areas. Here, we report a scalable approach for the preparation of Co-doped graphene/carbon hybrid aerogel (CGCA) with hierarchically porous structure through a dual cross-linking strategy. By adjusting the cross-linking structure of the hydrogel precursor, the porous structure of CGCA can be readily regulated and the specific surface area of CGCA can achieve 1217 m2 g−1. As a result, the CGCA samples not only manifest improved electrical conductivity, but also possess enhanced capacitance storage capacity. The optimized CGCA electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 371 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and maintains a large specific capacitance of 57 % at 150 A g−1. Meanwhile, the supercapacitor assembled with CGCA electrodes shows a high specific capacitance of 80 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good cyclic stability with a capacitance retention of 95 % after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the supercapacitor device can provide a high energy density of 11.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. The superior energy-storage behaviors of CGCA make them promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
