N2 adsorption-desorption method, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscopy were employed to test changes of the specific surface area, average pore diameter and appearances of activated carbons treated with different concentration of sulfuric acid. It can be concluded that these performances altered with sulfuric acid concentration. Activated carbon can be oxidized when the acid concentration increase to a certain value and this process takes time that sulfuric acid molecules first insert in the pore of the carbon which represented by reduction of the specific surface area of carbon and then oxidization occurred. This study is very significant in the development of carbon which is suitable for lead acid battery.
