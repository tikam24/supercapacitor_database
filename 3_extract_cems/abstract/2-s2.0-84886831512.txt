A self-assembly method was adopted to synthesize graphene oxide aerogel (GOA), which was further reduced by hydrogen at 1100°C to obtain graphene aerogel (GA). Nitrogen adsorption analysis results show that both aerogels possess high BET surface areas (approximate 870 m2·g-1). FT-IR analysis results reveal that the surface of GOA has more oxygen-containing groups than those of GA. Elemental results display that the C/O molar ratios of GOA and GA are 1.7 and 69.9, respectively. Electrochemical measurements show that at the current density of 0.2 A·g-1, the specific capacitance of GOA with high surface functionalized degree could reach up to 155.8 F·g-1, while GA with low surface functionalized degree exhibits a high-rate supercapacitive performance.
