We construct uniform hierarchical CuO@MnO2 core-shell structure via Kirkendall effect of KCu7S4microwires without any surfactants. KCu7S4 microwires are synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Subsequently, MnO2 nanosheets are grown on the CuO microtubes to form core-shell structures in the hydrothermal conditions. Based on time-dependent observation, a possible evolution mechanism for the hollow-core-shell structure is proposed. And the application of as-prepared CuO@MnO2 as the electrode for supercapacitor has been investigated, the core-shell structure enable the electrode with relatively high capacitance (252.6 F g1 (capacity: 70.2 mAh g1) at the current density of 0.1 A g1, based on the total mass of CuO and MnO2) and good stability (90.8% capacitance retention at 1 Ag1 after 1000 charge-discharge cycles).
