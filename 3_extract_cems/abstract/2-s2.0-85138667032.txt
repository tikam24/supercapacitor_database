Nickel-cobalt composite supercapacitor electrode materials such as nickel-cobalt hydroxide composites have attracted extensive attention in the field of electrochemistry due to their advantages of large specific capacitance and excellent cycle performance. The electrochemical properties of nickel-cobalt composites are generally better than those of single transition metal compounds due to the synergic interaction between the transition metal elements. However, the performance of metal composites is closely related to the component element distribution within the particles, which depends strongly on the micromixing efficiency of the precipitation reaction environment. In this work, a micro-impinging stream reactor (MISR) with excellent micromixing performance was applied to the preparation of nickel-cobalt hydroxide composites. The results showed that MISR could significantly reduce the particle scale and improve the size distribution, agglomeration degree as well as the electrochemical performance of the prepared nickel-cobalt hydroxide composites. In the three-electrode testing system, the initial specific capacitance of the MISR-prepared material was 1548.0 F/g, and the capacitance retention was 106.0% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. In the two-electrode system, the initial specific capacitance of the device was 30.6 F/g, and the capacitance retention was 75.6% after 1000 cycles.
