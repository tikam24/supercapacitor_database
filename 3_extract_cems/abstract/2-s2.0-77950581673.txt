Electrochemical capacitors are also called 'electric double layer capacitors'. The'supercapacitors' or 'ultracapacitors' stores the energy in the electric field of the electrochemical double-layer. In order to study the supercapacitor performance influenced by the temperature, a supercapacitor 3D thermal model was proposed to study the supercapacitor thermal behavior under the normal temperature condition in constant current charge and discharge mode in the article. At first, the transient state and the stable state temperature fields were simulated with the finite element method, then the internal temperature of supercapacitor were measured with the thermal resistance during charging and discharging process under normal temperature. The results indicate this model can accurately simulate the supercapacitor thermal behavior under the small or moderate current charging and discharging condition. Thus, the supercapacitor charges and discharges with the small or moderate current under the normal temperature, the temperature rise of supercapacitor is not higher than 15Â°C, and its performance is reliable.
