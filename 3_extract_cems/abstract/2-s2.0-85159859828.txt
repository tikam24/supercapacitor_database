Abstract—: Series of Ag-doped graphitic carbon nitride composites (GCN–xAg) is designed and utilized as electrode material for supercapacitors (SC). This is done by changing the amount of silver nitrate initially added to urea by a one-step calcination route. The crystal structure, chemical structure, thermal stability, morphology, all are investigated by Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) respectively. The electrochemical performance of this series has been analyzed by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD), and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. This is found that the 0.9 mmol Ag doped graphitic carbon nitride composite has high specific capacitance 195.3 F/g at 10 mV/s scan rate in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution as compared to pure graphitic carbon nitride (GCN–P) with 21.1 F/g specific capacitance. The specific capacitance of GCN–0.9Ag retains 100.2% after 1000 cycles at 150 mV/s. The energy density of GCN–0.9Ag observes 10.35 W h/kg with admirable power density 135.9 W/kg at 0.5 A/g current density. It is observed that even taking Ag doping as 0.9 mmol, specific capacitance shows a remarkable increase as compared to that of GCN–P.
