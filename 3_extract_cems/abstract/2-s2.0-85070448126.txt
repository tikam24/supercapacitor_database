This paper is based on the simulink and advisor2002 simulation software, aiming at the energy control strategy of pure electric vehicle whose energy storage system is composed of batteries and ultracapacitors in parallel. In order to improve the efficiency of braking energy recovery, a hybrid energy system model was built and a fuzzy control based energy allocation strategy was established. The hybrid energy system can reasonably distribute the energy output ratio of batteries and ultracapacitors, and improve the system performance.
