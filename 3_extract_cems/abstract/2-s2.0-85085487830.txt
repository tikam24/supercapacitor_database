At present, various wind farms in the industry have not established a service life based on the actual situation of super capacitors used in the wind turbine pitch system, a new method for estimating the life of super capacitors is proposed. The first step is to collect the charging voltage value and the annual temperature data value of the capacitor cabinet of a wind turbine, and then calculate the actual operation time of the super capacitor at each temperature point. Secondly, we use the life estimation formula to calculate the estimated operating life of the super capacitor at each temperature point, Finally, we use the method of life conversion to convert the actual operation time of super capacitor at each temperature point into the operation time of super capacitor at a specific temperature point in a year, and then the estimated life value of super capacitor is calculated. This new method for estimating the life of super capacitors takes into account the differences in the local environment of wind farms across the country, as well as the influence of the actual operating environment difference of each wind turbine on the life of super capacitor. The proposed method plays an important role in the regular maintenance and replacement of the super capacitor used in the wind turbine pitch system.
