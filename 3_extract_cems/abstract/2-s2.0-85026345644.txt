Sulfur and nitrogen dual-doped graphene fibers (SNGFs) were prepared through an optimized chemical vapor deposition. The SNGFs exhibit a stable 3D fibrous structure, high surface area, abundant mesopores, uniform distribution of S and N atoms and more defects. As electrodes for supercapacitors, the specific capacitance of SNGFs reaches 311 F g−1. The SNGF//SNGF symmetric supercapacitor delivers maximum energy and power densities of 37.7 W h kg−1 and 14 kW kg−1, with excellent cycling stability (92.2 % capacitance remained after 5000 cycles). The result indicates that the SNGFs are a promising candidate as a high-quality electrode material for supercapacitors.
