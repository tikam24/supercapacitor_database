Performance of activated charcoal based supercapacitor (SC) containing hydroquinone (HQ), as an organic redox shuttle, is evaluated in triethylammonium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (TEATFSI). Cyclic voltammograms of the SC show pseudocapacitive contribution of HQ and the galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement shows enhanced specific capacitance (72.0 F g-1) and specific energy (31.22 Wh Kg-1). The presence of HQ shows low charge transfer resistance, as confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Cyclic stability of the SC in the redox mediated electrolyte is comparable with that of the protic ionic liquid.
