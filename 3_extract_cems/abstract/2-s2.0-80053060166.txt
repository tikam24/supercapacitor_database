The composite electrodes of cobalt oxide and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are prepared by a simple low-temperature solid-phase synthesis method with the assistance of polyethylene glycol and their pseudocapacitive performances are investigated in alkaline solution by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, respectively. Transmission electron microscope images show that cobalt oxide is uniformly coated on multi-wall carbon nanotubes and the homogeneous hybrid nanostructure are considered to be responsible for their preferable electrochemical performances. The electrochemical tests further reveal that the composite can deliver a maximum specific capacitance of 217 F/g with a biggest utilization of Co element when the content of MWCNTs increases to 50 wt.%.
