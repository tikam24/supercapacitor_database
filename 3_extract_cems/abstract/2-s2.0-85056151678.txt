It is crucial to develop flexible and wearable electronic devices that have attracted tremendous interest due to their merits on compactness, flexibility and high capacitive properties. Herein we report the continuously ordered macroscopic poly(ionic liquid)-graphene fibers by wet spinning method via liquid crystal assembly for supercapacitor application. The fabricated all-solid-state supercapacitors exhibited a high areal capacitance (268.2 mF cm−2) and volumetric capacitance (204.6 F cm−3) with an outstanding areal energy density (9.31 µWh cm−2) and volumetric energy density (8.28 mWh cm−3). The fiber supercapacitors demonstrated exceptional cycle life for straight electrodes of about 10,000 cycles (94.2% capacitance retention) and flexibility at different angles (0°, 45°, 90°, 180°) along with a good flexible cycling stability after 6000 cycles (92.7% capacitance retention). To date, such a novel poly (ionic liquid)-graphene fiber supercapacitors would be a new platform in real-time flexible electronics.
