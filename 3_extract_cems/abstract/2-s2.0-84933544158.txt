This paper presents an optimization and control scheme for power converters in a micro-grid, which is composed of a wind energy system, an energy storage element (supercapacitor), a load and the interconnection to the utility grid. Based on the results of a dynamic optimization model, which establish the energy flow in the micro-grid, an optimal control scheme uses these results of electrical power values as set-points to efficiently integrate renewable energy to/from the utility grid through the optimal control of power converters. A case study micro-grid is used to integrate the energy from renewable resources, with the facility to storage energy, to provide of energy to loads and to provide/consume energy to/from the utility grid. Simulation results are presented to assess the performance of the proposed controller for the case study micro-grid.
