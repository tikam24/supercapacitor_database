Using the aniline oxidative polymerization, polyanilineâ€“carbonaceous material composites were synthesized, in which polymer layer at the carbon particle surface forms fibers oriented perpendicularly to the support surface. Conductivity, surface properties, and electrochemical activity of the composites in wide composition range are studied. The composites with fibrous morphology of polymer layer are shown to have much higher electrochemical capacitance than those with dense and homogeneous polyaniline layer.
