Perovskites have been significantly considered as promising materials for electrochemical energy storage in the recent years. Co-doping of Mn and Nd with hydrothermally synthesized LaFeO3 (LF) perovskite resulted in La0.8Nd0.2Fe0.8Mn0.2O3 (LNFM) with significantly higher specific capacitance of 158 F/g at 50 mV/s compared to non-doped and single doped LF samples. Subsequently, LNFM/nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NGO) nanocomposite was prepared and investigated. It was found out that the introducing of NGO substantially enhances the specific capacitance of the nanocomposite up to 1060 F/g at 50 mV/s. Besides, the composite revealed outstanding capacity retention as 92.4% after 10000 continuous cycle (85.37% for the LNFM sample). In overall, the electrochemical behavior of the composite with 1:1 ratio of LNFM/NGO confirms its high potential as supercapacitor for energy storage applications.
