With their outstanding electrical, mechanical and thermal properties, graphene and graphene-based materials have created keen anticipation as perfect candidates for improving the performance of energy storage devices, such as lithium batteries and supercapacitors. It has been demonstrated that graphene improves conductivity, charge rate, energy capacity and reduction of volume expansion of electrode materials in lithium batteries. Furthermore, graphene-based supercapacitors exhibit high storage capacity, fast energy release, quick recharge time, and a long lifetime. Th is chapter reviews some of the most widely-employed methods for preparing graphene and its derivatives, and application of these composites in the fi elds of lithium-ion, lithium-air, lithium-sulphur batteries and supercapacitors.
