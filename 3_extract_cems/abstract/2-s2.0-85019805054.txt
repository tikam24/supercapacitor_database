Electrode is the key part of the electrochemical capacitors (also known as supercapacitors) as well as energy storage and conversion products or other electrochemical devices, so the electrode materials are the most important factors to determine the properties of these tools. The major classes of suitable electrode materials used for the capacitors as well as an energy storage and conversion materials or other electrochemical devices are activated nanoporous carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes, conducting polymers, metal oxides, and polymer composites, which have been extensively reported in the literature. In addition, the well-known applications of advanced electrodes in metals production, energy storage in batteries and supercapacitors, and catalyst supports have appeared in the literature on both carbon materials and their interactions with electrolytes and redox systems. Since the significant application of graphite electrodes for electrochemical production of alkali metals, carbon materials have been broadly used in both analytical and industrial electrochemistry. The often-cited benefits of carbon electrodes contain reasonable cost, wide potential window, relatively inert electrochemistry, and electrocatalytic activity for a variety of redox reactions. Energy storage techniques appear as one of the most promising options in harvesting renewably generated energy during the optimum manufacture period for future use. Of the available electrical energy storage devices, fuel cells, batteries, and capacitors have been the technology of choice for most applications. Herein, the storage principles and characteristics of electrode materials, including carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides, and conductive polymers for advanced electrodes are depicted briefly.
