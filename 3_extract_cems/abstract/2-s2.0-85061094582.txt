In the past decade, researchers in the fields of energy production have concentrated on the improvement of new energy storage devices. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and faradaic supercapacitors (FSs) have attracted special attention as a result of the rapid development of new electrode nanomaterials, especially hybrid nanomaterials, which can meet the increasingly higher requirements for future energy, such as the capability to deliver high-power performance and an extremely long life cycle. In these hybrid nanostructures, a series of synergistic effects and unique properties arising from the combination of individual components are a major factor leading to improved charge/discharge capability, energy density, and system lifetime. This paper describes the most recent progress in the growth of hybrid electrode materials for LIBs and FSs systems, focusing on the combination of zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional (1D), two-dimensional (2D), and three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterials, respectively.
