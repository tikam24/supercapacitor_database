Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) (PEDOP)/vanadium pentoxide (V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>) nanobelt hybrid films were prepared for the first time. V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> nanobelts with a monoclinic structure were grown by a hydrothermal route and a PEDOT layer was coated onto V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> nanobelts by electropolymerization to yield the PEDOP/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> hybrid. The hybrid showed a fourfold increment in electrical conductivity compared to the pristine oxide, and a work function of 4.71 eV (by Kelvin probe force microscopy), which was intermediate to that of PEDOP and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>. Both oxide and hybrid showed green-red luminescence. The PEDOP/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> hybrid or V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> films were assembled into energy saving photoelectrochromic cells, by combining with a photovoltaic electrode of CdS/titania, and in response to 1 sun illumination for different durations, the hybrid showed a dynamic transmission modulation (ΔT), as it switched from a yellow to a dark green optical state, without the application of any external bias, by simply consuming the electrical current produced by the irradiated CdS/titania. The hybrid exhibited a maximum ΔT of 65.5% at 475 nm, which was greater by 82% compared to pristine V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> at the same wavelength. The ability of PEDOP to provide facile conduction pathways for fast and improved electron transfer and transport in the PEDOP/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> hybrid, enhances the optical contrast produced. The versatility of the hybrid was established by assembling asymmetric supercapacitors with the hybrid or polymer or oxide and a liquid electrolyte. The synergistic effects of PEDOP (high electrical conductivity) and V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> nanobelts (large surface area) and their ability to store/release charge by undergoing reversible Faradaic reactions were reflected in a high specific capacitance of 224 F g<sup>-1</sup> delivered by the hybrid, higher by 83% and 69% relative to pristine V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> and PEDOP. The hybrid shows an energy density of 223 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 3.8 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>, and an acceptable cycling performance with 90% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The PEDOP/V<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> hybrid is useful for advanced next-generation self-powered electrochromic smart windows and supercapacitors.
