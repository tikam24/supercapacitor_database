Porous MnCo2O4@NiO nanosheets have been produced through hydrothermal synthesis and calcination. The net structure of the porous nanosheets allows the MnCo2O4@NiO electrode to have an excellent specific surface area so as to provide more active sites in the Faraday reaction. Therefore, the MnCo2O4@NiO electrode has an ultrahigh specific capacitance of up to 508.3 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability of 89.7% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. With their unique structure, these composite materials show great potential for use as high-performance supercapacitor anodes in practical applications.
