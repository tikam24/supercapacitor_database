Nanocellulose (NFC)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (NR) and NFC/RGO/ polyaniline (PANI) (NRP) paper-based electrodes were prepared by means of the ultrasonic irradiation of a suspension of nanocellulose, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and polyaniline (PANI) and vacuum filtration. Meanwhile, the relationship between the carboxyl content of NFC and the electrical properties of the electrodes as well as that between the carboxyl content of NFC and the mechanical properties of the electrodes was discussed, so as to achieve composite paper-based electrodes of better electrochemical properties. Finally, by taking polyving akohol/sulfuric acid(PVA/H2SO4) as the electrolyte, two composite paper-based supercapacitors named NRS and NRPS were prepared respectively with NR and NRP. The results show that (1) by controlling the ratio of NFC, RGO and PANI, hydrophilic NFC can effectively decrease the restacking between RGO and PANI, meanwhile, the hydrophilic properties of NFC can effectively improve the diffusion of electrolyte ions; (2) increasing the carboxyl content of NFC helps to enhance the combination of composite materials, thus improving the electrical properties and mechanical properties of the composite paper-based electrodes; and (3) when the mass ratio of NFC, RGO and PANI is 5:3:3 and the current density is 0.5 A/g, the NRPS paper-based supercapacitor is of a specific capacitance of 305 F/g, and 98.3% of the specific capacitance is retained after 1 000 charge-discharge cycles, which means that this supercapacitor is of better electrochemical cycle stability.
