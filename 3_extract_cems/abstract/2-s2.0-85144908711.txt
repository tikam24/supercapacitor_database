A fractal, flower petal-like CuS-CuO/G-C3N4 nanocomposite is prepared and applied in a symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor. The preparation of CuS-CuO/G-C3N4 is carried out through the hydrothermal method, in which salts of copper are dissolved and mixed with a suspension of G-C3N4 nanoparticles. A symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor, formed from CuS-CuO/G-C3N4 paste on Au-plates is investigated. The measurements are carried out in diluted 0.5 M HCl, and Whatman filter paper is used as a separator. The supercapacitor electric properties are determined by measuring the charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, impedance, and lifetime parameters. An enhancement in the charge/discharge time from 65 to 420 s was recorded while decreasing the current density (J) from 1.0 to 0.3 A/g. The cyclic voltammetry behavior is studied from 50 to 300 mV·s−1, causing a direct increase in the produced J values. The specific capacitance (CS) and energy density (E) values are 370 F/g and 37 W·h·kg−1, respectively. The magnificent properties of the prepared supercapacitor qualify it for industrial applications as an alternative to batteries.
