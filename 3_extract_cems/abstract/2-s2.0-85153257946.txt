Porous carbons obtained from pyrolysis of biomass have been proved to be a great choice for energy storage applications, owing to the endless supply of precursors - hence low cost, and of course due to the significant advantages of carbon aerogels such as high specific surface area, good conductivity, and light weight. Most reports on energy storage devices that use carbon aerogels either employ energy intensive processes, such as freeze-drying, or rely on activation protocols. Therefore, it is significant to establish cost-effective and eco-friendly protocols, which will boost the competitiveness of such materials. Herein, we present a thorough electrochemical characterization, and we demonstrate the performance of some nitrogen/metal co-doped alginate-derived carbon aerogels in aqueous supercapacitors. Those carbon aerogels were synthesized by pyrolysis of polyurea-crosslinked alginate aerogels and exhibited excellent energy/power density as well as cycling stability, in comparison to analogous materials reported in the literature.
