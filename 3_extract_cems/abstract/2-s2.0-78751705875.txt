In this study highly pure carbons synthesized using resorcinol furaldehyde catalyzed with hexamethylenetetramine (an amine base) are tested for supercapacitor electrodes. This synthesis is not only from all-organic renewable sources, but can also significantly increase the performance of the device by promoting adequate electric double layer formation. The electrochemical characterization shows an increase in the specific capacitance per unit of surface area that is 18% higher than that of commercial biomass carbons and their synthetic counterparts. The life of the capacitor is also extended to twice that of the commercial brand tested here and has increased power after cycling. The supercapacitors made from this synthesis have electric double layer characteristics as desired in some applications. The samples have been tested for composition using XPS, and their electrochemical performance was analyzed using galvanostatic measurements and complex capacitance and power derived from impedance spectroscopy.
