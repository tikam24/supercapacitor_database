An unprecedented polyoxoniobate (PONb) oligomer was obtained by addition of a methylene blue (MB) dye solution over the PONb solution formed a blue nanogel that was converted into a stable blue solid through a lyophilization process. The new solid composite, so-called “blue polyoxoniobate” (blue-PONb), presents a two-dimensional (2D) morphology with electrochemical performance that stand out among the materials used in redox supercapacitor technology. This new material was evaluated as supercapacitor electrode showing a high areal specific capacitance and power density that reaches 110.50 mF cm−2 and 8.49 mW cm−2. In addition, in this composite the redox additive (MB) and the PONb presented a peculiar electrochemical behavior, the reduction of the niobium species and the transfer of electrons necessary for the accumulation of charge occurring simultaneously. As a result, blue-PONb electrode maintains the cycling performance with high coulombic efficiency (∼99 %) over the 50,000 cycles evaluated. Here, the origins of the electrochemical stability and the mechanism of operation of the blue-PONb electrode are analyzed and discussed. Finally, this work presents a PONb as a new and promising class of redox-capacitive materials with matrix/redox shuttle synergism.
