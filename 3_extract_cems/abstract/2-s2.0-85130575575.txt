An off-grid photovoltaic (PV) system's PV array is connected with a charge controller as the first power conversion stage. The average efficiency of the power stage of charge controllers is around 90%. Supercapacitor (SC) - battery hybrid PV system is a novel PV system that utilizes some of the wasted energy of a typical system and enhances the system's efficiency up to 98%. However, the feasibility of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) for this system is yet to be validated. This paper presents a comparative study to adapt MPPT for the proposed system consisting of a series-connected SC bank with PV array and step-down DC-DC converter. The step-down converter is used as the impedance matching network. Different solar irradiance profiles were emulated to check the feasibility and efficiency of MPPT. Experimentally, it was shown that the typical MPPT could be adapted to the proposed PV system with very high MPPT efficiency.
