There is an extensively growing interest in using paper or paper-like substrates for batteries and other energy storage devices. Due to their intrinsic characteristics, paper (or paper-like) batteries show outstanding performance while retaining low cost, multifunctionality, versatility, flexibility and disposability. In this overview, we review recent achievements in paper (or paper-like) batteries as well as their applications. Various types of paper power devices are discussed including electrochemical batteries, biofuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and nanogenerators. Further scientific and technological challenges in this field are also discussed. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
