Industrial carbon black (CB) with high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity was used as electrode material for supercapacitor. Effect of different scan rate on specific capacitance of CB electrode and effect of different cycle on CB electrode life were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical properties of CB electrode were also studied by constant current charge/discharge. It was showed that the rectangular CV curves and linear potential-time curves exhibited typical capacitive behavior of CB electrode. The specific capacitance was nearly irrelevant to the scan rate. The CB electrode also showed high power characteristics and excellent cyclic life.
