Supercapacitors are an important energy storage systems due to their high power compared to batteries, giving them unique applications. The search for low-cost and high-surface-area pseudocapacitive metal oxides/hydroxides with good conductivity as supercapacitor materials is a developing trend. In this work, the nanometer-scale active material Co(OH)2 was deposited on well-designed hierarchical nickel/nickel foam (current collector) with significantly enhanced conductivity, and the electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, displaying a high area-specific capacitance of 3.17 F cm-2 under the current density of 5 mA cm-2. Importantly, the capacitance increased to 9.62 F cm-2 after 2000 cycles of galvanostatic charging-discharging, which is 3.03 times as great as the initial value. Such a capacitance increase could be attributed to the formation of porous Ni-Co mixed hydroxide with a micro/nanostructure during cycling, which was confirmed by scanning and transmission electron microscopy investigations. The formation mechanism of Ni-Co mixed hydroxide is also proposed. This result demonstrates that the electrochemical reactions during galvanostatic charging-discharging could represent a novel fabrication method to synthesize mixed hydroxides for energy storage and conversion materials in the future.
