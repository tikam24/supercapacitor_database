Chloride-ion batteries (CIBs) have the advantages of being widely sourced, environmentally friendly, and having high theoretical volumetric energy density (2500 Wh·L-1). However, the electrochemical reaction kinetics and cycle performance of CIBs suffer from poor structural reversibility and insufficient electrical conductivity of chlorine storage materials. Herein, we report the synthesis of a Cl-terminated MXene (Ti3C2Cl2) with high Cl- capacity and low Cl- diffusion barrier as a cathode material for chloride-ion hybrid capacitors (CHCs). The constructed Ti3C2Cl2 electrode delivers a gravimetric capacity of 536 mAh·g-1 and a Coulombic efficiency of >99.5% after 1000 cycles of charge and discharge at a current density of 0.2 A·g-1. It also exhibits superior rate capability of 153.1 mAh·g-1 at 1 A·g-1 and 121.2 mAh·g-1 at 2 A·g-1, respectively.
