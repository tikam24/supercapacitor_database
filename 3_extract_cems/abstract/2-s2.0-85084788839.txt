Abstract: The possibility of improving the reliability of air conditioning systems and providing uninterrupted operation when passing through deenergized sections of a contact network by means of an electric energy storage, for which it is proposed to use large-capacity capacitors (supercapacitors). An approach to determining the required storage capacity is proposed that takes into account the speed of movement, the voltage in the contact network, and the length of the deenergized section. To verify the validity of the proposed method and the correctness of the selected storage capacity, a simulation was carried out in the ORCAD end-to-end design system. The simulation results showed the feasibility of uninterrupted power supply of an air conditioner compressor during passage through deenergized sections of the contact network, which increases the comfort of passenger transportation.
