Hierarchically porous carbon aerogels (CAs) were synthesized by following a green, facile preparation route involving ice-templating and lyophilization followed by carbonization. For the first time, we report CAs prepared with a cooling rate of 7.5 K/min, demonstrating a very high specific surface area (SSA) of 1260 m2g-1without any physical or chemical activation steps, and the electrode prepared using the latter aerogel showed superior electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 410 F g-1at 2 m V s-1with a cyclic stability of 94% after 4500 charge-discharge cycles. The effects of the ice-templating cooling rate and the solid content of lignin and cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) in the suspension on the structure and electrochemical performance of the CAs were investigated. The ice-templating process and the cooling rate were found to have a large effect on the generation of the nanoporous structure and the specific surface area of carbon aerogels, while the solid content of the lignin-nanocellulose suspension showed negligible effects. When assembled as a supercapacitor (SC), a remarkable specific capacitance of 240 F g-1at 0.1 A g-1was achieved. The relaxation time constant for the prepared SC was 1.3 s, which shows the fast response of these SCs. In addition, an energy density of 4.3 Wh kg-1was also obtained at a power density of 500 W kg-1. Thus, this study opens new perspectives for the preparation of green, environment-friendly, free-standing, high-performance CA electrodes for future energy storage applications.
