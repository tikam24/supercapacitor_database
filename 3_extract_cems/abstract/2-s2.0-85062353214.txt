Supercapacitors deliver exceptional power densities, high cycling stability, and inherent safety but suffer from low energy densities. Many methods to enhance the energy density are based on exploring electrode materials with well-developed structures and designing asymmetric systems with wide voltage windows. The energy density is substantially enhanced at the compromise of power density by utilizing the sluggish kinetics of pseudocapacitive materials. Redox-active electrolytes can contribute additional pseudocapacitance from the reactions of redox mediators at the interface, which have attracted increasing attention of researchers. Redox-mediator-enhanced supercapacitors deliver high energy densities while retaining high power densities. This Minireview highlights the recently prominent progresses of single-, dual-, and ambipolar-redox-mediator-enhanced supercapacitors, the challenges they face, and approaches to suppress self-discharge and develop high-concentration redox-active electrolytes for performance promotion.
