Ultrathin nanoflakes of Ni(OH)2 were synthesized onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by simple low cost chemically precipitation method for high performance electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The synthesized ultrathin Ni(OH)2 exhibit high specific capacitance of 1735 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 with excellent rate capability. This high performance of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes was attributed to its complete accessibility to the electrolyte and maximum utilization of metal hydroxides. Findings of this work suggest that synthesized electrodes offer low-cost and scalable solution for high-performance energy storage devices. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
