CoMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanowires are successfully embedded on the surface of nickel foam (NF) through a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The morphology and electrochemical properties of the samples can be controlled using different molar ratios of Co and Mn salts. CoMn LDH nanowires on NF with Co2+/Mn2+ molar ratio of 3:1 exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, high specific capacitance (1409 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1), good cycling stability (93.2% retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles), and excellent performance rate (71.1% retention at 10 A g−1) when used as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
