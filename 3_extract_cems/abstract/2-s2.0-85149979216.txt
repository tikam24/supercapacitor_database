The purpose of this study is to drive a fully active hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based on state of charge (SOC). A sliding mode control is used to estimate the SOC of the source such as battery and supercapacitor (SC) used in hybrid electric vehicles. For effective performance of HESS, higher-order sliding mode control method is implemented then the SOCs of battery and supercapacitor are estimated using a super-twisting technique. The advantages of the higher-order sliding mode control are that it can efficiently reject matched system disturbances and remove chattering induced in the control input in short span of time. In order to generate the reference current for effective tracking, rule-based strategy is used. The simulation results shows the estimating methodâ€™s efficacy by providing accurate estimation of source parameters.
