Hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) holds promise for the application of supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries because of its rapid mass transfer capability. In this work, we propose a facie method to prepare a new class of HPCs by choosing water hyacinth leaves (WHL) as the carbon source. The obtained WHL-based HPC possesses an ultrahigh surface area (2959 m g−1) primarily donated by numerous small-sized nanopores on the nanoparticles, and an aerogel-like macroporous structure aggregated by three-dimensionally interconnected nanoparticles. This hierarchically porous structure coupling with the high surface area can simultaneously enable fast ion transfer and provide plentiful active places for energy storage. Consequently, WHL-based HPC demonstrates a much higher capacitance and lithium storage capacity of 256 F g−1 and 590 mAh g−1 compared to commercial activated carbons and graphite, respectively. Meanwhile, the enhanced mass diffusion/transfer endows the obtained HPC with superior high rate performance.
