This paper gives an account on a hybrid energy storage system with Lithium ion battery and supercapacitor for an Electric vehicle. It is interconnected with a bidirectional DC-DC converter and the simulation results are obtained and tested for a small scale level. Battery can provide for longer all electric range depending on the battery capacity but has lesser efficiency when used under highly loaded conditions which leads to high thermal stress and decreases the life of the battery, which can be taken care of by supercapacitor. Simulation is done in MATLAB/ Simulink which has three modes of operation which includes powering the electric vehicle run on Brushless DC motor with both the energy storage devices and power management between them.
