Poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PDAA) coated carbon cloth (ROCC@PDAA) composites were fabricated as flexible electrode by in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (DAA) on the surface of oxidized carbon cloth (OCC) using ammonium persulfate (APS) as oxidant in the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide/acetonitrile by refluxing with HClO 4 as initiator, followed by reducing the OCC with hydrazine. The optimized flexible composites possessed high areal capacitance of 1.3 F cm −2 (specific capacitance of 81.9 F g −1 ) at the current density of 1 mA cm −2 with excellent rate properties (61% at 20 mA cm −2 ) and extraordinary cycling stability (159% after 20,000 cycles). The flexible symmetric solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) constructed with the optimized ROCC@PDAA composite could light up a red light emitting diode, also exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with remarkable mechanical and flexible properties. All the results demonstrated the potential application of the proposed ROCC@PDAA composites for flexible energy storage devices.
