This experimental study, reports the use of flexible tape casting of dense carbon nanofiber (CNFs) alone and in hybrid structure with MnO2 from supercapacitor applications. Different electrolyte concentrations of potassium hydroxide (KOH) were tested and it was founded that mild concentrated electrolyte, like 9 M KOH, provides higher specific capacitance 38 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements explain that the solution resistance and the charge transfer resistance is higher from 3 M KOH concentrations and lower from 6 M KOH concentrations. Afterwards a novel, fast and simple method is adopted to achieve a hybrid nanostructure of CNFs/MnO2 with various KMnO4 ratios. The hybrid supercapacitor, having loaded a mass of 0.0003 g MnO2 as a thin film, delivers a highest specific capacitance of 812 F g-1 at a scan rate 5 mV s-1. Charge/discharge cycling stability at current density of 7.9 A g-1 demonstrates larger specific capacitance 303 F g-1 stability. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor can deliver specific energy (72.4 Wh kg-1) at specific power (3.44 kW kg-1). Specific surface area increase from 68 m2 g-1 from CNFs to 240 m2 g-1 from CNFs/MnO2.
