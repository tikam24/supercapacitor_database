We report the development of high-performance wearable supercapacitor fabrics based on flexible metallic fabrics (Ni-cotton), on which nanofiber webs containing multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are directly electrospun without the need for any post-treatment. The as-prepared fabric devices show a high areal capacitance of 973.5 mF cm-2 (2.5 mA cm-2) and ultrahigh stability in the bending test at a very small bending radius (2 mm). In addition, such supercapacitor fabrics can be integrated into commercial textiles with any desirable forms, indicating the remarkable application potentials in wearable electronics.
