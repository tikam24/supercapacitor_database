Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) thin films were prepared through electrodeposition on copper substrates using an ammonia-complexed cobalt chloride solution. The structural and morphological properties of the film were studied using an X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscopy, and the results showed that the electrodeposited cobalt oxide film had a nanocrystalline and porous structure. The electrochemical behavior of the electrodeposited cobalt oxide electrode was evaluated in a KOH solution using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The electrodeposited cobalt oxide electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 235 F/g at a scan rate of 20 mV/s. The specific energy and the specific power of the electrode were 4.0 Wh/kg and 1.33 kW/kg, respectively. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
