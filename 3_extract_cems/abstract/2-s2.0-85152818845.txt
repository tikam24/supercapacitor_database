Hexagonal phase of molybdenum trioxide (h-MoO3) with rod-shaped structure was synthesized using solvothermal method at room temperature. The synthesized sample was further annealed at different temperatures. The annealed samples were characterized by various experimental techniques. Above 573 K, the hexagonal phase of MoO3 is transformed to orthorhombic (α-MoO3) along with the significant structural modifications (rod to sheet). The structural transformation induces defects, mainly oxygen vacancies, in the α-MoO3. The α-MoO3 may be formed due to the temperature-induced association and dissociation processes with the time. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of all the samples were done. The sample annealed at 673 K shows highest specific capacitance with the low value of charge transfer resistance along with good cycling stability. The better CV results of the sample annealed at 673 K were explained in terms of oxygen vacancies induced highly porous structure of α-MoO3 compared to the other samples. The presence of abundant active sites at the surface and defects present inside the α-MoO3 have made it as a better electrode material for its application in the field of energy storage devices.
