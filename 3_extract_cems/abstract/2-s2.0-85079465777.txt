In this work, we present the synthesis of a ternary CeO2-SnO2/rGO nanocomposite by using a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized composite was structural, chemical, morphological, elemental information studied by using different characterization techniques X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The CeO2-SnO2/rGO exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 156Fg-1 at 0.5A/g in the presence of 3 M KOH solution. The synergic effect of CeO2, SnO2 and graphene composite coated on Ni foam endowed a high specific capacitance than their individual compounds. This work suggests that the novel ternary composite is a promising candidate for the high performance electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.
