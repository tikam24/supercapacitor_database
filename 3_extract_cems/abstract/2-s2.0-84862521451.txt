A novel template-free approach to prepare nitrogen-doped hollow carbon microspheres with graphitic carbon shells (NHGCSs) was reported. The obtained NHGCSs by the direct pyrolysis of solid melamine-formaldehyde (MF) resin spheres exhibit excellent capacitance performance. The specific capacitance reaches 306 F g -1 at a current density of 0.1 A g -1 (in 2 M H 2SO 4), and remains as high as 230 F g -1 even at a high current density of 3 A g -1, which indicates the optimistic prospects for using NHGCSs as supercapacitor electrode materials.
