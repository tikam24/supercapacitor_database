Here we report the fabrication of high conductive and large surface-area 3D pillar graphene nanostructures (PGN) films from assembly of vertically aligned CNT pillars on flexible copper foils and directly employed for the application in electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) supercapacitor. The fabricated supercapacitor based on PGN films with excellent mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity has high energy storage capability. The PGN films which were one-step synthesized on flexible copper foil (25 um) by CVD process exhibit high conductivity with sheet resistance as low as 1.6 ohm per square and high mechanical flexibility. The fabricated EDLC supercapacitor based on high surface-area PGN electrodes (563m2/g) shows high performance with high specific capacitance of 330F/g and energy density as high as 45.8Wh/kg. All of these make this 3D graphene/CNTs hybrid carbon nanostructures highly attractive material for high performance supercapacitor and other energy storage material. Â© 2011 IEEE.
