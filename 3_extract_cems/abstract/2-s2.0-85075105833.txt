The effects of annealing on copper (II) oxide/sodium alginate (CuO/Alg) bionanocomposite synthesized via simple sol-gel method are investigated by using x-ray diffraction technique, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy and dielectric measurements. In order to understand the role of growth conditions on the resultant composite material, we found that the most substantial changes in structure from rod-like hexagonal shape to sheet-like structure and in electrical and optical properties occurred at a temperature higher than 400°C. The results of dielectric measurement indicate that the parameters ϵ′, ϵ″, tan δ and σ ac are decreasing with the increase in frequency; whereas these parameters increase with the increase in temperature. It was also observed that the size of nanoparticles is varying at different concentration of sodium alginate. So, the CuO/Alg bionanocomposite is better dielectric material with high optical band gap value, lower dielectric loss than pristine CuO nanoparticles and could be a better alternative in various fields of electronic applications like in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitor as well as semiconductor devices and in sensors also.
