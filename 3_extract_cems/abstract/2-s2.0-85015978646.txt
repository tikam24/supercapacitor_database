Researchers report the synthesis of novel 3D porous SnS/S-doped G hybrid nanoarchitectures (SnS/S-G HNAs) and their application for flexible, all-solid-state SCs. The synthesis is based on controllable thermal conversion of pre-synthesized mixed-phase SnS2-SnS nanodisks that capped by oleylamine (OLA) molecules. By utilizing the promotion effect of SnS2 component for carbonization of OLA molecules along with doping of S, and the phase transition and thermal stress to drive the assembly of in situ formed SnS/S-G hybrid nanosheets, the desirable 3D porous SnS/SG HNAs with the average pore size of about 3.9 nm can be easily obtained.
