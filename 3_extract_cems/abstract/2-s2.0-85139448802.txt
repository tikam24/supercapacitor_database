Ni1-xSrxCo2O4-δ nanoparticles were prepared by a simple one pot chemical synthesis route. From XRD data, the samples were indexed to the spinel cubic (FCC) structure. From FTIR data, the presence of metal-oxygen bond in the samples was confirmed. The presence of major nano- and few micron-sized particles was confirmed by particle size and SEM analysis. The electrochemical performance of the materials was studied by cyclic voltammetry technique in 6 M KOH at different scan rates (10–100 mV). Ni0.90Sr0.10Co2O4-δ resulted in high capacitance value (72.24 Fg−1 at 10 mV s−1). Hence, nickel cobaltite electrode may be useful in supercapacitors.
