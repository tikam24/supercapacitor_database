Electric motorcycles use a battery storage system and a controlled inverter (motor drive) to drive the wheels. Given that the sale of electric motorcycles is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, the aim of this research is to add a supercapacitor storage system to this simple network in order to extend the autonomy of the motorcycle. This paper analyzes and demonstrates the benefits of two different structures for adding a supercapacitor bank to a lithium-ion battery pack: a passive filter and a buffer for the battery. The advantages of each structure are presented and design guidelines are provided. In addition, we propose a synthetic inductor filter typology based on the two analyzed structures in order to increase the autonomy of the motorcycle. Simulations and experimental results using real data validate the analysis. This paper then uses real data extracted from an electric motorcycle to compare the four topologies: batteries only, the passive filter, the buffer, and the synthetic inductor semi-active hybrid storage system. The comparison shows that battery capacity is extended up to 7.8% with a smoother current profile. However, due to the losses from the added converter in cascade, the net capacity of the whole system is extended only up to 3.7%. Therefore, improvements in the dc/dc converter can further increase the entire system capacity.
