Tri-generation (electricity, heating, cooling) describes all energy generation systems that utilise recoverable waste heat for space heating, cooling, and domestic hot water purposes. Tri-generation is broadly considered as an alternative for the world to meet and solve energy-related problems, such as increase in energy demands and costs, energy supply security, and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse research on how to implement and utilise tri-generation system efficiently and effectively is booming at present. However, it is rarely reported in terms of the important relationship between efficiency improvement of tri-generation system and the reasonable utilisation of electrical energy in it. This paper discussed the reasons why the hybrid energy storage (HES) should be integrated into tri-generation system to promote its performance. And then an initial investigation of HES was carried out where, novel electrical storage components were employed to facilitate energy storage system which is regarded as a crucial part of tri-generation system. Furthermore, the performance of electrical energy storage and power supply subsystem was tested both in initial experimentation and simulation. The fact verified that innovative HES can promote the dynamics and improve the efficiency of tri-generation.
