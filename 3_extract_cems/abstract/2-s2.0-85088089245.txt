The growing demands for wearable, portable, and flexible textile electronics have attracted enormous attention in this field and technology. Herein, we put forward a controllable method of microfluidic fabrication strategy to synthesize superconductive carbon black/graphene composite fibers (SCB/GFs). The SCB/GFs demonstrate large specific surface areas (296.236 m2 g−1, average pore size of 2.6 nm), high electrical conductivity (22316 S m−1), and good mechanical flexibility. Moreover, a flexible supercapacitor (CGSC) assembled by SCB/GFs is successfully manufactured. As expected, the CGSCs display outstanding electrochemical performances, including large specific capacitance (volume capacitance, 176.6 F cm−3, mass capacitance, 241.8 F g−1), high energy densities (5.6 mWh cm−3), and superior long-period cyclic stability (92.6% retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles). Based on these excellent performance, we further employ the assembled CGSCs coated with organic ionic liquid electrolyte (EMIMBF4/PVDF/DMF) to power an electronic timer and some light emission diode lamps when it is completely charged, exhibiting the enormous capability as highly effective electrode materials for energy storage devices.
