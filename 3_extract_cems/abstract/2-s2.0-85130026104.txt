Recently, flexible supercapacitor attracted attention in lightweight and portable electronic devices due to its superior power density, lower weight and flexibility and excellent lifecycles. Flexible supercapacitor (FS) incorporates electrodes or substrate on which active mass deposited has characteristic flexibility which will combine excellent electrochemical performance with structural flexibility. Flexible supercapacitor can use faradaic mechanism for energy storage as seen in pseudocapacitor or non-faradaic process seen in electric double layer capacitor. This chapter focuses on different new generation materials used for flexible supercapacitor electrode. It also covers future direction in developing new material exhibiting superior electrochemical performance to predict future trends towards realization of applicability in practical applications.
