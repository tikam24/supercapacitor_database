Hydrogen-based electric vehicles are an important application of clean energy generation and storage systems. Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FHEVs) are gaining tremendous popularity as they address both the issues; CO2 emission and fuel economy crisis. FHEV under consideration consists of three sources which are fuel cell, supercapacitor and battery. Fuel cell acts as the main source, while the other two as auxiliary sources connected to the DC bus via DC–DC converters. In this paper, supertwisting sliding mode control based nonlinear controller has been designed for the hybrid energy storage system of FHEV. Moreover, fuzzy logic-based energy management unit has been implemented with proposed control design for the reduction of hydrogen consumption by utilizing maximum state of charge of battery and supercapacitor. The global stability of the system has been ensured by Lyapunov based analysis and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink® (2019a). A comparison of hydrogen fuel consumption with existing FHEVs in the literature reveals that the proposed approach successfully reduced the hydrogen fuel consumption by 29%. A robustness test has also been conducted which validates the immunity of the proposed controller to external as well as internal parametric variations. Lastly, controller hardware-in-the loop experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
