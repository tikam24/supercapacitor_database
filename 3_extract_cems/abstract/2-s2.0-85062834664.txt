The hybrid power supply of super capacitor of lithium ion battery combines the advantages of high specific energy of lithium ion battery and high power density of super capacitor, but whether the power distribution scheme is reasonable or not will directly affect the climbing of vehicle during driving. Acceleration time and energy consumption. In this paper, through fuzzy control strategy, two fuzzy controllers are set up to participate in power distribution, and the simulation results are verified under the standard operating conditions, which can effectively reduce the driving energy consumption of pure electric vehicles. The control strategy of this scheme is simple and easy to be realized in engineering.
