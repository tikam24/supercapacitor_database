This paper presents a design of electric vehicle (EV) hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator of battery and supercapacitor hybrid storage system. The EV HIL simulator in this paper uses 2 DC machines and load, where 1 DC machine functions as a motor and 1 DC machine functions as a generator, while the load is used as a load on the generator. The power sharing method used in this paper is filter based control (FBC). The reference or set point used is power, so the error between the reference power and the actual power is controlled by the proportional controller. In this paper also, to equalize the output voltage of each converter with different input voltages, the PWM signal on the supercapacitor converter is multiplied by the gain. There are 2 scenarios presented to see the performance of the designs that have been made, namely no regenerative braking programmed and with regenerative braking programmed. There are 3 conditions seen in the results of the simulator implementation, namely when starting, deceleration and acceleration to see the performance of the power sharing method used. The results show that the simulator that has been designed with the power sharing method used has a very good performance.
