A new energy storage material based on molybdate active species has been presented. Molybdenum seems to be a perspective material in supercapacitors because of numerous possible metal oxidation states, electrolyte storage by means of various chemical reactions and availability in comparison to other refractory metals. Material synthesized within this research was composed of reduced graphene oxide matrix and peroxomolybdate(VI)–citrate active dimers. It was showed that peroxomolybdate(VI)–citrate structure enhanced electrochemical activity of symmetric supercapacitor. Simple methodology was used to synthesize a composite with pH adjustment as the key step. The specific capacity calculated from galvanostatic charge/discharge curves was as high as 250 F/g. Material was distinguished by good cyclability with 5% capacity loss after 1000 cycles. The increase in charge transfer resistance, induced by metal–oxygen compound within the carbon matrix was relatively low, compared to parent reduced graphene oxide. Amorphous structure of peroxomolybdate(VI)-modified material was observed with slight increase in the interlayer distance in comparison to parent reduced graphene oxide. The height and lateral size of crystallites were also determined. Significant decrease in the specific surface area of peroxomolybdate(VI)-modified composite was observed, in comparison to the parent reduced graphene oxide.
