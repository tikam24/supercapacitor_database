Regarding PMSG-based wind turbine generation system, this paper proposes a supercapacitor energy storage unit (SCESU) which is connected in parallel with the DC-link of the back-to-back converter to enhance its high voltage ride through performance. The analysis of the operation and control for the grid-side converter and SCESU are conducted. Based on real time digital simulators (RTDS), a model and a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) platform of PMSG-based wind turbine with SCESU is developed, and the simulation results show that the SCESU absorbs the imbalanced energy and the grid-side converter absorbs inductive reactive power during the period of voltage swell and verify the correctness and feasibility of the high voltage ride through control strategy.
