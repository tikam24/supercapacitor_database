In order to maintain the balance between generation and demand, coordination of intermittency, voltage and frequency regulation and increment in quality of power an Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) proves to be a viable solution. The concept of hybridizing two or more ESS to form a Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESSs) is beneficial in achieving the desired performance by combination of suitable characteristics of various technologies. So, a Battery and Super-Capacitor based HESS with a Bidirectional Buck/Boost Converter (B3C) has been proposed in this paper. The main objective is to develop a controller which controls the current flow and energy loss of the Battery and the SC respectively. In concern with the above two objectives, this paper presents a novel Thermal Exchange Optimization (TEO) technique which dynamically tunes the PI control parameters. Further it is seen that the efficiency of power delivering and life span of the Battery as well as storing capability of the SC is enhanced. The system architecture is designed using the Matlab/Simulink software and is led to a fault to test the efficacy of the proposed controller. The results of the classical PI controller and TEO tuned PI controller with and without HESS are compared. To justify the improvement of system oscillations by the proposed controller, the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) for each case had been carried out.
