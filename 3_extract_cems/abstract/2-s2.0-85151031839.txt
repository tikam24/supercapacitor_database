Reduced graphene (RGO) has garnered substantial attention due to its specific surface area and electrical conductivity as a material for cathodes. However, RGO cannot meet the demand for new energy because of its low capacitance, which has the problem of RGO lamellar agglomeration. Herein, MnO2@MoS2/RGO electrode material composite is prepared by using MoS2/RGO as the conductive substrate and MnO2 as the active substance particles. Electrochemical performance tests showed that the MnO2@MoS2/RGO composite electrode has excellent specific capacitance and stable cyclic stability. The prepared nanocomposite material has a capacitance of 743 F g−1 of 1 A g−1, which is greater than that of MnO2 (102 F g−1). Specific energy and specific power were 31.22 Whkg−1 and 362.51 Wkg−1 of the MnO2@MoS2/RGO material. The cycle stability reaches 88.5 % after 5000 cycles. Due to its excellent electrochemical properties, it has become a hot subject in the research of materials for supercapacitor electrodes.
