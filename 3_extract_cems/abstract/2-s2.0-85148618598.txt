Remarkable improvement in the polarization and charge transport at the solid–solid electrode–electrolyte interface due to the incorporation of a redox-active additive sodium molybdate (Na2MoO4) is demonstrated. The presence of the electrochemically active oxide center along with Na+ facilitates the hopping-based charge transport of the ionic liquid leading to higher ionic conductivity and a twofold increase in specific capacitance (0.009 to 0.018 F cm−2). This drives a 200% increase in the energy density (0.76–1.7 µW h cm−2) and a 2.5 times improvement in the rate capability (10 000 mV s−1) of the solid-state supercapacitor. Importantly, the power density, non-Faradic nature, and cyclability remain unaltered, resulting in performance exceeding several solid-state and liquid electrolyte-based supercapacitors. Thus, the results established here through the use of redox-active additive establish the robustness of the approach and practicality of the resulting device besides providing transformative opportunities in tuning the performance of solid-state devices.
