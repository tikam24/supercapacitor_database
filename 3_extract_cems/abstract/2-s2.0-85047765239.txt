Electrospinning is a promising technique for producing ultrafine fibers of a large variety of one-dimensional materials that can be assembled into nonwoven architectures useful for various smart technologies and lightweight applications such as wearable and flexible electronics, lightweight batteries, and high-surface area substrates for catalysis and sensing. Self-integration of electrospun fibers into webs and yarns not only enhances their functionality but also opens new innovative directions ranging from energy and environment applications to regenerative medicine. This chapter presents a comprehensive account on the processing of single-phase and composite nanofibers and their manifold applications in batteries, supercapacitors, transparent conducting materials, photovoltaics, as well as solar fuels. Using multinozzle approaches in electrospinning, heterojunctions and sophisticated 3D architectures at the nanoscale can be achieved in a single process step by engineering the spinnerets and fiber collectors. Given its modular nature and variability of precursor chemistry, electrospinning enables scaled-up production of micro- and nanofibers at reasonable cost and represents a promising fabrication method for integrating functional nanomaterials into devices. Nanofibrous meshes of carbon, metal, metal oxide, and their mixtures have been obtained in different geometries such as coreâ€“shell, Janus-type fibers, and yarns to demonstrate the possibility of net shaping at the nanoscale and possible conversion of interconnected 1D networks into 3D structures. The insufficient strength of nanofiber meshes can be reinforced through infiltration of a secondary phase that also decreases the intrinsic porosity of electrospun mats thereby offering new experimental space to create multimaterial junctions and bulk heterostructures. The chapter also alludes to the future trends and existing challenges of shape control and retention of flexible and fibrous structure after heat treatment that is often mandatory to obtain crystalline materials.
