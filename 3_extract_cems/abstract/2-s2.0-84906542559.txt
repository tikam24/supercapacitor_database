In this work, a facile electrochemical approach for depositing Gd-doped CeOx nanoflowers on porous carbon foam with excellent supercapacitor characteristics has been demonstrated. Moreover, the ultraviolet illumination on the electrodeposited nanoflowers significantly enhances the device supercapacitor performances as compared to thermally treated samples. Based on the experimental results in the present study, a new process to improve the surface character and electrochemical properties of the electrode material via UV light irradiation has been proposed.
