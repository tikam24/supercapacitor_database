The fabrication of sulfide/graphene composites is an important strategy to improve the performance of supercapacitors. It is still a challenge to synthesize three-dimensional sulfide/graphene nanostructures with special morphologies and structures because it is difficult to realize the effective arrangement of graphene. In this work, a simple method has been successfully developed for the fabrication of three-dimensional NiS2/graphene nanostructures. The rod-like morphology of the precursors is preserved during the carbonization and sulfurization process. The carbonization temperature can affect the size of NiS2 nanoparticles formed in the nanostructures. The as-obtained materials can serve as electrode materials in supercapacitors and present excellent electrochemical behavior due to their good electrical conductivity and unique structures.
