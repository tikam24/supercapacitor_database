Three dimensional (3D) carbon nanofibers (CNFs) /Co3O4-polyaniline (PANI) composites have been successfully prepared by simple hydrothermal reaction and electropolymerization steps. And the electrochemical performances of the composites have been characterized in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution electrolyte. The CNFs/Co3O4-PANI composites exhibited high specific capacitances of 770 F/g at 1A/g and 200 F/g at 20 A/g. Moreover the composites showed excellent cycling stability, their capacitance retained 85.3% at 2 A/g for 1000 cycles. The results showed that the CNFs/Co3O4-PANI composites are potential electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors.
