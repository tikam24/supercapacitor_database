In this work, bacterial cellulose (BC)-based polymer derived from a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY) are optimized as both electrodes and electrolytes to fabricate a flexible and free-standing supercapacitor. BC is a multifunction and versatile polymer. Montmorillonite (MMT) and sodium bromide (NaBr) are used to improve mechanical strength and as the ionic source, respectively. From XRD analysis, it is found that the addition of MMT and NaBr has reduced the crystallinity of the electrolyte. Most interaction within the electrolyte happens in the region of the OH band, as verified using FTIR analysis. A maximum room temperature conductivity of (1.09 ± 0.02) × 10−3 S/cm is achieved with 30 wt.% NaBr. The highest conducting SCOBY-based electrolytes have a decompose voltage and ionic transference number of 1.48 V and 0.97, respectively. The multiwalled carbon nanotube is employed as the active material held by the fibrous network of BC. Cyclic voltammetry shows a rectangular shape CV plot with the absence of a redox peak. The supercapacitor is charged and discharged in a zig-zag-shaped Perspex plate for 1000 cycles with a decent performance.
