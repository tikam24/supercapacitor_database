This article highlights the study and analysis of supercapacitors as an innovative contribution in the development of electronics and its applications in the modern world. It also includes the operating principle of supercapacitors and details all its generalities and particularities; In the same way the document makes a comparison between the supercapacitors and the conventional capacitors, a model of hybrid power supply is used for the purpose between an EDLC supercapacitor and a conventional battery, with the integration of DC-DC converters and a block power limiter, in order to evaluate the contribution of the transitory power given by the block of supercapacitors EDLC and specify the performance of this type of electrical components, the development of the model was made by the software based on the simulation 'Matlab', which presents favorable results, fully adjusting to the desired load profile, analyzed in the present study case, with all the considerations of the implements associated with the proposed hybrid model, for the practical study of supercapacitors.
