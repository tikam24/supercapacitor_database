A facile method was successfully established to construct 3D conductive network-based free-standing polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube ternary hybrid film, in which a 3D conductive network was synergistically assembled by MWNTs and GO. The synergistic assembly of carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide not only increased the basal spacing between graphene sheets but also effectively bridged the defects of reduced graphene oxide to form a 3D conductive network. Due to the 3D conductive network with high conductivity and the synergistic effect of polyaniline with carbon nanotubes and graphene, the as-prepared ternary hybrid film possessed high specific capacitance and good cycle stability as a flexible supercapacitor electrode. This study gives a better insight for the preparation of functional flexible hybrid film by combining conducting polymer with carbon materials of different dimensions.
