An efficient and easy method is described which allows modification of supported nanocarbon films with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from an aqueous colloidal suspension. Subsequently CNTs can be decorated with Pt-nanoparticles directly from an aqueous solution of Pt ions without the need for reducing agents. High performance supercapacitors and electrocatalysts are obtained.
