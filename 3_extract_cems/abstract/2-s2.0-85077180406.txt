This paper presented the stability of using switched capacitor converter (SCC) topology with cells equalization for battery and ultracapacitor (UC) modules in hybrid energy storage systems (ESS's). The main advantage of using SCCs for Electric vehicle and plug- in hybrid electric vehicle (EV/PHEV) energy management is the absence of transformers and inductors, low electromagnetic interference (EMI), reduce size and cost of energy ESS and simple and easy control strategy.
