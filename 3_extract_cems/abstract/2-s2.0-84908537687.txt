Polypyrrole (PPy) has been polymerized onto reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube (rGO/CNT) to form an rGO/CNT/PPy composite using the chemical oxidation method. The electrochemical characteristics of the above composite in various aqueous electrolytes are systematically compared for the asymmetric supercapacitor application. The electrochemical characteristics of rGO/CNT/PPy in the electrolytes containing K+ show improved reversibility and higher stability. Introducing XC-72 in preparing the electrode has been found to enhance the specific capacitance and the cycle stability of rGO/CNT/PPy. The charge storage stability of rGO/CNT/PPy + XC-72 in various potential windows has been evaluated through the potential bias stress test. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with a positive electrode of Mn3O4 and a negative electrode of rGO/CNT/PPy + XC-72 is successfully demonstrated, which shows specific energy and power of 14.Wh kg-1 and 6.62 kW kg-1 with a cell voltage of 1.6 V. This ASC with a cell voltage of 1.6 V shows excellent charge-discharge cycle stability and ideal capacitive behavior in NaNO3 even after the application of 3250 charge-discharge cycles.
