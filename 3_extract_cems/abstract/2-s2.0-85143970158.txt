The hierarchically porous carbon/polyaniline electrodes derived from the nonmetallic part of waste printed circuit board have been synthesized by a convenient carbonization and activation method. A detailed analysis of the morphology, structure, and electrochemical performances of as-prepared composites is presented. As expected, the balanced specific surface area and porous structure manifest their remarkable electrochemical performances. Apparently, the multiple synergistic effects are crucial to simultaneously achieving high capacity and significantly increased stability. As a result, the electrodes display exceptional rate capability, superior cyclic stability, and high specific capacitance (520.0 F/g at 1 A/g). Furthermore, the asymmetrical device possesses an improved energy density of 9.3 Wh/kg with a power density of 62.4 W/kg in H2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, a potential mechanism contributing to the superior performance of hierarchically porous carbon/polyaniline composites has been studied in detail. Noteworthy, this study provides a feasible strategy for recycling waste printed circuit boards. Importantly, this approach will provide a path toward the rational synthesis and design of electrode materials for supercapacitors that take both high-performance and cost-effective into account.
