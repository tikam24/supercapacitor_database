A hybrid aqueous electrochemical supercapacitor technology was studied in which lithium-ion intercalated compound LiMn2O4 was used as an anode and active carbon as a cathode in a Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The mechanism of this system is similar to that of lithium ion batteries. In essence, this is a special kind of lithium-ion battery. The ratio of anode mass to cathode mass were optimized according to the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors with diferrent ratio of anode mass to cathode mass. The electrochemical performance in different current concentrations with different electrolyte concentrations was investigated. It was found that the high current performance of supercapacitor was obviously improved when electrolyte concentrations was increased. It was also noticed that the augmentation of polarization resistance will greatly reduce the discharge voltage flat. Experiment data indicate that this system exhibit high energy density and power density and maintain nice circulation performance.
