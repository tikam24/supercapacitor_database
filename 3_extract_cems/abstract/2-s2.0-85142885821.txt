Pure, zinc and vanadium-doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were synthesized through non-aqueous sol–gel route for the application of electrode materials in supercapacitors. XRD analysis ensures that all the samples are in single anatase phase with high crystallinity. FTIR, Raman spectra confirmed the functional groups which are related to the synthesized samples. SEM images showed monodispersed, well-defined, and uniform particle morphology of all the samples. HR-TEM image and SAED were evident for the uniform particle size distribution with phase purity of TiO2 anatase. The electrochemical performance was studied for the synthesized electrode material using cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge, and cyclic stability. The electrochemical measurement reveals that the synthesized electrode materials exhibit good capacitive behavior with good rate capability. The specific capacitance was found to be maximum about 513 F/g at current density of 4 A/g for the vanadium-doped TiO2 electrode material which was comparatively higher than pure zinc-doped TiO2 electrode materials.
