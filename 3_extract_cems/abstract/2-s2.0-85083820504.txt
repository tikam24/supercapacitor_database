Herein, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on PANI@CNT-graphene//NiCo2O4@N-C exhibits high specific energy densities and excellent mechanical stability, with ~90% capacity retention after 5000 continuous cycles at the current of 1 mA. The structural design and the synthesis approach is general and can be extended to synthesize a broad range of materials.
