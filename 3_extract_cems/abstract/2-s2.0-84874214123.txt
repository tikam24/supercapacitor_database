To improve the electrical conductivity of MnO2, the composite material of mesoporous carbon and MnO2 was synthesized. The mesoporous carbon was prepared by a polymerization-induced colloid aggregation method (PICA) using melamine formaldehyde resin as the carbon precursor and fumed silica (14 nm) as a hard template. The composite of mesoporous carbon and MnO2 was prepared by a redox reaction between KMnO4 and oxygen on the surface of carbon. The synthesized mesoporous carbon has a high specific surface area (~ 1500 m2g-1) and an average pore size as large as 7 nm. Electrochemical properties of the mesoporous carbon-MnO2 composite were elucidated by cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic charge-discharge in 1. 0 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. A specific capacitance of 128 Fg-1 was obtained at a current density of 0. 1 Ag-1.
