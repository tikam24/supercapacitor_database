Herein, we manufactured the positive and negative electrodes for the hybrid capacitor. The Mn-doped High surface area of Activated carbon composite used for the positive electrode and as-prepared composite was calcined at 600 °C and 800 °C. The morphological structures and pore-size distributions of MnYP-600HTT and MnYP-800HTT were characterized by means of XRD, SEM, EDAX, TEM, and BET. According to the BET specific surface-area evaluation, MnYP-600HTT and MnYP-800HTT were 1272.6 and 1388.1 m2/g, respectively. Total pore volumes were 0.627 and 0.687 cm3/g, which is beneficial for forming ion-transport channels in electrochemical reactions. The MnYP-600HTT electrode had a high specific capacity of 177.2 mAh/g at 20C, and the capacity retention was 64.8%. During the entire cycling, MnYP-600HTT had excellent cyclic stability in 500 cycles along with high efficiency. The robust design of the MnYP-600HTT and MnYP-800HTT cathode materials introduced in this work pave the way for designing next-generation supercapacitors operating at ultra-high C rates. The Mn-doped high surface of activated carbon had stable energy density and superior cycling stability that were demonstrated in supercapacitor systems.
