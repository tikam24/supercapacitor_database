Schiff base polymers having two different structures are synthesized by condensation polymerization using 4,4′-diamino diphenylamine sulfate hydrate with terephthalaldehyde and 2,4,6-Tris(p-formylphenoxy)-1,3,5-triazine (TRIPOD), named as COP-1 and COP-2. Nature of structural arrangement is studied using FT-IR and powder XRD techniques. The thermal stability of polymers is up to 250 °C, confirmed by TGA. SEM analysis of COP-1and COP-2 shows flaky, leaf veins and sheet like morphology. The calculated maximum areal capacitance values for both the COP-1 and COP-2, are 695 mF/cm2 and 771 mF/cm2 respectively at the applied current density of 1 mA cm−2. COP-2 has shown higher capacitance than COP-1 due to high content of nitrogen present in the polymer. The polymer coated nickel foam electrode exhibits substantial cyclic stability up to 1000 cycles, carried out at 20 mA cm−2.
