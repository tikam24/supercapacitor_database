A next-generation technology, the Supercapacitor, has emerged with the potential to enable significant advances in energy storage. The fundamental phenomenon and equations for conventional capacitors and supercapacitors are the same. But the improved efficacy of supercapacitors over conventional capacitors is due to the larger surface area of the electrode and thinner dielectrics. The existing review addresses a brief overview of the history, principles, and theory of operation of supercapacitors, along with various models, and significantly in current energy saving and storage. Here, a concise description of technologies and working principles of different materials utilized for supercapacitors has been provided. The main focus has been on materials like carbon-based nanomaterials, metal oxides, and conducting polymers. The performance of nanocomposites has been analyzed by parameters like energy, capacitance, power, cyclic performance, and rate capability. The use of supercapacitors in various applications is cited, and their advantages over alternative technologies are considered. Also, it comprises efficient techniques to minimize multi-response problems such as the fabrication of supercapacitors and storage capacity size, etc. This review embedded the current progress achieved in innovative materials for supercapacitor electrodes.
