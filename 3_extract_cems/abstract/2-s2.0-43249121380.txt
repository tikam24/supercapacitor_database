The working of a hybrid battery, generated by integrating a fuel cell with a battery, supercapacitor, or other power storage device, as power source and its portable applications are discussed. The power path management of the hybrid power source (HPS) consisting of a combination of a fuel cell and a battery, must be controlled in order to ensure that the system load meets the end users demands. The system can be monitored standard fuel gauge that provides data based on voltage, current, temperature, and state-of-charge. The fuel available in fuel cell and the average efficiency of the fuel cell are factored into available energy, for the monitoring process. The power controller performs the functions of managing the use of the battery and maximizing its capabilities over the expected lifetime of the HPS. As a result the optimal level of the peak available energy and maximum usability of the state-of-charge battery is ensured.
