A novel class of electrochemical supercapacitors electrode material has been synthesized using temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) CoMoO4 precursors prepared using a mixture of an aqueous solution of Co(NO 3)·6H2O and (NH4)6Mo 7O24·4H2O with ammonia. This material was physically and chemically characterized by X-ray diffraction microscopy (XRD), scanning electron microcopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV characterization indicated fast kinetics for charge-discharge process as well as good kinetic reversibility. The material provided 109.9 F g-1 specific capacitance over a potential window of about -0.25 ± 0.55 V versus saturation calomel reference electrode (versus SCE) in aqueous electrolyte. It is, therefore, a possible candidate as material applicable for electrochemical supercapacitors electrode. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
