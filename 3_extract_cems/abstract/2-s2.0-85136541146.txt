This paper reports the successful synthesis of mesoporous carbon/titanium dioxide (MC/TiO2) composite electrodes via the hydrothermal method for supercapacitor (SC) applications. The morphology and structural properties of MC/TiO2 composites were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR). The electrochemical properties were recorded by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) with an electrolyte (6 M KOH) in symmetric/asymmetric configuration. The specific capacitance (Cs) evaluated by CV is about 280F/g for composite electrode (95 % capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) and pristine has 150F/g @ 10 mV/s. Enhancement in capacitance is owing to faster charge dynamics within electrode material. The fabricated asymmetric device demonstrates high energy density (30.31 Wh/kg), than the symmetric configuration (âˆ¼27 Wh/kg). Finally, both symmetric/asymmetric supercapacitors have illuminated a red LED, and strengthens the candidature of composite electrode for energy storage technology.
