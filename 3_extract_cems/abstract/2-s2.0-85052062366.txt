Modern hybrid power systems, which combine conventional and renewable power conversion systems, are characterized by extensive system interconnections and increasing dependence on control for optimum utilization of existing resources, especially photovoltaic and wind energy, are the best solution for feeding the mini-grids and isolated loads in remote areas. The supply of reliable and economic electric energy is a major concern of industrial progress and consequent rise in the standard of living. Properly chosen renewable power sources will considerably reduce the need for fossil fuel leading to an increase in the sustainability of the power supply. At the same time, conventional power sources aide the renewable sources in hard environmental conditions, which improve the reliability and stability of the electrical system. The increasing demand for electric power coupled with resources and environmental constraints pose several challenges to system planners. With deregulation of power supply utilities there is a tendency to view the power networks as highways for transmitting electric power from wherever it is available to places where required, depending on the pricing that varies with time of the day. A stand-alone hybrid power system is proposed in this work. The MPPT control of solar Power system (SPS) is achieved by perturbation and observation method and the TSR control method was used for implementing MPPT control of WECS and field oriented mechanism of MSC control system enabling the WECS to extract optimum energy, while the LSC of both the RESâ€™s uses synchronous VSI control system. The dynamic performance of a stand-alone wind-solar system with battery storage was analyzed. MATLAB/SIMULINK was used to build the model and simulate the system.
