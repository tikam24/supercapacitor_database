Core-shell electrodes composed of highly porous honeycomb manganese oxide@carbon fibers (HMO@CFs) are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal approach involving an in situ redox replacement reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and carbon fibers. In this reaction, the carbon fibers serve as not only a sacrificial reductant, but also the substrate. The porous HMO@CFs core-shell nanocables deliver remarkable electrochemical performance with a high capacitance (295.24Fg-1 at 100mAg-1), high good rate capability, and superior cycling stability (about 96.4% specific capacitance retained after 3000 cycles). The maximum energy density of 22.2Whkg-1 (at a power density of 400Wkg-1) and power density of 12,000Wkg-1 (at an energy density of 10Whkg-1) can be achieved at an operating voltage of 1.6V. The fabrication method is simple, cost-effective, and readily scalable thereby having large commercial potential.
