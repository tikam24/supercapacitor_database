The magnesium/cobalt ternary oxide, porous MgCo2O4 nanostructures were synthesized by thermal decomposition of crystalline bimetallic coordination polymer precursors. As a result, various hydrothermal reaction time results in isostructural precursors with different crystallinity. When the pyrolysis temperature and binder are chose to be 500°C and PTFE respectively, the superior practical capacitance with good energy delivery efficiency (η) is obtained. The corresponding MgCo2O4 electrode with high surface area and moderate crystallinity achieves a largest specific capacitance of 348 F.g-1, maximum η value (92.9%) and 93.7% of capacitance retention after 1 000 continuous charge-discharge cycles.
