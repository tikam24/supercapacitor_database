Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) by combines the virtues of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitor have received intensive attention owing to their preeminent energy density, outstanding power density and uncompromised cycle life. However, the practical application of LICs has been greatly hampered by the lack of efficient anode materials. Herein, a facile strategy including hydrothermal reaction and subsequent thermal calcination has been carefully designed for constructing MnO porous spheres with a N-doped carbon coated layer (MnO@N-C). The resultant MnO@N-C electrode delivers a high capacity of 903 mA h g−1 and excellent cyclic performance with 96.2% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled MnO@N-C//AC LICs displays an excellent energy density of 125.3 Wh kg−1 and superior power density of 19.9 KW kg−1, as well as long cyclic lifetime of 5000 cycles with 83.2% capacity retention, outperforming those of recently reported metal oxide based LICs.
