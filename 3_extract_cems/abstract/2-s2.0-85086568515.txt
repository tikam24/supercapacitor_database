In the present work, the ionic resistance in the activated carbon (AC) electrode and blend polymer electrolyte (BPE) interface is reduced by tuning binder and BPE. A unique microcannulars channel connecting AC, binder and gaur gum (GG)/polyvinylalcohol (PVA) electrolyte is developed for easy Li+ movement. The use of AC derived from areca nut and natural GG as a binder makes the developed method more environmentally sustainable. The presence of microcannular structures on the electrode surface and BPE was confirmed using SEM and TEM analysis. Combined DSC-TGA data for BPE showed that PVA provides the mechanical support to jelly guar gum. The ionic conductivity, activation energy, dielectric studies were studied to understand the electrode/electrolyte interface mechanism. Dielectric studies revealed that the unique pathway of microcannular structures reduces the charge transfer resistance significantly at the interface. Optimized BPE was used in the fabrication of supercapacitor and specific capacitance was found to be 542 Fg-1. The time constant was 0.4 s and showed consistent cyclic pattern during galvanostatic charge/discharge studies with 99% Columbic efficiency.
