Proton Exchange Membrane-based Hydrogen Fuel Cell (PEMHFC) provides electrical power with zero carbon emission. PEMHFC is an electrochemical implement (like batteries and Supercapacitors) that delivers a dc power supply. The variable load-current stress severely affects the efficiency of and the lifespan of the PEMHFC. In this paper, a PI-based hybrid control system is proposed to regulate the current limit and maintain the voltage level simultaneously for PEMHFC and Supercapacitor-supported hybrid systems during variable load demand. Working of this proposed control approach is first simulated in MATLAB with variable load, and then validated in real-time at OPAL-RT platform.
