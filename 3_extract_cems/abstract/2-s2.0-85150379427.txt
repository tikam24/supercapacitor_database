By employing the sol-gel process and “Mo-doped strontium cobaltite,” such as SrCo0.9 Mo0.1O3−δ (SCM), which has a lot of oxygen vacancies creating a charge storage material. However, a simple hydrothermal approach was used to make a cell SCM@GQDs and “Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs).” The produced SCM@GQDs with increased conductivity have been found to be a promising electrode material for achieving larger energy densities. Through the use of the galvanostatic charge-discharge method for three electrode cells with 6.0 M potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte, the electro-chemical performance of the SCM@GQDs was examined. Due to enhanced conductivity and quicker ion diffusion between working electrodes and electrolyte, the produced electrode material for super-capacitor has a specific capacitance that is higher than GQDs at 0.65 A g−1. These outcomes demonstrate an excellent properties of SCM@GQDs material in the energy storage applications in the specific area of supercapacitors.
