Engineered materials are crucial for the higher efficiency of supercapacitors. Current work presents roughly shaped spherical NiFe2O4 nanoparticles dispersed in the SiO2 matrix NiFe2O4/SiO2 as a newfangled electrode material for supercapacitors with remarkable performance. Designing the NiFe2O4/SiO2 nanostructure with a sol-gel method followed by the Stober method to grow silica has instigated NiFe2O4/SiO2 as dynamic material with higher electrochemical activity. Physicochemical aspects of NiFe2O4/SiO2 nanostructures are evaluated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. The electrochemical activity is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) representing the comparable efficiency and reversibility of the electrode materials. The prepared electrode shows a capacitance of 925 F/g (154.1 mAh/g or 555 C/g) at 1 A/g, with 95.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 20 mA/cm2. The improved electrochemical performance of the NiFe2O4/SiO2 electrode can be subjected to prompt diffusion process provided by NiFe2O4/SiO2 and enhanced redox reactions owing to the high surface area. The mentioned features decrease the total impedance of the electrodes as suggested by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
