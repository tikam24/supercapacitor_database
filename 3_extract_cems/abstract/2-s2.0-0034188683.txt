Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT-PSS), an electronically conductive electroactive polymer, has been blended with an ion conducting polymer, polyethylene oxide (PEO), to increase the ionic mobility in the material. A substantial increase in the current density is observed in the cyclic voltammogram of the PEDOT-PSS, when the latter is blended with PEO. As supercapacitor electrodes, the blends give much higher energy densities at high power densities compared to the pure PEDOT-PSS. This enhancement of electrochemical properties has been ascribed to both intrinsic ionic conductivity of the PEO, and the swelling of the latter in liquid electrolyte solution, creating space for ion movement.
