In this study, the co-precipitation approach was used to make nanostructured nickel oxide (NiO) commencing with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and nickel (II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2-6H2O). Through the use of X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopes (SEM), UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging, structural and optical studies were investigated. FTIR, photoluminescence (PL), cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies are taken. The synthesized nanoparticles were annealed at 300°C and 400°C. The face-centered cubic (FCC) structure of the NiO and highly crystallized nanoparticles were revealed by XRD investigations. Observation of FTIR spectra validated the composition of functional groups. Scanning electron microscopy image shows the average size is 24 nm. NiO optical band gap at 300°C (3.37 eV) and 400°C (2.7 eV) is revealed from UV studies. From CV graph, the sample annealing at 300°C and 400°C the specific capacitance was 543.6 and 519.8 F/g, respectively. This study signifies the supercapacitor application of nanosized metal oxide.
