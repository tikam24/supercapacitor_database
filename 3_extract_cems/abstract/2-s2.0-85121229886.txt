Activated carbon monoliths of kenaf (ACMKs) were prepared by moulding kenaf fibers into a column-shape monolith and then carrying out pyrolysis at 500, 600, 700 or 800 °C, followed by activation with KOH at 700 °C. Then, the sample was characterized using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption instruments. The prepared ACMK was subjected to electrochemical property evaluation via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The GCD study using a three-electrode system showed that the specific capacitance decreased with higher pyrolysis temperature (PYT) with the ACMK pyrolyzed at 500 °C (ACMK-500) exhibiting the highest specific capacitance of 217 F g-1. A two-electrode system provided 95.9% retention upon a 5000 cycle test as well as the specific capacitance of 212 F g-1, being converted to an energy density of 6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 215 W kg-1.
