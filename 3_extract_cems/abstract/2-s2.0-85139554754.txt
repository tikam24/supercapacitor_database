Graphene is a promising active material for electric double layer supercapacitors (EDLCs) due to its high electric conductivity and lightweight nature. However, for practical uses as a power source of electronic devices, a porous structure is advantageous to maximize specific energy density. Here, we propose a facile fabrication approach of mesoporous graphene (m-G), in which self-assembled mesoporous structures of poly(styrene)-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) copolymer (PS-b-P2VP) are exploited as both mesostructured catalytic template and a carbon source. Notably, the mesostructured catalytic template is sufficient to act as a rigid support without structural collapse, while PS-b-P2VP converts to graphene, generating m-G with a pore diameter of ca. 3.5 nm and high specific surface area of 186 m2/g. When the EDLCs were prepared using the obtained m-G and ionic liquids, excellent electrochemical behaviors were achieved even at high operation voltages (0 âˆ¼3.5 V), including a large specific capacitance (130.2 F/g at 0.2 A/g), high-energy density of 55.4 W h/kg at power density of 350 W/kg, and excellent cycle stability (>10,000 cycles). This study demonstrates that m-G is a promising material for high-performance energy storage devices.
