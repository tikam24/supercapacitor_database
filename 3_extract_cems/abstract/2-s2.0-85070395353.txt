Though the utility of manganese compounds such as oxides, sulphides has been well researched in energy storage applications such as super-capacitors and lithium-ion batteries, the utility of manganese nitrides hasn't been reported yet, especially as anode in sodium-ion batteries. In this manuscript we report synthesis of manganese nitride decorated reduced graphene oxide (MnN@rGO) prepared by simple microwave nitridation technique and its utility as anode material in sodium-ion batteries, electrodes in super-capacitors and in EMI shielding applications. In energy storage applications such as sodium ion batteries, MnN@rGO electrodes exhibited sodium storage capacity of 716 mAhg−1 whereas when used as electrodes in super-capacitors, a high capacitance value of 639.2 Fg-1 at scan rates of 10 mVs−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte was achieved. The EMI shielding effectiveness measured in the X-band region of 2–18 GHz was about 30–32 dB which is 300% more than reduced graphene oxide.
