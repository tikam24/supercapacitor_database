Crosslinked poly(ST-co-DVB-co-NaSS) latex nanoparticles (LNPs) with average particle size were used as template to prepare porous carbonized electrospun nanofibers (CENFs) with pore size about 10 nm on the surface and inside by electrospinning and carbonization. The porous CENFs without and with MWCNTs exhibited high specific surface area of 505 and 535 m<sup>2</sup>/g and high mesoporosity percentage of 80% and 84% respectively. The porous CENFs as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> showed a specific capacitance of 235 F/g while the addition of MWCNTs led to an increase to 262 F/g. These free-standing and binder-free mesoporous CENFs with outstanding capacitance could be good candidates as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
