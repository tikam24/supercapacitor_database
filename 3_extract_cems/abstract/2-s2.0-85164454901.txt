Tailor-made carbonaceous-based cathodes with zincophilicity and hydrophilicity are highly desirable for Zn-ion storage applications, but it remains a great challenge to achieve both advantages in the synthesis. In this work, a template electrospinning strategy is developed to synthesize nitrogen and phosphorous co-doped hollow porous carbon nanofibers (N, P-HPCNFs), which deliver a high capacity of 230.7 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, superior rate capability of 131.0 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1, and a maximum energy density of 196.10 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 155.53 W kg−1. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) reveal that the introduced P dopants regulate the distribution of local charge density of carbon materials and therefore facilitate the adsorption of Zn ions due to the increased electronegativity of pyridinic-N. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations indicate that the doped P species induce a series of polar sites and create a hydrophilic microenvironment, which decreases the impedance between the electrode and the electrolyte and therefore accelerates the reaction kinetics. The marriage of ex situ/in situ experimental analyses and theoretical simulations uncovers the origin of the enhanced zincophilicity and hydrophilicity of N, P-HPCNFs for energy storage, which accounts for the faster ion migration and electrochemical processes.
