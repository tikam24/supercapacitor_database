BCN materials with varied structures are attracting attention for promising diverse applications. BCN materials are recognized for adaptable electrical properties, outstanding mechanical behavior, exceptional chemical inertness, and high thermal stability, which make them advantageous for corresponding applications in harsh environments. In this article, we thoroughly summarize BCN material theory, growth, properties, and applications. Properties of BCN thin films depend on the composition and growth technique, which facilitates in developing BCN films prevailing between insulating BN and semimetallic graphite. Regarding this, the effects of synthesis parameters on various BCN properties are examined. Dry and wet etching, which are imperative for device processing, are explored. Prompted by the success of graphene, graphene-analogous BCN nanomaterials are being researched intensively due to their unique chemical and physical properties. This article highlights BCN nanomaterials, their synthesis in different dimensions, and properties with prospective applications. We focus on their energy applications in supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, water purification, and CO2 adsorption along with other biosensing applications. Performance of BCN nanomaterials is discussed and compared with the prevailing benchmark materials to present an evolutionary perspective of BCN nanomaterial progress. Finally, unresolved issues are highlighted, and future development opportunities are identified.
