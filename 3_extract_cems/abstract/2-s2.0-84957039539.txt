Nitrogen and sulfur codoped porous carbon microspheres (NS-PCMSs) with superior electrochemical performance for supercapacitors were successfully fabricated using sublimed sulfur, thiourea and TMTD as different sulfur source by a solvothermal method. The transmission electron microscopy(TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy indicate the obtained NS-PCMSs have uniform morphology and partially graphitic structure. The N2 adsorption-desorption analysis reveal that all the NS-PCMSs have the hierarchical pore structure and relatively lower specific surface area (397.4-413.8 m2 g-1). The results of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrated that the nitrogen and sulfur successfully incorporated into the carbon frameworks. Electrochemical tests show NS-PCMSs present the superior specific capacitance (242-295 Fg-1 at 0.1 A g-1), outstanding rate capability (the specific capacitance at 10 A g-1 were 216-247 F g-1,respectively) and excellent cyclic stability (almost no attenuation after 10000 cycles). This study provides that the NS-PCMSs have huge application potential to be one of the splendid supercapacitor electrode materials.
