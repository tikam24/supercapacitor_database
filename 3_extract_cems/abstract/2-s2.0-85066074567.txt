Perovskite-type lanthanide oxide is a new kind of promising electrode material for supercapacitor. In this study, La1-xSrxMn0.9Ni0.1O3 nanofibers with different Sr substitutions are prepared by electrospun method and used as electrode material firstly. The effect of Sr substitution on the structure of LaMn0.9Ni0.1O3 perovskite has been investigated, and the electrochemical properties have been tailored correspondingly. Minor Sr substitution introduces some oxygen vacancies into the perovskite structure, and optimizes the specific capacitance. However, excessive Sr substitution causes lattice distortion of the perovskite structure and deteriorates the electrochemical performance instead. The highest specific capacitance of 113.9 F·g−1 is obtained in La0.85Sr0.15Mn0.9Ni0.1O3 component.
