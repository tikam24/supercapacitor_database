Synthesis of graphene oxide as a precursor for mass production of graphene is important to obtain high-quality graphene via reduction of the synthesized graphene oxide. The surface properties of graphene are affected by the agent used in the chemical reduction process, which can be advantageous for graphene applications. The effect of various reducing agents (hydrazine monohydrate, L-ascorbic acid, and N, N-dimethylformamide) on the surface properties of reduced graphene oxide was investigated. The supercapacitor performance based on the surface properties of electrodes prepared from graphene synthesized by these three methods was evaluated by electrochemical analysis. The electrochemical properties of reduced graphene oxide prepared using L-ascorbic acid were superior to those of the other two samples, as this sample had a unique morphology, presumably comprising a monolayer (or a few layers) despite being in the film state.
