A supercapacitor is a promising device for future energy storage application and carbonaceous materials are mainly used as the electrode for this purpose. They exhibit very high power density, but energy density value is much less. Faradic pseudocapacitive material partially solves this issue. Among the pseudocapacitors, transition metal oxides (TMOs) or transition metal hydroxides (TMHs) are mostly used due to their high theoretical specific capacitance value and fast redox reactions on the surface of the material. Thus the choice of electrode material is the key to fabricating advanced supercapacitors. Recent developments in nanotechnology offer several materials which have been used as the electrode material for supercapacitor application. Nanostructured TMOs or TMHs are more important compared to their bulk structure due to the high specific surface area, whole body participation during electrochemical reaction, etc. Here, in this chapter, we will discuss the use of different TMOs or TMHs materials and their hybrids with noble metals as supercapacitor electrode and the different strategies adopted by the researchers to enhance the pseudocapacitance activity of different TMOs or TMHs and their hybrids.
