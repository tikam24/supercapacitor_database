Nickel hydroxide (NiOH)2 has been recognized as an efficient electrode material for energy storage applications because of its attractive characteristics and high theoretical capacitance. However, the reduced cyclic stability of (NiOH)2 prevents it from being used in practical applications. To overcome this problem, we present a combination of nanocomposite (Ni(OH)2 with g-C3N4) prepared in an easy way of synthesis method. In the present study, the g-C3N4 was found to have great chemical stability and to enable a perpendicular charge-transportation in the charge-discharge processing that allows for easier electron transport. The structural and morphological properties confirm the formation of Ni(OH)2/g-C3N4 nanocomposite, in addition, Rietveld refinement was also performed on the XRD patterns. The nanocomposite Ni(OH)2/g-C3N4 shows high specific capacitances (463 F/g), good rate capability (94 %), and cycle stabilities as compared to Ni(OH)2. These attractive findings of the nanocomposite Ni(OH)2/g-C3N4 reveal that this could find a capable electrode material for superior performance supercapacitors.
