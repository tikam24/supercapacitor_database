The porous MgCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays/Ni foam (MCNA@NF) fabricated using the two-step method. Porous MgCo2O4 nanoneedle arrays have a regular diameter of 40–70 nm, and the nanoneedle is composed of numerous nanoparticles. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption surface area of the porous MgCo2O4 is about 25.6 m2 g−1, the volume of pores is 0.164 cm3 g−1. The MCNA@NF as the electrode material display 804 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1). After 2000 cycles, the pours MgCo2O4 maintains 87% of initial capacitance (725 F g−1, 6 A g−1). The electrochemical performances of the MCNA@NF are further investigated in an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). This asymmetric supercapacitor (MgCo2O4//rGO) device up to 81 Wh kg−1 at 1350 W kg−1. At 6750 W kg−1, the MgCo2O4//rGO ASC device still kept 59 Wh kg−1 (0–1.5 V). These good ASC device performances can be attributed to the spinel structure and its high surface areas, which is beneficial for the rich redox reaction sites growth. The MCNA@NF have a good potential application in ASC devices.
