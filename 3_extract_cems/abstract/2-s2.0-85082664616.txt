A novel electrochemical capacitor electrode based on Ce/Ni-MOFs was prepared. During this process, we introduced hydrothermal method. However improper reaction conditions would cause the collapse of crystal structure which will do harm to the performance of the electrode. We explored the option reaction conditions including temperature and end urance time. Under the option condition, we performed a series of electrochemical testing and surface characterizations to explore and electrochemical performance and cycle life. We obtain the Ce/Ni-MOF electrode with the capacitance of 584F/g and the retention of 95.5% after 1000 cycles of charging and discharging test. This indicate that Ce/Ni-MOFs might be a promising supercapacitor electrode for future use.
