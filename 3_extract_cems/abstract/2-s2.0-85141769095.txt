According to a high power density of supercapacitors, they have become interesting for electric vehicles. However, a boost converter is needed to step up the low voltage of the supercapacitor in its application. In this paper, a three-level DC-DC boost converter with supercapacitors is investigated. The two-loop sliding mode control is used to control the system. Simulation and experimental results are presented for start-up and steady-state. The converter can deliver power to load as expected from the experimental results.
