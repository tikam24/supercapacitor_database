This work presents a new methodology to interpret the electrochemical behavior of pseudocapacitors (PCs) which is based on a new theoretical approach denoted as the generic electrochemical model (GE). Based on a single premise, the GE model is composed of two distinct time constants (τ = RC) used to represent the narrow-deep (n-d) and large-shallow (l-s) heterogeneous surface structures incorporating the different surface defects (e.g., cracks, fissures, pores, etc.), which incurs in the so-called distributed capacitance and resistance phenomena. Five different transition metal oxide (TMO) electrodes composed of Ni, Co, and Ru were used to verify the validity of the proposed model equations. The internal (inner) and external (outer) capacitances and resistances were accurately determined from the fitting analysis (e.g., r2 ≥ 0.998 and χ2 < 10–5) involving the findings obtained using different techniques. Therefore, disagreements between the electrochemical techniques regarding the resistance and capacitance absolute values were ascribed to different average penetration depths intrinsic to each particular perturbation function, i.e., each electrochemical technique exhibits a particular sensitivity for detecting the capacitive and resistive phenomena in porous/defective electrodes. We verified for well-behaved PCs, where the so-called battery-like behavior is absent, that capacitive and pseudocapacitive phenomena are indistinguishable phenomena, as predicted by Saveànt and Conway. Therefore, the GE model can also be used for studying different carbon-based materials used in supercapacitors. Finally, the presence of different surface heterogeneous structures present in defective electrodes is the main cause of the distributed capacitance and resistance verified in both time and frequency domains.
