Nanoparticles of MnO2 were synthesized by a hydrothermal method using KMnO4 and MnSO4 as raw materials. The influence of KMnO4 concentration on the structure and capacitance properties of MnO2 was investigated. The results show that the KMnO4 concentration has an effect on the crystal type, grain size and morphology of MnO2 sample.β-MnO2 transforms into α-MnO2, and α-MnO2 nanowires become longer and thicker when the KMnO4 concentration increases. The α-MnO2 nanowire with the smaller grain size has the minimum charge transfer resistance (Rct) and diffusion impedance (W), resulting in the maximum capacitance and excellent ratio performance. The maximum capacitance is 227 F/g at a current density of 0.05 mA/cm2. The β-MnO2 sample has a good cycle performance but a poor capacitance (i.e., 113 F/g) and the capacity retention is 92.0% after 500 cycles.
