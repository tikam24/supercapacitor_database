Using petroleum cokes as raw material, and KOH, NaOH, K2CO3 and Na2CO3 as activated agent respectively, activated carbons were prepared in the chemical activation process. The effects of activated agents on the structure of prepared carbon were investigated by tap density and N2 adsorption method, and the electrochemical properties of the activated carbons were determined using two-electrode capacitors in 1 mol/L Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte by LAND battery tester and electrochemical workstation. The results indicate that KOH is the most efficient activated agent, and a high specific surface area of 2362 m2/g and a high micropore volume of 1.263 cm3/g are obtained in the activated carbon prepared by KOH. Used in supercapacitors, the activated carbon shows a well electrochemical performance, and the specific capacitance is 128.0 F/g. With the decrease of the alkalinity, the activated ability of the agent reduces; K2CO3 and Na2CO3 are not suitable for preparation of activated carbon from petroleum cokes.
