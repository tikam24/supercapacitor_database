A series of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) were prepared by a combination of self-assembly and chemical activation. Pore-structure analysis shows that micropores can be generated within the mesopore wall of mesoporous carbon in a controllable manner during activation. As evidenced by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cyclings and frequency response measurements, HPCs show superior capacitive performances to hard-templated ordered mesoporous carbons, which can be attributed to the generated pore surfaces that play most important role in the formation of double-layer capacitance and to their unique hierarchical porous structure that favors the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions into the pores. Of special interest is the fact that HPCs maintains 180 F/g at high-frequency of 1 Hz. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
