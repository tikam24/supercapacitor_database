Fuel cell (FC) constitutes a good alternative for using clean energy in embarked systems. To overcome several difficulties in using FCs as unique energy sources, the association of Supercapacitor (SC) as power sources is proposed. A recent approach of Passivity-based control (PBC) is the Interconnection and Damping Assignment (IDA-PBC) which is a very useful technique to control systems assigning a desired Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) structure to the closed-loop. This paper constitutes a first attempt to use energy principles and PBC to regulate hybrid sources for embarked electric energy system. Â© 2006 IEEE.
