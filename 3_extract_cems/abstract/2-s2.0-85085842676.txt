In order to improve the durability and economy of a hybrid power system composed of a battery and supercapacitors, a control strategy that can reduce fluctuations of the battery current is regarded as a significant tool to deal with this issue. This paper puts forwards a disturbance rejection control strategy for a hybrid power system taking into account the degradation of the battery. First, the degradation estimation of the battery is done by the model-driven method based on the degradation model and Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). Considering the transient and sinusoidal disturbance from the load in such a hybrid system, it is indispensable to smooth the behavior of the battery current in order to ensure the lifespan of the battery. Moreover, the constraints for the hybrid system should be considered for safety purposes. In order to deal with these demands, a cascaded voltage control loop based on a super twisting controller and proportional integral controller with an anti-windup scheme is designed for regulating the DC bus voltage in an inner voltage loop and supercapacitors' voltage in an outer voltage loop, respectively. The specific feature of the proposed control method is that it operates like a low-pass filter so as to reduce the oscillations on the DC bus.
