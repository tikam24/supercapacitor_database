This paper discusses the electrochemical energy storage and room temperature hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide adsorption/desorption behaviour of commercial nanoporous activated carbon having a specific BET surface area 1007 m2 g−1 and pore volume 0.371 cm3 g−1. The electrochemical energy storage behaviour of activated carbon was determined from its capacitive performance using standard three and two-electrode cells. The specific capacitance (CS) of the sample determined using a three-electrode cell is 138 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 with the capacitance loss of 1% after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. Whereas, CS determined using a two-electrode cell is 98.8 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with the capacitance loss of 3% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The energy and power densities of two-electrode cell supercapacitor is 19.76 Wh kg−1 and 3.77 kW kg−1, respectively. The sample exhibits gaseous uptake capacities of 0.23 wt% H2, 8.52 wt% CH4 and 37.25 wt% CO2 at ~50 atm/293 K.
