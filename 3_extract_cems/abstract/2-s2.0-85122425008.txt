Supercapacitors are a reliable device that has set an innovative path for the research line to face the energy gap. Consequently, remarkable steps were taken to prop up fabricated electrode materials electrochemical performance. ZnSe, MoSe2 and the composite of the mixed formation of ZnSe@MoSe2 has been individually investigated and the electrochemical performances have been studied for supercapacitor applications. The quality of the synthesized material was thoroughly examined using basic characterization studies. The binary composite of ZnSe@MoSe2 electrode delivered high specific capacitance of 450Fg−1 at 1Ag−1 in the charge–discharge profile and stable long cycle life retaining 99.6% over 2000 cycles at 10Ag−1 current density. Moreover, the existence of the flower like ZnSe@MoSe2 composites increases electrochemical performance by offering the additional electrolyte ions and the electrons mobility. Furthermore, full cell configuration via ZnSe@MoSe2//AC was assembled for 1.5 V and endowed with 43WhKg−1 energy density at 740WKg−1 power density signifying its capability over 99.3% of retention capacity. In favor of the potential applicability, full cell incorporated in series displayed 1.56 V and able to power up the three different LED’s, further enlightening the dominance in supercapacitor performance.
