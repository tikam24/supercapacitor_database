This paper presents a control strategy for a PV-Wind based standalone DC Microgrid with a hybrid energy storage system. A control algorithm for power management has been developed for the better utilisation of renewable sources. The proposed system helps in reducing the voltage variation in the DC bus and the current stress in the battery due to intermittency of both solar and wind energy. The PV array and the wind system operating in MPPT are interfaced to the DC load using boost converters. The control algorithm during reduced power mode uses droop control strategy for keeping bus voltage constant under excess power condition. The controllers for battery and supercapacitor designed by frequency domain analysis are also presented. The system is tested for sudden change in load, renewable energies, reduced power mode and during load shedding using MATLAB-Simulink platform. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by simulation results.
