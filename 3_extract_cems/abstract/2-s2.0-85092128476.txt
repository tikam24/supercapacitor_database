The synthesis and characterization of thorn-shaped nickel cobaltite nanoparticles (NiCo2O4) via a simple, rapid hydrothermal synthesis method for different reaction durations of 7 h and 14 h, denoted as NCo-7 and NCo-14, are reported. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the synthesized NiCo2O4 sample shows a thorn-like morphology. Compared to NCo-7, NCo-14 exhibits good capacitive performance, with a large specific capacitance. The NCo-14 electrocatalyst exhibited excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction and electrooxidation of methanol in alkaline medium.
