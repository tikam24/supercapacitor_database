The present work deals with the synthesis and characterization of p-Toluidinium picrate (PTP), an organic non-linear optical single crystal, produced by the solvent evaporation growth technique at room temperature condition. For the physical characterization, different instrumental techniques like powder XRD analysis for the crystallinity, FTIR, and laser Raman spectral analyses for the nature of chemical bonding and functionality, the ultraviolet spectrum for the optical absorption properties, etc. were employed. Following the instrumental analysis, on testing of the photoluminescence properties, we observed the first emission peak at 359 nm in the UV region, and two other emission peaks around 443 nm and 460 nm corresponding to the blue emission region. Also, we investigated PTP's dielectric behavior at different frequencies and room temperature, where the solid-state parameters such as plasma energy, Penn gap, Fermi energy, and polarizability were measured. Based on the overall analysis of optical, photoluminescence, and dielectric properties, it can be mentioned that the synthesized PTP crystals might have potential applications in the development of semiconducting, supercapacitor, and non-linear optical devices.
