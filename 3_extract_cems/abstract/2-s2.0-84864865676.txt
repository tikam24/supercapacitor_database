It is important to maintain high efficiency when using an energy generation source. This high efficiency can be obtained by a high generating efficiency or a high transferring efficiency. Conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques do not consider the transferring efficiency in the multiple load system. This paper presents a generalized technique for dynamic reconfiguration of a PV/supercapacitor array with considering the power consumptions in multiple loads. This technique will minimize the power loss in the converter and charger of the system. The experimental results show that there is 20-70% power loss reduction comparing with the conventional MPPT technique in our proposed system. This will make the system more reliable to operate in stand-alone situation.
