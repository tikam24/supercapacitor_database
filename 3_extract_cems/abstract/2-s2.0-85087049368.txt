Combination the materials together is a direct and forceful strategy to improve the electrochemical properties of each raw material. Herein, we present the method of hydrothermal process and treatment/calcination combination that is easy to synthesize a NiCo2O4 nanoparticles-mesoporous carbon composite (C/NiCo2O4). The result study electrochemical properties of materials revealed that the C/NiCo2O4 composite has excellent electrochemical properties compare with pristine NiCo2O4 or carbon. In particular, maximum specific capacitance of C/NiCo2O4 material at a current density of 1 A.g−1 is 204.28 F.g−1, meanwhile the Cs of carbon and NiCo2O4 are 25.06 F.g−1 and 178.78 F.g−1, respectively. In addition, C/NiCo2O4 material also showed excellent capacitance retention, Cs maintained to 90.35% after 3000 charge-discharge continuous cycles. The results show that the C/NiCo2O4 is a promising material for application as supercapacitor electrode.
