High performance energy storage devices are extremely useful in the sustainable transportation and grid energy storage. Lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors are commercialized storage devices and have captured electronic market in exceptional way. First one has high energy and limited power densities while, other one exhibits high power density but limited energy density. There is an urgent need of merging these two chemistries in order to achieve high power and energy densities simultaneously. In the present work, we will introduce some theoretical aspects regarding the possible hybrid combinations and strategies for the fabrication of optimized final devices. As lithium ion capacitors (LICs) found promising devices, we present recent trends in the development of anode and cathode materials for LIC.
