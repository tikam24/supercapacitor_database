A thermal reduction process was successfully employed to construct novel hybrid composites of SnO2@NiCo2O4/N-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes (N-MWCNTs) for supercapacitors. The hybrid confirmation studies were performed using X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. Cyclic voltammetry performance confirmed their suitability for use as an active electrode material for supercapacitors. SnO2@NiCo2O4/N-MWCNTs showed the high specific capacitance of ∼728 Fg−1 at 4 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte. After 5000 cycles, the hybrid composite produced excellent capacitance retention property with ∼92% of its primary value. Consequently, this SnO2@NiCo2O4/N-MWCNTs hybrid composite promising electrode for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
