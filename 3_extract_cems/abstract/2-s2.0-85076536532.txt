Highly stretchable supercapacitors are next-generation energy-storage systems with both high electrochemical performance and excellent mechanical properties under harsh conditions. In this study, we fabricate three-dimensional (3D) porous stretchable supercapacitor with wrinkled-structure poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) on a 3D porous reduced graphene oxide-coated elastic substrate under pre-strained conditions via a simple solution process. The stretchable supercapacitor exhibits an electrochemical energy capacity up to 82.4 F·g−1 and 85.1% capacitance retention at 300% strain. Furthermore, its specific capacitance and stretchability are well maintained after 500 repeated stretching–releasing cycles at a strain of 300%. Our stretchable supercapacitor device with wrinkled structures on porous skeleton can be extended to various energy storage/conversion systems, in addition to biomedical devices and sensors.
