The large specific surface area and high conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) make it a promising material for supercapacitors. However, aggregation of graphene sheets into graphitic domains upon drying hampers supercapacitor performance by drastically impeding ion transport inside electrodes. Here, we present a facile approach to optimize charge storage performance in RGO-based supercapacitors by systematically tuning their micropore structure. To this end, we combine RGOs with room temperature ionic liquids during electrode processing to impede stacking of sheets into graphitic structures with small interlayer distance. In this process, RGO sheets function as the active electrode material while ionic liquid serves both as a charge carrier and a spacer to control interlayer spacing inside electrodes and form ion transport channels. We show that composite RGO/ionic liquid electrodes with larger interlayer spacing and more ordered structure exhibit improved capacitance and charging kinetics.
