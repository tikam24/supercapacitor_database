We demonstrate, for the first time, a new method of fabricating hybrid MoS 2 /poly(ethyleneimine)-modified graphene oxide (PEI-GO) composites assembled through electrostatically charged interaction between the negatively charged MoS 2 nanosheets and positively charged PEI-GO in an aqueous solution. The GO can not only improve the electronic conductivity of the MoS 2 /PEI-GO composites, leading to an excellent charge-transfer network, but also hamper the restacking of MoS 2 nanosheets. The composition ratios between MoS 2 and PEI-GO were also optimized with the highest specific capacitance of 153.9 F g -1 where 96.0% of the initial specific capacitance remains after 6800 cycles. The specific capacitance of only 117.5 F g -1 was observed for the pure MoS 2 nanosheets, and 68.2% of the initial specific capacitance was achieved after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance of the hybrid MoS 2 /PEI-GO composites was demonstrated by establishing an asymmetric supercapacitor with a MoS 2 /PEI-GO-based negative electrode and an activated-carbon positive electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor provided a maximum capacitance of 42.9 F g -1 , and 93.1% of the initial capacitance was maintained after 8000 cycles. Furthermore, a MoS 2 /PEI-GO//activated-carbon asymmetric supercapacitor delivered an energy density of 19.3 W h kg -1 and a power density of 4500 W kg -1 , indicating the potential of the hybrid MoS 2 /PEI-GO composites in electrochemical energy storage applications.
