Herein, a facile one-step non-aqueous synthesis of nickel-manganese carbonate /reduced graphene oxide (GMC) nanocomposite is reported as cathodic materials for supercapacitor application. This one-step non-aqueous solvothermal synthesis of the manganese carbonate was achieved by using N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and urea, as solvents and source of carbonate respectively. The morphological study indicates the crystalline nature appeared on the surface of graphene during solvothermal synthesis. The FT-IR study reveals that metal carbonated compounds are attached during solvothermal reactions. From XRD analysis, the presence of crystalline manganese carbonate on the surface of RGO has been confirmed, which has completely supported from HR-TEM-image. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC) assembled using RGO as negative electrode materials exhibited excellent capacitance performance, whereas, 114 F g-1 was highest capacitance value at a current density 1.0A g-1 and retained up to 85 F g-1 at 7 A g-1. The calculated energy density and corresponding power density were 40.53 Wh kg-1 and 1.6 kW kg-1, respectively.
