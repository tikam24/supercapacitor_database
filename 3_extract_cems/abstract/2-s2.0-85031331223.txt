The booming developments in portable and wearable electronics promote the design of flexible energy storage systems. Flexible supercapacitors and batteries as promising energy storage devices have attracted tremendous attention. As the key component of both supercapacitors and batteries, electrode materials with excellent flexibility should be considered to match with highly flexible energy storage devices. Owing to large surface area, good thermal and chemical stability, high conductivity and mechanical flexibility, graphene-based materials have been widely employed to serve as promising electrodes of flexible energy storage devices. Considerable efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of flexible graphene-based electrodes through a variety of strategies. Moreover, different configurations of energy storage devices based on these active materials are designed. This review highlights flexible graphene-based two-dimensional film and one-dimensional fiber supercapacitors and various batteries including lithium-ion, lithiumâ€“sulfur and other batteries. The challenges and promising perspectives of the graphene-based materials for flexible energy storage devices are also discussed.
