Here, we report the fabrication of one step NiO nanopyramid thin film as a binder-free electrode with improved electrochemical properties using a reactive magnetron sputtering. The crystalline nature, surface morphology and chemical composition of the as deposited NiO thin films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoluminescence spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) techniques. NiO nanopyramid nanostructures electrode exhibited high specific capacitance (325 F g−1 at 0.4 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH), high efficient density (19.66 Wh kg−1) and power density (2.15 kW kg−1) with excellent cycling stability (91.4% retention after 1000 cycles).
