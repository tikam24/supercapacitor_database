MoS2/ PPY nanocomposites with different mass ratios were successfully synthesized the in-situ oxidative polymerization method. The microstructure, morphology, element content of the samples was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). And the influence of the composite ratio on the electrochemical properties was evaluated by galvanizing chargeâ€“discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and cycle stability. The experimental results show that all samples exhibit hexagonal systems with great crystallization. The morphologies are uniform structures with an obvious cladding layer. The CV curve is rectangular and the redox peak is evident. MoS2 nanocomposites have excellent specific capacitance and good cyclic stability. The Nyquist spectrum of the sample shows that the electrical resistance of the MoS2 nanocomposite is low and the electronic conductivity is excellent. When the current density is 1 A g-1, the specific capacitance of MP-2 is 677.8F g-1, which is higher than that of pure PPY and the other two kinds of nanocomposites. It can be seen from the experimental results that the specific capacitance of MP-2 nanocomposite material decreases by 24.3% after 3000 cycles.
