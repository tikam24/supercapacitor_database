An active contribution: The specific capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitors can be significantly improved by the addition of an electrochemically active compound (hydroquinone) to the supporting electrolyte. The strong contribution of the redox-active electrolyte to the pseudocapacitance of the system results in the largest capacitance values obtained for an activated carbon-based supercapacitor.
