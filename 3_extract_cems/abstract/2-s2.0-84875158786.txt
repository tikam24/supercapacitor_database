NiCo2O4 nanowires-loaded reduced graphene oxide composite (NiCo2O4@RGO) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method without any surfactant. Hexamethylenetetramine was introduced as a structure directing and assembling agent to the synthesis of NiCo2O4 nanowires. NiCo2O4 nanowires with an average size of 80×10 nm2 are uniformly and densely dispersed on the graphene sheets. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements on NiCo2O4@RGO indicated a high specific capacitance of 737 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and only 6% loss of the initial specific capacitance after 3000 charge/discharge cycles at 4 A g-1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte, which is valuable for practical application in supercapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
