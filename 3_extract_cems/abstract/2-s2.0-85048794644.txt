Energy storage systems (ESSs) are of crucial importance in electric vehicles (EVs). Batteries as the best existing storage solution have been used widely in EV applications. ESSs based on batteries are simple but have several challenges. Main issue of them is that the power density of batteries is not high enough to meet the high power demands of EVs. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) consisting of batteries and ultra-capacitors are proposed to mitigate this issue. In this paper effective utilization of stored energy of UCs as a main challenge in designing HESSs is introduced and a novel solution is proposed.
