As energy shortages become more prominent, renewable energy is widely exploited. Renewable energy sources such as wind energy and solar energy are affected by the non-uniformity and non-steadiness of the natural environment, resulting in fluctuations and randomness of output power. When incorporated into the grid, it will cause fluctuations in grid voltage and frequency, affecting the power quality of the grid. The energy storage system can be used as an energy buffering device to stabilize the grid-connected power to meet the grid-connected standard. A hybrid energy storage system is proposed to stabilize the fluctuation of renewable energy generation, and the energy storage control method and energy distribution method are given. Finally, using the actual data of a wind farm, the hybrid energy storage composed of hydrogen storage energy and supercapacitor energy storage is used to stabilize the wind power fluctuations. The simulation results verify the technical rationality and economic practicability of the proposed method.
