Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also known as coordination polymers or coordination networks (self-assembled by multidentate organic ligands and metal ions/metal clusters), are multifunctional materials, which have been widely used in the fields of sensing, catalysis, ion exchange, adsorption/separation, or gas storage since their birth. At present, MOFs are a new type of energy storage and conversion material, which are considered as one of the most promising electrode candidates as a result of their large specific surface area, adjustable pores, open metal sites, and adjustable crystal structure. Although MOFs have the above advantages, the direct utilization of pristine MOFs as electrode materials is facing great challenges, which hinder their practical application. On the basis of this, in this review, we summarize the recent development of pristine MOFs as electrode materials for supercapacitors. On the basis of the research of these pristine MOFs, the synthesis process, energy storage performance, and structural design characteristics are summarized. Finally, we focus on the future development trend of pristine MOFs.
