A three-dimensional (3D) CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite structure based on CoS nanoflakes and two-dimensional (2D) Ni(OH)2 nanosheets were in situ synthesized on Ni foam by a whole hydrothermal reaction and electrodeposition process. The 3D CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite structures demonstrate the combined advantages of a sustained cycle stability of CoS and high specific capacitance from Ni(OH)2. The obtained CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite structures on Ni foam can directly serve as a binder-free electrode for a supercapacitor. For the 3D CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode, the high specific capacitance is 1837 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1, which is obviously higher than both the bare CoS electrode and Ni(OH)2 electrode. The galvanostatic charge and discharge measurements illustrate that the 3D CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode possesses excellent cycle stability, and it keeps a 95.8% retention of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements also confirm that the 3D CoS/Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode has better electrochemical characteristics. These remarkable performances can be attributed to the unique 3D nanoporous structure of CoS/Ni(OH)2 which leads to a large accessible surface area and a high stability during long-term operation. In addition, 2D Ni(OH)2 nanosheets in 3D nanocomposite structures can afford rapid mass transport and a strong synergistic effect of CoS and Ni(OH)2 as individual compositions contribute to the high performance of the nanocomposite structure electrode. These results may promote the design and implementation of nanocomposite structures in advanced supercapacitors.
