Portable and furnished electronics appliances demand power efficient energy storage devices where electrochemical supercapacitors gain much more attention. In this concern, a simple, low-cost and industry scalable successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) approach has been adopted to deposit nanostructured VS2 onto flexible and light-weight stainless steel (SS) substrate towards supercapacitor application. The nanocrystalline nature with hexagonal crystal structure has been confirmed for VS2 through structural analysis. The VS2 electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 349 F g−1 with a super stable behavior in three-electrode liquid-state configuration. Fabricated flexible symmetric solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) device using gel electrolyte yields specific power of 1.5 kW kg−1 (specific energy of 25.9 Wh kg−1) with a widen voltage window of 1.6 V. A red LED has been glown for 30 s using the system consisted of two devices in series combination. Furthermore, the system glows a combination of 21 red LEDs network with acronym ‘VNIT’, demonstrating commercial exposure. The attribution of device demonstration even under mechanical stress holds great promise towards advanced flexible electronics application.
