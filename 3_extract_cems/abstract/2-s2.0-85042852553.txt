Boron carbonitrides (BCN) have attracted great interest in superhard or energy storage materials. In this work, thin BCN sheets were synthesized at 250 Â°C by a facile and green solvothermal method. The structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Based on the results of electrochemical experiments, the thin BCN sheet exhibited excellent capacitance performance (343.1 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g) and cycling stability (90%), which showed high potential applications in supercapacitors.
