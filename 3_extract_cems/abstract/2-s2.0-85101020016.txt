The present study reports on the preparation and potential electrochemical properties of spray pyrolysed ruthenium incorporated cobalt oxide thin film electrodes prepared via aqueous route. The effect of Ru incorporation is analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Elemental Diffraction Analysis (EDAX), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical characterizations followed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (charge-discharge-CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. XRD and SEM depict nano-crystalline face centered cubic phase for Co3O4 and tetragonal structure for RuO2 exhibiting semi-porous revolutionary mixed nano-structured morphology. XPS confirms the atomic states and formation of Co3O4 and RuO2 phase. Electrochemical study reveals mixed-capacitive behavior at the scan rate 1 mV/s with optimum specific capacitance 900.0 F/g using 1 M KOH electrolyte, exhibiting excellent electrochemical stability. Charge-discharge study was carried out to evaluate specific energy, specific power and columbic efficiency at numerous current densities, the maximum estimated values are 34.4 Wh/kg, 50.90 kW/kg and 93.31% respectively. The EIS analysis was carried out for a frequency 1 mHz to 1 MHz range to investigate the internal resistance and capacitive behavior of the prepared electrodes. These modified electrodes can be the excellent candidates for supercapacitor application.
