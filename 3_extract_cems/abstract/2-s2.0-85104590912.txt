The performances of the supercapacitor mainly rely on the design of electrode materials. The transition metal molybdates have been attracted as electrode material in supercapacitor due to their physicochemical properties. In the present work, a petal-like CoMoO4/r-GO composite was synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties were studied by using different analytical methods. As an electrode material, the CoMoO4/r-GO composite exhibited a high specific capacity of 425Cg-1at current density 1 Ag−1 with an excellent rate capability of 92.2% retained over 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at current density 10 Ag−1. Besides, the constructed asymmetric supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 63.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1.
