The metal ion etching induced transformation of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) to layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is closely related to the etching conditions. Here, by tuning the Ni2+ etching conditions (e.g., initial Ni2+ concentration and etching time), Co-ZIF-L templated CoNi-LDH with diverse morphologies and tailorable compositions are obtained and their resultant electrochemical properties are optimized. Mechanism study reveals that the etching conditions significantly affect the disassembling rate of Co-ZIF-L as well as the formation rate of CoNi-LDH, leading to the morphological and compositional variance of etched samples, which further results in their distinct electrochemical activities. The resultant asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with Co-ZIF-L derived CoNi-LDH and activated carbon can achieve a maximum energy density of 77.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 700 W/kg with the capacity retention of 85.7 % after 2000 cycles, superior or comparable to other advanced CoNi-LDH based supercapacitors.
