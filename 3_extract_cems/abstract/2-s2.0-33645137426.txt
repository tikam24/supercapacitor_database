A beta-iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) was synthesized via a hydrolyzing route and investigated as a lithium intercalation host. It delivers a capacity of about 170mAh/g and exhibits good cycling performance when charged/discharged in the voltage range from 1.6V to 3.3V. For the first time we have confirmed that FeOOH is suitable for using it as a negative electrode for hybrid electrochemical supercapacitor assembled with an activated carbon positive electrode in 1.0M LiPF6 ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (EC/DMC, 1:2 in volume) solution. The cell reveals a slightly sloping voltage profile from 0 V to 2.8 V and gives an estimated specific energy of 45Wh/kg based on the total weight of two electrode materials, approximately two times of carbon/carbon electrochemical double layer capacitors. The hybrid supercapacitor shows a good cycling performance, it remains approximately 96% of initial capacity after 800 cycles at a charge/discharge rate of 4C. The capacitor also shows a desirable rate capability, even at 10C discharge rate, it holds 80% of capacity compared with that at 1C discharge rate.
