Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices providing capacitance much higher than conventional capacitors and higher power density and longer cycle life than Li-batteries. We report printable and disposable supercapacitors fabricated from solution-processed carbon nanotube (CNT) composite material as active electrodes and nanocellulose (NC) as a separator. Use of a highly porous and electrically conducting CNT film as electrode materials eliminates the need of current collector. NC is a robust separator material used instead of conventional polymer separator films. Supercapacitor characterization was done with a galvanostatic discharge method according to an industrial standard. The capacitance of 1.8 cm2 devices was 14.9-16.5 mF (7.4-9.1 mF/cm2 or 2.4-2.9 F/g) and equivalent series resistance (ESR) 74-155 Î©. This type of low-cost energy storage devices fabricated from safe and environmentally friendly materials have obvious applications in autonomous intelligence and disposable low-end products.
