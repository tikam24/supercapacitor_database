NiCoP/C electrodes with hollow structure are prepared successfully by solvent thermal method and low temperature phosphorylation method, the effect of Co doping on the electrode performance is explored. The hollow sphere structure of NiCoP/C electrode brings out outstanding electrochemical properties. The results of electrochemical tests show that the NiCoP/C electrode delivers a specific capacity of 193.8 mAh g − 1 at 1 A g − 1 and only losses 6.7% capacity under a 5 A g − 1 of current density after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device composed of NiCoP/C and activated carbon has an energy density of 53.7 W h kg−1 when the power density is 750 W kg−1. The ASC device is also cycled for 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g − 1 while the capacity loss is only 7.2%.
