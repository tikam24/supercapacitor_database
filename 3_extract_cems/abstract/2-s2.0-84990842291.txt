Ni(salphen), a Schiff base ligand compound, was synthesized and electropolymerized on multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes in an acetonitrile solution via the pulse potentiostatic method and then applied as a supercapacitor electrode material. The polymerization mode was investigated through methyl replacement in the para-position of phenyl rings in the Ni(salphen) monomer, and it was found that the Ni(salphen) monomers would polymerize by the generation of CC bonds between the phenyl rings in the para-position of the phenol moieties. The optimum condition for polymerization was evaluated, and when the polymerization time was 8 min, poly[Ni(salphen)] exhibited a specific capacitance up to 200 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, and the capacitance remains at 164 F g−1 at 20 mA cm−2. The energy density of the poly[Ni(salphen)] electrode reached 40 Wh kg−1 at 0.1 mA cm−2, about eight times greater than for a pure MWCNT electrode. Electrochemical performances were investigated, and the composites showed good redox property and ion transfer capability. This work showed that Ni(salphen) may be an attractive material in supercapacitors© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 44464.
