The design and exploration of new-type energy storage devices with exceptional energy and power density as well as ultra-long cycling lifespan are still on highly demand. Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSs) have been broadly reported as emerging and promising candidates for energy storage devices in recent years, which integrate the complementary advantages of supercapacitors and batteries. In this review, we systematically and comprehensively summarize the fundamental principles and recent progresses of ZHSs. Furthermore, the critical challenges and perspectives of ZHSs are also highlighted. This well-timed and comprehensive review is supposed to provide a powerful motivation for the reasonable design and exploitation of high-performance ZHSs to realize energy storage applications.
