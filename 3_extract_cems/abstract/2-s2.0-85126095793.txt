Carbon cloth (CC) based supercapacitor is considered as one of the most promising electrode materials for flexible supercapacitor due to their excellent flexibility and electrochemical properties. In this paper, a low-cost ternary hybrid material polyaniline-coated γ-MnO2/carbon cloth (PANI@γ-MnO2/CC) is synthesized via facile hydrothermal and in-situ electrochemical polymerization reactions for superior supercapacitor electrode materials. Flexible conductive CC can not only be used as a scaffold for the growth of γ-MnO2 and PANI but also can be used as a carbon source for generation γ-MnO2. The structure and electrochemical properties of PANI@γ-MnO2/CC composite are investigated via different testing techniques. The coating PANI layer on the surface of γ-MnO2@CC with a three-dimensional hierarchical structure provides high electroactive surface area and accelerates the ion diffusion and electron transfer. Due to synergistic effects between the components, the flexible PANI@γ-MnO2/CC composite displays a high specific capacitance of 1105 mF cm−2 (371.4 C g−1) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte and long cycle stability for 2000 cycles with 86.35%, as well as good rate performance 72.3% capacitance retention from 1 to 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASCs) based on PANI@γ-MnO2/CC and PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte have been fabricated and it has shown the energy density of 10.4 mW cm−3 at a power density of 1.5 mWh cm−3. The ease of preparation and excellent energy storage capability indicates that the PANI@γ-MnO2/CC composite could be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
