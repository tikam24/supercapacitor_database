Supercapacitor is an energy storage device that attempts to combine the high power density of a capacitor with the high energy density of a battery. Conventional supercapacitors use carbon based electrodes, mostly graphite. In recent years, alternatives such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and other nanostructured materials have been considered to construct supercapacitor electrodes. This article reviews the progress in this area in addition to presenting a brief background on supercapacitors as energy storage medium and nanomaterials. Â© 2013 American Vacuum Society.
