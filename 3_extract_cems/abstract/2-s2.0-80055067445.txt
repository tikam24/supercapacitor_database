A novel conductive nanocomposite named poly(p-phenylenediamine)/graphene oxide/Au (PpPD/GO/Au) was synthesized via in situ polymerization using p-phenylenediamine(p-PDA) as monomer and HAuCl4 as oxidants and Au sources in the presence of graphene oxide (GO). The microstructure of the nanocomposite was characterized by FESEM, FT-IR and XRD patterns. And the results show that three phases including PpPD, GO and Au nanoparticles exist. Compared with single phase of PpPD or GO, the heat stability of the nanocomposite is improved greatly. And the highest specific capacitance of 237.5F/g can be obtained from the PpPD/GO/Au nanocomposite, which is higher than 11.25F/g of individual PpPD and 176.25F/g of PpPD/GO obtained by using FeCl3 and H2O2 as oxidants in the same condition. Obviously the specific capacitance of nanocomposite is improved significantly, which shows positive meanings in this field.
