The developing political and environmental reforms are driving rapid evolution of today's power systems. There is a steady increase in electrical energy being generated from renewable energy sources like wind and photovoltaic systems while decommissioning large thermal power plants. This trend has a major impact on the performance of the electrical power systems especially with respect to their dynamic behaviour. Phasing out of existing conventional synchronous generators will adversely affect auxiliary services like voltage control and frequency regulation. This paper discusses one solution to cope with these challenges: the use of a Modular Multilevel Converter based STATCOM with an additional frequency stabilizer can significantly contribute to the stable operation of a power system. The application of the frequency stabilizer has been analysed on a representation of the Ireland (All-Island) transmission grid of Ireland and the results have been presented and discussed. It has been shown that a Frequency Stabilizer of 50 MVA can reduce the frequency deviation by more than 0.1 Hz and thereby avoiding load shedding. Furthermore the ROCOF was reduced from app. 0.45 Hz/s to 0.4 Hz/s which could be crucial for the setting of the ROCOF protection and the grid stability.
