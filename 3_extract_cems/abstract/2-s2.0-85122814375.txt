The synthesis of the stable hybrid material for electrodes to exhibit stupendous supercapacitor functioning is an actual challenge. Here, we present a two-step synthesis by a chemical route method followed by a hydrothermal technique to produce two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) hybrid material, wherein MoS2 nanosheets were integrated with the 3D cube-like network of PbS. The multiple MoS2/PbS hybrid structures are synthesized by varying the concentration of PbS. The characterization tools, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, approve the co-existence of MoS2 and PbS, while field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy conclusions approve the distinctive microstructures. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller is also performed to compare the surface areas of pristine MoS2 nanosheets and MoS2/PbS-based hybrid material. Remarkably, the optimized concentration of the metal sulfide (PbS)-loaded MoS2/PbS (MP100) hybrid structure yielded the highest double-layer capacitance value of 205.50 F/g in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (scan rate of 10 mV/s), whereas pure MoS2 nanosheets showed 40.04 F/g. The inclusion of metal sulfide heightened the supercapacitive parameters of pure MoS2 nanosheets. The significant supercapacitive application of the hybrid material can be accredited to the synergistic effect amid the 3D network of interconnected MoS2 nanosheets surrounded by metal sulfide (PbS) providing an enhanced surface area and the lowest charge transfer resistance.
