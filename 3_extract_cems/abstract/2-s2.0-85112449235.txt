[Objectives] To address the unstable power output of photovoltaic systems on the mobile platforms of ships and power fluctuations caused by surge loading/unloading, an energy management strategy involving a photovoltaic hybrid energy storage system based on optimal power distribution is proposed. [Methods] In view of the shortcomings of the traditional limit management method, the filter time constant is adaptively adjusted according to the different zones of the charged state of the supercapacitor, thereby realizing the optimal power distribution of the hybrid energy storage system. Meanwhile, the control strategy and working mode of each converter are analyzed. [Results] The Matlab simulation results and engineering test results show that the energy management scheme and converter control strategy can effectively improve the overcharge or over-discharge problem of hybrid energy storage systems, not only ensuring the stability of the DC bus voltage, but also improving the dynamic response and coordination of the system. [Conclusions] The results of this study can provide references for the energy management of photovoltaic systems on mobile platforms.
