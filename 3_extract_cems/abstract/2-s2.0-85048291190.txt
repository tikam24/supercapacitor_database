NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a simple, fast and cost effective sucrose-assisted combustion route, and followed by calcination treatment. When NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the NiCo2O4 electrodes delivered a high specific capacitance of 429.6 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, remarkable capacitance retention rate of 74.30% at current density of 16 A g-1 compared with 1 A g-1, and 88.54% retention after 4000 cycles. The as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanoparticles hold promise for practical application of high-performance supercapacitors due to the facile and low cost effective synthesized method and superior electrochemical performances.
