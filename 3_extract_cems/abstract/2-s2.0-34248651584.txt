A research team from the Electromagnetic Compatibility Laboratory at King Mongkuts Institute of Technology at Lad Krabang in Thailand has developed the countrys first prototype fuel cell vehicle. The team modified a motorcycle-based electric vehicle, and designed a PEM fuel cell system to generate power to drive it. Instead of using electric power from batteries, once the vehicle has started up, the fuel cell also generates electric power to drive the vehicles motor. Hydrogen from a tank is fed to the stack. The combined flow rates of the hydrogen and oxygen are the key factors in making the fuel cell generate enough power. The team completed the development of the prototype in early March 2007; this vehicle is an upgrade from the first version, which came out in 2006. While the first version uses a supercapacitor, its successor uses electric power generated in real time purely from hydrogen and oxygen, with no need for a battery.
