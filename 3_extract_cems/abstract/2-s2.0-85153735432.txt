By employing a new semi-rigid pyrazole-amide-derived bis(pyridyl) ligand [N,N'-bis(4-picolylamine)-1-hydropyrazole (4-dpap)], a new homopolymolybdate-based two-dimensional (2D) plate-like complex [Co(4-dpap)(H2O)(β-Mo8O26)1/2] (1) has been prepared under solvothermal condition and structurally characterized. The β-Mo8 anions are fixed between the 2D metal–organic networks [Co(4-dpap)(H2O)]n2n+ via hydrogen-bonding interaction. Complex 1 possesses satisfactory specific capacitance of 1512.4 F·g−1 (current density: 1 A·g−1) and good cycling stability (90.8% after 1000 cycles). Moreover, 1 represents a promising amperometric sensor for measurement of Cr(VI) with low detection limit (0.042 µmol·L−1) and high durability. The insertion of β-Mo8 anions between the unique 2D metal − organic networks improves the active area of polyoxometalates, which further promotes electrochemical performance.
