Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs)have been consideredas apromising candidate for energy storage systems because of the meritsthey inherited from both supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries.Herein, we show the eco-friendly modified solvent evaporation-inducedself-assembly (EISA) synthesis of newly engineered plant polyphenoltannin-derived ordered mesoporous carbons (TOMCs) and employ themas cathode material for high-performance ZHSCs to promote the diffusiondynamics of Zn2+ ions for the first time. The optimizedTOMC-700 possesses a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)surface area of 967 m2 g-1, narrow mesoporescentered at âˆ¼3.5 nm, and rich heteroatoms. Profiting from thesynergy of enhanced kinetics and electroactivity, the aqueous TOMC-700-basedZHSC exhibits intriguing Zn-storage capabilities, including a superiorenergy density of 148.9 Wh kg-1 at 180 W kg-1 in a broad potential range of 0-1.8 V andlong-term cycling stability. Moreover, the quasi-solid TOMC-700-basedZHSC also delivers an outstanding energy density of 121.3 Wh kg-1 at 180 W kg-1. These results highlightthe facile fabrication of a natural carbohydrate-derived ordered mesoporouscarbon as cathode material, notably boosting the development of Zn-basedhybrid energy storage systems.
