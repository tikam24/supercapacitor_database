Regarding the physical and chemical performances, Fe3O4 and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) combined with other metal oxide such as titanium dioxide open new opportunity to be widely used for energy application such as supercapacitor. In this paper, we report the preparation of Fe3O4/MWCNT nanocomposite combined with titanium dioxide using sonochemical-precipitation method. The nanocomposite was characterized using X-ray diffractometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and UV-Vis spectrometer. The results of diffraction data analysis showed the presence of crystalline phase in nanocomposite derived from Fe3O4 and titanium dioxide with cubic inverse spinel and anatase structures, respectively. The existence of MWCNT was then confirmed by functional groups data which indicated the vibration of C=C functional group at the wavenumber of 1400-1600 cm-1, while the vibration of Fe-O was detected at the wavenumber of 409 cm-1 and 667 cm-1 overlapped with Ti-O functional group. MWCNT was considered to be crosslinked the surface of Fe3O4 or titanium dioxide nanoparticles. The bandgap energy of the nanocomposite was 2.17 eV for Fe3O4/MWCNT, and 3.27 eV for Fe3O4/MWCNT. Furthermore, the magnetization value of the sample was 50 emu/g exhibited as a superparamagnetic character.
