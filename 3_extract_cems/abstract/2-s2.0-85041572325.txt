We have synthesized sulfur-doped nickel oxide (S-NiO) spherical nanosheets by emulsion method. The structure of the S-NiO nanosheets is characterized by using TGA, XRD, XPS, BET, FE-SEM and FE-TEM. From the TGA, XPS and EDAX results conclude the nickel oxide is doped with sulfur. The specific capacitance of the S-NiO nanosheets was showing 313 F g−1 at the sweep rate of 5 mV s−1 by cyclic voltammetry. The S-NiO nanosheets showing the high rate performance of 80% at the current density ranging from 1 to 8 A g−1 and high retention of the capacitance 99% after completion of 1000 charge–discharge cycles.
