A facile and supercritical drying-free synthesis strategy is developed for rapid preparation of resorcinol-formaldehyde resin organic xerogel. An iron-based deep eutectic solvent is applied as both reaction medium and catalyst for the polymerization of resorcinol with formaldehyde. The coordination effect of Fe3+ greatly short the gelation time. Hierarchical porous carbon xerogel with both amorphous and graphitic regions is obtained via pyrolysis as prepared organic xerogel. By selectively etching the amorphous carbon domains of the product through a simple air etching treatment at 400 °C, a porous graphitized carbon xerogel is achieved. The carbon xerogel possesses a high specific surface area of 587 m2 g−1 and abundant surface oxygen functional groups. Consequently, the O–RFCX–700 sample delivers a specific capacitance of 209 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and exhibits excellent rate performance (131 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) as well as cycling stability in a three-electrode configuration in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The present work paves a new way for rapid preparation of resorcinol-formaldehyde resin (xero)gel and extends their applications in energy storage devices.
