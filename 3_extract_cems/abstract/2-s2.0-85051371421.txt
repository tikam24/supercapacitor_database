Here, we report simple hydrothermal method for the preparation of Graphene oxide (GO) is embellished with nanostring clusters of ruthenium oxide (GO-RuO2). The structure of the nanocomposite material was ascertained using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Scanning electron spectroscopy (SEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Transmission spectroscopy (TEM). The supercapacitor performance of the nanocomposites was investigated in acidic electrolyte, 1.0 M H2SO4, in a three-electrode setup. GO-RuO2 nanostring composite has shown a maximum specific capacitance of 859 Fg−1 at the scan rate of 5 mVs−1 using Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and by using Chronopotentiometry (CP) the specific capacitance towered up to 512 Fg−1 at a current density of 2.5 Ag−1. Further, the material also possesses a high energy density of 246 Wh kg-1with a maximum power density of 1028 W kg-1. GO-RuO2 nanostring composite electrode exhibits tremendous cyclic stability with the specific capacitance retention of nearly 99% of the initial capacitance.
