In the last few years, renewable, inexpensive, biocompatible, and biodegradable wood and lignocellulose materials have triggered considerable research interest for application in various functional devices. However, there is still a lack of a new perspective to deeply understand the structure-property-function relationships of micro-/nanostructures and components of natural wood, so as to explore the potential of wood assembly of nano-energy materials with different dimensions. Herein, the recent progresses in the design and construction of free-standing supercapacitor (SC) electrodes containing wood-derived materials are reviewed. We begin with an illustrated introduction to the hierarchical structure and characteristics of natural wood with a “top-down” view, which includes the cell walls, cellulose microfibers, nanocellulose, and cellulose supramolecules. Next, the fabrication, structure, and properties of lignocellulose are highlighted. We focus on the structure-property-function relationships between the hierarchical micro- and nanoscale structure of wood and electroactive materials. The focus then turns to a summary of the recent advances in wood-based free-standing SC electrodes with a unique point that is ever out of the spotlight, including one-dimensional integrated fibers, two-dimensional flexible films/papers, three-dimensional porous hydrogels/aerogels, and ultra-thick electrodes. Finally, we put forward our perspectives on the challenges to further promoting the development of this emerging field in the future.
