Supercapacitors (SCs) are widely utilized as energy storage units (ESUs) to compensate the transient power fluctuations. In this paper, an improved virtual impedance based coordinated control strategy for distributed SCs is proposed to achieve accurate power distribution. Unlike the existed strategy which can hardly adjust the output power of each SC if the energy storage system contains several distributed SCs, the proposed control scheme can allocate the output power of each SC according to the state-of-charge (SOC) without causing current oscillations. The power distribution among each SC is realized based on low-bandwidth-communication (LBC). And power distribution coefficients which are proportional to the SOC of each SC are introduced. By appropriate tuning the coefficients, the accurate power distribution of SCs is achieved. This method can not only supply energy instantly under transient conditions caused by loads or sources, but also realize precise power distribution between SCs. Meanwhile, this coordinated control strategy which has improved reliability is simple to implement, since it only uses local controllers and LBC network to exchange information between SCs. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation results.
