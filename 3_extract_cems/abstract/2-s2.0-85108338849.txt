We report the synthesis of silver-integrated silica nanostructures using rice hulls and silver chloride through a facile thermal combustion process. The formation of mesoporous silica nanomatrix embedded with silver nanoparticles (SiO2:Ag 5 wt% and SiO2:Ag 10 wt%) was confirmed by XRD, FTIR, EDX, BET, and TEM analysis. Also, the obtained results from the above studies revealed that the concentration of silver ions significantly increases the particle size and number of silver nanoparticles formed in the silica matrix. The electrochemical performance was studied using silver-integrated silica nanostructures as a working electrode in KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of SiO2:Ag 5 wt%- and SiO2:Ag 10 wt%-coated electrode was found to be 517 and 580 F/g at current density of 1 A/g. It was also found that SiO2:Ag 10 wt% electrode exhibit an excellent stability with the capacitance retention of 94% than SiO2:Ag 5 wt% (capacitance retention of 85%) after 1000 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. These results may be attributed to the inherent characteristic of more silver nanoparticles present in the silica nanomatrix in SiO2:Ag 10 wt%. The intrinsic characteristic of rice hull-derived silica nanostructures such as high surface area and mesoporous structure along with the advantage of silver nanoparticles (conductivity) can facilitate the Faradic redox processes at electrode surface which are responsible for the supercapacitive behavior of the prepared silver-integrated silica nanostructures.
