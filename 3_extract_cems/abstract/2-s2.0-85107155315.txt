Herein, a solution-free dry strategy for the growth of self-assembled ordered tricopper phosphide (Cu3P) nanorod arrays is developed and the product is employed as a high-energy, stable positive electrode for a solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (HSC). The ordered Cu3P nanorod arrays grown on the copper foam deliver an excellent specific capacity of 664 mA h/g with an energy efficiency of 88% at 6 A/g and an ultra-long cycling stability over 15,000 continuous chargeâ€“discharge cycles. These electrochemical features are attributed to the ordered growth of the Cu3P nanorod arrays, which offers a large number of accessible electroactive sites, a reduced number of ion transfer paths, and reversible redox activity. The potential of the Cu3P nanorod arrays is further explored by engineering solid-state HSCs in which the nanorods are paired with an activated carbon-based negative electrode. The constructed cell is shown to convey a specific energy of 76.85 Wh/kg at a specific power of 1,125 W/kg and an 88% capacitance retention over 15,000 cycles. Moreover, the superior energy storing and delivery capacity of the cell is demonstrated by an energy efficiency of around 65%. The versatile solution-free dry strategies developed here pave the way towards engineering a range of electrode materials for next-generation energy storage systems.
