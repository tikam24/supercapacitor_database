In the current investigation, NiO nanoflakes were developed using a simple and cost-effective technique known as hydrothermal method. Effect of variation of Ni precursor with concentration of urea on electrochemical properties was studied. Increased urea concentration in Ni nitrate precursor causes agglomeration of nanoparticles with morphological distortion of nanoflakes. For electrochemical experiments, samples were prepared with Ni:urea precursor ratio such as 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, and 1:10 were used. The ratio of Ni (1):urea (2) precursor indicates the maximum capacitance value 128F g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolytes at a scan rate of at 10 mV s−1.
