The self-decomposition reaction of the nickel ammonia complex was used for the nickel hydroxide formation on the nickel foam with further modification in several ways. The addition of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and the electrochemical or chemical activation with cobalt hydroxide was used to modify the formation method. In all cases, structures with Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes were formed. It was found that the flower-like particles of Co(OH)2 were precipitated during chemical activation among the nanoflakes. It was shown that the presence of PVP during the nickel ammonia complex decomposition suppressed the highly branched particles. The absence of the highly branched particles increased the capacitive properties of the formed electrode at high current densities. The highest capacitance in 1408 F/g at 1 A/g was shown for the sample precipitated with the PVP presence and the further chemical activation by cobalt.
