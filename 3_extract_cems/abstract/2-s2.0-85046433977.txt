In-situ activation for optimizing hierarchically meso-/microporous structure of hollow carbon shells which were produced using a simple calcination process with NaOH was demonstrated to effectively enhance the performance in supercapacitors. The electrical conductivity, pore structure and surface area of the material were tuned by adjusting the amount of NaOH. The optimized sample showed a specific capacitance of 374.3F g-1 at a current density of 0.2A g-1 and 191.0F g-1 at 10A g-1, with almost no degradation after 10,000 cycles.
