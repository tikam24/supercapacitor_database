Despite solid-state energy storage devices are one of the potential candidates for modern electronics, it usually suffers from poor compatibility with gel electrolyte acquiring insufficient energy density. Continuous efforts have been devoted to overcome the energy density paucity. Here, we highlight the strategy to augment the energy density of solid-state electrochemical energy storage device by constructing indigenous Sn doped nickel dichalcogenides nanosheets along with tunable composition. Micrometre size, flat nanosheets offer high compatibility to the gel electrolyte and their porous structure grant multi directional active site access. Modified electronic structure upon cation/anion substitution gain enhanced charge transfer and increased numbers of active sites. Cooperative features of nanostructures and controlled doping, boosted the specific capacity of samples from 134 to 437 mAh/g with remarkable rate retention of 42â€“81%. Prepared range of anion/cation/cation & anion doped nickel dichalcogenides, i.e., NiSSe, Ni0.66Sn0.33S2 and Ni0.66Sn0.33SSe further gain benefit upon coupling with freshly prepared N, S doped bio-derived carbon (OP-850). Resultant, all solid-state energy storage devices delivered 54, 78 and 127 mAh/g cell capacity at 3 A/g with outstanding energy density of 54, 78 and 102 Wh/kg, respectively. These comparative interpretations confer, Ni0.66 Sn0.33SSe//N, S doped OP-850 must be the promising all solid-state energy storage device with exceptional energy density outcome. Excellent cycle stability and LED pattern illumination demonstrate the feasibility of the device. Furthermore, such simple scalable synthesis approach could also extend to prepare other doped metal chalcogenides nanosheets, likely achieve breakthroughs in various applications.
