In this article, we have investigated the electrochemical properties of CuS nanoparticles for supercapacitor applications. The CuS nanoparticles are prepared by a facile one-pot hydrothermal approach using copper nitrate and thiourea as starting materials. The x-ray diffraction study revealed the formation of covellite CuS. The field-emission scanning electron microscope studies suggested the formation of cubic shaped CuS nanoparticles. The electrochemical studies such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed the pseudocapacitive nature of the CuS electrodes. The CuS electrode shows a specific capacitance of about 101.34 F g-1 from the cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 5mVs-1. The electrochemical impedance spectra analyzed using Nyquist plot confirmed the pseudocapacitive behavior of the CuS electrodes.
