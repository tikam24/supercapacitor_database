Carbon-based hybrids with three-dimensional (3D) mesoporous have received considerable attention as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their excellent electrical conductivity. However, the poor mechanical strength of the hybrid significantly affects the long-term cycling stability of SCs, which seriously hinders their practical applications. Herein, a uniform sulphur (S) doped carbon-based hybrid (CSiO2) derives from carbonized bamboo leaves, which has been controllably prepared by solvothermal treatment. The as-prepared material possesses large surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, robust 3D structure and excellent electrochemical properties. Therefore, the as-fabricated product demonstrates superior areal capacitance of 643.2 mF cm−2 and mass capacitance of 107.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 3 M KOH. Furthermore, this sample also displays ultra-long cycling stability, which significantly remains 100% after 20,000 cycles and still maintains 98.1% after 30,000 cycles. Besides, the as-prepared sample reveals higher response (34.65 for 50 ppm NO2) and long-term stability (2.1% maximum fluctuation during 30 days) at room temperature. The obtained S@CSiO2 also exhibits the practical capability with an extremely low limit-of-detection of 500 ppb NO2. Thus, the as-prepared material is a potentially promising alternatives to the electrode of advanced supercapacitors and the sensing layer of gas sensors.
