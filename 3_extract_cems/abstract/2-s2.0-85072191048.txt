Transition metal oxides are considered promising functional materials for energy storage, but their poor conductivity and stability limits their application in energy storage devices. The conductivity and stability of transition metal oxides can be significantly improved by nanostructuring the material, and in this work we report a method for preparing porous Co–Mo–O–S microspheres. As a supercapacitor electrode, Co–Mo–O–S demonstrated a high capacitance of 1134 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as well as a high rate capability. A hybrid supercapacitor composing Co–Mo–O–S vs reduced graphene oxide delivered a high energy density of 67.6 Wh kg−1, which is much higher than most previously reported results. Therefore, Co–Mo–O–S are expected to be widely used in energy storage devices.
