This paper describes the developed complex of vacuum thin-film nanotechnologies for creating electrode materials for supercapacitors. Thin-film technologies, in contrast to thick-film ones, allow more efficient use of surface properties by employing nanostructured materials and structures. The developed complex allows implementing a promising technology for creating a new generation of electrode materials based on a flexible carbon matrix with a highly developed surface.
