SCASA is a new supercapacitor assisted surge protector technique whose goal is to reduce component count in surge protectors while achieving higher surge-withstand capability. Basic topology was developed based on a semi-experimental basis, during the first stage leading to patents and a successful commercial implementation. This paper summarises a numerical analysis applied to the basic circuit to compare and validate its performance with experimental results using a lightning surge simulator and LTSpice simulation. Noiseken LSS6230 was used as the test gear to do the testing according to IEEE C62.4X standards and UL 1449 test procedure. This comparison is used as the basis for further improvement of SCASA topology to withstand higher energy and increased surge repetition.
