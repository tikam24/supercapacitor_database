The fiber wrapped tuberose structured Fe:Sr(OH)2 have been successfully deposited by using a simple and low cost chemical approach of successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors. The structural properties have been obtained by the XRD patterns, while FTIR shows the chemical bond analysis. The FE-SEM micrographs show fiber wrapped tuberose structured morphology and the Fe doping into Sr(OH)2 is confirmed by EDX. The deposited films show the battery type electrode behaviour in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. As an active electrode material, the specific capacity of 871 C g−1 (specific capacitance of 792 F g−1) at 1.2 mA cm−2 with cycle retention of ∼79% at 5 mA cm−2 has been obtained for 0.5 at.% Fe:Sr(OH)2. The electrochemical properties of the synthesised electrode reveal that it has the great potential for next-generation energy storage applications.
