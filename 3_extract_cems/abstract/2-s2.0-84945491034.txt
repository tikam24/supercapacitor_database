This mini-review summarizes recent progress in graphene films as flexible electrodes for various applications such as solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, touchscreens, transistors and supercapacitors. As 'flexibility' has emerged as an important issue in next-generation electronics, many efforts to find new classes of materials have been devoted to realizing stretchable, bendable and foldable electronic devices. For these devices to be realized, graphene has been considered as one of the most promising candidates for flexible electrodes due to its extraordinary electrical, optical and mechanical properties. Particularly, recent developments in the fabrication and modification of graphene point to a bright future for graphene electrodes in flexible electronics. This mini-review summarizes the recent progress in graphene films as flexible electrodes for various applications such as solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes, touchscreens, transistors and supercapacitors.
