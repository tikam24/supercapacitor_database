In this letter, we report a facile strategy to synthesize 3D graphene (3DG)/ZnO nanorods composite networks by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and hydrothermal method. Integration of porous graphene networks and ZnO nanorods as supercapacitor electrode leads to a high specific capacitance (554.23 F/g at 5 mV/s). We have optimized the performance of 3DG/ZnO composite with respect to the contents of ZnO and achieved optimal preparation condition. From practical point of view, we have also evaluated electrochemical stability of present supercapacitor, which retained 94.4% of the initial capacitance after 2300 cycles, demonstrating excellent cycle stability with a high degree of reversibility in the repetitive charge/discharge. Present work might open a new strategy to fabricate functional 3DG and metal oxides composite materials as electrodes for the application in supercapacitors.
