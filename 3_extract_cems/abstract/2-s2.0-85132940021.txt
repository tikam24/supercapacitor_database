In this study, stimulating approach electrodeposition has been espoused to fabricate binder-free electrodes of transition metal sulfides to achieve high electrochemical performance for energy storage devices. Here, the effect of Co and Cu with MnS has been scrutinized by gradually replacing Co with Cu concentration. The fabricated electrodes have been examined by FESEM to analyze the structural morphology of the material. Furthermore, electrochemical characterizations have been carried out for exploring the electrode performance which reveals that the S4 electrode (Cu0.75Co0.25MnS) exhibits the best performance as compared to contender electrodes. This electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 4800 F/g at 10 A/g current density with a smaller ESR value of 0.48 Î©. Additionally, the S4 electrode has been used as a cathode and activated carbon (AC) as an anode in assembling of supercapacitor device. Device S4//AC portrayed a maximum energy density of 118 Wh/kg with a power density of 960 W/kg at 1.2 A/g. The obtained results prophesied that the electrochemical performance of metal sulfides has been intensified by varying the concentration of material for superior electrochemical applications.
