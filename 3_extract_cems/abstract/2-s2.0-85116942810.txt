The emergence of visible light information transmission systems is profoundly affecting the future of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The complex sensing and driving circuits of the IoT have become the key factor to hinder signal conversion and processing. Herein, a high-performance self-variable-voltage light information transmission integrated system (SVV-LTS) is reported and its application potential in low-power, self-powered optical communication transmission systems is demonstrated. Diffusionâ€“adsorption regulation growth method and laser induction technology are innovatively used to realize high-brightness light-emitting diode (LED) and flexible micro-supercapacitor (MSC) on graphene. Meanwhile, MSC realizes the dual functions of supplying power to the system, realizing pressure signal response, and converting pressure signals into electrical signals. Finally, the MSC as power, sensor and LED as signal transmitter are integrated into an SVV-LTS. The response time of SVV-LTS is 80 ms and the luminous wavelength fluctuation of the LED is stable at 1.2 nm. This study will provide a new approach to realize low-power optical communication transmission systems affecting the IoT technology.
