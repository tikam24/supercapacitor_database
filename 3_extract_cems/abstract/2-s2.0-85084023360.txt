In this paper the power capabilities of several lithium batteries and supercapacitors are determined and compared based on measurements of the resistance of the cells at UC Davis. The comparisons were made for pulse efficiencies of 80-95%. It was found that for a pulse efficiency of 95% the batteries had a power density of 500-600 W/kg and most of the supercapacitors had power densities of 1500-2000 W/kg. Hence for applications requiring high efficiency pulses, supercapacitors have higher power densities than lithium batteries by a factor of at least 3-4. The high power supercapacitors have higher power capability than high power lithium batteries for vehicle by a factor of 4-5. The advantages of combining an energy battery (high energy density, low cost, modest power capability) with supercapacitors in plug-in hybrid vehicles PHEV like the Volt was investigated. Simulations of PHEVs with an all-electric range of up to 50 miles indicated that the combination of an energy battery and supercapacitors both decreased the energy use (Wh/mi) of the vehicle and greatly reduced the peak currents from the energy battery by a large factor compared to that in a power battery in the same vehicle.
