Present work describes the superficial incorporation of the RuO2 in pristine PPy matrix by simply immersing the pristine PPy FE in 20 ml of 1 μM aqueous solution of RuCl3 to soak it in PPy matrix followed by drying. XRD shows mostly amorphous nature but there are peaks confirming the existence of tetragonal as well as rutile structures of RuO2. The characteristic peak at 1563 cm−1 in FTIR confirms the formation of PPy. SEM image of the prepared hybrid flexible electrodes (HFEs) exhibits spherical structures embedded in PPy matrix. EDX pattern of the HFE shows the peaks for C, N, O and Ru. The prepared HFEs were electrochemically analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The observed maximum SC was found to be 1010.4 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 0.2 M Na2SO4. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
