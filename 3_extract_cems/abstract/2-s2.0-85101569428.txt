Graphene is attractive two-dimensional (2D) carbon nanomaterial has excellent mechanical flexibility, superior electrical conductivity and high thermal/chemical stability. Many reports have been available on applications of graphene in different fields. Present work describes an easy way to prepare graphene embedded conducting Polyvinylidene-difluoride (PVDF) membrane pore size 0.22 Î¼m. In this work graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by modified hummer method and then graphene oxide was reduced by using ascorbic acid. Graphene-PVDF flexible nanohybrid film was prepared. The film was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. FESEM, XRD and FTIR results ascertained the presence of graphene on polymer membrane. Supercapacitor application of the PVDF-graphene conductive paper was investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV).
