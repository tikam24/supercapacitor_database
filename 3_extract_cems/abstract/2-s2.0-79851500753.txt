A printable, all solid-state photo-supercapacitor (PSC) incorporating both organic photovoltaic (OPV) and supercapacitor (SC) functions has been demonstrated utilizing a single-walled carbon nanotube network, enabling a thinner (< 0.6 mm) and lighter (< 1 g) device architecture, which leads to a 43% reduction in device internal resistance as compared to external wire connected OPVs and SCs.
