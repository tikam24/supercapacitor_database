Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are promising energy storage materials owing to their rigid and cross-linked microporous structures. However, the fabrication of nano- and microstructured CMP films for practical applications is currently limited by processing challenges. Herein, we report that combined sono-cavitation and nebulization synthesis (SNS) is an effective method for the synthesis of CMP films from a monomer precursor solution. Using the SNS, the scalable fabrication of microporous and redox-active CMP films can be achieved via the oxidative C-C coupling polymerization of the monomer precursor. Intriguingly, the ultrasonic frequency used during SNS strongly affects the synthesis of the CMP films, resulting in an approximately 30% improvement in reaction yields and ca. 1.3-1.7-times enhanced surface areas (336-542 m2/g) at a high ultrasonic frequency of 180 kHz compared to those at 120 kHz. Furthermore, we prepare highly conductive, three-dimensional porous electrodes [CMP/carbon nanotube (CNT)] by a layer-by-layer sequential deposition of CMP films and CNTs via SNS. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor comprising the CMP/CNT cathode and carbon anode shows a high specific capacitance of 477 F/g at 1 A/g with a wide working potential window (0-1.4 V) and robust cycling stability, exhibiting 94.4% retention after 10,000 cycles.
