The preparation of highly graphitic carbon materials encourages the synthesis of sustainable energy storage for fast charging power applications. In this consideration, at present work, porous nitrogen-doped carbon nano-onions (N-CNO) were prepared by a different strategic, simple, low-cost, one-step pyrolysis technique. The fabricated material was characterized by various physical and electroanalytical measurements. The D, G, and 2D bands from Raman and pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and pyridinic-N-O from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the graphitic nature of the N-CNO material. The results of specific capacitance for the as-grown materials containing N-CNO at a current density of 1 A/g have achieved a specific capacitance of 234 F g− 1. Moreover, the retention of N-CNO after 5000 long charge/discharge was 98%. The utilizing voltages of the synthesized asymmetric devices were expanded to 1.6 V in 2 M KOH solution, providing a notable specific capacitance of 79 F g−1 and higher energy densities of 27.2 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. Mainly, even at higher current densities (10 A/g) this device still holds higher power densities (7.5 kW kg−1) while keeping 12 Wh kg−1 energy densities. Nevertheless, the well-being asymmetric device explores notable electrochemical cycling stabilities and capacitance retention of 98% over 5000 at 8 A g−1. These values evident that N–CNO will have been utilized as a surrogate electrode source and a potential candidate in SCs with higher specifical energy/power densities.
