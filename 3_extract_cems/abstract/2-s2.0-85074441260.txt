During past years, hybrid energy and its storage system has become solution of non-stop supply, reliable, eco-friendly energy supply to power electronic (PE) devices. Supply given to power electronic devices by storage system can give required energy and enhance its characteristics for specific task. In todayâ€™s generation requirement of energy at a time can be filled by renewable sources of energy by combining it properly with energy storage system. This paper is focused on use of supercapacitor and Battery Association Methodology for hybrid vehicle system. So, the set of Motor drive and generator is set to control gear system of vehicle, and the energy is delivered by a set of two capacitor, each having 108 module produces maximum of 270 volt to complete the requirement. The produced voltage can also enhanced by using multi-bridge and multi-boost converter to good power management. The output voltage of converter topology is directly connected to rotor of DC motor drive and generator set wheel, so it is easier to achieve desired speed of vehicle. In this paper multi-bridge and multi-boost converter is simulated and studies with the application of supercapacitor in battery energy storage system.
