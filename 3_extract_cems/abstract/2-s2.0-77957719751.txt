Co-based layered double hydroxides(LDHs) with different metal cations in the host layers, were prepared by modulating the composition of trivalent cations. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and X-ray diffraction(XRD) patterns of the as-prepared samples indicate that the changes of the trivalent cations in the host layers have a great influence on the structures of the LDHs. The results of the electrochemical tests also present some differences. The different trivalent cations of Co-based LDHs have a significant impact on the effective potential work window, which also can influence the stability at large current density and capacity retention characteristic in cycle test. Due to the different roles of divalent and trivalent metal ions on the electrochemical performance, Co-Al LDHs has a specific capacitance of 447 F -g-1 at the discharge current density of 1 A -g-1; Both Co-In LDHs and Co-Cr LDHs have better cycle stability and capacitance behavior than Co-Al LDHs.
