Fabrication of novel and efficient electrodes for green and renewable hybrid energy storage systems is an effective approach to deal with energy crisis. In this work, hierarchical nanosheet-based MnCoP hollow nanocubes electrode with the battery type feature has been successfully synthesized by a simple hard and soft acid-base (HSAB) approach followed by a heat treatment. By taking advantage of the remarkable merits including uniform morphology, electrical conductivity, structural stability, large surface area as well as the battery type feature, the nanosheet-based MnCoP hollow nanocubes electrode exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance with high specific capacity of 879C g−1 at 2 A g−1 excellent cycling stability of 94.4% capacity retention after 6,000 cycles, and maximum energy and power density of 66.98 Wh Kg−1 and 16446 W Kg−1, respectively.
