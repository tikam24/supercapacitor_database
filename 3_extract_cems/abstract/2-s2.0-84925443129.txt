Abstract LaxSr1-xCu0.1Mn0.9O3-δ (LNF-x) (0.1 ≤ x ≥ 1) nanofibers are prepared by electrospun method. The structure of LNF-x and the electrochemical properties of LNF-x in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte are investigated. As a result, LNF-x nanofibers present a perovskite structure, and the LNF-0.5 sample exhibits the highest specific capacitance value of 464.5 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1. The maximum energy density of 64.5 W h kg-1 are achieved at a power density of 2 kW kg-1 for the symmetric supercapacitor prepared by La0.5Sr0.5Cu0.1Mn0.9O3-δ nanofibers. More importantly, this symmetric supercapacitor also shows an excellent cycling life after 2000 charging and discharging cycles. Those results offer a suitable design of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
