We report the bulk phase synthesis of graphene sheets using waste plastic (WP) as a precursor following a modified pyrolysis approach. Furthermore, the low and high mass loading of vanadium pentaoxide was performed on graphene sheets in 1 : 10 and 1 : 1 ratios, respectively. Advanced characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) analysis, and SEM imaging were used to confirm the synthesis of graphene. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed that the resonating structure affects the bond strength in the composite, which enables peak shifting in the FT-IR spectrum of the composite. Furthermore, bandgap analysis has been performed using UV-Vis spectroscopy, which confirmed the synthesis of the composites. The developed vanadium-doped graphene was used as the active material for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. The electrochemical performance of these devices was evaluated in 1 M H3PO4 solution using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fabricated cells 1 and 2 showed exceptional specific capacitances of 139.7 F g−1 and 51.2 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate, respectively. Cell 1 showed a huge power density of 5312 W kg−1 and an energy density of 19.7 W h kg−1. Conversely, cell 2 showed a comparatively lower power density of 1941 W kg−1 and an energy density of 7.2 W h kg−1 at a 5 mV s−1 scan rate. Moreover, we disclose some brief conclusions on the performance, mechanism, and required modifications that can improve the performance of such devices. This approach can surely help with universal WP problems as well as the development of high-performance supercapacitors.
