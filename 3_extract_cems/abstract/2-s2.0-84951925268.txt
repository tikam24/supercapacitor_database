Hybrid CeO2/Fe2O3 composite nanospindles (CNSs) are synthesized by a simple and cost effective co-precipitation method. CeO2/Fe2O3 CNSs used as an efficient recyclable photocatalyst for degrading Eosin Yellow (EY) dye under visible light irradiation possess a high degradation rate of 98% after 25 min. The estimated electrical energy efficiency of CeO2/Fe2O3 CNSs shows the consumption of less energy (6.588 kW h m-3 per order) in degrading EY. Besides, the CeO2/Fe2O3 CNS exhibits a specific capacitance of 142.6 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Moreover, the composite displays an excellent capacitance retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles. This newly designed CeO2/Fe2O3 CNS with enhanced visible light-driven photocatalytic activity and good supercapacitive cycling stability has great potential for use in wastewater treatment and energy storage applications.
