Hierarchical NiO/MnO2 nanosheet array were synthesized by chemical bath deposition and hydrothermal method. XRD and SEM show that NiO nanosheets vertically grow on Ni foam and connect with each other to form a net-like array. Then, MnO2 nano mesoporous foam deposites on both sides of NoO nanosheets, constructing NiO/MnO2 core-shell composite structure. Pseudocapacitance performances were examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatİc charge-dİscharge. Compared wİth sİngle NiO and MnO2, hierarchoical NiO/MnO2 nanosheet array shows İmproved electrochemİcal performances, exhİbiting hİgh specific capacİtance of 1 297 F· g-1 at 1 A -g-1 and 97% retentİon at 2 A·g-1 after 1 000 cycles, whìch is due to the fact that the hierarchical nanosheet array structure quickens mass transfer of the electrolyte, enlarges contact between active material with the electrolyte, promotes pseudocapacİtance reactİon and enhances structure stability of NiO and MnO2.
