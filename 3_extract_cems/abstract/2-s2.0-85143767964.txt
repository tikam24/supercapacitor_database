Herein, a fully paper-based all-solid-state supercapacitor with functionalized cellulose paper as electrodes, carboxymethyl cellulose gel as solid electrolyte and cellulose paper as separator was fabricated. The electrode was fabricated by a conventional papermaking process with silver-modified fibers and graphene oxide (GO)-modified fibers followed by reduction of GO. The Ag-modified fibers and GO-modified fibers were obtained by in situ growth of Ag nanoparticles and self-assembly of GO sheets on cellulose fibers, respectively. Ag-modified fibers act as a flexible current collector with rich three-dimensional interconnected electron transport pathways to make the reduced GO-modified fibers as electrode materials to achieve high conductivity (1.93 Ω sq−1) and high-rate capability. Simple drying can reduce 40% weight of the supercapacitor to facilitate transportation and storage, and its capacitance efficiency can be recovered by wetting when needed. This work opens up a new way of developing cheap, green and high performance full-paper flexible electronics by conventional papermaking process. (Figure presented.).
