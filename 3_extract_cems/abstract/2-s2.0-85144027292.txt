Hybrid supercapacitors signify a potential candidate for highly stable energy storage devices because of their excellent power density, low cost, and inherent safety. Hydrothermal method was used to synthesize NGO (Nitrogen doped graphene oxide)/NiWO3 (nickel tungstate)/PANI (polyaniline)) nanocomposite (NC). GCD analysis offers noticeable enhanced specific capacitance of 1380 F/g as compared to NiWO3 (670 F/g) and displays the cycle stability for 10 000 cycles with 92.6 % retention of capacitance at the current density of 0.5 A/g, and also shows a high energy density of 47.8 W h kgâˆ’1. These obtainable outcomes propose that NGO/NiWO3/PANI can be considered an efficient electrode for highly stable supercapacitors.
