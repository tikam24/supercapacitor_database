Rapidly growing need for steady electric supply has led to energy crises owing to inconsistent renewable and inadequate non-renewable energy sources, underscoring the need for reliable hybrid energy storage systems which synergize contrasting electrical characteristics and execute sustained electrochemical performance. Supercapacitors transcend the performance of traditional energy storage systems, imparting significantly higher power densities and longer life cycles with its hybridization gaining paramount attention attributed to the utilization of polymer nanocomposites. These advanced nanocomposites deliver exceptional ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical stability with significant capacitance, high cyclic stability under deformation offering energy density of at least 50 Wh/kg and power density of 3 kW/kg. In this review, potential of complex polymer nanocomposites as electrodes and electrolytes to achieve high energy density supercapacitors have been extensively elaborated. Subsequently, examining trade-off between model complexity and computational cost, continuum level approaches are emphasized to comprehend the influence of electrode and electrolyte morphologies coupled with validation against experimental studies. The overall objective is to briefly propose techniques to design and model multifunctional supercapacitors to enhance their performance.
