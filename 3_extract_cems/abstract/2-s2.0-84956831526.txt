The increasing worldwide interest in MnO2 for supercapacitor applications is based on anticipation that MnO2 based high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors will ultimately serve as safety and low cost alternative to state-of-the-art commercial organic EDLC or RuO2-based acid systems. In this chapter, the crystalline structure features, synthesis method, charge storage mechanism of MnO2 as well as the current status of MnO2 based supercapacitors are summarized and introduced in detail.
