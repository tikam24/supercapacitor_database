Lignin, one of the components of natural plant biomass, is a rich source of carbon and has excellent potential as a valuable, sustainable source of carbon material. Low-cost lignosulfonate (LS) doped with polyaniline (PANI) has been used as a precursor to produce porous carbon. LS has a highly dispersed and sparse microstructure and can be accidentally doped with S atoms. N and S double-doped carbon can be directly synthesized with abundant mesopores and high surface area in a lamellar network using PANI as another doping source. This study explored the optimal conditions of LS/PANI material with different amounts of lignosulfonate and different carbonization temperatures. When the amount of lignosulfonate was 4 g and the carbonization temperature was 700 °C, graded porous carbon was obtained, and the electrochemical performance was the best. At 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance reached 333.50 F/g (three-electrode system) and 242.20 F/g (two-electrode system). After 5000 charge/discharge cycles at 5 A/g, the material maintained good cycling stability and achieved a capacitance retention rate of 95.14% (three-electrode system) and 97.04% (two-electrode system). The energy and power densities of the SNC700 samples were 8.33 Wh/kg and 62.5 W/kg at 0.25 A/g, respectively, values that meet the requirements of today’s commercially available supercapacitor electrode materials, further demonstrating their good practicality. This paper provides an efficient double-doping method to prepare layered structures. Porous carbon is used for electrochemical energy storage devices.
