To meet the requirement of the flexible supercapacitors, the enhancement of the mechanical properties of the gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) membrane attracts more and more attention. Here a novel PAM-PVP GPE has been developed with a semi-interpenetrating (semi-IPN) structure, which can achieve the superior flexibility and stretchability (elongation at break of 17.42 mm/mm), meantime, the ionic conductivity reaches 0.138 S/cm. The PAM-PVP-H3PO4 GPE supercapacitor shows outstanding cycle stability and can bear complex deformations including bending and stretching. In addition, it possesses the stable electrochemical performances (65% capacitance retention) at -20 Â°C. The supercapacitor is promising for the application in the flexible electronic devices under low temperature condition.
