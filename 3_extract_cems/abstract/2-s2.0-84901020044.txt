Very high surface area activated carbons (AC) are synthesized from pine cone petals by a chemical activation process and subsequently evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications in a nonaqueous medium. The maximum specific surface area of ∼3950 m2 g-1 is noted for the material treated with a 1:5 ratio of KOH to pine cone petals (PCC5), which is much higher than that reported for carbonaceous materials derived from various other biomass precursors. A symmetric supercapacitor is fabricated with PCC5 electrodes, and the results showed enhanced supercapacitive behavior with the highest energy density of ∼61 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, outstanding cycling ability is evidenced for such a configuration, and ∼90 % of the initial specific capacitance after 20 000 cycles under harsh conditions was observed. This result revealed that the pine-cone-derived high-surface-area AC can be used effectively as a promising electrode material to construct high-energy-density supercapacitors. Pine cones: Not just for squirrels! Activated carbon with an ultrahigh surface area (∼3950 m2 g -1) was prepared from pine cone petals by using a chemical activation process for high-performance supercapacitor applications. The symmetric supercapacitor cell with such carbon electrodes delivered a discharge capacitance of ∼111 F g-1 with excellent capacitance retention. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
