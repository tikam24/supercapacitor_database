Herein, we demonstrate a simple approach for the fabrication of MWCNT film on PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane using vacuum filtration set-up. PVDF is a fluoropolymer with large number of applications as binder/separator in batteries and supercapacitors. In this work, a stable CNT/PVDF paper was formed. The film was then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopic techniques. The conductive paper was tested for super capacitor application. This study may pave a new way to make polymer-carbon nanomaterial and nanotube composite, which can have various applications in the field of strain sensors, flexible conductors, supercapacitors, and flexible batteries.
