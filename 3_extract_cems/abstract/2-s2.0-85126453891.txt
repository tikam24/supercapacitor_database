The rapid expansion of wearable electronic devices boosts the development of energy storage minicomponents. Among them, the on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have aroused widespread interest due to their distinctive characteristics, e.g., long cycle life, high power density, etc. Herein, an on-chip MSC device is fabricated by using an isocyanide-based coordination polymer framework as electrode material. Due to the narrow bandgap, flexibility, and compatibility of the coordination polymer, such MSC device with LiCl/PVA electrolyte delivers large capacitances (up to 0.98 mF cm−2 and 20.56 F cm−3 at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1) and a short time constant (0.026 ms), which are comparable to the state-of-the-art MSCs with polymer film electrodes. Moreover, this MSC device exhibits good AC line-filtering ability (−70.8° at 120 Hz). This work introduces an implementable interfacial method to obtain coordination polymer frameworks for constructing miniaturized energy storage devices.
