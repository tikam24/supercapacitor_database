Herein, we for the first time develop two facile and fast steps (including magnetron sputtering and electro-oxidation) to grow a hierarchical forest-like Cu2O/Cu array architecture onto the three-dimensional fiber framework of cellulose paper. The Cu rods serve as the trunk and the oxidation product (Cu2O) acts as branches. When utilized as a flexible and free-standing electrode, the unique architecture made full use of a large interfacial area from the hierarchical multi-scale structure of the forest-like array, numerous channels for rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions from the porous fiber skeleton of hydrophilic cellulose paper, and fast electron transport and high electrochemical activity from the Cu2O/Cu complex. These merits endowed the electrode with a high specific capacitance of 915 F g-1 (238 mF cm-2) at 3.8 A g-1, a large specific energy of 53.7 W h kg-1 at 1.25 kW kg-1, superior rate capability, and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 91.7% after cycling 10000 times. More importantly, an easy interesting strategy was proposed to assemble a symmetric supercapacitor based on the Cu2O/Cu/cellulose hybrid paper, that is, growing the forest-like Cu2O/Cu array onto the two surfaces of cellulose paper. The device delivered a high specific capacitance of 409 F g-1 (213 mF cm-2) at 1.9 A g-1, a superior specific energy of 24.0 W h kg-1 at 0.625 kW kg-1 and good cycling stability (90.2% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles). These fascinating results unveil the potential of the hybrid paper as a high-performance electrode material for flexible energy storage devices and portable electronics.
