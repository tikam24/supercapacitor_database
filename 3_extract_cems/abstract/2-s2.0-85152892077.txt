The composites of metal oxides and carbons are of research interest for improving the energy density of supercapacitors. In this work, we have demonstrated a simple one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method to prepare NiO nanorods followed by carbon framework decorated NiO nanorods (NiO@C). The NiO@C electrode showed an excellent specific capacitance of 1360 F g−1 compared to pristine NiO of 890 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a voltage range of 0.05 to 0.5 V in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The NiO@C electrodes showed excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles with 90 % capacitance retention. Asymmetric supercapacitors fabricated using corncob-derived activated carbon anode, and NiO@C cathode delivers a power density of 4574 W kg−1 at an energy density of 21.6 Wh kg−1. The enhanced capacitance of NiO@C material is due to the synergistic effect of the pseudocapacitive of NiO nanorods and the electric double-layer capacitance of the carbon matrix. Besides, the carbon framework facilitates quick charge acceptance, improved cycling stability, and rate capability. The cost-effective one-pot synthesis and eco-friendly NiO nanorods with easy electrode fabrication open opportunities for developing high-energy-density NiO-based supercapacitors.
