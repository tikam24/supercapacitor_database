A cost-effective and sustainable approach has been developed to synthesize N-doped carbon material from fishbone waste via a one-step carbonization without an addition of chemical activator as a catalyst. The carbonization temperature can be optimized so that a favorable layered structure is achieved in 3D-flake nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NPC). NPC-850 (NPC that was carbonized at 850 °C) not only has a high specific surface area of up to 1337 m2 g−1, but is also richly doped with heteroatoms (N and O content of 5.8 and 7.99 at.%, respectively). NPC-850 also exhibits an excellent electrochemical supercapacitor (SC) performance, i.e., a maximum specific capacitance of 476 F g−1 in a three-electrode system and 354 F g−1 in a symmetrical SC (both in a 1 M H2SO4), and a maximum energy density of 21.2 Wh kg−1 in a symmetrical SC (in a 1 M TEABF4/AN). Moreover, NPC-850 can achieve high cycling stability, with 90.9% retaining of the original capacitance after 10,000 continuous cycles at a 1 A g−1 current density. Such an outstanding performance suggests that our facile and scalable synthesis technique is effective to prepare porous carbon from biomass for electrochemical energy storage.
