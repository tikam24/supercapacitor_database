Due to the variable nature of the photovoltaic generation, energy storage is imperative, and the combination of both in one device is appealing for more efficient and easy-to-use devices. Among the myriads of proposed approaches, there are multiple challenges to overcome to make these solutions realistic alternatives to current systems. This paper classifies and identifies previous efforts to achieve integrated photovoltaic storage devices. Moreover, the gaps and future perspectives are analysed to give an overview of the field, paying attention to low-power devices (<10 W) as well as high-power devices (>10 W). We focus on devices that combine solar cells with supercapacitors or batteries, providing information about the structure, materials used, and performance. On the one hand, small power devices must concentrate on including power electronics to increase the efficiency of the system as well as ensuring a safe operation; likewise, more attention should be drawn to validate the feasibility of novel concepts by carrying out more realistic and standardised tests, including long-term testing. On the other hand, high-power devices must be researched thoroughly to evaluate the impact of high temperatures on energy storage and solar module ageing; furthermore, optimum system sizing is a relevant topic that deserves attention and its relation to modular solutions. This critical literature review serves as a guide to understand the characteristics of the approaches followed to integrate photovoltaic devices and storage in one device, shedding light on the improvements required to develop more robust products for a sustainable future.
