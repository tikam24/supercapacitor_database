Ultrathin cobalt phosphate (CoHPO4·3H2O) nanosheets are successfully synthesized by a one pot hydrothermal method. Novel CoHPO4·3H2O ultrathin nanosheets are assembled for constructing the electrodes of supercapacitors. Benefiting from the nanostructures, the as-prepared electrode shows a specific capacitance of 413 F g-1, and no obvious decay even after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. Such a quasi-two-dimensional material is a new kind of supercapacitor electrode material with high performance. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
