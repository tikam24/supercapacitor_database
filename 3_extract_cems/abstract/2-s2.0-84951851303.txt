Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) were successfully coated by uniform, adherent and homogenous ultra-thin crystalline diamond films through microwave enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MWCVD). The as-grown functionalized nanowires were employed as electrodes in a symmetric micro-supercapacitor (MSC) using a protic ionic liquid electrolyte [triethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide; Et3NH TFSI]. The electrochemical performance of the device delivered a specific capacitance of 1.5 mF cm- 2 and a power density of 25 mW cm- 2 using an enlarged cell voltage of 4 V. Furthermore, a remarkable cycling stability was evaluated after 1Â·106 galvanostatic cycles at a high current density of 10 mA cm- 2 with an excellent capacitive behavior. These results confirm that diamond-coated SiNW micro-supercapacitors exhibit very promising performances dealing with MSCs based on CVD-grown SiNWs.
