Graphene-based materials with novel properties are widely applied in energy storage fields. In the last two decades, various methods have been used to prepare graphene-based materials, in which the supercritical fluid (SCF) technology exhibits unique advantages. This review summarizes the advantages of SCF technology in preparing graphene-based materials and their applications in energy storage systems. Firstly, the fundamental properties of graphene, graphene oxide (GO), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are introduced. Then, the SCF exfoliation, deposition, doping, and drying process in graphene-based materials are presented. In the last section, the performance of graphene-based materials in supercapacitors, Lithium-ion batteries, Sodium-ion batteries, fuel cells, and thermal storage systems are overviewed, respectively. This review reveals that the SCF technology can produce graphene-based materials with unique properties and would promote their applications in energy storage.
