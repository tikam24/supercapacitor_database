Direct growth of layered MoS2 nanoworms on low-cost bendable SSM has been physically achieved for flexible supercapacitor utilization. The homogeneously grown MoS2@SSM electrode demonstrates several electroactive cavities, facilitating the swift diffusion and additional pathways for Na+-ion intercalation. The structural and morphological features of MoS2 thin film grown at optimized substrate temperature (300 °C) revealed the formation of the porous array of intermixed nanoworms. The advanced electrode delivers a specific capacitance of 214.90 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. The specific energy of 28.05 Wh/kg is obtained at 0.26 kW/kg, further elucidating the rich electrochemical response. A wide voltage window of 1.2 V with elongated cycling (retains ∼88% capacitance after 3000 cycles) has been achieved by MoS2@SSM electrode (dimensions 1 × 1 cm2). Moreover, Dunn's technique has gauged the origin of dual contribution in charge storage mechanism and considerable dominance of capacitive contribution over faradic one. The synthesized electrode has been investigated at a bending angle of 180° (retains ∼92%), signifying better mechanical stability and pliability. As practical applicability in the flexible supercapacitor, the contemporary route yields a cathode of enormous potential, which may enable new possibilities in wearable hands-on electronics and demonstrate a framework to manifest its real practical application.
