The article concerns dynamics of an open system (OS) considered as a subsystem of some closed Hamiltonian system. Description of such OS is carried out in terms of integro-differential generalization of the Liouville equation. The Mellin transform allows to present this equation in terms of fractional operators. In frame of these concepts the response problem is formulated and applied to the supercapacitor dynamics. A good agreement with experimental data is found.
