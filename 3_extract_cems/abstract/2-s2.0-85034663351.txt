A DC bus voltage ripple suppression method based on super-capacitor (SC) was proposed under unbalanced load. Firstly, the influence of unbalanced load on DC microgrid was analyzed. And then, depending on the mathematical model of the SC compensation device, current control strategy of the SC was designed using the sliding mode control (SMC) to precisely track the pulsating current. Furthermore, parameters design of the SC compensation device was given considering the most serious condition of unbalanced load. Finally, simulations were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.
