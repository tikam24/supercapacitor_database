In this study, alpha-manganese dioxide/activated expanded graphite (α-MnO2/AEG) composite was successfully synthesized using simple hydrothermal method. Morphology, structure, elemental composition and specific surface area of the material were characterised by scanning electron microscope (SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Electrochemical evaluations were achieved using three- and two-electrode configurations in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of 185.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 was recorded for three-electrode measurements. The half-cell retained an efficiency of 99.7% over 2000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The fabricated device using α-MnO2/AEG composite and activated carbon-polyvinyl alcohol (AC-PVA) as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, showed a remarkable capacitive property with a specific energy of 33 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 999 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1 within 2.0 V cell potential. Great stability of 97.8% was observed at a specific current of 5 A g−1 for over 10, 000 cycles. Further stability of the device was confirmed by performing a voltage holding of up to 70 h and retained 70% of its initial capacitance at 5 A g−1.
