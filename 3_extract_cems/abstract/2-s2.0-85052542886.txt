The power output of wind farms is directly dependent on the instantaneous wind speed. At variable weather conditions there will be an instantaneous excess of electrical power that cannot be stored by a conventional battery bank. In recent years, great progress has been made in the development of short term storage units like ultracapacitors, which are capable of absorbing high power pulses within seconds. Another advantage of ultracapacitors is a high number of charge cycles. This article focuses on a hybrid energy storage system consisting of ultracapacitors and a battery bank. Ultracapacitors are used to store temporarily the energy that the batteries are unable to absorb due to the power limit in the charging process caused by their electrochemical properties. Afterwards the energy stored in the capacitors is transferred to the batteries. The article is focused on the optimal battery-to-capacitor ratio. The hypothesis is a storage capacity ratio of 1:1500 in favour of batteries. Simulations on the basis of measured solar and wind production data are made for this purpose.
