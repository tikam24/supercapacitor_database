Carbon nanotube (CNTs) fibers with high conductivity and excellent electrochemical properties are the most promising candidate materials for flexible supercapacitor electrodes. Utilizing the high energy storage characteristics of MXene materials, this paper designed and prepared the novel MXene/CNTs/HA hybrid fibers by wet spinning methods with sodium hyaluronate (HA) as the dispersant, and MXene and CNTs powder as main materials. The volumetric capacitance of obtained MXene/CNTs/HA hybrid fibers can reach 13.95 ± 2.45 F/cm3 and the retention rate of capacitance could remain 82 % after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. These results indicate that MXene/CNTs/HA hybrid fibers have great potential application in flexible supercapacitors and multi-functional electronic devices.
