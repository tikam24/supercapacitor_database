Intrinsically conducting polymers ICPs can be combined with further electrochemically active materials into composites for use as active masses in supercapacitor electrodes. Typical examples are inspected with particular attention to the various roles played by the constituents of the composites and to conceivable synergistic effects. Stability of composite electrode materials, as an essential property for practical application, is addressed, taking into account the observed causes and effects of materials degradation.
