Three-dimensional NixCo3−xS4@NiCo2O4 (x = 1.8) hybrid nanostructures supported on Ni foam was designed and fabricated for supercapacitor. Among different Ni-Co stoichiometries of NixCo3−xS4 electrode materials studied, NixCo3−xS4 (x = 1.8) electrode materials showed the highest capacitance of 1.908 F/cm2. Moreover, the smart combination of NixCo3−xS4 (x = 1.8) and NiCo2O4 electrode materials exhibited strong synergistic effect with significantly enhanced performances of areal capacitance up to 4.44 F/cm2.
