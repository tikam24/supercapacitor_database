Nano-dots are nano-materials with a size specifically less than 10nm. Carbon nano-dots (also known as carbon dots or carbon quantum dots) are carbon-based materials. They are an emerging class of nano-material researched for their synthetic methods, properties, and applications. This chapter begins with a brief introduction to nano-dots. Next, their synthetic pathways and properties are briefly discussed. The chapter mainly focuses on the electronic applications of nano-dots. Thus, most of the chapter covers the electronic properties of nano-dots. Finally, the chapter concludes with some important advantages, challenges, and possible solutions regarding carbon nano-dots.
