We report on the electrochemical and capacitive behaviors of poly(2,2-dimethyl-3,4-propylene-dioxythipohene) (PProDOT-Me2) films as polymeric electrodes in Type I electrochemical supercapacitors. The supercapacitor device displays robust capacitive charging/discharging behaviors with specific capacitance of 55 F/g, based on 60 μg of PProDOT-Me2 per electrode, that retains over 85% of its storage capacity after 32 000 redox cycles at 78% depth of discharge. Moreover, an appreciable average energy density of 6 Wh/kg has been calculated for the device, along with well-behaved and rapid capacitive responses to 1.0 V between 5 to 500 mV s-1. Tandem electrochemical supercapacitors were assembled in series, in parallel, and in combinations of the two to widen the operating voltage window and to increase the capacitive currents. Four supercapacitors coupled in series exhibited a 4.0 V charging/discharging window, whereas assembly in parallel displayed a 4-fold increase in capacitance. Combinations of both serial and parallel assembly with six supercapacitors resulted in the extension of voltage to 3 V and a 2-fold increase in capacitive currents. Utilization of bipolar electrodes facilitated the encapsulation of tandem supercapacitors as individual, flexible, and lightweight supercapacitor modules. © 2010 American Chemical Society.
