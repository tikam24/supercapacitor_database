The electrochemical and supercapacitive properties of an electrochemically deposited graphene oxide-polypyrrole composite are investigated. Graphene oxide (GO) for this study is synthesized by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite rod in 0.1M H2SO4 solution, with graphite rod for exfoliation is recycled from waste C-type primary battery. One step deposition of graphene oxide-polypyrrole (GO-PPy) composite using electrochemical technique by Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was successful. FEG-SEM, XRD, Raman, and FTIR technique were used to examine the physical properties of the deposited film. The deposited composite's surface morphology demonstrates a uniform and evenly distributed composite film. Electrochemical properties and supercapacitive behavior of composite are investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and stability in 0.5M NaCl solution. The influence of GO proportion in composite on total capacitance is assessed, and the number of CV cycles is optimized to investigate the effect of mass loading on total capacitance. It is found that the capacitance of the composite increases with increasing GO proportion, with a maximum at 20% GO, whereas the mass loading effect shows decrease in capacitance with increasing number of CV cycles during coating. The 20% GO-PPy composite has maximum capacitance of 111.11 Cg−1 for 2 cycles at 5 mVs−1. This increase in capacitance with increase in GO proportion is attributed to improved synergetic effect of between EDLC type GO and the pseudocapacitive type PPy.
