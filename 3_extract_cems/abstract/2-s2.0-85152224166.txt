Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are a type of inorganic–organic porous material with high specific surface area, high porosity, and diverse functions, have attracted widespread scientific interest in the field of electrical storage. In particular, the MOFs based on iron-series elements (Fe, Co, Ni) offer benefits owing to their low toxicity, low cost, numerous structures and morphologies, and decent stability, highlighting their remarkable potential for practical applications. To offer a general approach for devising iron-series metal-based MOFs with electrochemical storage attributes, this paper reviews the recent applications of pristine iron-series metal-based MOFs and their derivatives in supercapacitors and lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and lithium–sulfur batteries. The electrochemical properties of these materials are discussed and compared to further broaden their electrode applications. Finally, the problems and prospects of iron-series metal-based MOF materials are summarized by surveying the progress made in this field.
