R321, Beidou satellite communication has become an important access communication mode to electric energy data acquisition system of the remote areas and signal blind areas. To realize integration and miniaturization of power Beidou terminal equipment, this paper proposes an integrated scheme that developing a power Beidou communication module to replace the GPRS module in the power terminal equipment. The key technical problem of power supply and structural design of the module is solved by connecting supercapacitor in parallel with Beidou basic module and vertical double deck layout. Through comparison experiments and system tests, the results show that this scheme realized integration and guaranteed the communication success rate of electric energy data acquisition system.
