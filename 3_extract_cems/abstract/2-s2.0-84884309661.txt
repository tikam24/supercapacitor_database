In the present investigation, silver vanadium sulfide (SVS) anchored by PANI matrix nanocomposite (NC) was synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline. For the preparation of NC, aniline, silver nitrate, ammonium metavanadate and thiourea (TU) were used as the precursors. TU was used as a metal ion complex forming agent as well as a source of sulfur. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) spectroscopic investigation indicate the presence of two layers: outer layer is of PANI, and middle layer is of SVS. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) study shows good coverage of PANI on the surface of SVS spherical particles. The presented NCs are found to be an effective and facile technique for improving the electrochemical performance and stability, than PANI alone, for supercapacitors. The capacitance of PANI-anchored SVS is 440 F g-1 and that of PANI is found to be 128 F g-1. The dependence of the impedance behavior of the PANI-anchored SVS nanospheres NCs film was studied systematically. The results are interpreted on the basis of an Adatom model. Moreover, the formation of binary transition metal sulfides has been demonstrated at optimum conditions. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
