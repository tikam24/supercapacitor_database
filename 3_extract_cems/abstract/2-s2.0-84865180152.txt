Through pseudo-high dilution technique, the new electrode materials of aqueous dispersed polyaniline nanowires with diameter of 78 ∼-90 nm,18 ∼30 nm and 16∼25 nm are prepared employing acidic phosphate ester containing one ethylene glycol unit as dopant acid, in which ammonium persulfate, ferric nitrate and ferric chloride are used as oxidant, respectively. Accordingly, electrical conductivities of polyaniline films can reach 18, 32 and 35 S cm -1 ,and their surface areas are 65, 70 and 82 m 2 g -1 ,respectively. As an ecofriendly active electrode material for supercapacitor,nanofiberous polyaniline can be well dispersed into water. Specific capacitance as high as 110, 140 and 152 F g -1 at discharge rate of 0.4 A g -1 from -1 V to 1 V in 1 mol L -1 tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/propylene carbonate solution is obtained, which is affected strongly by the surface area and electrical conductivity and the values increase with the increasing surface area and conductivity. Polyaniline nanowire provides high discharge/charge efficiency above 98% ,indicating that nanofibrous polyaniline possesses good electrochemical reversibility and discharge/charge rate-control capability.
