As the sustainable carbon resources, biomass wastes have attracted increasing research attention because of their natural porous structure, low cost as well as abundant heterogeneous groups, showing great potential in synthesizing carbon materials for advanced supercapacitors. In this work, N, O co-doped micro-mesoporous carbon (MMC) is prepared by activating pre-carbonized poplar catkin biomass waste. MMC shows beneficial characteristics for capacitive energy storage, such as high-specific surface area (1693 m2 g−1), suitable porous structure (0.866 cm3 g−1), abundant heteroatom doping and defect. Due to the synergy of these properties, MMC demonstrates a capacitance of 248.0 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, and high capacitance retention (68.5%, 50.0 A g−1). Moreover, the MMC based symmetric device displays a high energy density (35.87 Wh kg−1) at a power density of 240 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the device maintains a long lifetime of over 30,000 cycles without obvious capacitance loss. These existing results demonstrate a potential of the poplar catkin-derived carbon material as a competitive electrode material candidate for supercapacitors.
