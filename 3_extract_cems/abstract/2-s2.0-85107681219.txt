The chromium oxide-nickel oxide nanocomposite (Cr2O3-NiO NC) was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach. The prepared Cr2O3-NiO NC was investigated for various structural, functional, morphological, and elemental analyses using XRD, FTIR, SEM, HR-TEM, and EDX techniques. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) study revealed that the synthesized composite delivers higher specific capacitance of 333.4 F/g at 10 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) revealed lower solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.99 Ω and 1.04 Ω respectively. The Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis reveals the good stability, good redox rate capability, and faradaic nature of the electrode material. The cyclic stability of Cr2O3-NiO NC exhibited good capacitive retention of 87.7% even after 2000 cycles.
