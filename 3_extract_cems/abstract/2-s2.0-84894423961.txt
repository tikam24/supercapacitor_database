Nanocrystalline Ru film is deposited on Ni foam by a chemical replacement reaction. The deposited Ru film exhibits a mesoporous structure comprising nanocrystallites and nanopores of 2-3 nm in diameter. A 1.8 V symmetric supercapacitor is developed using nanocrystalline Ru films as both negative and positive electrodes. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
