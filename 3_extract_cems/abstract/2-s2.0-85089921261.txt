Abstract: Polymeric ionic liquids (PILs) not only have the unique properties of ionic liquid, but also possess diverse mechanical properties of polymers. Due to their safety and conductivity, PILs-based gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) are the promising candidates for the design of the devices. Here, we reported a facile approach to synthesize novel star-shaped GPE (named PIL–POSS–Li GPE) based on 1-vinyl-3-butylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid, octavinyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and LiPF6 solution in one step via gamma-ray radiation. Compared with PIL–Li GPE without POSS, the incorporation of POSS into the PIL–Li GPE can improve properties of PIL–POSS–Li GPE due to the formation of a star-shaped structure, and the as-prepared PIL–POSS–Li GPE showed excellent compressive strength of 1617 kPa, high fracture compression stain of 79% and high ionic conductivity of 3.88 mS cm−1 at 25 °C. What is more, the PIL–POSS–Li supercapacitor (SC) showed better electrochemical performance than PIL–Li SC. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
