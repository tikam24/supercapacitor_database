Mushroom-like Ni3S2 consisting of a thin film on nanorod arrays have been successfully synthesized via a dissolution-precipitation route, which was carried out through a hydrothermal process using the Ni foam in thioacetamide alcohol solution without the introduction of other Ni sources. The thin film played a key role in exhibiting an excellent electrochemistry performance of the mushroom-like Ni3S2 electrode. As a pseudocapacitor material, the as-obtained mushroom-like Ni3S2 electrode showed a significant specific capacitance (1190.4 F g-1 at 8 A g-1). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor, with the mushroom-like Ni3S2 as the positive electrode material and activated carbon powder (AC) as the negative electrode material, exhibited a high energy density (60.3 W h kg-1) at an average power density of 3600 W kg-1 based on the mass of the active material.
