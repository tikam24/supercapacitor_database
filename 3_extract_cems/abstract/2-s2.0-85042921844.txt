Seaweed have different structure and component from terrestrial plant, and the difference can be reserved when it is used for making porous carbon. In this study, Sargassum muticum was token as precursor, KOH and H3PO4 activation were adopted for producing porous carbon. The properties including pore structure, crystalline phases, micromorphology, elementary composition, functional groups and electrochemical performance were characterized and compared with other activated carbons made from terrestrial plants. S. muticum was deemed to be a suitable precursor for pourous carbon. KOH activation method is regarded as a more suitable way to produce porous carbon because the product has good pore structure, high specific surface area (3362 m2 g−1), high graphitization and good electrochemical performance. Porous carbon made by KOH activation also show large power density (64 Wh kg−1) and energy density (21 kW kg−1), good cycle performance (90% reserve after 5000 cycles) and rate capability. Although H3PO4 activation method didn’t show its advantage on S. muticum, it is easier to accomplish as it integrate carbonization and activation into one step, and the produced carbon have higher carbon yield and more functional groups, which means they have potential for faradaic pseudocapacitance after being modified.
