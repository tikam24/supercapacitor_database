Nickel-organic framework (Ni-MOF)/Ti3C2Tx (MXene) hybrid nanosheets as supercapacitor electrode materials are fabricated via a facile ultrasonic method. Ti3C2Tx nansheets are uniformly dispersed on the surface of Ni-MOF, thus enhancing the electronic conductivity and preventing the aggregation of Ni-MOF nanosheets. The as-prepared Ni-MOF/MXene hybrid nanosheets exhibit high specific capacitance of 867.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and excellent rate capacity.
