The management of energy sources in electric vehicles is currently a major research area. The objectives of this research focus on the integration of innovative energy storage devices using batteries and supercapacitors and on the implementation of advanced energy control and management techniques in the traction and braking phases to optimise the performance of the whole system. In this paper, an energy management system will be discussed by presenting the different coupling topologies between sources and load to describe the power flow during traction and braking phases, and as a solution to manage the transmitted energy, many control algorithms can be used. The proposed solution is a power system with two DC-DC inverters using shared frequency as a power flow control technique. The simulation results of the proposed topology are verified and analysed in both phases using Matlab/Simulink simulator. The analysis of the results showed that energy management in electric vehicles based on this approach offers better flexibility in the use of the energy available in the sources.
