Graphene nanowalls (GNWs) were deposited on the surface of the copper foil, nickel foam and glass using the plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (13.56 MHz) method. The etching effect of hydrogen on the morphology of the GNWs was investigated by varying the CH4/H2 ratio during the graphene growth. Supercapacitor electrodes made of GNWs on nickel foam were tested with cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods, showing premium electrical double-layer performance and cyclic stability.
