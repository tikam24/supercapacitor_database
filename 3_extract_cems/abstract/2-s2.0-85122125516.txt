MoS2-coated zeolitic imidazoline framework-derived transition metal sulfides (MoS2-coated S-doped ZIF-67@NF) are synthesized by hydrothermal method on nickel foam (NF). ZIF-derived transition metal sulfide and MoS2 as inner core and outer shell, respectively. Overall structure like a succulent plant, maintaining the unique skeleton structure of ZIF as an inner core, ZIF-derived transition metal sulfides enhances the charge transfer efficiency. The well-covered MoS2 protects the inner core and acts as a channel for electrolyte ion diffusion to the interior. At 1 mA cm−2, the MoS2 coated S-doped ZIF-67@NF (MSZ@NF) electrode provides a specific capacity of 4840 mF cm−2 and good cycling stability (81.3% at 30 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles). The the asymmetric MoS2 coated S-doped ZIF@NF//RGO device achieved high energy density of 93.49 μWh cm−2 at 0.8 mW cm−2.
