A series of Sn 1−x Mn x O 2 (X = 0.00, 0.015, 0.025, 0.035 and 0.045 mol%) nanoparticles have been synthesized by effective chemical precipitation method. In this work to explore the structural, morphological, optical, electrochemical and magnetic properties of the pure and Manganese doped SnO 2 nanoparticles are characterized on the TG/DTA, XRD, SEM/EDX, HR-TEM, FTIR, UV–DRS, PL, CV, and VSM analysis. XRD indicates that the tetragonal crystal structure, with the crystallite size of range from 37 to 11 nm. The structure, size, shape, and morphology analysis by SEM and HR-TEM was spherical shape is observed. FTIR studies on functional group analysis of pure and Manganese doped SnO 2 nanoparticles. The peak appeared at 619 cm −1 due to O–Sn–O stretching vibration of clearly indicates the formation of SnO 2 phase. UV–DRS absorption measures were the optical band gap energies decreasing with increasing Mn (0.00%, 0.015%, 0.025%, 0.035% and 0.045%) concentration from 3.89 to 3.75 eV. UV–DRS analyzed the mechanisms of electron–hole recombination and charge carriers separation. Further, the electrochemical properties were subsequently characterized by cyclic voltammetry. From the CV performance of the supercapacitor application was analyzed, the higher capacitance value of pure and Manganese (0.045%) doped SnO 2 electrode 156.7 Fg −1 and 285.2 Fg −1 observed in the scan rate of 5 mV s −1 for the product calcinated at 700 °C. The M–H loop of pure SnO 2 nanoparticles showed diamagnetism, Manganese doped SnO 2 nanoparticles show weak ferromagnetic and paramagnetic behavior at room temperature as measured by VSM. A tin oxide with lower manganese concentration show larger magnetization and with increasing manganese concentration the retentivity and coercivity are found to decrease. The magnetic parameters such as saturation magnetization (M S ), coercivity (H C ) and retentivity (M R ) are obtained from VSM data.
