A facile approach has been developed to fabricate polyaniline nano-wrinkles arrays on three-dimensional graphene film (3rGN/PANI-NW) by electropolymerization, which using polystyrene microsphere (PS) as sacrificial templates to form porous structure and ZnO nanorods as scaffolds to form PANI nano-wrinkles. The novel structure can greatly reduce the diffusion length of ion and improve the utilization of electrode materials. When the composite film is used as a supercapacitor electrode, 3rGN/PANI-NW film displays a specific capacitance of 630.0 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with excellent rate capability (remains 80% even at 10 A g-1), much higher than that of 3rGN/PANI film without using ZnO nanorod as a scaffold (358.0 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, 74% retention at 10 A g-1) in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. More importantly, the 3rGN/PANI-NW can maintain 90.5% of its initial capacitance after constant charge-discharge 5000 cycles at current density of 10 A g-1, suggesting a superior electrochemical cyclic stability and it is promising candidate for use in energy storage device applications.
