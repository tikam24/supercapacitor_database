Supercapacitors are components for energy storage, dedicated for applications where both energy and power density are needed. Even if their energy density is ten times lower than the energy density of batteries, supercapacitors offer new alternatives for applications where energy storage is needed. We have done an experimental bench and we have measured the voltage across a supercapacitor in a constant current charge/discharge cycle. Using these measurements and a mathematical algorithm we have proposed an electrical model for the supercapacitor, and we have determined the parameters of the model also. Â© 2009 IEEE.
