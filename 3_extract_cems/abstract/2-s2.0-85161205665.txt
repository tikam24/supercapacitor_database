As a new type of energy storage device, supercapacitors (SCs) have the advantages of high power density, long cycle life and wide operating temperature range. However, there is energy loss in the working process of SCs, and the main way is heat loss. Therefore, this paper analyzed the heat generation characteristics of commercial SCs through heat flux measurement experiments, and studied the relationship between the heat generation characteristics of devices and the energy loss of charge and discharge. The results showed that the energy loss increases with the increase of charging current, and the heat loss accounts for more than 85% of the total energy loss. In addition, the total heat generation during the charging and discharging process of the SCs are greater than the Joule heat generation. The difference is partly caused by the irreversible Faraday reaction heat generation and charge redistribution.
