A pristine copper oxide and manganese-doped copper oxide nanostructured films were prepared by simple spray pyrolysis technique. A study of the effects of Mn doping with three different concentrations as 2, 4, and 6 wt % were studied in the view of enhancement of supercapacitive performance of copper oxide electrode. The 6 wt % manganese-doped copper oxide thin film changed their surface morphology considerably favorable to the exchange of ions in the Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electrochemical properties of the pristine copper oxide and manganese-doped copper oxide were investigated in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte within the potential window of âˆ’1.0 to 0.4 V. A maximum specific capacitance of 801.61 F/g was obtained for the manganese-doped copper oxide thin film electrode.
