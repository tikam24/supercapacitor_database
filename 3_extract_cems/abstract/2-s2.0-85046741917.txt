Inkjet printing is considered as a promising technique for flexible electronics fabrication owing to its simple, versatile, environmental-friendly and low-cost features. The key to inkjet printing is ink formulation. In this work a highly concentrated ink containing two-dimensional δ-MnO2 nanosheets with an average lateral size of 89 nm and around 1 nm thickness was used. By engineering the formulation of the δ-MnO2 ink, it could be inkjet printed on O2 plasma treated glass and polyimide film substrates to form δ-MnO2 patterns without undesired “coffee-ring” effect. As a proof-of-concept application, all-solid-state symmetrical micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) based on δ-MnO2 nanosheet ink were fabricated. The fabricated MSCs showed excellent mechanical flexibility and good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 88% after 3600 charge-discharge cycles. The MSCs attained the highest volumetric capacitance of 2.4 F cm−3, and an energy density of 1.8·10−4 Wh cm−3 at a power density of 0.018 W cm−3, which is comparable with other similar devices and show great potential as energy storage units for low-cost flexible and wearable electronics applications.
