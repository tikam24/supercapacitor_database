In this paper, an efficient control is proposed and implemented to minimize the power fluctuation of grid connected photovoltaic (PV) with supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS). The SCESS is used to minimize the power fluctuation caused by changes in temperature and irradiation. The optimal size of the SCESS and its control strategy are developed for continuously charging and discharging SCESS to achieve its objectives. Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System is developed in real time using dSPACE to generate the maximum power from the PV system. The SCESS is integrated with the system through a bi-directional buck boost converter. The system model and the control strategy have been developed in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) that consists of PV array, buck converter, buck-boost converter, and voltage source converter (VSC). To transfer the available DC power to the grid, an independent P-Q control is proposed and implemented for the VSC. The proposed controller is examined through hardware in the loop setup using RTDS and dSPACE 1104 controller. Furthermore, the superiority of the proposed approach has been confirmed by comparing the results with those reported in the literature.
