Aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted more and more attention for their safety, fast charge/discharge capability and ultra-long life. However, the application of aqueous SCs is limited by the low working voltage due to the narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) of water. Herein, we report a new “water in salt” (WIS) electrolyte by dissolving potassium bis (fluorosulfonyl) amide (KFSI) in water with an ultra-high mass molar concentration of 37 mol/kg. The highly concentrated electrolyte can achieve a wide ESW of 2.8 V. The WIS electrolyte enables a safe carbon-based symmetrical supercapacitor to operate stably at 2.3 V with an ultra-long cycle life and excellent rate performance. The energy density reaches 20.5 Wh/kg at 2300 W/kg, and the capacity retention is 83.5% after 50,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. This new electrolyte will be a promising candidate for future high-voltage aqueous supercapacitors.
