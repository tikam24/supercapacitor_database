This paper suggests an innovative multi-machine coordinated drive system for electric rail vehicles, equipped by onboard supercapacitor to recuperate braking energy. An effective energy management strategy is also presented for it to reduce both current magnitude of the main supply and the dc bus voltage drop during train acceleration. Moreover, an applicable model predictive control method is introduced to control the speeds of its two open-winding Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines at the same time, while considering their voltages and currents constraints independently. Simulation results show the validity and effectiveness of the proposed drive topology, and the feasibility of the designed controller in terms of required computational power and memory.
