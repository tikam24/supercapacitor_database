In this report, we present a novel platform to study the formation of delicate ordered vertically aligned copolymer nanowires array with EDOT and Py as the initial source. The resultant samples exhibit a specific capacitance of 187 F g−1 with the current of 0.1 A g−1 in 0.1 M LiClO4 aqueous electrolyte. When the current was set as 8 A g−1, the energy density was 16.9 W h kg−1 and the power density was 5480 W kg−1 with good cycling stability (remained stable after 5000 cycles). The multicomponent copolymer nanowire array has great potential to become a versatile and efficient material for next generation of endurable electrochemical supercapacitors.
