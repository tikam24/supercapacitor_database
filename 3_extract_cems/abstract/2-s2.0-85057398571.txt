In order to estimate the performance of supercapacitor,it is important to identify correctly its electrical parameters. Therefore,firstly,the design of identification experiment and data processing which will influence the accuracy of identification should be analyzed in depth. In this paper,the selection of stimulus signal,the definition of the length of experimental data and sampling period,and the data filtering method are particularly discussed,and concrete solutions are presented. The comparison of experimental and simulation results show that,based on the identification experiment designing process and wavelet filtering method,we can acquire more precise identification results of supercapacitor electrical parameters. This paper provides the theoretical direction and the basis for the realization of accurate identification of supercapacitor's electrical parameters.
