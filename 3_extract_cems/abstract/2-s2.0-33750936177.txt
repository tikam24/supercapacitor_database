The electrical double-layer (EDL) performance of three different TiC-derived nanoporous carbon materials was tested in prismatic capacitor assembly filled with 1.2 M triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEMA) acetonitrile solution. The electrical double-layer characteristics of supercapacitors were studied using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. Energy density versus power density, i.e. Ragone plots were constructed from the constant resistance and constant power (CP) charge/discharge data. The 1450F supercapacitor with novel nanoporous carbon made by halogen treatment of TiC/TiO2 composite demonstrated the energy density of more than 10 Wh dm-3 at the cell voltage of 2.7 V.
