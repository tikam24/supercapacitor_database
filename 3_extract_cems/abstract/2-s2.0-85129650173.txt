Increasing energy demands are triggering the development of high performance, low-cost supercapacitor electrode material, particularly in countries that are shifting to renewable energy as their current energy supply cannot meet their significant energy demands. These countries require high-voltage, safe and long-lasting electrical energy storage devices. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) were tested during an in-situ hydrothermal process. The structure test of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterisation was used to determine the relation between the morphology of the electrode and its electrochemical value. The morphology of the composite electrode indicated that the nanocomposite electrode had better values than the single material electrode. Additionally, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) tested in a two-electrode system indicated that the specific capacitance of MWCNT-rGO-TiO2 30% was 168 F g-1 and showed the energy and power density to be 15 Wh kg-1 and 337.5 W kg-1, respectively. This result was higher with the other electrode due to the faradaic and non-faradaic processes in the electrode.
