Electrolyte-imprinted and copper crosslinked hybrid flexible electrodes have been considered as long-term stability supercapacitors. Graphene oxide, chitosan and copper (copper chloride) were crosslinked under ionic liquid medium using a hydrothermal technique. The fabricated flexible supercapacitor exhibits a maximum 356 F g-1 specific capacitance and possesses extreme cyclic stability up to 200000 cycles.
