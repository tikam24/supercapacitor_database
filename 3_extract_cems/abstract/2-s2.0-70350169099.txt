Silica aerogel (SiO2 aerogel) was prepared by sol-gel method from tetraethyl orthosilicate hydrolyzation and has been characterized by scanning electron microscopy and N2 adsorption for its surface structure, surface area, and pore-size distribution. Constant current charge-discharge technique, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectrum were employed for its specific capacitance and equivalent series resistance. The results showed that the maximum specific capacitance of SiO2 aerogel electrode in 1 M Et4NBF4/PC electrolyte was 62.5 F g-1. In addition, the SiO2 aerogel capacitor exhibits excellent long-term stability with no significant degradation after 500 charging and discharging cycles. Therefore, the application of high surface area SiO2 aerogel as electrodes in supercapacitor devices is promising. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009.
