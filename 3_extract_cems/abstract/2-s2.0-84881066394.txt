In the race of further improvement in efficiency and performance of an Electric Vehicle (EV), one of the most crucial tasks is to improve the performance and efficiency of the electrical energy storage system regarding the electrical power density and energy capacity. In this paper, hybrid storage system with the battery module and the supercapacitor module is simulated in the MATLAB to evaluate the performance of hybrid storage system (HSS). Simulations in MATLAB SIMULINK were conducted to investigate the mitigation of battery stresses. The hybrid storage system improves the efficiency of overall storage. It is clearly represented that the battery stresses-especially electrical stresses are reduced by introducing supercapacitor. Â© 2013 IEEE.
