Emergence of supercapacitor's utilization is been clearly observed in recent years due to the advancement in energy conversion technologies as well as in energy storage systems. The supercapacitors are seemed to be attractive mainly due to its high-energy density, stable cycle life and longer lifetime. Additionally, sustainable nanotechnology played a crucial role in pushing the ongoing progress of supercapacitor technology. Among various popular materials, cerium oxide (CeO2) is one of the ceramic materials that have depicted positive electrochemical activity. CeO2 and its nanostructured composite materials are broadly investigated as a promising active material for supercapacitor applications. The enhancement in electrochemical performance due to addition of different elements to CeO2 was also been explained. The morphologies of prepared binary or ternary composite using CeO2 were also briefly discussed in this article.
