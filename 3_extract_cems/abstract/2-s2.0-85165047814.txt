Pulse Duration is a particularly crucial factor that governs surface machining via laser. In this work, we demonstrate the effects of alternating pulse duration and monitor its effect on achieving near-nano surface essential for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. We used the ULPING (Ultra-short Laser Pulses for In-situ Nanostructure Generation) technique conducted in ambient conditions on a Ni sheet. Utilizing this technique and smart-tuning pulsed laser parameters, a specific capacitance of 122 mF cm− 2 was achieved at a current density of 1 mA cm− 2. This fabrication technique is an in-situ, rapid, binder-free, and green method for the fast fabrication of electrodes that can yield low-cost and industrial-favored supercapacitors. In this study, we prove that the smaller the pulse duration of the laser, the better the specific capacitance and conductivity as it offers less ablation, enhanced surface area, favorable nano morphology, low thermal and mechanical degradation. Such fabrication is possible with the simple working principle of lasers in which the irradiated transition metal changes its phase to transition metal oxide. The oxide provides essential charge storage and ion exchange as defined by the thermodynamic principle of pseudocapacitors. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
