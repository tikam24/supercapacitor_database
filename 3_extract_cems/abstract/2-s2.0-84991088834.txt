Accordion-like MnO2-coated graphene composites were successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method at 160℃. The as-products were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive spectrometry, BET and Raman spectroscopy. The high capacitance of 138 F·g-1 at 0.2 A·g-1 is achieved with MnO2/graphene composites as a supercapacitor electrode, much higher than that of a single MnO2 or graphene electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the uniform MnO2 nanosheet morphology, large surface area of graphene and stable chemical bonding of MnO2 on the graphene substrate.
