Herein, we report a novel, two dimensional (2D) layered In2S3 electrode material for supercapacitor application via a one-step solvothermal method. 2D In2S3 exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 897 Fg−1 at 1 mVs−1. Further prepared solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSC) demonstrate a wide operational window of 1.4 V, highest 2 terminal specific capacitance 284 Fg−1, and outstanding cyclic retention value of 90.81% after 3000 cycles. Excellent electrochemical behaviors of 2D In2S3 material via a facile and direct-grown method make it a potential candidate for the next-generation energy storage system.
