In order to solve the problems of large storage capacity, high cost, and improve the performances of the whole drive system, a power matching strategy was proposed based on super capacitor energy storage system applied to hybrid excavator rotary system. And then the performance price ratio of the super capacitor energy storage system was used as the optimal target of the storage capacity. The genetic algorithm was used to optimize the mathematics model established and simulation validation was made in the MATLAB model of the hybrid electric drive system, the parameters were compared before and after optimization. The results show that the optimized model may improve the performance price ratio of the hybrid excavator rotary drive system, the optimization of the storage capacity in hybrid excavator motoring system has some theoretical and practical guidances.
