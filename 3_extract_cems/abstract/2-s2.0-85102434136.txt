Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying.
