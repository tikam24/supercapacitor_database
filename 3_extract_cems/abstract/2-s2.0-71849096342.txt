The Renewable Energy & Energy Storage (RES) Project is a small-scale investigation of how two types of renewable energy sources (a PV module and a wind turbine-generator [WTG]) can be combined with two types of electric energy storage (the lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor) to power a constant load 24 hours per day. The PV module is rated at 60 W under STC; the peak wind turbine output is 400 W at a wind speed of 30 mph. Two lead-acid batteries were employed eventually, each rated at 100 amp-hours. The supercapacitor can provide 1000 Farads at 12 volts, and the constant load consists of two LED arrays drawing a total of 7 watts. This system has been in operation for five years. Lessons learned in creating, monitoring and operating the RES system will be discussed in the presentation. Â©2009 IEEE.
