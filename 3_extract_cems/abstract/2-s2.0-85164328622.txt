Developing metal oxides with advanced architectures has received extensive global attention and becoming an attractive contender for achieving high-performance electrode materials for efficient energy storing systems. Herein, metal organic framework (MOF) derived porous sponge-like Co3O4 architectures have been fabricated through a simple aqueous solution route combined with thermal treatment. The sponge-like unique morphology of Co3O4 architectures affords a high surface area with the appropriate porous feature and superior electronic conductivity. Further, it offers an effective pathway to expedite electron/ion transportation and alleviate volume changes. The porous sponge-like Co3O4 electrode reveals a large specific capacity of 434 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with promising rate capability. Furthermore, the constructed hybrid supercapacitor (HSC; Co3O4//AC) depicts an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity as high as 272 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, the HSC achieves a large specific energy of 48.19 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 710.76 W kg−1 and cyclic retention of 90.58% after 10,000 cycles. As a result, the remarkable electrochemical performance of the porous sponge-like Co3O4 architectures could provide a new strategy as a potential candidate for next-generation energy storage applications.
