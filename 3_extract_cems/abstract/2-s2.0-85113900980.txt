This paper reports on the preparation and electrochemical performance of chitin- and chitin-cellulose-based hydrogel electrolytes. The materials were prepared by a casting solution technique using ionic liquid-based solvents. The method of chitin dissolution in ionic liquid with the assistance of dimethyl sulfoxide co-solvent was investigated. The obtained membranes were soaked with 1-M lithium sulfate aqueous solution. The prepared materials were preliminarily characterized in terms of structural and physicochemical properties. Further, the most promising biopolymer membranes were assembled with activated carbon cloth electrodes in symmetric electrochemical capacitor cells. The electrochemical performances of these devices were studied in a 2-electrode system by commonly known electrochemical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The devices operated at a maximum voltage of 0.8 V. All the investigated materials have shown high efficiency in terms of specific capacitance, power density, and cyclability. The studied capacitors exhibited specific capacitance values in the range of 92–98 F g−1, with excellent capacitance retention (ca. 97–98%) after 20,000 galvanostatic charge and discharge cycles. Taking into account the above information and the eco-friendly nature of the biopolymer, it appears that the prepared chitin- and chitin-cellulose-based hydrogel electrolytes can be promising components for green electrochemical capacitors.
