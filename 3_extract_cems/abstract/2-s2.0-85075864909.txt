A novel three-dimensional (3D) hybrid electrode based on graphene aerogel (GA) modified with a vanadium nitride (VN) film by a sputtering method has been prepared. This method allows for better structural integration of GA and the VN film, resulting in enhanced electrochemical properties. The as-prepared VN/GA shows excellent electrochemical performance, with a maximum specific capacitance of 236.5 F g−1 at a charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A g−1, a good rate capability of 86.3% at 1 A g−1, and 91.8% specific capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. These parameters are superior to those reported for conventional GA- and VN-based electrodes. These findings open a new pathway for the fabrication of novel aerogel-based electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
