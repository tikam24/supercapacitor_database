α-MoO3 is a well-investigated layer-structured material for intercalation of different ions. Here, for the first time, we utilized Be2+ electrolyte for electrochemical characterization of α-MoO3 for supercapacitor applications. Our studies revealed a minimized detrimental effect of proton (H+) co-intercalation at a high current density 25 Ag−1 resulting in excellent cyclability with a specific capacitance of 169 Fg−1 and a retention of 81% capacitance after 2000 cycles. The electrochemical impedance and ionic diffusion measurements reflected a reduced intercalation of H+ and higher diffusion coefficient of Be2+ as the contributing factors for unusually high and stable capacitance of MoO3 at high current density.
