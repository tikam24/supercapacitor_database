There are few experimental reports combining hybrid energy storage and diesel engine generators as the power source of distributed power generation systems. In this article, a distributed power generation with energy storage system (DG-ES) which contains a diesel engine generator and an energy storage unit is set up and tested in the laboratory to satisfy the dynamic changing load. The hybrid energy storage system is composed of a lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor. The DG-ES supplied power to meet the domestic load demand successfully under different seasons. A simulation model of this system was also set up in MATLAB software used to guide to the experimental operation of this system. The simulation results has 2.69% and 2.35% error. The results of the experimental tests show the DG-ES can provide enough power to meet the dynamic loads of the selected house, especially at peak time in both winter and summer time. Computational simulation results show that the performance of DG-ES is improved by 3.61% in summer and 1.86% in winter when the system's operations are optimised.
