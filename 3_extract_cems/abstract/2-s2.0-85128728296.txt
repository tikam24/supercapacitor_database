Bimetallic metal–organic frameworks (BMOFs) have developed as novel candidates for electrodes due to their high-performance energy storage applications. We attempted to develop a new three-dimensional (3D) ordered structure of nickel–zinc MOFs (NZMOF), grown in situ on carbon cloth (NZMOF/CC) using a solvo-hydrothermal strategy to increase the stored energy. A notable capacitance of 456.8 F/g was achieved for this electrode at 1 A/g. In addition, the NZMOF/CC//AC/CC assembled split-cell asymmetric supercapacitor device (SASD) achieved an excellent energy and power densities of 38.54 Wh/kg and 750 W/kg, respectively, with a capacity retention of 87.27% after 5000 cycles, which is better than that of conventional supercapacitors. Additionally, this study is easy and controllable, providing a viable approach for fabricating hybrid electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems.
