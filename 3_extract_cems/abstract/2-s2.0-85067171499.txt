A novel dumbbell-shaped mixed bimetallic oxide (Ni1.71Co1.29O4) is directly anchored on activated carbon fiber textile (CFT) for high-performance flexible symmetric supercapacitors (NCO@CFT-FSSCs). The as-fabricated NCO@CFT-FSSC exhibits excellent supercapacitive performance by achieving the high-specific capacity of 200 mAh/g at 1 A/g with excellent rate capability of 71% at 10-folded high current density. The NCO@CFT-FSSC showed outstanding cycling stability over 5000 cycles by retaining 94.78% capacity at a current density of 12.5 A/g. Moreover, the NCO@CFT-FSSC possesses good flexible performance and maintained 89.64% capacity over 500 bending cycles. Therefore, the achieved fascinating charge storage capabilities along with excellent flexibility ensure that Ni1.71Co1.29O4 being a potential material for high-performance supercapacitors.
