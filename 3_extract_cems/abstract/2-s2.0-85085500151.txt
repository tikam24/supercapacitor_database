The proceedings contain 164 papers. The topics discussed include: current shaping of permanent magnet synchronous motor with non-sinusoidal flux distribution for torque ripple reduction using model based predictive control; simplified modulated model predictive control of synchronous reluctance motor; simple and robust finite-control-set model predictive control for DFIGS in wind turbine systems; a new structure for a hybrid multilevel inverter based on transformer and switched-capacitance; a novel three-phase multilevel inverter with reduced number of IGBTs, developed for drive application; improvement of a high-accuracy photovoltaic emulator by considering wind effect; a novel boost switched-capacitor based multi-level inverter structure; and co-estimation of supercapacitor states and parameters considering three-branch equivalent circuit model.
