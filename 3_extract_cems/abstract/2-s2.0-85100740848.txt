A facile route has been employed to synthesize a series of high performance activated carbons as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The structure of the carbons are characterized by N2 adsorption/desorption and FTIR spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the carbons as an electrode material were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry test and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. As a biomass derived carbon, KOH-1 exhibits high capacity, good rate capability and high energy density, indicating the promising application of hydrothermal combining with KOH activation method for biomass materials that used in supercapacitors.
