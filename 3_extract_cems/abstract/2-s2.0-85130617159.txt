The power output obtained from the hydrokinetic renewable system fluctuates with changes in weather conditions, which could cause adverse effects on the voltage, frequency and stability of the electrical grid. In this article, an evaluation of power smoothing is performed for a renewable hydrokinetic on grid system using a supercapacitor. The power fluctuations are mitigated and smoothed by the proposed energy control and supplied to the utility grid and household load. Moreover, this paper studies the impact of the temporal resolution of data sampling with respect to the self-consumption of prosumers under technical, economic and environmental parameters using Matlab/Simulink software. The simulation results show that the fluctuations of the hydrokinetic turbine output power can be significantly mitigated, using the supercapacitor based storage system for different temporal resolutions reducing up to 90% of power peaks and power fluctuations produced by the hydrokinetic turbine and the load. Besides, the use of supercapacitors allows increasing the self-consumption of prosumers up to 17.27% for time resolutions of 1 min. Finally, the proposed control reduces up to 0.54 kgCO2/day at cost of energy 0.15 USD/kWh.
