A simple sucrose-assisted combustion and subsequent high-temperature calcination route have been employed to prepare hierarchical porous ZnMn2O4 nanostructure. When used as an electrode for supercapacitor, the ZnMn2O4 electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 411.75 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, remarkable capacitance retention rate of 64.28 % at current density of 32 A g−1 compared with 1 A g−1, as well as excellent cycle stability (reversible capacity retention of 88.32 % after 4000 cycles). The outstanding electrochemical performances are mainly attributed to its hierarchical porous architecture, which provides large reaction surface area, fast ion and electron transfer, and good structure stability. All these impressive results demonstrate that ZnMn2O4 shows promise for its application in supercapacitors.
