Four activated carbon (AC) samples prepared from rice husk under different activation temperatures have been characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA-DTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The specific surface area of AC sample reached 2681m2g-1 under activation temperature of 800Â°C. The AC samples were then tested as electrode material; the specific capacitance of the as-prepared activated carbon electrode was found to be 172.3Fg-1 using cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 5mVs-1 and 198.4Fg-1 at current density 1000mAg-1 in the charge/discharge mode.
