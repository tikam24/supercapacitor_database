NiO with different morphologies were fabricated via hydrothermal method in different kinds of solvent. The morphology of the obtained NiO samples varied from nanoflakes to nanoparticles with the different volume ratios of water to ethanol. The electrochemical results showed that the specific capacitance of NiO-S5 obtained in ethanol was up to 1337.5 F g-1 at a current density of 0.62 A g-1, which was greatly higher than that of the other samples. These results indicated that NiO-S5 had the superior electrochemical behavior which may be due to its small-size effect.
