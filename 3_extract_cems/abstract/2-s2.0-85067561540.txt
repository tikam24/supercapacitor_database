Reasonable configuration of proper type and capacity of energy storage device in DC distribution network can effectively suppress DC voltage flicker and promote reliable stability of system operation and fault ride-through capability. The configuration of energy storage device is the pre-planning design of the DC distribution network construction, which is based on the power supply sample data of the energy storage device in the distribution network. The discrete Fourier spectrum analysis is performed on the power sample data of the energy storage device to obtain the base power in the low frequency and the fluctuation power in the high frequency. A hybrid energy storage device is obtained considering response rate and energy storage cycle characteristics. Then, a weight coefficient is introduced to optimize the weight of the multi-dimensional power in low frequency, to configure the rated power of the energy storage battery. After that, the configuration of the rated power of the supercapacitor is proposed under the constraints of power balance. Additionally, an impact index is introduced to characterize the relationship between State Of Capacity (SOC) and capacity of the energy storage device, to seek the threshold for the capacity of energy storage device reducing the impact. The validity of the method above is verified by an example taking the power difference between distributed renewable energy and load as the sample data of power requirement for energy storage device.
