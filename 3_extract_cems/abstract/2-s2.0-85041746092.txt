We synthesized Co3O4 and Co3O4@Au-NPs nano structures via simple and economical strategy for high-performance supercapacitors. Co3O4@Au-NPs modified glassy carbon electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance including high specific capacitance of 683 Fg−1(current density of 0.5 Ag−1), better retention capability of 65% at high current density (10 Ag−1) with remarkable cycling stability in 1000 continuous cycles at 0.5 Ag−1 current density (only 6% loss after 1000 cycles) and high energy and power densities (94.86 Whkg−1 and 3.48 kWkg−1). The photocatalytic activity of the synthesized mesoporous structures against Methylene Blue dye was also carried out and compared with the standard P25. The study showed that the presence of gold nanoparticles has increased the photocatalytic activity of synthesized porous Co3O4 to many folds. From the results it is believed that the addition of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) has largely increased the supercapacitor and photocatalytic activity of Co3O4.
