Template method provides a new technology for synthesizing various controllable and directional mesoporous carbon materials and has currently become one of the most popular topics in the advanced materials preparation at home and abroad. Due to their uniform and ordered pores, narrow pore size distribution and high specific surface area, mesoporous carbon materials have been widely used in gas separation, catalyst support, adsorption, chromatographic analysis, supercapacitors and fuel cells, etc. Based on the recent research progress of the template synthesis technology of mesoporous carbon, we discuss the effect of different template preparation technology on the performance of mesoporous carbon, analyze mesoporous carbon's formation mechanism and its application in biology, catalysis, electronic energy resources areas. It is pointed out that preparing mesoporous carbon by template technology is a promising method, and in the future the mesoporous molecular sieve template method and soft template method should be emphasized for template synthesis of mesoporous carbon materials.
