2D carbides and nitrides-based nanomaterials because of their unusual physical and chemical properties and a vast range of energy-storage applications have attracted tremendous attention. However, 2D carbides and nitrides-based nanomaterials and their corresponding composites have many intrinsic constraints in terms of energy-storage applications. The nano-engineering of these 2D materials is widely investigated, to improve their performance for practical application. In this Review article, the current progress and research on 2D carbides and nitrides-based nanostructures are presented and debated, concentrating on their methods of preparation, and energy conservation applications for example Lithium-ion-battery, supercapacitors, and Sodium-ion-battery. In conclusion, the problems, and recommendations essential to be discussed for the progress of these 2D nanomaterials for energy-storage applications based on carbides and nitrides are displayed.
