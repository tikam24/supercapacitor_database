We report generation of flow-induced electrical voltage and current associated with changing numbers of graphene layers in graphene surfaces prepared on PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) substrates by moving an ionic droplet of NaCl to investigate the effects of pseudocapacitance phenomena between each graphene surface and the ionic solution. Each sample exhibited different surface energies and electrical ionic double layers on the graphene surface. For each sample, these properties were evaluated by water contact angle measurements and Raman spectra, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated changes in flow-induced voltage and current generation using various ionic concentrations of NaCl (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 M). Based on triboelectrification and pseudocapacitance phenomena, the generated voltage and power for monolayer graphene were 8.1 and 15.9 times larger, respectively, than the values obtained for 3 layers.
