BACKGROUND: Biomass-based porous carbon as the basic component of electrodes has received wide interest as a renewable energy storage device with high chemical–physical stability and environmental friendliness. Therefore, novel biomass waste based on Zingiber officinale Rosc./red ginger leaves was synthesized as an electrode-based carbon material with an abundance of unique macaroni-sponge-like hierarchical pore structure, as well as good chemical, physical and economic performance. Template/metal–organic framework-free red ginger leaf-based hierarchical porous carbon (RGPC) was prepared using a facile and zero-residue technique as electrode material for supercapacitor application. RESULTS: Additionally, ZnCl2 impregnation with concentrations of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mol L−1 was utilized for increasing the active sites between electrode and electrolyte ions through interconnecting microchannels. The combination of macaroni-sponge-like structure, amorphous nature, optimum specific surface area and availability of oxygen functional groups as a self-doping heteroatom of RGPC-0.3 greatly optimized the electrochemical performance of symmetric supercapacitor cells. The RGPC-0.3 electrode had an ideal specific capacitance of 215.76 F g−1 with a specific energy of 29.966 Wh kg−1 and maximum specific power of 108 W kg−1 at 1 mV s−1 in a symmetric supercapacitor system. Furthermore, a relatively good coulombic efficiency of 71.01% was obtained with a low equivalent series resistance of 0.098 Ω. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the generation of unique hierarchical porous carbon as a basic component of electrodes for energy storage applications with high electrochemical performance through the utilization of waste red ginger biomass with a simple, facile and cost-effective strategy. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).
