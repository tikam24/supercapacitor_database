Nitrogen and oxygen co-doped porous carbons have been synthesized facilely from peanut bran via pre-carbonization coupled with KOH activation. The porous carbon prepared having high N, O contents of 2.12 and 14.69 at.%, respectively, possesses highly porous structure with the specific surface area of 2050 m2/g, total pore volume of 1.126 cm3/g, and suitable mesoporosity of 36.2%. When used as electrode materials for two-electrode symmetric supercapacitors, it delivers a specific capacitance of 237 F/g at the current density of 0.047 A/g, consisting of electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance originated from the doping heteroatoms, displays a good rate capability of 86.5% in the current range of 0.047–2.37 A/g, exhibits superior cycling stability with 98% capacitance retention after 1000 charge–discharge cycles at 2.37 A/g, and demonstrates low equivalent series resistance of 0.1 Ω. The outstanding electrochemical performance is due to the synergistic effect of large specific surface area with unique pore structure and doping heteroatoms of nitrogen and oxygen.
