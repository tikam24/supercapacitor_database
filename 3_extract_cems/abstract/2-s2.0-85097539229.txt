This study is geared towards harnessing the promises of Oil Palm Fiber (OPF) as a renewable substitute for electrode material of supercapacitor. Physical and chemical activation conversion methods were used to activate OPF. The structural and physiochemical properties of the activated carbon derived from OPF were studied and analyzed using FESEM, XRD, BET, XPS, and FTIR. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors fabricated from P_OPF and C_OPF were studied and reported using cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
