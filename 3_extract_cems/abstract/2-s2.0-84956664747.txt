The present paper reports the growth and structural, morphological and electrochemical characterization of SnO2 thin films by spray pyrolysis. XRD results showed that films are polycrystalline with tetragonal crystal structure. The band gap energy is found to be 3.88 eV for film deposited at 500 °C. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor was characterized using a three-electrode configuration, and cyclic voltammetry curve recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 was pseudo-rectangular. All samples show good supercapacitance in 1 M KOH electrolyte with highest specific capacitance of 119 F g−1 for film deposited at 500 °C. Nyquist and Bode plots show the ideal capacitive behavior. The present study signifies successful application of SnO2 thin films as supercapacitor electrode. These findings demonstrate that substrate temperature is an effective parameter to improve the performance of pseudo-capacitive metal oxides.
