Although safe and low-cost aqueous supercapacitors have gained great attention, their narrow operation voltage significantly limits their widespread applications. Here, we demonstrate a high-voltage and high-capacitance aqueous symmetric supercapacitor by using polyaniline-derived carbon nanorods as the electrodes and a highly concentrated water-in-salt [lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide dissolved in water] electrolyte. The resultant supercapacitor is able to work with a wide operation voltage window of 2.2 V and shows a high specific capacitance of 44 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, it exhibits a superior rate capability (73 % capacitance retention upon increasing current density from 1 to 10 A g−1). Consequently, the favorable combination of high specific capacitance, wide operation voltage window, and excellent rate capability enable the device to have comparable energy and power densities to those of commercial non-aqueous supercapacitors.
