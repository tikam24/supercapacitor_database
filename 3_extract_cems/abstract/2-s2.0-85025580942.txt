Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGOH) was fabricated by crosslinking ethylene diamine (EDA) and the functional groups of GO in the presence of one-dimensional (1D) Ag nanowires (NWs). The Ag NWs increased the electrical conductivity and the pore size of the final 3D structures. The capacitance of Ag-rGOH (369 F g−1 was 1.7 times higher than that of EDA-rGOH (218 F g−1 and 1.3 times higher than that of a physically mixed sample with the same Ag content. Moreover, the Ag-rGOH electrode also exhibits excellent long-term stability with a capacitance retention of more than 90% over 1,000 cycles and a high energy of 2.2 Wh kg−1 at 900 W kg−1
