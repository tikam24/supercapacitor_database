Supercapacitors with high performance and cycle life are demanding features for energy storage application. To fulfill these requests, selection of suitable couple of electrode and electrolyte are crucial beside other parameters. In this study, D-A-D type conjugated polymer was synthesized electrochemically and used as a supercapacitor electrode. After characterization of electrode, it was used to construct symmetric supercapacitor device. To increase device performance, TiO2 nanoparticle was incorporated in PMMA/TBAPF6 containing gel electrolyte. The amount of TiO2 filler in gel electrolyte was also optimized. It was observed that TiO2 addition effect device performance via increasing ionic conductivity. The highest area specific capacitance was 3.30 mF/cm2 at 2 mV/s and 3.08 mF/cm2 at 0.015 mF/cm2. Maximum value of energy density was 1.47 μW·h/cm2 and corresponding power density was 13.5 μW/cm2. Moreover, the electrochemical stability of the supercapacitor devices was tested for 1000 galvanostatic charge - discharge (GCD) cycles and they showed excellent stability in terms of % capacity retention and % coulombic efficiency.
