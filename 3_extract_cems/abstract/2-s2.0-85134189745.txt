By combining the exclusive characteristics of a two-dimensional MoS2 layered material with a conventional key material, aluminum nitride (AlN), a flexible supercapacitor electrode can be realized. We present a bendable electrode that is straightforwardly grown on stainless-steel foil via a binder-free sputtering route. The inherent merits of good conductive pathways among MoS2 nanolayers and enriched pseudocapacitive and dielectric activity from AlN nanoflowers enable synergism of the intermixed porous structure. This unique surface morphology facilitates sulfur and nitrogen edges to make insertion/de-insertion of Li-ions more feasible to store electrochemical energy. The MoS2-AlN@SS hybrid working electrode achieves a gravimetric capacitance of 372.35 F/g at a 5 mV/s scan rate with a wide potential window of 2 V in a 1 M Li2SO4 electrolytic aqueous solution. The composite thin film of better adhesion with the current collector exhibits a remarkably high specific power of 28.05 W h/kg at a specific power of 0.26 kW/kg, simultaneously an advanced cycling lifespan of 93% over 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The capacity of the hybrid electrode is almost unperturbed under bending from 0° to 175°, while only ∼5% degradation in capacitance was noticed at a flexing angle of 175°. These distinctive features of this electrode material elucidate the practical applicability and recommend it as a promising candidate in wearable bendable supercapacitors.
