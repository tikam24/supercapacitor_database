In this paper, novel Quasi Opposition based Whale Algorithm (QOWOA) is proposed for Automatic generation control (AGC) for two area interconnected power system with utilization of ultracapacitor. Both areas consist of thermal unit and Solar Field Unit. Non-Linearity such as Governor Dead Band (GDB) and Generation Rate Constraint (GRC) are employed in both areas. A modified PIDN-FOPD controller is used. A Novel QOWOA is proposed to optimize the gain parameters. System dynamics are studied by applying step load change (SLP). To validate superiority of proposed Algorithm dynamic response are compared with PSO. Robustness of proposed controller is compared with conventional PID controller. Distinct results rebuild the effectiveness of proposed work.
