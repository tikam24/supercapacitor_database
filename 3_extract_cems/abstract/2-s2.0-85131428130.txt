Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), a class of metal–organic materials, are gaining much importance as battery-type electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), owing to their open-framework structure and high power density. In this work, which considers Ni-hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) as a PBA subsystem, Co-doped NiHCF/ Ni-foam (NF) composites are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal process and their structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties are studied. The Co0.7Ni0.3HCF/NF electrodes exhibit improved battery-like behavior with excellent electrochemical performance, cycling stability, and specific capacitance. The HSC fabricated with Co0.7Ni0.3HCF/NF as the positive electrode and an activated carbon cloth as the negative electrode produces a high power density of 3938 W kg−1 at an energy density of 13 Wh kg−1. These results emphasize that the proposed composite is a promising candidate as an electrode material and that it is well-suited for the development of supercapacitors.
