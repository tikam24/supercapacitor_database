Fiber supercapacitors weavable into smart textiles have attracted great attention. The key to fabricating such energy storage devices is to develop flexible fiber-like electrodes with tunable functionalities and low production cost. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the roll-to-roll mass production of carbonaceous nanofiber yarns with tunable pore structures and functions. Our protocol combines a modified electrospinning technique with a pyrolysis procedure, thereby using economic polymers as precursors. The as obtained fiber supercapacitors exhibit a remarkably high length-specific capacitance and excellent rate capability, demonstrating their great potential as smart textiles with energy storage functions.
