Because of its large number and wide distribution, 5G base stations can be well combined with distributed photovoltaic power generation. However, there are certain intermittent and volatility in the photovoltaic power generation process, which will affect the power quality and thus affect the operation of the base station. Energy storage technology is one of the effective measures to solve such problems. The battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage method is currently widely used in absorbing new energy. This article first introduces the energy depletion of 5G communication base stations(BS) and its mathematical model. Secondly, it introduces the photovoltaic output model, the power model of batteries and super capacitors(SC), and the capacity model, as well as the 5G BS hybrid energy storage system(HESS) model. Ground on the 24-hour photovoltaic power generation and load power depletion data of the 5G BS, the optimization solution is performed. The results verify the feasibility of the HESS for 5G communication BS.
