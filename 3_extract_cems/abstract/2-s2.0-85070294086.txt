Aiming at the shortcomings of single-protection circuit in the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) process of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG), this paper proposes an integrated protection circuit strategy for LVRT of DFIG based super-capacitor(SC). The integrated protection circuit includes a Crowbar circuit, a rotor series dynamic resistance (SDR) and SC. By adopting different protection circuits in different situations and time divisions, the LVRT capability of the DFIG is comprehensively improved, and the transient current of the rotor current during the protection circuit input is analyzed in each case. Finally, the proposed integrated protection circuit strategy is compared with the traditional single Crowbar circuit and single SDR on the simulation platform MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed integrated protection circuit strategy.
