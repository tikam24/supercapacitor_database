Polypyrrole (PPy) electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors (ES) were prepared by electrochemical impregnation of porous Ni plaque current collectors, designed for high power electrochemical devices. The approach is based on the use of tiron as a dopant for PPy pulse electropolymerization. The microstructure of the PPy electrodes was studied by SEM. The capacitance of 1.01 F cm -2 was achieved at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. The electrodes showed good capacitance retention at high scan rates. Capacitance measurements were combined with impedance spectroscopy for the analysis of cycling stability. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
