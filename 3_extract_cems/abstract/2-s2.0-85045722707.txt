Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has attracted huge attention in field of energy storage including supercapacitor electrodes due to its low cost and layered structure. In this present study, Bulk V2O5 has been prepared by the calcination of ammonium metavanadate followed by the synthesis of V2O5-nanowires (V2O5-NWs) by hydrothermal treatment of bulk V2O5. Obtained V2O5-NWs was further used to fabricate the supercapacitor electrodes. Structure and morphology analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Energy storage capability of as prepared nanowires was investigated by Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in aqueous electrolyte (1M H2SO4). High specific capacitantance of about 622 F/g was achieved at 1 A/g. Along with high storage by faradic charge storage mechanism; V2O5-NWs electrodes also possess high stability. It could retain 63% of its initial capacitance even after 1000 GCD cycles. Excellent performance of V2O5-NWs promotes its commercial utilization for the development of high performance supercapacitors.
