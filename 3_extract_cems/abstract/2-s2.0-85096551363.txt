Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized by sol-gel method and used for supercapacitor application. Structural and morphological properties were studied by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The potential use of these nanoparticles as an electrode for supercapacitors was investigated by the electrochemical behavior using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The CV curves of the cobalt ferrite nanoparticle modified electrode showed a typical pseudocapacitive behavior.
