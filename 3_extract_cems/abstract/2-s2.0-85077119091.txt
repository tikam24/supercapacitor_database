This paper introduces a system for electric braking energy recovery of the rotational system with brushless DC motor. The energy storage unit is composed of supercapacitor (SC) bank. The power module combines the bidirectional DC/DC converter with buck and boost circuits. The SC bank can provide electric energy for starting, and the energy can be recovered quickly into the SC bank in the electric braking state. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of this control strategy, and the efficiency improvement in the energy utilization is introduced.
