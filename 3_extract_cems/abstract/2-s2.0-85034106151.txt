The energy density of an electric double layer (EDL) capacitor, a type of supercapacitor, depends on the ion distribution within the micropores of electrodes that are typically made of amorphous carbon. By using coarse-grained models and the classical density functional theory, we investigate the distributions of ionic species among different idealized nanopores in contact with an asymmetric ionic liquid mixture and the effects of the bulk electrolyte composition on capacitive energy storage. We find that a charged pore is always small-ion selective, provided all ions have the same valence and similar non-electrostatic interactions. While small ions enhance both the EDL capacitance and the accessibility of micropores, an ionic mixture containing ions of different sizes may yield a capacitance higher than those corresponding to pure ionic liquids. The increased capacitance may be attributed to more efficient ion packing near the charged surface. At certain conditions, the improvement is on a par with the anomalous capacitance rise for pure ionic liquids in electrodes with ultranarrow pores.
