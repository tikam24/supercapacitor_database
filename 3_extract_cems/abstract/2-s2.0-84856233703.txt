MnO 2 nano hollow sphere was prepared by liquid co-precipitation with different concentrations of cationic surfactant CTAB. The morphology and structure of the prepared MnO 2 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and low temperature nitrogen adsorption. It was revealed that the obtained manganese dioxide was α-MnO 2 and the particle size of samples was between 100 and 300 nm. As evidenced by the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge test, 0.014 mol/L was found to be the optimum impact concentration of CTAB. The MnO 2 synthesized under optimum conditions showed the specific capacitance 178 F/g at the current density of 500 mA/g and its BET area is 229.8 m 2/g, compared to the 126 F/g and 178.4 m 2/g of the MnO 2 synthesized without surfactant. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
