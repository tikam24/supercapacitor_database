This paper describes a novel equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle. The vehicle is composed of a fuel cell as main energy source, batteries and supercapacitors as peaking power sources. Through using fuel cell efficiency penalty coefficient, battery SOC coefficient and supercapacitor SOC coefficient, the designed new strategy aims to operate the fuel cell system at its best efficiency point, the battery as a long term energy buffer and supercapacitor to supply peak power. Considering the characteristic differences between battery and supercapacitor, different SOC penality coefficients are set to full play the potential of battery's large storage ability and supercapacitor's fast charge/discharge power. The proposed energy management is validated by simulation using driving cycle with urban pattern.
