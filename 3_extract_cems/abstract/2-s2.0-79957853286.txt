Nanostructured α-Ni(OH)2/ mesoporous carbon composites were synthesized by a facile solvothermal method using sodium dodecyle sulfate as a soft template and urea as a hydrolysis-controlling agent. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD), and scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Electrochemical properties studies were carried out using cyclic voltammetry(CV) and galvanostaitc charge/discharge method. The results exhibited that the α-Ni(OH)2/ mesoporous carbon composites single electrode had high specific capacitance in KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of the α-Ni(OH)2/ mesoporous carbon composites single electrode was up to 2191 F/g in 6 M KOH solution at a charge-discharge current density of 4 mA/cm2, when the mass percent of mesoporous carbon was 5%. It is suggested its potential application in the electrode material for supercapacitors. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
