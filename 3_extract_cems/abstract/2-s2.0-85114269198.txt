A series of covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are prepared via ionothermal synthesis for supercapacitors. Due to the feature of adjustable pore structure and rich nitrogen, CTFs with regular structure can be used as a group of model compounds to further investigate the influence of pore size and heteroatom on supercapacitors. By comparing the performance of CTFs with different pore structures and nitrogen contents, the experimental results show that BPY-CTF with high specific surface area of 2278 m2 g−1, mesopores structure, and suitable nitrogen content displays a specific capacitance of 393.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. According to the results and analysis, the existence of mesopores largely enhance the contact area between the electrode material and electrolyte, and then boost the charge transfer. On the other hand, N-doping has a prominent effect on improving the Faradaic pseudo-capacitance and conductivity for CTF electrode materials. This work will inspire further research on the development of highly efficient electrode materials for energy storage devices.
