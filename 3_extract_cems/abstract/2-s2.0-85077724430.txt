Carbon-ruthenium xerogel based electrode behaved more like a capacitor material with the highest specific capacitance of 522 F/g for three electrode system & 163 F/g for two electrode system. Samples embedded with maximum amount of ruthenium containing material, exhibited less specific surface area; but highest specific capacitance and specific energy. Electrodes having maximum amount of ruthenium exhibited least charge transfer resistance of 3.8 Î©. Quasi-rectangular cyclic voltammetry and symmetric charge-discharge curves were observed due to the capacitive nature. The use of Na2SO4 & KOH electrolyte medium elevated the potential range of the system resulting in high specific capacitance.
