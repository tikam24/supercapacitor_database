In this paper, a novel power management strategy (PMS) for power-sharing among battery and supercapacitor (SC) energy storage systems has been proposed and applied to resolve the demand-generation difference and DC bus voltage regulation. The proposed compensation for PI controller managed hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) provides for improved DC bus regulation with minimal battery stress levels. Further, redirections of unwaged battery currents to SCs for fast compensations in the proposed PMS enhances battery life span. Moreover, the stability analysis of DC microgrid is also evaluated. The proposed PMS effectiveness was investigated by simulations, including a comparison of peak deviations in dc bus voltage with a traditional control strategy. The results have been experimentally verified by hardware-in-loop (HIL) on an FPGA-based real-time simulator.
