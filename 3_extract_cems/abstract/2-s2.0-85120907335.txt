Supercapacitors have the characteristics of high specific capacitance, long cycle life and green pollution-free, and their excellent electrochemical performance has attracted much attention. In this research, NiMoO4/g-C3N4 composite powder was hydrothermally synthesized, and the composite powder was coated on foamed nickel to prepare NiMoO4/g-C3N4 electrode material. The results show that the morphology of NiMoO4/g-C3N4 powder is mainly NiMoO4 nanorods and g-C3N4 clumps, and NiMoO4 nanorods grow on g-C3N4 nanosheets. The electrochemical performance test results show that adding 30at% g-C3N4 to NiMoO4 can reduce the equivalent series resistance and diffusion impedance of the capacitor system, which is beneficial to the oxidation-reduction reaction. Compared with other electrode materials with different g-C3N4 contents, NiMoO4/g-C3N4 electrode materials with a g-C3N4 content of 30at% have higher specific capacitance (584.3 F/g) and better rate characteristics.
