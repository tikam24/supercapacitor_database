A non-isolated Multiple Input Converter (MIC) with an input port, two storage ports and a load port is proposed. The synthesis of the proposed four port converter with its switch realization is presented. A steady state analysis of each operating mode with a small-signal model is derived, and a stability analysis is done. A mode selection controller is proposed to automatically choose a specific operating mode based on the voltage levels of the different source and storage units. In addition, a voltage control loop is used to regulate the output voltage. A 200W prototype is built with a TMS320F28027 DSP controller to test the feasibility of the operating modes. Simulation and experimental results show the ability of the proposed converter to handle multiple inputs either individually or simultaneously.
