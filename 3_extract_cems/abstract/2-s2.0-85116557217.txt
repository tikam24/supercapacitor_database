Immense attention has been drawn towards electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) as a viable intermittent energy storage solution, owing to their ultra-fast charge/discharge rates and long cycle life. However, the high activation energy of ionic conductivity innate in conventional aprotic organic electrolytes has greatly impeded the feasibility of high-performance EDLCs. Herein, we investigate and compare the physicochemical properties and performance of electrolytes based on potassium hexafluorophosphate (KPF6) and commercial triethylmethy-lammonium tetra-fluoroborate (TEMABF4) salts in EDLCs. Compared to commercial TEMABF4-based electrolytes, KPF6 salt-based electrolytes (in acetonitrile solvent) demonstrate outstanding rate performance. The KPF6 salt-based electrolyte further manifests lower ionic resistance within activated carbon pores as well as lower interfacial resistance between electrode and electrolyte; an affirmation of not the high ionic conductivity but rather the eminence of low activation energy. The low activation energy can be attributed to the low effective nuclear charge of the K+ cations that allow anions to transverse easily in solvent state. This study not only underpins potassium-ion (K+) as a fast charge carrier, but also a viable solution for the next-generation non-aqueous power devices relying on monovalent alkali cations.
