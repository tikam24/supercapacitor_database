In this work, Ni0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 is synthesized as binder-based (NZF) and binder-free electrodes (NZF@NF). The binder-free electrode is directly synthesized on nickel foam via facile hydrothermal techniques. The crystalline phase of both of these electrodes is examined through X-ray diffraction. Their morphology is investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and highresolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which revealed the well-defined nanostructure with the shape like thin hexagonal platelets. The chemical composition is verified by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Their electrochemical properties are analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The NZF@NF electrode has outperformed the binder-based NZF electrode in terms of electrochemical performance owing to the 3D interconnected structure of the nickel foam. The NZF@NF electrode has delivered a high specific capacity of 504 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, while its counterpart has delivered a specific capacity of 151 F g−1 at the same current density.
