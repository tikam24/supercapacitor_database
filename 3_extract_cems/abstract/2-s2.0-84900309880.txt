With the advent of printed electronics and flexible devices, flexible energy storage has received so much attention in the past few years. In this work, a scalable process for manufacturing of a flexible supercapacitor device based on nanostructured PANI and MnO2 was demonstrated. In this process, nanostructured materials are transformed into form of a printable ink which is applied on a current collector using a simple screen printing method, which can be used in a roll to roll scheme. The flexible device was assembled using a solid polymer electrolyte and the electrochemical performance of the devices was evaluated. A specific capacitance of 120 F/g and 89 F/g for two symmetrical devices based on PANI and MnO2 were obtained respectively. The devices are showing relatively good cyclability and columbic efficiency. Â© 2013 Materials Research Society.
