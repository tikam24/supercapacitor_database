A new MnO2@NiS2/Ni(OH)2 heterostructure material was synthesized using a two-step hydrothermal process. The presence of 1D MnO2 nanosticks provided a substrate for the junction and facilitated the charge transmission. The grafting of NiS2/Ni(OH)2 sheets onto the surface of MnO2 enlarged the specific surface area (SSA) of the material. As a result, the SSA of the electrode material was improved and the capacitor performance was optimized. The material also showed a high rate capacity and long-term cycling capability.
