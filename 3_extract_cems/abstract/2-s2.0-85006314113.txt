Supercapacitors as a new-type energy storage devices have drawn much attention because they can provide higher power density than batteries and higher energy density than traditional dielectric capacitors. But at present their application are still exist the defect of low energy density. Carbon materials, metal oxides and conductive polymers are three more commonly utilized electrode materials for supercapacitors, and the different forms of carbon materials are the most widely research and application of capacitor electrode materials.Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a porous and biological polymer which secreted by some bacterias, and BC has special properties of high mechanical strength and modulus, high porosity, good size and thermal stability. Consequently, significant research interest has been directed into the research of the carbon electrode materials which use bacterial cellulose as a raw material. In this paper, we present a review of the research progress of the BC based electrode material for supercapacitor application in term of the types of materials, preparation methods and performances. Furthermore, the optimum configuration, synthesizing method and the developing trend for the bacterial cellulose composite are summarized.
