A composite POPM-TFP-rGO has been synthesized via condensing M and TFP on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) under solvothermal conditions. Coupled with the well electrical conductivity of rGO, POPM-TFP-rGO exhibited excellent energy storage capacity with a high specific capacitance of 311.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, suggesting a well electrochemical performance as a capacitive electrode material. The electrodes functionalized with POPM-TFP-rGO exhibit a 170% increase in capacitance as compared to those functionalized with POPM-TFP without rGO. The ion conduction inside the pores throughout POPM-TFP-rGO, the redox processes arising from triazine unites and electrical conductivity of rGO could be responsible for this high supercapacitor performance.
