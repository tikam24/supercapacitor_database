Vulcanized natural rubber latex foams (NRLF) are a kind of sponge product with multi-bubble structures that are widely used in household products. The recycling of waste scraps from the production of NRLFs reduces production cost and alleviates environmental pollution. In our work, we demonstrate that industrial waste NRLF scraps having porous networks of uniformly distributed sulfur bonds within their structure may be efficiently transformed into S- and O-doped carbons with a high specific surface area and interconnected micropores. This process is accomplished through segmental calcination, temperature control, and KOH activation. We further show for the first time that the S-doped porous carbon derived from natural rubber latex foam scraps (NRSC) via an appropriate synthetic route offers outstanding potential for supercapacitor applications. In a traditional three-electrode system, NRSC displayed a specific capacitance of 430 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 in an electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4.
