Piezoelectric circular diaphragm energy harvesters have been shown to perform well under high as well as low stress and a wide frequency range. This paper studies the performance of drum harvesters made using piezo buzzer elements under low stress and low frequency conditions. Drum harvesters of different sizes and steel ring IDs were fabricated and analysed for their electrical power harvesting capability under a dynamic force of 0.5 N in the frequency range of 30-300 Hz. A maximum DC output power of 2.463 mW was obtained with a 27mm drum harvester having steel ring ID of 24 mm across a load resistance of 27.4 kÎ© at a resonant frequency of 213 Hz. A supercapacitor was charged using these harvesters and used to power a Arduino microcontroller board. The results show that these drum harvesters are capable of powering low power microelectronic devices using ambient vibrations from various sources.
