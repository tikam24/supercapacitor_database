A new ternary composite of 1T-molybdenum disulfide, hexagonal tungsten trioxide, and reduced graphene oxide (M-W-rGO) is synthesized by using a one-pot hydrothermal process. The synergetic effect of 1T-MoS2 and hexa-WO3 nanoflowers improves the electrochemical performance for supercapacitors by inducing additional active sites and hexagonal tunnels, respectively, which lead to high storage capacity and easy transfer of electrolyte ions. The ternary M-W-rGO composite has a high specific capacitance of 836 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is nearly twice that of binary composites of M-rGO and W-rGO with high capacitance retention of 86.35 % after 3000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1. This study provides a new ternary composite that can be used as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
