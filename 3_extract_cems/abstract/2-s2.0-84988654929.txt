Electrical double layer capacitors store energy on two adjacent layers, resulting in fast charging and discharging, but their energy density is limited by the available surface area. In this study, using poly(methyl methacrylate) assisted sonication, carbon nanotube buckypapers with specific surface area as high as 950 m2/g have been processed. Performance of these high surface area buckypapers have been evaluated as supercapacitor electrodes. The energy density of these high surface area electrodes at low power density of 0.68 kW/kg was 22.3 Wh/kg, and at high power density of 84 kW/kg was 3.13 Wh/kg using the ionic liquid electrolyte.
