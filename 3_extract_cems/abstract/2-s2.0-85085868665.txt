The present work deals a new polymer electrolyte, that is, polyvinylpyrrolidone doped with salt ammonium iodide and plasticizer ethylene carbonate (EC) prepared via solution casting technique for supercapacitor application. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out using CH instrument electrochemical work station which shows enhancement in conductivity (Ïƒ) value by doping EC. Polarized optical microscopy confirms the reduction of crystallinity in the polymer electrolyte which established a good relation with our conductivity data. Fourier transform spectroscopy proves the composite nature of plasticized polymer electrolyte. X-Ray diffraction shows the decrease in the crystallinity in polymer matrix after incorporation with the plasticizer. A laboratory-scale electrical double-layer capacitor has been fabricated using graphene oxide electrode and maximum conducting polymer electrolyte which shows reasonable performance.
