Transition metal oxides (TMOx) have garnered focused for their potential usage in supercapacitors attributed to their high specific capacitance (Cs), safety, economical, and notable electrochemical activity. But their low cycling stability has been increased by doping strategy. In this research, we report the fabrication of Ni3S2 (NS) and Ce doped Ni3S2 (CNS) with different concentration (0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 mmol) via hydrothermal method without the use of surfactants. Structure, morphology, and electrochemical performances of pure and Ce doped Ni3S2 nanostructures have been investigated. The crystalline structure has been investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and morphological behavior with Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical finding suggests that the specific capacitance (Cs) of a Ni3S2 nanomaterial doped with 0.3 Ce is studied by using a three-electrode setup exhibited the maximum capacitance of 2349.10 F g−1 and energy density (Ed) of 72.07 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The symmetric behavior of 0.3 Ce doped Ni3S2 electrode also determined with a two-electrode device made from 0.3 Ce doped Ni3S2 which display a higher specific capacitance (Cs) of 1139.22 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. This highlights the electrocatalytic potential of an symmetric device based on 0.3-CNS for next-generation supercapacitors.
