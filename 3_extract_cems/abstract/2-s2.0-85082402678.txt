A first principle model was used to fit the impedance data of intrinsic pseudocapacitors based on polypyrrole and manganese dioxide electrodes and was validated by successfully predicting charge/discharge characteristics. The model performs non-linear regression to an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data using a rigorous prototypical model of pseudocapacitance, which emphasizes an integrated description of the various components of the capacitor at the microscopic and macroscopic level. Parametric studies showcase further how important microscopic variables in pseudocapacitors influence both impedance spectra and galvanostatic discharge.
