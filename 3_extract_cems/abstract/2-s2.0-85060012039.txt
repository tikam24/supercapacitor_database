In this paper, the activated carbon monolith (ACM) for the supercapacitor electrode is produced from different of raw materials and methods. Carbon electrodes made from several materials such as rubberwood sawdust (RWSD), mission grass flower (MGF) and banana peel (BP). Preparation of the carbon electrode begins with a pre-carbonization process at a temperature of 250 °C and its followed by grinding the sample, then chemically activated using several activator agents such as KOH, ZnCl 2 , and NaOH. The sample is then formed into a pellet form with a pressure of 8 tons using a Hydraulic press and followed by carbonization and physical activation using a furnace in the temperature range of 600-900 °C. The difference in the electrode production process was intended to obtain the difference in samples specific surface area. The specific surface area was carried out by N 2 gas adsorption-desorption method while the specific capacitance was performed by using Cyclic Voltammetry method. The surface area and capacitance are obtained by multiplying the mass on the data of specific surface area and specific capacitance. Based on the results it has been found that the capacitance of the supercapacitor cell increases linearly with the increase of the electrode surface area.
