Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also quoted as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are causing great concern in supercapacitors (SCs) field owing to their ultra-high surface-areas, tailorable pore-sizes and shapes, and diverse structural architectures. This review mainly focuses on the recent progress in various branches of MOFs materials including porous coordination networks, two-dimensional (2D) MOFs, entangled MOFs, polyoxometalate MOFs (POMOFs), heterometallic MOFs, and some new emerging MOFs, as well as their applications in SCs. The superiority and the deficiency of various MOF types were systematically introduced and summarized. Additionally, the challenges and perspectives relate to pristine MOFs and MOFs-based composites for the applications in SCs have also been discussed. We hope that our review could provide guiding frameworks to design and fabricate MOFs materials with more practical energy-storage applications.
