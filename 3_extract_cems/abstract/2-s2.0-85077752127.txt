A successful transformation of Datura metel seed pod into activated carbon (AC) codoped with nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) contents have opened up a new route in this process which turned the material to be source material for supercapacitor application. The appropriate proportion of KOH with raw material and the activation condition were the key factors in this conversion process. The conversion of Datura metel seed pod into AC has opened the possibility of the material for supercapacitor application. HRSEM/EDX with elemental mapping and XPS analysis evidenced the morphologies and codoped surface functionalities. XRD, Raman spectra and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm analysis were studied. The activation temperature 600 Â°C for 1 h with 30 wt% of KOH resulting the surface area of the derived AC (DM 3) is found to be 795.4857 m2/g. The codoped surface functionalities have led to a significant specific capacitance of 340 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The novel material exhibits excellent cycling stability with 95.24% capacitance retention at 1 A/g for 3000 cycles proved to be an excellent electrode material for energy storage especially for supercapacitor application.
