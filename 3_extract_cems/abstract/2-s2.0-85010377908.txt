Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials with unique properties such as mechanical stability, flexibility, high surface area and chemical stability, have shown great potential for supercapacitor electrodes. In this review, we focus on recent development of 2D materials based supercapacitors, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and carbides. The synthesis methods and electrochemical properties are summarized. Except their promising advantages, the easy aggregation and low electrical conductivity of some 2D materials lead to low electrochemical performance are discussed. Finally, to achieve high performance 2D materials based supercapacitors, some perspectives and outlook are proposed.
