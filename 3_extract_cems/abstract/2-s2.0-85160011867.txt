Fe2O3/poly-2-aminothiophenol (P2ATP) nanocomposite is prepared under the oxidation of 2-aminothiopheol using FeCl3. Under this in-situ oxidation, the Fe2O3 is immersed inside the produced polymer for Fe2O3/P2ATP formation of Dumbbell-like shape nanocomposite. While the polymerization of 2-aminothiophenol using K2S2O8 oxidant led to the formation of a broken ball-shape micropolymer. These great morphologies with a high surface area are confirmed using SEM analyses. Moreover, TEM micrograph is included to confirm these morphologies. The chemical composition is confirmed through the position of the functional groups using FTIR and then through XRD analyses. Then, the supercapacitor (pseudo capacitor) is fabricated using Fe2O3/P2ATP nanocomposite and tested using 1.0 M NaOH electrolyte. The charge and cyclic voltammetry studies are performed, in which the specific capacitance (CS) and energy density (E) are calculated. The produced CS and E values are 44.5 F/g and 9 W.h.kgâˆ’ 1, respectively. This supercapacitor has a great impedance behavior that illustrates the charge transfer through the electrolyte and the charge storage on the plates. The stability is studied till 500 charge cycles, in which this pseudo capacitor has the stability of 98.9% till 200 cycles, which represents high retention coefficient.
