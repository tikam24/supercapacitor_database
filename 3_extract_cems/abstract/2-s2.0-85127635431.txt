Since the output characteristics of the fuel cell are relatively soft, the voltage of the single cell is lower, and there is no power regulation ability, the output voltage changes easily, and the generated DC is unstable, which cannot directly meet the voltage and power requirements of the motor controller. In this paper, research on some problems of fuel cell working alone. A new multi-port DC / DC converter is designed based on the traditional single bidirectional DC-DC converter, so that the auxiliary energy (super capacitor, accumulator, etc), the main power supply of fuel cells and the load are effectively combined to work together. The experimental results show that the converter has higher energy conversion efficiency and voltage conversion ratio, and Low frequency current ripple at input and output sides.
