Templating techniques have been widely adopted for the synthesis of porous carbons, such as oxygen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (O-PCNs), but the effect of the surface characteristics of templates on the surface functionality and performance of a derived carbon has not been well studied. Herein, a series of laboratory-made superbases of K/Mg(OH)2 with different K/Mg ratios were employed as template to fabricate nanocarbon materials. The aim is to find out how the strength of template basicity could influence the surface functionalities and the supercapacitor performances of the derived O-PCNs. The resulting materials are rich in conjugated hydroxyl and carbonyl groups that are electrochemically active owing to the protection of the conjugated hydroxyl group by KOH and the dehydrogenation step catalyzed by magnesium oxide. Systematic investigations revealed that with the increase of basic strength, the content of the derived electrochemically active oxygen species in the forms of conjugated carbonyl ([sbnd]C[dbnd]O) and hydroxyl ([sbnd]C[sbnd]OH) first increases from 8.4 atom% to 11.4 atom% then decreases to 9.25 atom%. Moreover, the microporosity of the O-PCNs stepwise increases with the rise of KOH loading, ascribable to the effect of KOH etching on the carbon skeleton. The O-PCN-20 templated by 20 % K/Mg(OH)2 is rich in porosity, large in surface area (930 m2/g) and high in active oxygen content (11.4 atom%). With high active surface area and extra Faradaic capacitance, O-PCN-20 exhibited superior supercapacitor performances including large specific capacitance of 375 F/g@1.0 A/g, high rate capability of 81.1 % (from 1.0 A/g to 20 A/g), energy density of 25.7 Wh/kg@900 W/kg and excellent cycling stability with near 100 % capacitance retentions after 10 000 cycles and more than 86.2 % capacitance retention over 20 000 cycles at large current density of 10 A/g, indicating O-PCN-20 has potential to be used as electrode material for energy storage devices.
