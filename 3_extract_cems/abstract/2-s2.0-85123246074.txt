As an efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage device, the practical application of supercapacitor is largely limited by the low energy density. Therefore, to design desiring electrode materials is very important in improving the performance of supercapacitor. In this work, we prepare NiCo-layered double hydroxides (NiCo–LDH) nanosheet arrays grown uniformly on Cu0.92Co2.08O4 (CCO) nanowires by a two-step solvothermal route. The heterogeneous core-shell structure consists of high conductive shell and high capacitive core. It can slow down the agglomeration of NiCo–LDH nanosheets and improve the conductivity of material. It also facilitates ion diffusion and faradaic redox reaction, thus enhances the electrochemical performance. CCO@NiCo–LDH sample delivers a specific capacity of 1652 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and still 124 F g−1 at 10 g−1. A flexible asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using the synthesized product as cathode. It presents an energy density of 42.38 Wh kg−1 at 1350 W kg−1.
