In this study, we analyzed an innovative, scalable, and simple preparation of branch-like MoS2 nanomaterial (BL-MS) for symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) applications. The BL-MS SSC device reveals a good specific capacitance of 124.1 F g−1 and a large voltage window (1.5 V). The BL-MS SSC device also shows a high energy density (38.79 W h kg−1) and high power density (15900 W kg−1). Further, the BL-MS SSC device displays a robust long-term stability of 77.7% and 89.5% in 40 h of voltage-holding tests and 10,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles, respectively. The BL-MS SSC device shows a low leakage current of 0.25 mA within a few seconds of removing the test voltage; it decreases and becomes nearly constant at 0.06 mA for 2 h during the voltage-holding test. The BL-MS SSC device exhibits good device behavior, the potential dropping from 1.5 to 0.62 V during the 2 h self-discharge process. Moreover, we considered the self-discharge mechanisms of the BL-MS SSC, determining that the diffusion-controlled process is dominant over a leakage-current-through-a-resistance model. Therefore, it is concluded that branch-like MoS2 nanomaterial is a promising and high-performance electrode material for energy storage in portable electronic devices.
