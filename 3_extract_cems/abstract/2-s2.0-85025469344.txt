The demand for a new generation of flexible, portable, and high-capacity power sources increases rapidly with the development of advanced wearable electronic devices. Here we report a simple process for large-scale fabrication of self-standing composite film electrodes composed of NiCo2O4@carbon nanotube (CNT) for supercapacitors. Among all composite electrodes prepared, the one fired in air displays the best electrochemical behavior, achieving a specific capacitance of 1,590 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 while maintaining excellent stability. The NiCo2O4@CNT/CNT film electrodes are fabricated via stacking NiCo2O4@CNT and CNT alternately through vacuum filtration. Lightweight, flexible, and self-standing film electrodes (≈24.3 µm thick) exhibit high volumetric capacitance of 873 F cm−3 (with an areal mass of 2.5 mg cm−2) at 0.5 A g−1. An all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor consists of a composite film electrode and a treated carbon cloth electrode has not only high energy density (≈27.6 Wh kg−1) at 0.55 kW kg−1 (including the weight of the two electrodes) but also excellent cycling stability (retaining ≈95% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles), demonstrating the potential for practical application in wearable devices.
