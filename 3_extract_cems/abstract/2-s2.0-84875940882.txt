Composites of polyaniline (PANI) and graphene oxide (GO) were prepared in the suspension of GO in the presence of aniline and H2O2 in acidic media. Open-circuit potential measurements confirmed that the simultaneous use of GO and H2O2 made the polymerization of aniline faster and more effective than using GO or H2O2 alone. SEM observation showed that PANI nanoparticles were deposited on GO sheets with uniform and well-arranged morphology. It was found that there were considerably strong interactions between GO and PANI chains in the composites. Along with the cyclic voltammetric properties of typical PANI, the composites exhibited a capacitance as high as 797 F g-1 with a good stability during long-term cyclic voltammetric measurements, which was attributed to the uniform arrangement of PANI nanoparticles on GO sheets, leading to improved charge transport in the composites.
