Electrochemical supercapacitor (EC) is a kind of device able to generate and store clean energy, which makes it the object of intense research. This work proposes a double layer capacitance combination of electrochemical reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon fiber (CF) in addition to pseudocapacitive behavior of polyaniline (PAni) to produce PAni/rGO/CF ternary composite with high capacitive response. rGO/CF and PAni/rGO/CF are obtained by electrochemical methodology. The morphological and structural analyses by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy show that these nanostructured composite materials can be produced successfully. rGO/CF and PAni/rGO/CF samples are evaluated electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and charge/discharge tests. PAni/rGO/CF ternary composite presents a better performance in terms of specific capacitance and electrochemical reversibility than that of rGO/CF composite and CF electrodes. The results show that this ternary composite can be a promising electrode for applications in supercapacitors.
