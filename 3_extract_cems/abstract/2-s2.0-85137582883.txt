Electric vehicles' drivetrain is primarily comprised of an energy storage unit (battery pack or/and supercapacitor bank), a power converter, an electric motor and control. Thus, for purposes of studying the processes in an EV's drivetrain, modelling is performed with such system. In this paper a study of regenerative braking of the system battery - power converter - electric motor is presented. The study is performed on an experimental stand in laboratory environment. In addition, simulation models of the system with two control strategies are made, verified by the experimental stand and presented. Furthermore, a comparison between obtained simulation results is given.
