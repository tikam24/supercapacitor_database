High performance actived carbon–MnO2–polyaniline (AC/MnO2/PANI) composite was synthesized via a two-step method. AC/MnO2 was firstly obtained by a chemical co-precipitation procedure, and then exposed to an in situ polymerization process of aniline under acidic conditions to form the AC/MnO2/PANI composite. The structures and morphologies of the products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Results show that the AC/MnO2/PANI hybrid exhibits better capacitance than that of pure AC and the AC/MnO2 electrodes.
