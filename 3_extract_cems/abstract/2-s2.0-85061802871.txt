This work presents a state of the art review of energy storage systems and its applications integrating an alternative technology for the electrical energy generation known as fuel cell of PEM type. This review focus on supercapacitors and Ion-Lithium batteries as energy storage systems. The state of the art review contains an analysis of the evolution of the classical and fractional modeling based on equivalent circuits, a survey of hybrid energy systems and its control, as well as, a study of the methods proposed in the literature to estimate the state of charge. In addition, we describe some applications of the supercapacitors and batteries in hybrid energy storage systems for electric vehicles.
