Graphene is considered a promising active electrode material due to a large surface area, high electronic conductivity, and chemical and mechanical stabilities for supercapacitor (SC) applications. However, the current bottleneck is the fabrication of restacking-inhibited graphene on an electrode level which otherwise loses the capability to achieve the aforementioned properties. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of restacking-inhibited nitrogen (N)-incorporated mesoporous graphene for high energy SCs. The melamine-formaldehyde acts as a restacking inhibitor by forming a bonding with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) through a condensation reaction and as an N precursor to be decomposed to create open pores and N sources upon heat treatment. The d-spacing increases up to 0.352 nm and the surface area is as high as 698 m2 g−1 with high mesoporosity, confirming restacking inhibition by N incorporation decomposed by melamine-formaldehyde. The restacking-inhibited RGO-based SC cells in organic electrolyte show the specific capacitance of 25.8 F g−1, the energy density of 21.8 kW kg−1 and 85% of capacitance retention for 5000 cycles, which are better than those of pristine RGO-based cells. These improved SC performances are attributed to the fast ion transport through a mesoporous channel in crumpled structure and the doping effect of N incorporation. This work provides a simple yet effective chemical approach to fabricate restacking-inhibited RGO electrodes for improved SC performances.
