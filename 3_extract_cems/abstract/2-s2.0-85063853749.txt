Mn 3 O 4 -nanofiber with high aspect ratio is prepared by a simple electrospinning process. The thermal, structural and morphological characterizations are carried out by TGA, XRD and FESEM, respectively. To assess the property of nanofiber for the use in supercapacitors, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) are performed in 2M KOH electrolyte with the potential window ranging from +0.42V to -0.45V. Effect of polymer concentration and electric field intensity on the diameter of as-spun nanofiber was studied. Further, appropriate heating rate was used for sintering to obtain aligned nanofiber. High specific capacitance of 150(Â±5) F g -1 is obtained by Mn 3 O 4 nanofibers. The rate performance is also found to be good. This improved performance in terms of high specific capacitance and rate capability is ascribed to the nanofabric morphology which provides more active sites and easy access path for ions/electrons.
