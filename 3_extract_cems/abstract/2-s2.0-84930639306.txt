Flower-like architectures of a Co-doped Ni(OH)2 composite were prepared using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O and CO(NH2)2 as raw materials via a hydrothermal process. The as-prepared sample was characterized in detail by XRD, SEM, FT-IR and other techniques. The XRD and SEM analysis indicate the microarchitecture was accumulated by Ni(OH)2 nanorods with good crystallinity. The electrochemical properties of the Co-doped Ni(OH)2 composite was also investigated, and a three electrode system was used to test the electrochemical properties and the Co-doped Ni(OH)2 composite shown higher activity than pure Ni(OH)2 which was obtained by Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and CO(NH2)2 as raw materials via a hydrothermal process. The electrochemical properties could be seen in the CV curves, galvanostatic discharge curves and the specific capacitance based of the CV curves and discharge curves.
