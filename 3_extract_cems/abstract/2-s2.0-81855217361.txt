This paper presents a new direct integration scheme for supercapacitors that are used to mitigate short term power fluctuations in wind power systems. The idea is to replace ordinary capacitors of a 3-level flying capacitor inverter by supercapacitors and operate them under variable voltage conditions. This approach eliminates the need of interfacing dc-dc converters for supercapacitor integration and thus considerably improves the overall efficiency. However, the major problem of this unique system is the change of supercapacitor voltages. An analysis on the effects of these voltage variations are presented. A space vector modulation method, built from the scratch, is proposed to generate undistorted current even in the presence of dynamic changes in supercapacitor voltages. A supercapacitor voltage equalisation algorithm is also proposed. Furthermore, resistive behavior of supercapacitors at high frequencies and the need for a low pass filter are highlighted. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system in suppressing short term wind power fluctuations. Â© 2011 IEEE.
