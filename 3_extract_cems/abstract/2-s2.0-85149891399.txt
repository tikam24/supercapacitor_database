Investigating the best combination of different materials like graphene oxide and phospholipids, as well as their physicochemical parameters, may permit exploring the use of this hybrid compound in new applications, such as the development of (bio)supercapacitor devices. In this study, Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films onto conductive electrodes containing a nanostructured complex of graphene-oxide (GO)/manganese dioxide (MnO2) and dimyristoyl-phosphatidic acid (DMPA) were fabricated to investigate their properties as supercapacitors. Mechanical properties were analyzed by surface pressure-area isotherms and surface compressibility. Electrochemical measurements were conducted by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge. 9-layer DMPA+GO/MnO2 LB films presented the performance of a supercapacitor, exhibiting capacitances of 30 Î¼F/cm2 and charge-discharge cycles of 185 s. The results indicate a synergism between the chemical species caused by the organized materials at the nanoscale, leading to properties that permit to employ LB films as an electroactive nanostructured interface for energy storage biodevices.
