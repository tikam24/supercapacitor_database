Perovskite-type CeMnO3 nanofibers (NFs) were effectively synthesized via electrospinning and consequent calcination processes. The nanofibers with porous surface exhibit a high specific surface area of 103.88 m2 g−1 with mesopores. The perovskite CeMnO3 NFs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microstructure and morphology of CeMnO3 were observed by scanning electron and transmission electron microscopes. The Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy manifested the homogeneous distribution of cerium, manganese, and oxygen. The electrochemical properties of CeMnO3 NFs were implemented using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in alkaline aqueous electrolyte. The Faradic redox reaction occurred at the electrode surface was precisely concluded. The specific capacitance of CeMnO3 NFs was 159.59 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. This research offers a new strategy to synthesize CeMnO3 perovskite material for high-performance supercapacitor, indicating its potential application as a supercapacitor electrode in energy storage devices.
