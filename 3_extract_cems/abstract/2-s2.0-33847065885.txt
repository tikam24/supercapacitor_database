The Component Hybrid Dynamic Nets CHDN is a graphic model for hybrid dynamic systems. The CHDN allows an individual representation of every component in the hybrid system. On the base of this methodology a software tool dedicated to the electrical engineering simulation has been developed. So, the aim of this paper is to present a brief review of model's structure and to describe the developed software which has been called SimRDH. In order to show the abilities of our tool, a motorisation device, including the use of the Fuel Cell and Supercapacitors hase been studied. The obtained results are encouraging especially in the development of simulator of E.V. areas. Â©2005 IEEE.
