The novel polyaniline/MWCNT composite hydrogel has been successfully synthesized on carbon cloth using in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline in the presence of MWCNT and phytic acid which can further be used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor. The use of electrode without binder is an effective approach to get better electrochemical behavior, which makes the ions move quicker. The supercapacitor cell has been built in a Teflon Swagelok assembly by sandwiching a separator impregnated with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte between two symmetrical hydrogel electrodes and used further for electrochemical characterization. The electrochemical behavior of supercapacitor electrodes has been explored in a two-electrode cell configuration using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The electrochemical results reveal that in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, polyaniline/MWCNT composite hydrogel possesses a high specific capacitance (Cs) value of 277.59 F/g as compared to Cs value of 142.24 F/g for polyaniline hydrogel at 0.25 A/g. The polyaniline/MWCNT electrode shows superior rate capability and outstanding cyclic stability up to 5000 consecutive cycles. The electrochemical performance of composite hydrogel may be attributed to its well-designed nanostructure and the collective effect of both components. It may be concluded that as prepared composite hydrogel serves as a favorable electrode material for highly capable flexible energy storage system.
