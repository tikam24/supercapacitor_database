For aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) using mesoporous carbon as electrode material, besides electrode morphology, wettability is one of the key factors limiting their electrochemical performances. So far, approaches to improve the wettability of carbon electrode materials include using amphiphilic or hydrophilic polymers, adding additives with low surface tension and doping with B, N, F, O and other heteroatoms. Here, it is found that the doping of manganese metal can effectively improve the wettability of phenol-formaldehyde resin-based carbon (PFc) electrode material due to increase of nitrogen oxide active sites. In addition, the introduction of the second metal Ni, following change of morphology, improves the ion diffusion control capacitance, and at the same time, its redox behaviors form pseudocapacitance for the device. Especially, the specific capacitance at 0.5 A g−1 and energy density at 0.1 A g−1 increases from 56 F g−1 and 0.26 W h kg−1 for Mn-PFc to 133 F g−1 and 0.79 W h kg−1 for Ni-Mn-PFc. Meanwhile, the coulombic efficiency still remains 97% over 1000 cycles during cycling stability test. This research will provide a new pathway for the amelioration of wettability of mesoporous carbon materials.
