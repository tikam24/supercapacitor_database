We have successfully developed the carbon nanostructured materials prepared on metallic substrate by easiest and economic way of production. The direct syntheses of multi-walled carbon nanotubes on nickel (Ni) foil metal substrate by thermal chemical vapor deposition (T-CVD). As synthesized forest growth MWCNTs was finding the crystalline peak at 2-25.68 (002) plane through X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphological characterizations were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observed the well aligned and curved MWCNTs typical size 40-60 nm. The MWCNTs were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy low disorder with high intensity graphitic band. The electrochemical performance of cyclic voltammetry (CV) was observed electric double layer capacitors (EDLC) at different scan rates. Charge transfer resistance was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at low resistance (Rct) value such as 7.2. The galvanostatic charge/dischargemeasurements were performed and as prepared MWCNTs as a electrode active materials for electric double layer capacitors without any further additive binder and activated carbon supports. The maximum specific capacitance (Csp) was measured 100.02 F/g at 1 A/g. In order to the facile single step MWCNTs synthesized and electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrode for future energy storage applications.
