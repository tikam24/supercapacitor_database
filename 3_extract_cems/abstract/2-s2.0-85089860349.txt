Potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) have attracted tremendous attention because their energy density is comparable to that of lithium-ion batteries, whose power density and cyclability are similar to those of supercapacitors. Herein, a pomegranate-like graphene-confined cucurbit[6]uril-derived nitrogen-doped carbon (CBC@G) with ultra-high nitrogen-doping level (15.5 at%) and unique supermesopore-macropores interconnected graphene network is synthesized. The carbonization mechanism of cucurbit[6]uril is verified by an in situ TG-IR technology. In a K half-cell configuration, CBC@G anode demonstrates a superior reversible capacity (349.1 mA h g−1 at 0.1 C) as well as outstanding rate capability and cyclability. Moreover, systematic in situ/ex situ characterizations, and theory calculations are carried out to reveal the origin of the superior electrochemical performances of CBC@G. Consequently, PIHCs constructed with CBC@G anode and KOH-activated cucurbit[6]uril-derived nitrogen-doped carbon cathode demonstrate ultra-high energy/power density (172 Wh kg−1/22 kW kg−1) and extraordinary cyclability (81.5% capacity retention for 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1). This work opens up a new application field for cucurbit[6]uril and provides an alternative avenue for the exploitation of high-performance PIHCs.
