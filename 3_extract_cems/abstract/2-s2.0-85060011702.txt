We fabricated a billboard with solar cell using DSSC (Dye Sensitized Solar Cell) and Li+ battery system with supercapacitor parrlel connection. It's a kind of normal type of billboard with the high luminance LEDs. However, This model of billboard is totally needless from external energy source because it's enough to spend electric power by making itself. [1] The additional supplied energy could get electricity from KEPCO (Korea Electric Power Company) the moment of lack of sun light such as rainy season. The most important is this is the first trial in this world, so we can establish our own brand with next energy generation. One feature of billboard is that it turns on only night time so we can make and save the solar energy during day time by using Li+ batteries and supercapacitors, spend it on night tiem. Therefore, any other external power is not required so it's totally eco-friendly model. In addition, we can also control this billboard by using a personal smart-phone.
