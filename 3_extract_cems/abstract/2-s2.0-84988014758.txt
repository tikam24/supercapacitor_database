Synthesis and Electrochemical properties of zinc antimonate nanoparticles have been explored and the strategy was to engage zinc antimonate towards supercapacitors. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were done at different sweep rates and the inclusion of two heterovalent metal cations such as Zn2+ and Sb5+ in the nanostructure participates in the electrochemical phenomena thereby exhibiting pseudocapacitance behavior with a significant specific capacitance of 140.8 F/g at the sweep rate of 10 mV/s was achieved. Further, from galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, it is apparent that the capacitor characteristics were found to be phenomenal in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with good electrochemical constancy over 500 cycles with an incredible capacity retention of 100% at a current density of 1 A/g respectively. The results suggest that the obtained zinc antimonate could be a promising, inexpensive and electrochemically active candidate in supercapacitor application.
