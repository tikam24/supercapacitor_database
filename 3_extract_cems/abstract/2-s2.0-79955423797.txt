Compared with conventional secondary batteries, electrochemical supercapacitors exhibit the long cycling life and high power density, but with low energy density. In order to improve the energy density of supercapacitor, the most promising approaches are either to use an electrode material with large specific capacitance or increase its working voltage by utilizing a hybrid supercapacitor system which consist an activated carbon electrode and a battery elelctrode material (pseudo-capacitor material). The present paper introduces the development of the hybrid supercapacitor and the recent research on the electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitor. Many studies have been undertaken for the various hybrid supercapacitor systems to obtain higher energy density, coupling redox-active material electrodes with activated carbon electrode, such as activated carbon/ NiOOH (FeOOH), activated carbon/graphite, activated carbon/metal oxides and activated carbon/polymer hybrid supercapacitors. Recently, Li-ion intercalated compounds Li4Ti5O 12 and lithium-ion battery carbon materials are attracting much attention as positive electrode with a negative activated carbon electrode. At the same time, many researches focus on the various hybrid capacitor systems consisting of negative activated carbon electrode and positive aqueous Lithium-ion battery materials electrode, such as LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, LiTi2(PO4)3 and LiCo 1/3 Ni1/3 Mn1/3O2. These hybrid supercapacitors are improved in energy density and also with the working voltage increased, comparing with the traditional activated carbon/activated carbon electrochemical double-layer capacitor. In the paper, the research situation and development tend of several kinds of hybrid systems and the currently studied relative materials are also introduced.
