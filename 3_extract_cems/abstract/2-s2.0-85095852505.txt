The new 2D coordination polymers (CPs) [M(L)2(H2O)2]n [M = CoII (1) and NiII (2); L = 4-(pyridin-3-ylcarbamoyl)benzoate] were synthesized from pyridyl amide-functionalized benzoic acid (HL). They were characterized by elemental, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) structural analyses. Single-crystal XRD analysis revealed the presence of a 2D polymeric architecture, and topological analyses disclose a 2,4-connected binodal net. A thermochromic effect leads to the production of two new CPs, 1′ and 2′, by heating at ca. 220 °C, accompanied by a color change from orange to purple in the case of 1 and from blue to green in the case of 2. The transformation of 1 to 1′ takes place through an intermediate (1a) with a different twist of the L- ligand, leading to the formation of a 1D polymeric architecture, as proven by single-crystal XRD analysis. The addition of water or keeping 1′ or 2′ in air for several days leads to regeneration of 1 or 2, respectively. The thermochromic-triggered structural transformations of 1 and 2 were further substantiated by PXRD and UV-vis ground-state diffuse-reflectance absorption studies. The supercapacitance ability of the CPs 1 and 2 and a Ni-Co composite (made from mixing the CPs 1 and 2) was investigated by electroanalytical techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The CP 2 exhibits the highest specific capacity of 273.8 C g-1 at an applied current density of 1.5 A g-1. These newly developed CPs further act as electrocatalysts for the water-splitting reaction.
