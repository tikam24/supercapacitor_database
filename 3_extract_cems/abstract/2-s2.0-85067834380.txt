Polyaniline nanowires (PANI NWs) were synthesized under different temperatures through a facile hydrothermal method and used as electrodes for high-performance pseudocapacitor. The resulting samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron micrographs, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrochemical properties of these PANI electrodes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 0.5M H2SO4 aqueous solution. The highest specific capacitance is obtained on the PANI NWs synthesized under 80°C (PANI-80) with 540.0 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 accompanied with 82% specific capacitance retention after 1000 charge discharge cycles at 5 A g−1 current density.
