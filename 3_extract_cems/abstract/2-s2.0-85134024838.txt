The biggest organ of the human body is skin, it has exceptional sensory capacities in response to the various environmental stimuli present, it acts as a mediator between human and that of environment interactions, and it acts like the body's outer barrier for the purpose of protection. Electronic skins is receiving a feasible attention in recent years along with it has been located great potential in the prosthetics, robots, wearable devices, medical equipment, and various other areas. The emerging field of nano generators and the piezotronics has given us a new variety of flexible electronic skins. The following devices possess high sensitivity, quick response, and self-power capability. This review gives an overview of electronic skins that are provided by nano generators and piezotronics. It mainly focuses on methods, importance of graphene, design and fabrication, application.
