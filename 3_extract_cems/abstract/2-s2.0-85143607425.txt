In this work, we report the synthesis of copper sulfide/vertically aligned graphene nanosheets nanocomposite on carbon cloth (CC/VAGN/CuS) for asymmetric supercapacitors. CC/VAGN is an excellent conductive backbone with interconnected porous architecture, resulting in fast transportation of electrons and ions, meanwhile improving the utilization of active materials. Impressively, the resulting CC/VAGN/CuS electrode obtains an outstanding specific capacity of 342.6 mAh/g at 1 A/g and demonstrates excellent cyclic performance. Moreover, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using two binder-free electrodes, i.e., CC/VAGN/CuS as the positive electrode and CC/VAGN as the negative electrode, exhibits a high specific energy of 76.7 Wh kg−1 at specific power 800.2 W kg−1 with 83.6 % capacity retention over 10,000 cycles at 8 A/g. Our results illustrate the promise of the rational-designed CC/VAGN/CuS as a promising candidate for hybrid supercapacitors.
