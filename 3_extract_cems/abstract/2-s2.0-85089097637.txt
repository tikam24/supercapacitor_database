In this work, for the first time we are reporting the development of a kind of high rate and long cycle life electrode composed of nickel cobalt manganese ternary carbonate hydroxide (NiCoMn-CH) ultrathin nanoflakes coated on Co-CH nanowire arrays (NWAs), which are directly generated on a nickel foam (NF) support. The hierarchical heterostructures are synthesized via a scalable two step solvothermal strategy without any adscititious surfactant and binder. The smart combination of Co-CH and NiCoMn-CH nanostructures in the nanowire arrays shows significant synergistic effect on the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of the as-fabricated supercapacitors. The as-obtained electrode exhibits excellent conductivity and high specific surface area, resulting in an unprecedented high specific capacitance (up to 3224 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode system) and an ultralong cycling stability (92.4% retention after 6000 successive charge–discharge cycles 5 A g−1). Meanwhile, an asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled of the Co-CH@NiCoMn-CH hierarchical nanostructures as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode delivers good energy density of 20.31 W h kg−1 at the power density of 748.46 W kg−1 in the operation window 0–1.5 V. This methodology could be generalized to the design of other novel structured nanomaterials for energy storage devices and other applications.
