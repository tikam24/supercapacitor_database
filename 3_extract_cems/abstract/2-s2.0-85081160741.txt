The stability and durability of laser-induced graphene (LIG) patterns embedded in polymer substrates are significant for their practical application. However, most of currently reported LIG precursors are facing the dilemma of weak structural controllability, poor resistance to acid/base, or bad processability. In this work, we efficiently converted the synthesized poly (Ph-ddm) into LIG using a straightforward CO2 laser, aiming to find a potential LIG precursor with excellent durability under harsh conditions. The graphene structure of obtained LIG was confirmed by Raman spectra, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Results indicated that the poly (Ph-ddm)-based LIG showed a low sheet resistance of 35 Î©/sq as well as a high specific surface area of 883 m2/g. And due to the superior properties of poly (Ph-ddm), the LIG patterns exhibited excellent resistance to strong acid/base solutions and high adhesion on the substrate, which ensured their stable application under severe conditions. Besides, potential application of as-prepared LIG was demonstrated in well-performed supercapacitors and electrode for water splitting in an alkaline medium. Based on the results in this work, polybenzoxazine could be a promising precursor for stable and durable LIG preparation.
