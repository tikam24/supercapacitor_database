Unique MnO<inf>2</inf> nanoflowers (∼25 nm) composed of ultrathin K<inf>0.26</inf>MnO<inf>2</inf> nanoflake assemblies were synthesized by a facile and green procedure. Prototype MnO<inf>2</inf>-NFs//KCl//CNTs asymmetric supercapacitors in a neutral aqueous electrolyte demonstrated pseudocapacitive dominance for the first time in addition to outstanding energy and power densities and superior cycling performance. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.
