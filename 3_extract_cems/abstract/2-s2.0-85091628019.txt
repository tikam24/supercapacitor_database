Graphene has been widely used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. However, parallelly-stacked graphene layers often result in inefficient ion diffusion and electron transfers that usually reduce the rate capability of a supercapacitor. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) composite films were prepared by a solvent evaporation method using PEDOT:PSS as the binder to fix aligned graphene for its good conductivity and strong π-π stacking interactions with the graphene sheets. Analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption, and small-angle X-ray scattering show that the graphene sheets were well aligned when a magnetic field was applied, though they were oriented randomly without the magnetic field. As a capacitor electrode material, the aligned rGO shows a specific capacitance of 169 F g−1 with a capacitance retention of about 70% at a current density of 50 A g−1 and its cyclic voltammetry (CV) loops maintained a rectangular shape at a voltage scan rate of 2 V s−1. The aligned rGO electrode can help break through the limitations of traditional supercapacitors and increase significantly their charge/discharge rate and power density.
