We report here the synthesis of layer structured WS2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrids by a facile hydrothermal method for its possible application as supercapacitor materials in energy storage devices. The prepared two-dimensional materials are characterized thoroughly by various analytical techniques to ascertain their structure and to confirm the absence of any impurities. Two-electrode capacitance measurements have been carried out in aqueous 1 M Na2SO4. The WS2/RGO hybrids exhibited enhanced supercapacitor performance with specific capacitance of 350 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. The obtained capacitance values of WS 2/RGO hybrids are about 5 and 2.5 times higher than bare WS 2 and RGO sheets. Because of the unique microstructure with combination of two layered materials, WS2/RGO hybrids emerge as a promising supercapacitor electrode material with high specific capacitance, energy density, and excellent cycling stability.
