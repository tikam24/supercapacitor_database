This paper proposes a topology of electric vehicle (EV) DC fast charging station (FCS) considering the access and applications of distributed PV (DPV) generation (such as rooftop PV, carport PV and building integrated PV) and hybrid energy storage systems (HESS), all the PV generation systems, hybrid energy storage systems and EV DC chargers are connected to a common DC bus in the way of plug and play. Considering the state of charge of super-capacitor energy storage system and power flow variation rate of DC bus, a fuzzy control based power flow control strategy (namely an optimal power allocation strategy between battery and super-capacitor (SC) according to the variation of PV output power, power dispatch order of AC distribution network and EV fast charging power) is designed to achieve the maximum utilization of DPV and guarantee the safe and stable operation of EV DC fast charging station. Simulation results in Matlab/Simulink verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which can improve the voltage stability of DC bus and control flexibility of power flow.
