In hybrid energy storage systems, supercapacitors are usually connected in series to meet the required voltage levels. Equalizers are effective in prolonging the life of hybrid energy storage systems because they eliminate the voltage imbalance on cells. This study proposes a modularized equalizer, which is based on a combination of a half-bridge inverter, an inductor, and two auxiliary capacitors. The proposed equalizer inherits the advantages of inductor-based equalization systems, but it also offers unique merits, such as low switching losses and an easy-to-use control algorithm. The zero-voltage switching scheme is analyzed, and the power model is established. A fixed-frequency operation strategy is proposed to simplify the control and lower the cost. The switching patterns and conditions for zero-voltage switching are discussed. Simulation results based on PSIM are presented to verify the validity of the proposed equalizer. An equalization test for two supercapacitor cells is performed. An experimental hybrid energy storage system, which consists of batteries and supercapacitors, is established to verify the performance of the proposed equalizer. The analysis, simulation results, and experimental results are in good agreement, thus indicating that the circuit is practical.
