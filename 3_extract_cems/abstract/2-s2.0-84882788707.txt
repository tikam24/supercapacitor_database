A three-dimensional ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanocomposite is prepared via a two-step procedure. Firstly, OMC is synthesized through a co-assembly strategy associated with the incorporation of Ni nanoparticles. Then Ni nanoparticles are used as catalyst for the growth of CNTs. The introduction of CNTs into OMC can construct a 3D conductive network, greatly improving the rate performance of the nanocomposites. The nanocomposite with optimal CNTs content, when applied as supercapacitor electrodes, exhibits a high specific capacitance (338.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), excellent rate capability (130.2 F g-1 at 50 A g-1) and high cycling stability (91.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles) in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Such intriguing electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects between OMC and CNTs. It is reckoned that the present 3D OMC/CNTs nanocomposite can serve as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
