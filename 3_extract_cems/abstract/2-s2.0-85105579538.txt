A family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides known as MXenes has received increasing attention since the discovery of Ti3C2 in 2011. To date, about 30 different MXenes with well-defined structures and properties have been synthesized, and many more are theoretically predicted to exist. Due to the numerous assets including excellent mechanical properties, metallic conductivity, unique in-plane anisotropic structure, tunable band gap, and so on, MXenes rapidly positioned themselves at the forefront of the 2D materials world and have found numerous promising applications. Particular interest is devoted to applications in electrochemical energy storage, whereby 2D MXenes work either as electrodes, additives, separators, or hosts. This review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis, fundamental properties and composites of MXene and highlights the state-of-the-art electrochemical performance of MXene-based electrodes/devices. The progresses in the field of supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries, Li-S batteries, Na- and other alkali metal ion batteries are reviewed, and current challenges and new opportunities for MXenes in this surging energy storage field are presented. In the focus of interest is the possibility to boost device-level performance, particularly that of rechargeable batteries, which are of utmost importance in future energy technologies. Very recently, the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the inventors of the Li-ion battery. For sure, this will provide an additional stimulation to study fundamental aspects of electrochemical energy storage.
