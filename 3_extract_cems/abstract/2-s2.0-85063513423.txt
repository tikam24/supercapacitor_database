Nanocomposite of Zinc doped Iron oxide/Graphene Oxide/Chitosan was prepared using optimized quantity of the components by simple solution mixing-evaporation method. The structure of the composite was studied by UV–Vis, FTIR, XRD, SEM, HRTEM and AFM. The results obtained from these analyses showed the formation of homogeneous mixture with strong interaction between the constituents and evidenced by the shift in peak position in both UV–Vis and FTIR spectra. Band gap calculated was found to be 2.28eV which indicates the conducting nature of the composite. The formation of composite in nano dimensions of around 20 nm was proved by XRD, SEM and HRTEM studies. Thermal stability of the sample was investigated by TG/DTA and DSC techniques and showed improved thermal stability with the increase in glass transition temperature of chitosan by 78°c. Electrochemical characteristics of the composite was studied by cyclic voltammetry and capacitative behavior was studied by impedance studies (EIS). These electrochemical investigations revealed good adherent nature of the composite on electrode surface at pH1 and greater electrochemical stability with well defined redox peaks. EIS showed that the nanocomposite modified electrode exhibited good capacitance behavior with the bode phase angle of 87° which proves it to be a very good candidate for supercapacitor applications.
