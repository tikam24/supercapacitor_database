The present investigation delves into the ionic transport studies in Na+ ion-based composite solid polymer electrolytes (CSPEs) reinforced with nano crystallites of Na3Zr2Si2P3O12 (NZSP) and reveals their possible application as solid-state electrolyte, particularly in supercapacitors. These membranes have been prepared by solution casting. Highest conductivity of ∼ 10-4 Ω-1cm−1 is achieved for a typical composition 10NaCF3SO3-90(0.40PEO-0.60NZSP) at 40 °C. For the samples with large NZSP content (≥54 wt%), polymer (PEO) melting is hardly seen to be affecting the conductivity behaviour. The content of NZSP also improves electrochemical stability window. Further, the ‘liquid-free’ all-solid-state supercapacitors have been prepared by hot roll lamination using the hybrid CSPEs as electrolyte and activated charcoal electrodes (surface area ∼ 1000m2g−1). The NZSP content in the polymer matrix influences supercapacitor performance. The supercapacitors are stable with CV and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling, and exhibit a specific capacitance of ∼ 150 Fg−1 at a current density of ∼ 2Ag−1 and 1 V operating voltage.
