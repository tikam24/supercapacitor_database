There has been an increased interest in developing efficient and low-cost electrodes for supercapacitor applications using simplified synthesis procedures. Herein, a simple, easy, in situ synthesis of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanosheets supported with sodium titanate nanotubes (Na2Ti3O7 NTs) and their application as electrodes for a supercapacitor has been reported. The electrochemical properties of Na2Ti3O7 NTs and MoO3/Na2Ti3O7 nanocomposite were studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MoO3/Na2Ti3O7 NTs demonstrated a specific capacitance of 104.22 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, with remarkable capacitance retention. The MoO3/Na2Ti3O7 NT nanocomposite provided significantly improved electrochemical performance compared to that of pure Na2Ti3O7 NTs. These results have shown that incorporating MoO3 nanosheets into Na2Ti3O7 NTs led to improved capacitance.
