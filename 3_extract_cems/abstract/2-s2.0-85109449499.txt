The demand for hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) is growing nowadays for serving different types of loads. PV and Wind energy resources are complementary. HRES using PV and wind energy sources may increase system reliability for serving a load throughout a year. This paper analyses the cost, feasibility, and reliability of two types of HRES using HOMER software for Haldia, namely, PV/Wind/Battery and PV/Wind/Supercapacitor. These systems are cost-optimized using the net present cost (NPC) of the system and cost of the energy (COE) of the system. The solar radiation, wind speed, the temperature of the site, hourly load, and unit cost of the components of the HRES are given input to the HOMER software. The feasibility of the system is studied for the lowest cost of energy (COE) with different ratios of electricity production from PV and wind energy systems. The reliability of the system is measured in terms of the percentage of the unmet load. It is found that 80:20 and 73:27 share of PV and wind energy production is optimum for PV/Wind/Battery and PV/Wind/ Supercapacitor system respectively for the climatic conditions of Haldia, India. The technical parameter sensitivity and cost sensitivity analysis and the energy management of the system are also reported in this paper. The study revealed that the HRES using supercapacitor can deliver peak load, during the day and night, as compared to a battery. It also depicts that supercapacitor can charge very fast with low values of available solar or wind energy than that of the battery.
