This chapter gives an overview of the surface and electrochemical investigations of the properties of various types of graphene-based materials in the development of new supercapacitors. Owing to a unique combination of features such as superb electrical conductivity, corrosion resistance in aqueous electrolytes, highly modifiable nanostructures, long cycle life, and large theoretical specific surface area, the use of graphene as a supercapacitor electrode material has become the focus of a significant amount of scientific research in the field of energy storage devices. A fast electron transfer rate during faradaic charge transfer reactions can be gained by utilizing graphene, like the other conducting carbon-based materials, leading to an enhancement in the capacitance. Furthermore, graphene can play a focal role as substrate for the other materials in supercapacitor applications. Graphene not only can be utilized to provide a substrate for growing nanostructured polymers in a polymer/carbon nanocomposite structure, to overcome the insulating nature of conductive polymers at dedoped states, but also can provide a platform for the decoration of metal oxide nanoparticles to avoid their agglomeration. In this regard, synthesis, characterization, and performance of the different types of graphene-based electrodes, such as graphene–nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, modified graphene supercapacitors, graphene-conductive polymer composite-based pseudo-capacitors, and graphene–metal oxide/hydroxide composite-based pseudo-capacitors are discussed in detail. The remarkable results demonstrate the exciting commercial potential for high-performance, environmentally friendly, and low-cost electrical energy storage devices based on graphene material.
