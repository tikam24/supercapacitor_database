Fabrication and characterization of high energy density supercapacitor based on graphite oxide/polypyrrole (GO/PPy) composites is reported. Improvement in charge storage has been obtained by exfoliation of graphite oxide sheets via intercalation of polypyrrole. The formation of composite has been shown by the analysis of X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transfer of infrared spectroscopy data. Scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy clearly show sheet-like layered structure of graphite oxide surrounded by polypyrrole. Supercapacitors fabricated using this composite system result in a reduced equivalent series resistance value ~1.85 Ω. Such low value can be attributed to the intercalation of conducting polypyrrole into the graphite sheets. A specific capacitance of ~181 F g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte with a corresponding specific energy density of ~56.5 Wh kg -1 could be achieved. These values make GO-based materials suitable for their use as electrodes in high performance supercapacitors. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
