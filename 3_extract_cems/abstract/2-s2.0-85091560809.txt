Supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage element between traditional capacitor and battery. Particulate leaching method, which was used to increase specific surface area, was the main idea of this article. First of all, GR-PPy material was prepared by chemical in situ polymerization (FeCl3-MO self-degradation template was used to polymerize pyrrole monomer on GR layer). Subsequently, acetylene black and polytetrafluoroethylene emulsion were added and carbon paste electrode was obtained. At the same time, the porous electrode was prepared by particulate leaching method. Cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge and discharge test and AC impedance test were conducted in 1molâ€¢ L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte. The results showed that the specific capacity of the porous electrode was increased by 12% compared with the normal electrode, and the ion diffusion rate was faster than the blank group. In addition, this porous treatment had little effect on the stability of circulation and the electrode resistance. Therefore, it could be concluded that the porous electrode is a promising electrode of supercapacitor.
