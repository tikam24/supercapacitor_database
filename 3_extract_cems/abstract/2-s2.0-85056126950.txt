Enriched with oxygen vacancies, Mo-doped strontium cobaltite (SrCo0.9Mo0.1O3−δ, SCM) is synthesized as an oxygen anion-intercalated charge-storage material through the sol–gel method. The supplemented oxygen vacancies, good electrical conductivity, and high ion diffusion coefficient bestow the SCM electrode with excellent specific capacitance (1223.34 F g−1) and specific capacity (168.88 mAh g−1) at 1 A g−1. The decisive constant (b-value) deduced for the charge storage mechanism (low scan-rate region) is nearly 0.8, indicating a highly capacitive process. In the high scan-rate region, however, the b-value is almost 0.5, and a linear pattern of charge (q) versus the inverse of the square root of the scan rate (v−1/2) is obtained. The results reveal O2− diffusion as the rate-limiting factor for charge storage. Furthermore, a hybrid cell (SCM∥LRGONR) is fabricated by using lacey, reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (LRGONR) as the negative electrode, which exhibits a high energy density (74.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 734.5 W kg−1). With a charging time of only 20.7 s, the cell sustains a very high energy density (33 Wh kg−1) with a high power delivery rate (6600 W kg−1). The excellent cycling stability (165.1 % activated specific capacitance retention and 97.6 % of the maximum value attained) after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles, demonstrates SCM is a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
