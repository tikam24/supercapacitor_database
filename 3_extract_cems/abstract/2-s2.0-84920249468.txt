A binder-free activated carbon paper (ACP) was simply prepared for electric double-layer capacitors by the carbonization of filter paper, followed by heat-air activation at a lower temperature. The electrochemical cells assembled using the as-prepared ACP-470 provides a high specific capacitance of 296.4 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and a high rate performance at a current density of 150 A g−1 with a capacitance of 191.2 F g−1 and a high cycle ability at 10,000 recycles with 100 % capacitance retention. In addition, the ACP has a lower electrical resistivity and provides an effective energy storage performance with a maximum energy density of 41.2 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 138.0 kW kg−1 in a voltage range of 1 V.
