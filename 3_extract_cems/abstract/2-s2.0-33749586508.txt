A novel method for preparing nano-supercapacitor arrays, in which each nano-supercapacitor consisted of electropolymerized Polypyrrole (PPy) electrode / porous TiO2 separator / chemical polymerized PPy electrode, was developed in this paper. The nano-supercapacitors were fabricated in the nano array pores of anodic aluminum oxide template using the bottom-up, layer-by-layer synthetic method. The nano-supercapacitor diameter was 80nm, and length 500nm. Based on the charge/discharge behavior of nano-supercapacitor arrays, it was found that the PPy/TiO2/PPy array supercapacitor devices performed typical electrochemical supercapacitor behavior. The method introduced here may find application in manufacturing nano-sized electrochemical power storage devices in the future for their use in the area of microelectronic devices and microelectromechanical systems.
