Composite electrode material composed of MnO2 nanowires and wood-derived activated carbon hollow fibres (Mn@ACHFs) was successfully fabricated by in situ hydrothermal method. In this work, MnO2 nanowires were developed by adjusting the mass ratio of potassium permanganate and wood activated carbon hollow fibres (ACHF). The ACHF with hierarchical porous structure served not only as the support for the growth of MnO2 particles, but also as the electric double layer capacitance for the composite electrode. The Mn@ACHFs exhibited an outstanding specific capacitance of 420 F.g-1 at 1 A.g-1 and cycle stability with 99.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A.g-1. Electrochemical characteristics of the prepared composites are attributed to the synergetic effect of the double layer capacitance of the hierarchical porous ACHF and the layered structure of MnO2, which can efficiently enhance the conductivity and stability of the electrodes.
