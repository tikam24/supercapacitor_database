Biomass-derived porous carbon is an excellent scientific and technologically interesting material for supercapacitor applications. In this study, we developed biomass-derived nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (BDPCNS) from cedar cone biomass using a simple KOH activation and pyrolysis method. The BDPCNS was effectively modified at different temperatures of 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 ℃ under similar conditions. The as-prepared BDPCNS-700 electrode exhibited a high BET surface area of 2883 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 1.26 cm3 g−1. Additionally, BDPCNS-700 had the highest electrical conductivity (11.03 cm−1) and highest N-doped content among the different electrode materials. The BDPCNS-700 electrode attained a specific capacitance of 290 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in a 3 M KOH electrolyte and an excellent long-term electrochemical cycling stability of 93.4% over 1000 cycles. Moreover, the BDPCNS-700 electrode had an excellent energy density (40.27 Wh kg−1) vs power density (208.19 W kg−1). These findings indicate that BDPCNS with large surface areas are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors and energy storage systems.
