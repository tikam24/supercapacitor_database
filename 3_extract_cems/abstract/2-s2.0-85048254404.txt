Herein, Mn3O4/reduced graphene oxide composites are prepared via a facile solution-phase method for supercapacitor application. Transmission electron microscopy results reveal the uniform distribution of Mn3O4 nanoparticles on graphene layers. The morphology of the Mn3O4 nanomaterial is changed by introducing the reduced graphene oxide during the preparation process. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell based on the Mn3O4/reduced graphene oxide composite with the weight ratio of 1:1 exhibits relatively superior charge storage properties with higher specific capacitance and larger energy density compared with those of pure reduced graphene oxide or Mn3O4. More importantly, the long-term stability of the composite with more than 90.3% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles can ensure that the product is widely applied in energy storage devices.
