A family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, the so-called MXenes, has been discovered and investigated for advanced energy devices with outstanding performances. The outstanding physical and chemical properties of MXenes with 2D layered structures, high mechanical strength, metallic electrical conductivity, sufficient surface functional groups, hydrophilic nature, high negative zeta-potential, high surface area, large potential charge capability, and ability to accommodate intercalants are attractive for engineering applications to energy devices, particularly in wearable supercapacitors and triboelectric nanogenerators. This research update provides an overview of practical challenges and recent advances of synthetic routes and a perspective on applications to wearable energy storage and energy harvesting devices.
