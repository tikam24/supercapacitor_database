Using a three-dimensional graphene (3DG) prepared by a sol-gel method as skeleton material, and adding commercial carbon black as conductive additive, a novel composite electrode material (3DG/CB/MnO2) is synthesized by hydrothermal method. The 3DG and 3DG/CB/MnO2 composite are characterized by SEM and XRD. The SEM results indicate that the thickness of graphene sheets is homogeneous, and the MnO2 nanoparticles are successfully deposited on the surface of the 3DG and carbon black to form a honeycomb structure, in which numerous pores are constructed by the graphene sheets and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The XRD result shows that the state of the MnO2 in the 3DG/CB/MnO2 composite is Î´-MnO2. The electrochemical test results display that the specific capacitances are 590, 433 and 247 F/g respectively at the current densities of 0.3, 1 and 3 A/g. Whereas, the specific capacitances of the MnO2 nanoparticles at 0.3 A/g is only 433 F/g. After the 3DG/CB/MnO2 composite is charge-discharge for 5000 cycles at the big current densities of 30 A/g, its specific capacitance decreases to 38 F/g from 55 F/g. The capacitance retention of the 3DG/CB/MnO2 composite reaches to 70%, implying this composite is a supercapacitor electrode material which has the prospect of industrialization.
