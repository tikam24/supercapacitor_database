MnO 2 nanorods for supercapacitors were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis method. The samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), N 2 adsorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge were used to characterize the electro-chemical performance of the samples. The results showed that the prepared samples were Î±-MnO 2 with a BET specific surface area of 105.2 m 2/g. The particles were in a rod shape with a diameter of 50 to 70nm. In an electrolyte of1mol/L (NH 4) 2SO 4, electrode based on the MnO 2 showed perfect pseudo capacitive and power characterization in the potential region of -0.5~0.4V(vs. SCE). Ata current density of 10mA/cm 2, a specific capacitance of 413F/g was achieved.
