Today, two-dimensional materials for use in energy devices have attracted the attention of researchers. Molybdenum disulfide is promising as an electrode material with unique physical properties and a high exposed surface area. However, there are still problems that need to be addressed. In this study, we prepared a hybrid containing MoS2, Fe3O4, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by a two-step hydrothermal method. This nanocomposite is well structurally and morphologically identified, and its electrochemical performance is then evaluated for use in supercapacitors. According to the galvanostatic charge-discharge results, this nanocomposite shows a good specific capacity, equivalent to 527 F g-1 at 0.5 mA cm-2. The results of the multi-cycle stability test (5000 cycles) indicate a significant stability rate capability, with 93% of the electrode capacity remaining after 5000 cycles. The reason for this could be the synergistic effect between rGO and MoS2 as well as between molybdenum and iron in the faradic reaction in the charge storage process. Fe3O4 and MoS2 provide electroactive sites for the faradic process and electrolyte accessibility and rGO supply conductivity.
