This work presents the possibility of considering MoO2 nanorods synthesized by the carbothermal reduction of MoO3 as an intercalation- or insertion-type anode for lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) assembly. The mechanism for Li intercalation into MoO2 carbon composite (MoO2-C) is studied in a half-cell assembly within the potential window of 0.8-3 V vs Li+/Li. The material can deliver an initial discharge capacity of about 225-250 mAh g-1 with excellent cyclic stability over 500 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 100 mA g-1. Furthermore, the performance of MoO2-C as a battery-type (intercalation) anode in LIC assembly is studied by pairing it with a commercial activated carbon (AC) cathode. The role of prelithiation and operating-voltage window on the electrochemical performance of AC//MoO2-C LIC is analyzed. Such a LIC assembly without prelithiation, when tested within the voltage window of 1.7-3.2 V, can provide an energy density of about 75.27 Wh kg-1 and maintain about 70% of its initial capacity after 4500 cycles. Moreover, such a LIC prototype's low- and high-temperature performance is also evaluated. This study clearly shows the possibility of considering MoO2-based LIC systems as a strong competitor for Li4Ti5O12-based LIC assembly, providing much safer features than graphite-based LIC configurations.
