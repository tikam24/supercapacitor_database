Polypyrrole (PPy) films were prepared by direct current (DC), pulse current (PC) and pulse potential (PP) in aqueous solutions. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of PPy films indicated that a lot of horn-shaped PPy was formed during PP-PPy polymerization process. The top-end of horn-shaped PPy exhibits both open and closed structures. The body of horn-shaped PPy has a hollow structure with a thin wall. The micelles composed by PPy monomer and p-toluenesulfonate anions (PTS-) was formed when pyrrole monomer was dispersed in aqueous solution containing PTS- anions by mechanical stirring. In PP polymerization, the micelles with negative charge were repelled and hence left the surface of PPy films at switch off time. As a result, the PTS- anions on the surface of micelles were effectively supplied, and thus stabilized the micelles. This process results in the continuous growth of horn-shaped PPy. The hollow horn-shaped PPy films showed big specific capacitance, high charging/discharging rate and better stability. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
