A hydrophilic polypyrrole/tellurium (PPy/Te) nanocomposite was synthesized by a facile approach in which H2TeO3 was used as the oxidizing agent of pyrrole and then the elemental Te formed in situ catalyzed the polymerization of pyrrole. The morphology and structure of the products were characterized by a series of testing technology. The electrochemical property and impedance of the PPy/Te nanocomposite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. Significantly, the charge-discharge measurement results show that the PPy/Te nanocomposite has high specific capacitance (2488 F/g, at 2 A/g) and good cyclability.
