The sol-gel methodology was exploited for the production of Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles, at different sintering temperatures (750, 950, and 1150 °C). The nanometer size crystallites were evaluated utilizing the Debye Scherrer formulae in the X-ray diffraction (XRD) study. The two bands manifested in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra near 600 cm−1 (tetrahedral site) and 400 cm−1 (octahedral site) ratify the formation of spinel structure for all sintering temperatures. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs estimate the average size of the particle by using ImageJ software and reveal the agglomerated grains, which are inhomogeneous in shape and size. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) study confirms the stoichiometry and composition of the synthesized specimens. For an enhancement in the sintering temperature, the enhancement in the saturation magnetization was perceived in the magnetic studies by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). With regard to all incorporated samples, the squareness ratio was assessed to be under 0.5 which assimilates to a multi-domain structure. For all scan rates and current densities, the prepared Mn0.3Co0.2Zn0.5Fe2O4 (1150 °C) had the higher value of the specific capacitance as portrayed through the electrochemical study.
