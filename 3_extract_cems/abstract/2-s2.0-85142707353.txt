In this research we developed two triphenylamine (TPA)-linked conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs), TPA-TAB and TPA-TBN, through Suzuki couplings of tris(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)amine (TPA-BO) with the aryl bromides tetrakis(4-bromophenyl)benzidine (TAB-Br4) and 2,7,10,15-tetrabromotetrabenzonaphthalene (TBN-Br4), respectively. These CMPs, which have substantial surface surfaces and outstanding thermal stability, could be employed as electrode materials in supercapacitor (SC) devices. In a three-electrode SC, the TPA-TAB CMP exhibited ultrahigh specific capacitance (684 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and long-term stability, with a capacitance retention of 99.5% after 5000 cycles (at 10 A g−1). Moreover, a two-electrode symmetric SC incorporating TPA-TAB CMP presented a capacitance of 117 F g−1 and a high retention of 98% when subjected to 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. This exceptional performance resulted from was achieved through the use of redox-active TPA units and a large BET surface area (490 m2 g−1). Accordingly, such TPA-CMPs appear to have promise for use in charge and energy storage applications.
