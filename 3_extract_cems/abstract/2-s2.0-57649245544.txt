Polyaniline nanoparticles with sizes of 20-40 nm were prepared by the pulsed sonoelectrochemical method. These nanoparticles are characterized by IR, UV-vis, HRSEM and TEM analysis. IR and UV-vis confirm the formation of polyaniline nanostructures. The capacitance of these materials was studied by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M H2SO4. The PANI nanoparticles prepared at 1 V show a higher capacitance value than PANI prepared at 0.9 V and polyaniline prepared by pulsed electrochemical deposition. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.
