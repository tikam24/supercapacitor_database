The power management system for the integrated system of the photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid power source and the wireless sensor node was manufactured. The low power operation strategy, intelligentized control method and super-low lifting voltage technology were adopted in the power management, so the solar energy was utilized adequately. The charge curves of the supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery were obtained, and the efficiency of the power management was researched. The performance test of the power management system demonstrates that the lithium-ion battery could be charged within four days, and it could make the wireless sensor networks node work seven days continuously.
