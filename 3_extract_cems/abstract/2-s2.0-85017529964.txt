Porous carbon can be widely applied in energy ranging from lithium-ion batteries to supercapacitors. We here propose a novel hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (HPGC) monolith to replace conventional activated carbon for achieving excellent electrochemical performance. In this monolith structure made from the cross-linking of lignosulfonate without any templating agent, the nanoscale core is composed of porous amorphous carbon, while the microscale shell is formed by graphitic carbon and generated within mesoporous wall of HPGC. As evidenced by cyclic voltammetry, the abundant porosity and the high surface area not only offer sufficient reaction sites to store electrical charge physically, but also accelerate the liquid electrolyte to penetrate the electrode and the ions to reach the reacting sites. Of special interest is the fact that HPGC monolith maintains mesoporous without extrinsic template agent.
