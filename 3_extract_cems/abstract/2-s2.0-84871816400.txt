Ni0.76Co0.24Ox xerogels were formed by the sol-gel method followed by heat-treatment in air. The structure and properties of these materials were characterized by using X-ray diffraction, TEM and N2 (77K) adsorption. Electrodes with the xerogels were activated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and their capacitive performance was evaluated by galvanostatic technique in 7 mol/L KOH solutions. A maximum specific capacitance of 904 F/g was obtained by constant current discharge with a current density of 2.0 mA/cm2 for the Ni0.76Co0.24Ox xerogels heat-treated at 250°C. High performance obtained indicates that these materials are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. © (2013) Trans Tech Pulications, Switzerland.
