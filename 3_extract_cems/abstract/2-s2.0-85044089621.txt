We demonstrated a protocol of incorporating the graphene oxide sheets on the surface of Zinc-Glutamate metal-organic framework (MOF) microcrystalline by electrostatic attraction and carbonizing this composite to synthesis the nanoporous carbon. The etching of facets in Zinc-Glutamate MOF microcrystalline by the graphene oxide sheets was observed and the possible mechanism of this etching had been elucidated. Excitingly, the Supercapacitor electrodes from this hierarchically porous carbon exhibit fast frequency response and ultrahigh charge/discharge rate up to 2 V/s, high specific gravimetric and volumetric capacitances of 318 F/g and 299 F/cm3 at the scan rate of 20 mV/s, outstanding cycling stability of 90% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at the currency of 5 A/g in aqueous alkaline electrolytes.
