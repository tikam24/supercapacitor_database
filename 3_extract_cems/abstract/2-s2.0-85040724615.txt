Using electric double layers or rapidly reversible Faraday's reactions with special ion on or near the surface, supercapacitor (SC) is a new energy storage device of high power/energy density and long cycle life in recent years. The study of nickel-cobalt sulfide electrode material has been gotten more attentions, because of their higher electrical conductivity than single sulfides or oxides, and excellent electrochemical performance resulted by synergy effects of two metal ions. According to the related literatures reported in recent years, working principles, preparation methods, electrochemical performance and merits/demerits of nickel-cobalt sulfide are reviewed, and researches of its storage mechanism and structure design are prospected.
