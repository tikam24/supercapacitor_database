This study investigates an energy management strategy based on fuzzy logic for a new topology of battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The new topology uses a bi-directional dc-dc converter with a lower power rating than those used in the traditional HESS topology. The new HESS topology has three operating modes. The control system includes four fuzzy control strategies for regulating the distribution of power between the battery bank and UC bank, and chooses the appropriate operating mode of the new HESS. The results of the simulations provide strong evidence for the feasibility of the proposed control strategy.
