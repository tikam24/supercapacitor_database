Simulations of models containing a supercapacitor based energy storage system (ESS) are slow due to a small simulation step required by a switching-mode character of the ESS power converter. In the article, a SIMULINK model built on the analytic equations of the ESS power stage is proposed and verified by applying it in a model of a tram equipped with an onboard ESS. Performance of the proposed analytic model is compared with the switching and average ones. The model provides approximately 75-fold decrease in the simulation time in comparison to the switching model. Â© 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.
