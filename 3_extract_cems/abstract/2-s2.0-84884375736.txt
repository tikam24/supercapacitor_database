We fabricated activated carbon (AC)- based supercapacitors encased in flexible packaging using a novel organic electrolyte, triethylmethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile+propylene carbonate (MeEt3NBF4/(AN+PC)), and two conventional organic electrolytes, tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile (Et4NBF4/AN) and tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate/propylene carbonate (Et4NBF4/PC). Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements in various voltage windows were conducted. In addition, a comprehensive comparison of these three electrolytes was conducted via data obtained from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge- discharge, leakage current, self-discharge, cyclic life, and coulombic efficiency within the 0-3 V voltage window. The results indicate that MeEt3NBF4/(AN+PC) combining the advantages of AN and PC exhibits excellent performance. Â© Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
