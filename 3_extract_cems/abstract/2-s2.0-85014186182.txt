The deregulation of the electric market and the increasing number of renewable energy sources connected to the public grid are gradually attracting more attention to the concept of AC microgrids. These power networks are active electricity distribution systems with the capacity to operate as controlled electrical islands [1]. These systems integrate distributed energy sources (including photovoltaic, wind power, mini hydro, gas turbine, etc.) and energy storage devices (such as batteries, ultra-capacitors, flywheels) into the main power system. AC microgrids can meet electrical requirements locally, supply uninterruptible power, improve power quality, reduce power losses and provide voltage support [2]. Furthermore, these systems can reduce environmental pollution and global warming by using lowcarbon technology.
