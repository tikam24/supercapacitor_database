The TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared on Ti plate by anodizing technology, and then Co(OH)2 nanoparticles in-situ grew into TiO2 nanotubes with "Tube-particle bonding" nano composited structure. Co(OH)2 nanoparticles with a particle size of 40.5Â±8 nm were infiltrated in the TiO2 nanotube arrays, and the Co(OH)2 outside the tube presented a nanosheet structure. The specific capacitance of the Co(OH)2/TiO2 nanotube array composite reached 260 F/g at the current density ~1 A/g. The capacity retention rate was 82.5 % after 2000 cycles at the current density~5 A/g. The high-rate performance of the Co(OH)2/TiO2 nanotube array composite reached 210 F/g at the current density~10 A/g.
