A series of polyindole/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites (PINCs) were synthesized through cetyltrimethylammonium bromide assisted dilute solution polymerization method, in presence of different concentrations of GO (%,w/w) ranging from 5.0 to 20.0 and ferric chloride as an oxidant. The interactions between polyindole and GO have been investigated through Fourer transformed infrared, X-ray diffraction spectra, and scanning electron microscopy. Sulphonated polysulphone binded electrodes were fabricated on 316 stainless steel substrate and the supercapacitance (Cs, F/g) of PINCs has been evaluated with reference to Ag/AgCl through cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate (V/s) ranging from 0.15 to 0.001 in KOH (1.0 M). With the concentration of GO, a regular increase in the thermal stability of PINCs and Cs of their cathodes has been observed irrespective to scan rates. PINCs with 20%,w/w GO have shown highest Cs (F/g) of 399.97 as compared with 21.89 for pure polyindole at a scan rate of 0.001 V/s with a capacitive decrease of nearly 1% during the first 50 cycles at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s, indicating the excellent cyclic stability of the composite for supercapacitor applications.
