Nickel-based hydroxide/bamboo fiber-derived carbon (BFC) composite (BFCNi), with an open and interconnected pore structure inherited from BFC, is constructed for the first time by redxo etching reaction based on MnO2 templates. Benefiting from the outstanding porous structure of BFC and high theoretical capacity of nickel-based hydroxide, BFCNi exhibits excellent advantages for electrochemical energy storage. Typically, in the three-electrode system, BFCNi delivers high specific capacitance of 1310 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior rate capability (841 F g−1 at 15 A g−1). The energy storage mechanism of BFCNi is deeply studied, which reveals that the energy storage process of BFCNi combines surface control behavior and diffusion control behavior. Additionally, a coin-type asymmetric supercapacitor on the basic of BFCNi and BFC is assembled (BFCNi//BFC), which achieves an extraordinary energy density of 74.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 799.8 W kg−1, good cycle stability (87.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) and satisfactory rate capability, indicating a great promise of BFCNi in electrochemical energy storage.
