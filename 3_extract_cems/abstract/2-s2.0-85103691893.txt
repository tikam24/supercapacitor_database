The porosity and electrochemical properties of electrodes play an important role in improving the specific energy of supercapacitors. In this work, a novel macrocycle molecule cucurbit[8]uril (CB8) with cavity diameter of ~ 0.88 nm is synthesized to fabricate the porous carbon electrodes. By monomer synthesis, macromolecule cyclization, octa-cycle purification, and carbonization at 800 °C, the prepared cucurbit[8]uril-carbon (CB8C-800) material has ideal pore size distribution centered at 0.88 nm and high specific surface area of 781.51 m2·g−1. Symmetric supercapacitor device is assembled by using the CB8C-800 electrode and 1-propyl-3-methylimidazole tetrafluoroborate (PMIMBF4) ionic liquid electrolyte with ion diameter of 0.87 nm and wide potential window of 3.8 V. The optimized device achieves a high specific energy of 66.04 Wh·kg−1, along with a satisfactory cycling stability (90.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 consecutive cycle). The results demonstrate an effective porous carbon material derived from cucurbituril for high specific energy supercapacitors.
