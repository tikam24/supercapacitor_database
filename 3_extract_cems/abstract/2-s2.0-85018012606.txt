A new circuit realisation scheme for the simulation of floating lossless immittance function (FLIF) using differential voltage current conveyor transimmittance amplifier is proposed; intuitive choice of the device transadmittance (Ym) would yield either a floating inductor (if Ym ≈ gm) or a floating FDNR-type supercapacitor (if Ym ≈ sCm) in the same topology. Analysis indicates that device nonidealities have insignificant effects on the nominal design. Experimental results for some selective filter (5 ≤ Q ≤ 10) design using the FLIFs are presented.
