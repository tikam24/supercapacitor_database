A novel topology of a hybrid energy storage is proposed for a standalone Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system consisting of a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG), dump load and mains loads. In this regard, the behaviour of a hybrid energy storage unit consisting of battery storage and a supercapacitor is examined. The battery storage is designed to meet the energy requirement of the system while the supercapacitor is used to respond to rapid power fluctuations of the RAPS system. The battery storage is connected to the AC side of the system through an inverter while the supercapacitor is connected to the DC link of the back-to-back converter system of the DFIG via a two stage bi-directional buck boost converter. A control strategy is adopted for the hybrid energy storage system in which the operation of the battery is limited to a lower Depth of Discharge (DOD). The dump load is used to absorb excess energy in the system which cannot be utilised by the energy storage system. The entire RAPS system has been modelled using MATLAB Simulink. Â© 2010 IEEE.
