Energy storage devices are contributing to reducing CO2 emissions on the earth's crust. Lithium-ion batteries are the most commonly used rechargeable batteries in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and E-vehicles. Li-ion batteries have limitations like less power density, high cost, non-environment friendly, flammable electrolytes, poor cycle performance, etc. Supercapacitors have high power density, and long cycle life but lesser energy density and high self-discharge rate. High-performance, smart, next-generation rechargeable batteries like Zn ion, Li-air, Li-S, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid capacitors can be a good alternative to traditional Lithium-cobalt batteries. In this review article, we focussed on different energy storage devices like Lithium-ion, Lithium-air, Lithium-Zn-air, Lithium-Sulphur, Sodium-ion rechargeable batteries, and super and hybrid capacitors. Emphases are made on the progress made on the fabrication, electrode material, electrolyte, and economic aspects of different electrochemical energy storage devices. Different challenges faced in the fabrication of different energy storage devices and their future perspective were also discussed.
