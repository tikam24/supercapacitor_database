Different micro morphology zinc sulfide on three-dimensional porous and space network structure of nickel foam (ZnS/NF) electrode materials were designed by changing a scanning rate during cyclic voltammetry electrochemical deposition process. The structure and energy storage state of the prepared ZnS/NF electrode material were fully studied by a variety of means and characterized by using corresponding instruments in detail. The electrode materials with different microstructures have different energy storage quantity. The maximum mass specific capacity of ZnS/NF electrode prepared was 1827.5 F g−1 when the current density was set to 15 A g−1. The maximum area specific capacity of ZnS/NF electrode prepared was 354.5 mF cm−2 when the current density was set to 3 mA cm−2. The stability of the ZnS/NF with maximum mass capacity was studied and gained capacity retention of 68.42% after 3000 cycles. Studies showed that the prepared electrode material is suitable as a positive material for asymmetric supercapacitors.
