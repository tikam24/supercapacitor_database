Ni1.5Co1.5S4 is a new electrode material with high specific capacitance, which has high tantalum capacitive performance, but poor cycle performance, while bagasse has been used to develop three-dimensional porous structure with considerably high specific surface area. In this study, we report a method to prepare biomimetic graded porous carbon by using bagasse as the matrix, in order to develop porous carbon in-situ loaded with Ni1.5Co1.5S4 nanoclusters. The relationship between structure and performance of the nanocomposite was discussed. The biomimetic graded porous carbon based on bagasse provides an efficient channel for ion transport during the electrochemical reactions, while Ni1.5Co1.5S4ensuressufficiently high tantalum capacity. The biomimetic Ni1.5Co1.5S4 porous carbon composite has a capacity of 968 F/g at 1 A/g, with a specific capacity retention rate of 76% after 5,000 cycles at 10 A/g. This biomimetic composite based on natural graded porous structures can be used as new supercapacitor materials.
