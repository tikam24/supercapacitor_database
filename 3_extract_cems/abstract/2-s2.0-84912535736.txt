Electrodeposition of nickel sulfide (Ni-S) on NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4@Ni-S) nanoplate arrays produces a new hierarchical core-shell functional-material. Weak crystalline Ni-S nanosheets have been uniformly coated on the NiCo2O4 nanoplate array obtained by hydrothermal growth. When tested as an electrode for supercapacitors, the NiCo2O4@Ni-S nanoplate arrays have been found to exhibit a significantly improved areal capacitance of 1.85 F cm-2 at a current density of 8 mA cm-2, good rate capability and cycling stability. In addition, the capacitance fading of the NiCo2O4@Ni-S arrays are attributed to the surface coarsening of the Ni-S nanosheets.
