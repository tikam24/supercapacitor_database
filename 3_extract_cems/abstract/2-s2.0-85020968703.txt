In this paper, the flower-like MoS2 microspheres were successfully synthesized by nanosheets through simple hydrothermal method, which used ammonium molybdate as source of molybdenum and thiourea for sulfur source. The microstructure and morphology of the product was systematically investigated by XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM. Simultaneously, the electrochemical performances for supercapacitors of the samples are evaluated by cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the maximum specific capacitance of the MoS2 electrodes reaches up to 225 F/g at a discharge current density of 0.5 A/g, suggesting a good rate capability. MoS2 will be a suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
