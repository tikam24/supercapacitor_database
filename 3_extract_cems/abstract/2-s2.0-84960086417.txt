A free-standing paper-like three-dimensional graphene framework (3DGF) with orientated laminar structure and interconnected macropores, was obtained by the hard template-directed ordered assembly. As the sacrificial templates, polystyrene (PS) latex spheres were assembled with graphene oxide (GO) to build up a sandwich type composite film, followed by heat removal of which with a simultaneous reduction of GO. The 3DGF exhibited high specific surface area of 402.5 m2/g, controllable pores and mechanical flexibility, which was employed as the binder-free supercapacitor electrode and shows high specific gravimetric capacitance of 95 F/g at 0.5 A/g, with enhanced rate capability in 3 electrode KOH system.
