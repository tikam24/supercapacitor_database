According to the difference in solubility between nickel-cobalt sulfide and hydroxide, a supercapacitor electrode material (ACF/NiCo2S4) with activated carbon fiber (ACF) as core and NiCo2S4 as shell was prepared by room temperature vulcanization method, and the feasibility of this method was verified through X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In addition,ACF/NiCo2S4 electrode materials with the shape of "filaments", "urchins", "honeycombs" and flakes were prepared by controlling the reaction conditions, and they were subjected to galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for performance comparison. Research shows that the "honeycomb" material obtain a large specific surface area due to its abundant pore structure, which increases the contact area of the material and the electrolyte, promotes the penetration of the electrolyte, and provides more active sites for charge storage. "Honeycomb" material exhibits a larger specific capacitance, a smaller impedance, and a more stable rate performance. When the current density is 1 A/g, the specific capacitance value of honeycomb material is as high as 1 682 F/g. Furthermore, a cyclic voltammetry test (CV) was performed on the "honeycomb" ACF/NiCo2S4, which exhibited good electrochemical performance and was a promising electrode material for supercapacitors with broad application prospects.
