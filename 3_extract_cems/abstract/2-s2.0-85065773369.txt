This report demonstrates the modification of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets by decorating SnO2 nanorod bundles and nanoparticles on the surface for effective use of the graphene as supercapacitor electrode materials. The shape- and density-controlled SnO2 nanostructures were prepared through hydrothermal synthesis and acted as spacer materials to physically inhibit the overlapping of the RGO sheets; this is known as the restacking effect. When measuring the electrochemical properties, the electrode comprising RGO with SnO2 nanorod bundles (RGO−SnO2−NR) revealed a higher capacitance, rate capability, and cyclic stability than the RGO electrode with SnO2 nanoparticles (RGO−SnO2−NP) and the bare RGO electrode, indicating the effective role of the surface-implanted SnO2 spacer during the electrode reactions of the double-layer capacitor. The electrochemical superiority of RGO−SnO2−NR could be explained by the fact that wedge-like SnO2 nanorod bundles between the RGO sheets promote fast transfer and approach of electroactive species to form the electrochemical double layer at the electrode surface. Moreover, the improved mass transfer behavior of the RGO−SnO2 composite electrodes and the role of the SnO2 nanostructures were reasonably verified by various electrochemical analyses.
