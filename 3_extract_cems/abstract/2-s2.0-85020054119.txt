This piece of work provides a hybrid power plant integrating a wind coupled with Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG), a super-capacitor (SC), a battery and a diesel engine (DE) set which operates without a grid connection. Each subsystem (e.g., wind, SC, battery, DE) has controlled through non-isolated PID/PI embedded controller power converters while the overall operation and power flow priorities are achieved through Programming Logic Controller (PLC). According to the algorithm, the wind has the priority to meet the demand. The SC and battery modules are utilized as an energy storage devices during surplus power and/or backup during demand. A diesel engine is also added to increase the reliability of the system for 24 hours. The performance of proposed design is tested at different wind speed and load conditions for a small community at Karachi, Pakistan. MATLAB results conclude the effectiveness of proposed system in terms of power quality and load tracking.
