As the penetration rate of renewable energy generation increases, the power disturbance it introduces into the grid for its inherent characteristics cannot be ignored. In the case of high proportion access, the demand for renewable energy generation to participate in grid regulation is increasing. This puts higher demands on its power response performance. A hybrid energy storage consisting of battery and super capacitor, because of their complementary energy characteristics, can help improve the overall energy handling capacity of the renewable energy generation system. In order to take full advantage of energy storage media according to their power characteristics, a model predictive overall control method for the hybrid battery-super capacitor hybrid energy storage converter is proposed for application in a photovoltaic power generation system. Given a mathematical model of the bidirectional DC/DC converter, combined with the control objective of the hybrid energy storage, a Model Prediction Overall Control (MPC) strategy with embedded power filter is designed. The simulation results show that the proposed model predictive overall control method has superior power response characteristics and parameter robustness.
