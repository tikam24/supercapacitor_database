To enhance the electrochemical performance of electrode materials for energy storage devices, utilization the synergistic effect of EDLC-capacitance and pseudocapacitance as well as modification nanostructures are general strategies. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of an array core-shell heterostructure graphene nanoscrolls composite, in which petal-like NiCo-LDH nanoflakes are vertically anchored on the 3D interconnected GNSs skeleton, accomplished by a highly facile microwave-assisted method. This design combines several advantages, including providing more active sites for pseudocapacitive reactions, promoting the collection/transport of electrons and ions, and buffering the volume variation of active matters during cycling. Benefiting from the advantageous nanostructure, the as-obtained NiCo-LDH@GNSs electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1470 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a long cycle life with 81.6% retention after 1000 cycles.
