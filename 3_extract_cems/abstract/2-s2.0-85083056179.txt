NiMoO4 nanorods (NRs) were successfully fabricated on Ni foam with robust adhesion via a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal treatment, followed by a calcined process. In a three-electrode configuration with 3 mol L−1 KOH aqueous solution. The NiMoO4 NRs supported on Ni foam as working electrodes achieve a high specific capacity of 1320 C g−1 at a charge and discharge current density of 2 mA cm−2, and a desirable rate capability (884 C g−1 even at 10 mA cm−2) and a superior cycling ability with 88% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2. To enhance the energy density and enlarge the voltage window, the aqueous hybrid supercapacitor has subsequently been constructed by employing the NiMoO4 and activated carbon electrodes as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, which delivered a high energy density of 52 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 725 W kg−1. Impressively, the device indicates a long-term cycling stability with capacitance retention of 123% even after 9000 cycles in aa safe voltage range from 0 V to 1.45 V. These results definitely imply the promising prospect of NiMoO4 NR electrodes for application in supercapacitors.
