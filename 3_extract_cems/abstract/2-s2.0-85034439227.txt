MnCO3 is gaining attention of the scientific community as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications. It can be easily synthesized by simple, cost effective method using manganese and carbonate precursors. In this article, we report the effect of carbonate precursors on the capacitive storage performance of MnCO3. Carbonate precursors used for the synthesis of MnCO3 were (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3. The effect of carbonate precursors on the physico-chemical properties of MnCO3 was studied using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), infra-red spectroscopy (IR), surface area analysis, scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. PXRD and IR spectral studies revealed that carbonate precursors do not affect the crystal structure. However, they influence significantly the morphology, surface area and porosity of MnCO3 as revealed by morphological and sorption studies. The capacitance properties of MnCO3 were evaluated in an aqueous 0.1 M Mg(ClO4)2 electrolyte. Specific capacitance value of 103, 116, 120, 121, 123 and 141 F g-1 was obtained for MnCO3 synthesized using (NH4)HCO3, (NH4)2CO3, K2CO3, Li2CO3, NaHCO3 and Na2CO3 as carbonate precursor, respectively. Difference in the specific capacitance is attributed to difference in the morphology and other surface properties.
