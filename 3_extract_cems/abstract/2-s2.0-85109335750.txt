Nickel hydroxide nanosheet is a common valuable electrode material, which has the advantages of environmental friendliness, low price, and abundant resources. However, its poor conductivity base and circulatory stability limited its use in supercapacitors. Therefore, we report a system of electrochemical polymerization to prepare a porous polymer nanoskin–coated nanomaterial Ni(OH)2/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) electrode. The PEDOT nanoskin has the advantages of controllable thickness and good electrical conductivity, and it is porous and continuous. In addition, each unit of the special structure can be uniformly coated by nanoskin and prevents the internal nanostructure from collapsing of the structure as electrolyte ions move in and out, and the conductivity and porosity of the composite electrode can be improved. Furthermore, the NF/Ni(OH)2/PEDOT presents outstanding electrochemical activity and high storage capacitance for supercapacitor. The NF/Ni(OH)2/PEDOT exhibits good specific capacitance of 1389 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and has excellent energy density of 46.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 399.7 W kg−1. Graphical abstract: In this paper, the porous PEDOT nanoskin structure provides a large number of channels for carrier transport and improves the carrier transport rate and increases the active sites for ion adsorption/reaction.
