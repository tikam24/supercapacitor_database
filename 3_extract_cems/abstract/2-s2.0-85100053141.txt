VHDL language imposes some limitations, compared with the flexibility and expressiveness of other fuzzy logic oriented languages. In order to achieve behavioural modelling, a VHDL description style can be used where the system structure description (fuzzy sets, rule base etc.) and the operator description (connectives and fuzzy operations) are defined separately. It allows describing both the fuzzy system structure and the processing algorithm independently. The description format allows the use of linguistic hedges in order to compact the rules defining the system's behaviour. The paper analyses the potential advantages for the use of bespoke high-level descriptions and the feasibility of the translation into a VHDL code with a GUI interface of a controller described by a fuzzy logic oriented language. This study is encased in a particular application: Lithium-Ion Hybrid Super Capacitors management. The Lithium-Ion Hybrid Super Capacitor is a novel technology breaking new ground in the technology sector. The Lithium-Ion Hybrid Super Capacitor (LIHC) is fast evolving as the missing link between the Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) and the Lithium-Ion Battery (LIB), is a distinct hybrid of the two technologies. To be effective, it requires a management controller, which the paper targets to produce in a VHDL hardware description language.
