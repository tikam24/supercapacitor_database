Novel intelligent materials with multiple functions that can be used in a diverse range of practical material applications are still in urgent demand. Herein, we have developed novel multifunctional and intelligent materials with excellent electrofluorescence (EFC), electrochromic (EC) and electrochemical properties that are suitable for the preparation of flexible supercapacitors. The novel intelligent polymer P1 has a high quantum efficiency of 10.75% in the solid-state and the colouring and bleaching times of P1 are 1.80 and 3.93 s, respectively. The polymer film with three colour variations changed from yellow to green and dark blue in the range of 0–1.0 V applied potential. The area ratio capacitance of the electrode material is 21.59 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.075 mA cm−2. A flexible supercapacitor with a full polymer containing EC and EFC groups has been constructed and exhibits obvious colouring, bleaching and fluorescence colour changes with potential. The supercapacitor also responds quickly to the applied potential. In addition, recent studies may offer a significant guideline for multifunctional molecular design and provide a vital step forward in extending the energy storage and display sensor.
