In this work, Co2NiO4/MXene (Ti3C2Tx) composites as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors are successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot hydrothermal route. The as-prepared products deliver a capacitance of 719.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and keep 83.1% of initial capacitance after 10000 cycles, revealing the remarkable electrochemical performance compared with other two single electrodes. An asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated, which presents an energy density of 49.74 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2752.21 W kg−1, demonstrating that the products can be potential candidates in high performance energy storage devices.
