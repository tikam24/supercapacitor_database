We report a facile strategy to prepare iron nanosheets directly grown on graphene sheets nanocomposite (C-PGF) through the carbonization of iron ions adsorbed onto polyaniline nanosheet/graphene oxide hybrid material. Because of the synergistic effect of iron nanosheets and graphene sheets, the as-obtained C-PGF exhibits an ultrahigh capacitance of ca. 720 F g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Additionally, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (C-PGF//Ni(OH)2/CNTs) delivers a remarkable high power density and a noticeable ultrahigh energy density of ca. 140 Wh kg-1 (based on the total mass of active materials) and an acceptable cycling performance of 78% retention after 2000 cycles. Therefore, the designed supercapacitors with high energy density, comparable to rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), offer an important guideline for future design of advanced next-generation supercapacitors for both industrial and consumer applications.
