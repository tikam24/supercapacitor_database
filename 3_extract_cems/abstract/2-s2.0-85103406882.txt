Maintaining fast charging capability at low temperatures represents a significant challenge for supercapacitors. The performance of conventional porous carbon electrodes often deteriorates quickly with the decrease of temperature due to sluggish ion and charge transport. Here we fabricate a 3D-printed multiscale porous carbon aerogel (3D-MCA) via a unique combination of chemical methods and the direct ink writing technique. 3D-MCA has an open porous structure with a large surface area of ∼1750 m2 g-1. At -70 °C, the symmetric device achieves outstanding capacitance of 148.6 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1. Significantly, it retains a capacitance of 71.4 F g-1 at a high scan rate of 200 mV s-1, which is 6.5 times higher than the non-3D printed MCA. These values rank among the best results reported for low temperature supercapacitors. These impressive results highlight the essential role of open porous structures for preserving capacitive performance at ultralow temperatures.
