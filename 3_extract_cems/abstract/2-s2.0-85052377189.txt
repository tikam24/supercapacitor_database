Battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) are popular as a way of extending the battery lifetime by reducing the battery current fluctuations. In this paper, a current sensor reduction method for a recently proposed interleaved boost inverter based battery-supercapacitor HESS is proposed. A pulse width modulation (PWM) and inductor current reconstruction scheme is developed to achieve the current sensor reduction for the HESS. The method is able to measure four inductor current waveforms using two current sensors while ensuring the interleaved operation of the boost converter legs.
