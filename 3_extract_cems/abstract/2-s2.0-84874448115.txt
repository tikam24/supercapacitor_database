Power and energy management are central algorithms effecting key properties of hybrid powertrain systems. In this contribution a compound approach for the load profile prediction and the control optimization of the power and energy management is presented and demonstrated on a fuel cell/supercapacitor-based hybrid electric powertrain. The load profile prediction applied is based on its past trajectory. Therefor the characteristic properties of the trajectory of the previous measurements are analyzed and applied for the prediction. Based on this, a related control optimization approach based on a new developed Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is presented. For optimization, three system properties, i.e. the system drivability, the fuel efficiency, and the component aging of the fuel cell system are considered. Â© 2012 IEEE.
