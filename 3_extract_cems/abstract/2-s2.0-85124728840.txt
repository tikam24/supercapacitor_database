For both batteries and supercapacitors, developing electrodes based on Silicon is of enormous interest. The purpose of this study was to prepare two nanocomposites, MZ8 (MCM-41/ZIF-8) and MU66 (MCM-41/UiO-66), that have been specifically designed to function as electrode materials. The cyclic voltammograms showed enlarged potential window and galvanostatic charge-discharge by confirming the samples' successful synthesis process and morphological structure via XRD, FT-IR, TGA, BET, TEM, and FESEM plots gave excellent specific capacitance. MU66 with spherical morphology and average particle size around 50 nm creates more appropriate pores, and more accessible pathways showed higher capacitance (992 F g − 1 @ 0.5 Ag−1), while MZ8 (351 F g − 1 @ 0.5 Ag−1) with hexagonal morphology and average particle size around 350 nm stands more durable (100%) after 4000 cycles. MZ8 displayed an EDLC with semi-rectangular CV and symmetric charge-discharge graphs, while MU66 showed inflation at lower sweep rates and lowered current densities, representing a hybrid charge mechanism. Based on the EIS test, MZ8 showed lower charge resistance and was more conducive to taking the barriers of the low capacitance of Si-based electrodes. We believe that the fabrication of Si-containing materials into MOFs can protect Si from swelling-shrinking and maintain close contact between Si and electrolyte to use both merits of MOF structures and Si capacity.
