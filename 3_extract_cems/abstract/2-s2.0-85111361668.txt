A high-performance energy storage device plays an important role in controlling carbon emissions. The emerging additive manufacturing techniques bring a great revolution of electrode fabrication process and promote the performance of energy storage devices through the advanced electrode architecture design. In this paper, recent studies on the three-dimensional (3D)-printed electrode with advanced architecture have been mainly reviewed, including interdigitated structure, through-thickness aligned structure, hierarchical porous structure and fiber and fibric structure of electrodes, and expectations for the development of novel advanced electrode architecture generated and optimized by computational simulation and machine learning. The strategy of advanced electrode architecture design and fabrication enabled by the 3D printing technique represents a promising direction toward future energy storage devices with high electrochemical and mechanical performance.
