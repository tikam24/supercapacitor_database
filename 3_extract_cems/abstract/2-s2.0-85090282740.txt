Polyindole (Pind) is one of the rising conducting polymers (CPs) finding application in energy, sensors, biomedicine, corrosion protection, and catalysis. Pind and its composites of carbon, metal oxides and transitional metal dichalcogenides are gaining enormous attention as electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors. Herein, the methods to synthesize (polymerize) and utilize Pind-based electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors are systematically reviewed. A critical perspective and future works to be done to push the performance of these electrodes for electrochemical energy storage are also discussed.
