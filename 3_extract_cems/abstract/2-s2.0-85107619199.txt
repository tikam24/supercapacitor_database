Major interest has recently been raised by zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHSCs) as a promising development in the realm of electrochemical energy storages because of their impressive energy and power densities, ease of manufacturing and handling in air, cost effectiveness, durability, safety, natural abundance, eco-friendliness, and high volumetric capacity. This device enjoys the advantages of zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) with large energy density and supercapacitors (SCs) with exceptional power density and cycle stability. Thus far, a variety of techniques, advanced cathode and anode materials, and different electrolytes were utilized to improve the electrochemical performance of ZIHSCs. However, despite breakthroughs in research, practical application and large-scale production of ZIHSCs are still relatively far away. This comprehensive review summarizes the main basics and advances associated with the ZIHSCs e.g., their compositions, energy storing mechanisms, and developments in electrodes and electrolytes. Besides, challenges and perspectives of the recently-developed cathode and anode materials for ZIHSCs application were summarized.
