Facile and cost-effective synthesis of few layer graphene has been developed from bituminous coal by modified Hummer's method and thermal reduction (C-RGO). Here, a chemically oxidized technique the preparation of bulk synthesis graphene from coal has been developed and thermally reduced graphene were characterized by X-ray Diffraction Studies and Raman Spectroscopy. Morphological analyses were using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM). An electrochemical behavior of graphene derived from coal, C-RGO as working electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scan rates towards the electrochemical double layer capacitance behavior from CV. The C-RGO materials was exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 149 F/g current density at 0.125 A/g. The electrochemical impedance measurement shows a low Rct value of 24 ohm. The specific capacitance is more superior to electrochemical performance of graphene nanosheets from coal as high energy storage electrode materials for supercapacitors. The coal could be used for the chemical oxidation by Hummer's method and thermal reduction for large scale production is desirable for applications such as use in high energy storage supercapacitor application.
