In systems like electric/hybrid vehicles and islanded DC microgrids, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) technologies are employed to augment the batteries. In case of a DC microgrid, the flow of energy between the source and the load must be balanced so as to take care of a relentless DC grid voltage. Energy storage is utilized to balance out any imbalances between the source and the load. To control the imbalance power, supercapacitor and battery-based combination storage is the best solution among all hybrid energy storage systems. This paper presents the HESS modelling, design of bidirectional converter, controller design, stability analysis and simulation as well as experimental findings for a step change in PV generation and load demand are presented. The outcomes of the study of the conventional control scheme along with the proposed control scheme were included.
