Free-standing 2D porous nanomaterials have attracted considerable interest as ideal candidates of 2D film electrodes for planar energy storage devices. Nevertheless, the construction of well-defined mesopore arrays parallel to the lateral surface, which facilitate fast in-plane ionic diffusion, is a challenge. Now, a universal interface self-assembly strategy is used for patterning 2D porous polymers, for example, polypyrrole, polyaniline, and polydopamine, with cylindrical mesopores on graphene nanosheets. The resultant 2D sandwich-structured nanohybrids are employed as the interdigital microelectrodes for the assembly of planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), which deliver outstanding volumetric capacitance of 102 F cm−3 and energy density of 2.3 mWh cm−3, outperforming most reported MSCs. The MSCs display remarkable flexibility and superior integration for boosting output voltage and capacitance.
