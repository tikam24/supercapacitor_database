In this work, a paper-based chemiluminescence excited photoelectrochemical aptamer device (PPECD) was developed for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurement based on a porous Au-paper electrode modified with a tin dioxide quantum dot/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (SnO2 QD/RGO) integrated with an all-solid-state paper supercapacitor (PSC) amplifier and a digital multi-meter (DMM). The Au-paper electrode was constructed through the growth of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) layer on the back of the paper working electrode to improve the electron conduction. Fe3O4@AuNP nanocomposites were used as labels of luminol, glucose oxidase (GOx) and signal aptamer which greatly enhanced the chemiluminescence emission and provided a simple magnetic separation approach to attain interference-free measurement for real detection. GOx was used for the oxidation of glucose to produce H 2O2 which was not only used as the co-reactant in the CL system, but also as the electron donors to suppress the corrosion of SnO 2 QDs under illumination as well as to facilitate the generation of stable photocurrent. A PSC was constructed and integrated into a PPECD as an effective electrical energy storage unit to collect and store the photocurrents. The stored electrical energy could be released instantaneously through a low cost, portable, and simple DMM to obtain an amplified current for the quantification of ATP.
