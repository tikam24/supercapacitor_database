The behavior of the differential impedance of a solid-state supercapacitor in the course of a charge/discharge cycle in the region of potentials including a hybrid regime has been studied. Both real and imaginary parts of the impedance exhibit a hysteresis. A large number of features observed on the experimental curves indicate that the energy accumulation process has a much more complicated character than that stipulated by the existing model.
