We employed a hydrothermal technique to prepare electrodes of nickel phosphate hydrate (NPH) and nickel pyrophosphate (NPP) over the 3D Ni-foam. At a steady reaction temperature, the microstructures of NPH and NPP electrodes change with hydrothermal reaction duration (1 to 5 h). The structural, morphological, and electrochemical characterizations were thoroughly investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, and FT-Raman study confirm the crystalline and amorphous nature of the synthesized NPH and NPP materials, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigation reveals plate-like microstructures of all the electrodes. Electrochemical measurements of NPH and NPP electrodes were conducted in a 1 M KOH electrolyte with a potential range of -0.2 to 0.55 vs SCE/V for NPH and 0 to 0.55 vs SCE/V for NPP. The NPP electrode, prepared after a 2-hour reaction time, demonstrated a specific capacity of 1866.66 ÂµAh/cm2 (12.21 F/cm2) at a current density of 30 mA/cm2. The NPP electrode shows 98.30% capacity retention after 5,000 consecutive cycles of charge-discharge at 100 mA/cm2. The charge storage dynamics of the NPP electrode is discussed using the 3D Bode analysis. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor is assembled with NPH/NPP and AC for electrochemical measurements.
