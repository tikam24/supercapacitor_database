The intermittent nature of renewable energy resources has led to a continuous mismatch between energy demand and supply. A possible solution to overcome this persistent problem is to design appropriate energy-storage materials. Supercapacitors based on different nanoelectrode materials have emerged as one of the promising storage devices. In this work, we investigate the supercapacitor properties of a molybdenum disulfide-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) heterostructure-based binder-free electrode, which delivered a high specific capacitance (387.6 F g-1 at 1.2 A g-1) and impressive cycling stability (virtually no loss up to 1000 cycles). In addition, the possible role of rGO in the composite toward synergistically enhanced supercapacitance has been highlighted. Moreover, an attempt has been made to correlate the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies with the voltammetric analyses. The performance exceeds that of the reported state-of-the-art structures.
