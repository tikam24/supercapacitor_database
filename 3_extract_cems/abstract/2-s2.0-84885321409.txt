By means of Monte Carlo simulations we show that a pore-width dependent dielectric permittivity, εp(L), may diminish the pore-size dependence of the surface-specific capacitance. This is different from the case of a fixed dielectric permittivity, εp = const, which leads to an increase of capacitance when the pore width becomes comparable to the ions size. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
