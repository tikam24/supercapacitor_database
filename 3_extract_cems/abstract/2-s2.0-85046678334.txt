Distribution network is one of the essential part of the power system always suffers from overload condition and voltage fluctuations, which reduces its efficiency. To overcome this problem addition of the renewable energy sources is preferred. Adding of energy storage devices is essential, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Hence the combination of renewable and energy storage devices will play a vital role in enhancing the power transfer capability of Distribution network and power system stability. This paper deals with the characteristics, performance and comparisons of various storage devices.
