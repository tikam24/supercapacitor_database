In the present study polyaniline (PANI)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/Ag2O nanocomposites with varying Ag content were synthesized using a facile chemical rout and investigated for the energy storage application. XRD results reveal crystallite size and lattice strain varied from 40.30 nm to 50.02 nm and 0.00117 to 0.00745 respectively. The Ag content was varied from 0.08 at.% to 0.20 at.% as confirmed by the XPS. The carbon network study in Raman and XPS show C-H(B), C-N(B), C-N(Q), C-C(Q), C=N(Q), C=C(Q), and C-C(B) functional groups. The cyclic voltammetry showed the specific capacitances for PRGAg60, PRGAg80, and PRGAg160 nanocomposites are 733.2 Fg−1, 897.9 Fg−1, and 556.8 Fg−1 respectively at 5 mV s−1 scan rate, which indicates that the specific capacitance increases first with Ag loading and then it decreases with farther increase in Ag. Moreover, PANI/rGO/Ag2O nanocomposite exhibited good cyclic stability of 87.1% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles.
