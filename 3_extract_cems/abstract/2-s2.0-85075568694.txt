Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a two-dimensional layer structure with high edge energy state, resulting in high chemical activity. It can be widely used in the supercapacitors. Herein, a novel conductive architectures of MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets was immobilized on carbon cloth (CC) via hydrothermal method. The MoS2/rGO nanosheets are uniformly grown on CC, which can provide a higher specific surface area and increase additional active sites. The intimate contact between nanostructured MoS2/rGO and active CC is in favor of maintaining the stability of structure. As a result, MoS2/rGO as a supercapacitor electrode material shows high specific capacitance of 331 F g−1 at 0.75 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability with a specific capacitance retention of 110.7% after 15000 cycles. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled and the device shows a high energy density of 29.2 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 4517.7 W kg−1. These results indicate that MoS2/rGO as an electrode material has an important application potential in supercapacitors.
