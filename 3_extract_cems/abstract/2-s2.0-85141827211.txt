DC microgrids have shown to be a good approach for better accommodating stochastic renewable energy sources (RES) and for the charging of electric vehicles (EVs) at the distribution level. For this, fast-acting energy storage units (ESSs) are essential. This requires that both the bi-directional power converter topology and the control scheme present the right set of features. The ESS discussed in this paper consists of a new DC-DC converter based on a tapped inductor (TI) for a higher voltage gain at moderate duty cycles. The direction of the current in its intermediate inductor does not need to be reversed for power flow reversal, leading to a faster action. Moreover, it can employ a multi-state and multi-variable modulation scheme that eliminates the right half-plane (RHP) zero, common in boost-type converters. In order to achieve good dynamic performance across a wide range of operating points, a control scheme based on feedback linearization is developed. This paper presents the modeling of the five-switch DC-DC converter operating in the tri-state buck–boost mode. A systematic approach for deriving control laws for the TI current and output voltage based on exact state feedback linearization is discussed. The performance of the proposed control scheme is verified by simulation for a supercapacitor (SC)-based ESS. It is compared to that of a conventional control scheme for a dual-state buck–boost mode with cascaded PI controllers designed based on small-signal models. The results show that both control schemes work similarly well at the operating point that the conventional control scheme was designed for. However, only the proposed scheme allows the SC-based ESS to control the current injected into the DC microgrid with the voltage of the SC varying between the expected range of rated to half-rated.
