In order for a material to be considered a supercapacitor, it should have electrochemical properties similar to that of a typical capacitor. This chapter describes the common measurement techniques used to evaluate the performance of a capacitive material or supercapacitor system. These techniques include cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), self-discharge measurements, and others. A brief analysis of the typical experimental profiles expected for each technique is provided, as well as a description of the method by which key supercapacitor descriptors can be calculated.
