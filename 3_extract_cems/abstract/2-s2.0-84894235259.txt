Porous hollow nanospheres (or spherical shells) made of NiO nanosheets are synthesized and tested for the electrochemical performance of the electrodes made of these materials for supercapacitors. Preparation of the NiO sheet hollow spheres starts with synthesis of polystyrene nanospheres with carboxyl groups (CPS), followed by a two-step activation procedure and the subsequent nucleation and growth by electroless deposition of Ni on the CPS core to obtain CPS@Ni core-shell nanoparticles. The CPS core is eliminated and metallic Ni nanoshell is converted into NiO by calcinations at high temperatures. The material properties of as-prepared hollow NiO nanospheres are characterized by TEM, XRD and N2-absorption measurements. The electrochemical characteristics of the electrodes made of these nanostructured NiO materials are determined by the CV and galvanostatic measurements. These electrochemical tests indicate that electrodes made of the NiO nanosheet hollow spheres exhibit an improved reversible capacitance of 600 F g-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g-1. It is believed that the good electrochemical performance of these electrodes is attributed to the improved OH- transport in the porous network structures associated with the hollow spheres of randomly oriented NiO nanosheets.
