This paper presents the power management strategy utilized for the three-wheeler electric vehicle (EV) between the North and South Campus of IIT Mandi, India situated in the lap of the Himalayas. The hill-climbing power requirement from the energy sources is peaky with a high magnitude as compared to other traction components acting on EV. Also, the opposing wind flow in these mountainous terrains has high speed demanding a significant amount of power from the source. The power-split technique is used such that the slow varying power requirements are supplied by the battery. The transient or fast varying power components are supplied by the Ultra-Capacitor (UC) for the required traction. The nature of the power requirement for hill climbing impacts the battery cycle life reducing its capacity. The power management strategy reduces the battery stress by adding an auxiliary energy storage system in the form of UC packs. The technique considered has been implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. It also helps in storing the regenerated power efficiently using UC which in turn increases the range of EV and reliability of complete energy storage systems.
