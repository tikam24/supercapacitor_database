2D (Two-dimensional) Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets is synthesized by hydrothermal method with nickel nitrate hexahydrate and hexamethylenetetramine as raw materials. Herein, the effect of reaction temperature and time on the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets are studied. The results showed that morphology and performance appeared great changes as the reaction time and temperature changed. The maximum specific capacitance of 1404.6 F g -1 at current density of 1.5 A g -1 by chronopotentiometry is achieved for Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets in 6.0 M KOH when reaction temperature and time are 140 Â°C and 8 h. Moreover, the capacitance only reduced to 88% after 2000 times charge and discharge of constant current. Such results demonstrated that Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets is a promising electrode material for the practical application of high-performance supercapacitor and it is worthy of further investigation.
