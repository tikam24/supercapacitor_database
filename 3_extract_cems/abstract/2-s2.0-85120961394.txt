This research demonstrated the synthesis of Mn2SnO4 and Mn2O3 (MSO@MO) with isolated nanoparticle and nanorod morphologies, respectively, derived from MnSn(OH)6 (MSH) for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. The MSH was synthesized using a simple solution process and converted to MSO@MO composites by thermal annealing with good crystallinity, purity with the MSO and MO ratio of 1:0.46. The MSH and MSO@MO-modified Ni foam electrodes exhibited the specific capacitance (Cs) of 1000.86 and 1197.75 F/g, respectively, at 10 mV/s, and 512.0 and 660.0 F/g, respectively, at 0.4 A/g. The enhanced Cs value and high energy density (22.91 Wh/Kg at 0.4 A/g) of the MSO@MO were attributed to the synergistically improved surface area, decreased charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and a high degree of charge intercalation/deintercalation into the tunnels of MSO and MO. The MSO@MO electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical cycling stability with the capacity loss of only 5.5% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
