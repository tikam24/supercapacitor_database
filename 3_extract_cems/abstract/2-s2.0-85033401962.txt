Novel and flexible Mn3O4 nanosheets/reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs) paper-like electrodes have been developed by a feasible method. The rGO works as a flexible substrate and an electron conductor. The synergetic effect of interconnected nanosheet structure can effectively depress self-agglomeration of rGO, which displays eminent conductivity. Moreover, the crumpled surface with more active sites are more convenient for the ion and electron insertion/desertion in the reversible reactions. So flexible Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 409 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, superior cycling stability of 92% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. More importantly, the composite material was first applied in 3D printing and screen printing of micro-patterns because of the desirable processability. It is anticipated that the high-performance Mn3O4 NSs/rGO NSs composites are a promising electrode material in printable energy storage and wearable electronic equipment.
