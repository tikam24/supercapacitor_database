Low cost carbon material was produced from Dosmostachya bipinnata (Dharba grass) through thermal decomposition method. Ghee was used as the carbonizing agent and the prepared material was carbonized at 500 Â°C for 3 h. Structural studies have been made through FTIR and SEM analysis. The electrochemical performance of the carbonized sample was analyzed via cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance analysis using 0.5 M Na2SO4 in PVA gel electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance of 215 F g-1 was obtained at a scan rate of 25 mV s-1. The excellent cyclic stability of 98 % after 500 continuous cycles could be observed. Based on the electrochemical performance and ease of production of carbon obtained from Dosmostachya bipinnata, it is suggested as a suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
