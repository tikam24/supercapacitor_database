The dual metal oxides anticipated prospective substitution of the transition of cathodic energy materials. The prominent attributes like higher specific energy, specific power, and long cycle stability are crucial to a supercapacitor device's energy storage. In this acclaimed research, the novel MnV2O7 composite is fabricated by microwave process and tailed by a hydrothermal method where dimethyl formamide, ethylene glycol, and water are used as solvents separately. The bimetallic oxide's distinctive morphology with crystallinity variation realizes by the solvent. It delineates a higher active surface area that grossly supersedes redox-active sites, which eases diffusion of electrolyte ions and multi-valence redox reaction with ions intercalation. The lignocellulosic bio-waste-derived activated carbon materials are worked as anodic material. The synthesized oxide is investigated using diversified characterization tools to confirm the phase formation and investigated by electron microscopy for structural characteristics. The Hirshfeld surface, EPR and theoretical generalized gradient approximations simulation assist in comprehending the electronic interaction to elucidate the experimental consequences. The MnV2O7 oxide depicts improved capacitance is 402 Fg−1 at 2 mVs−1 scan rate and 364 Fg−1 at 2 mAcm−2 current for dimethyl formamide as solvent compared to rest. Also, composites delineate 96 % long cycle stability up to 10,000 cycles at 40mAcm−2 current with a maximum specific energy of 51.8 Whkg−1 and specific power of 2500 Wkg−1. The integration of augmented energy storage of the composite leads to a perfect candidate to apprehend the urge of novel advanced materials engineering for applications of energy storage.
