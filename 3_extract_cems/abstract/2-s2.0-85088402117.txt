The energy storage material NiMoS4 with Faradaic redox reactions was grown on the reduced graphene oxide (RGO) lamella by a facile hydrothermal method, considering that RGO with the high surface area and conductivity can provide some channels for charge/ion transfer and active sites for redox reactions. The optimal NiMoS4/RGO composite can exhibit the high specific capacity of 124 mA h/g at 1 A/g, and be selected as positive electrode materials of hybrid supercapacitors. The assembled NiMoS4/RGO//activated carbon hybrid device possesses a high current density of 63 Wh/kg at a power density of 1125 W/kg and good cyclic stability with the capacity retention of 81 % after 5000 cycles. The prepared NiMoS4/RGO composite is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
