This work describes the utilization of carbon (Char) held after the slow pyrolysis of Disposed Electric Switches made of Thermoset Plastic (DESTP) as a high-capacity electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Char is prepared by pyrolysis strategy and exposed to severe milling in high energy planetary ball mill for size reduction. By suspending the pulverised DESTP in silver (Ag) nanoparticles dispersed solution obtained by reducing AgNO3 with hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent, the DESTP is loaded with Ag nanoparticles. The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX) validates the elemental makeup of the manufactured char. The DESTP and Ag@DESTP are coated separately on a low-cost etched brass substrate, and their electrochemical charge-storage properties are investigated using an electrochemical workstation. The specific capacitance of DESTP and Ag@DESTP electrodes are discovered to be 32 Fg−1and 67 Fg−1, respectively. The fabricated electrodes provide a maximum volumetric capacitance of 93 mFcm−3and 21 mFcm−3with a current density of 5 mA for Ag@DESTP and DESTP electrodes respectively. This work gives a great model of repurposing the e-waste advertising with good electrochemical energy storage applications. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
