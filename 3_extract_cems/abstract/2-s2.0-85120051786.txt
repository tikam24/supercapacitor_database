Recently, the high-value utilization of food wastes has attracted great interest in sustainable development. Focusing on the major application of electrochemical energy storage (ECES), light-weight lignin-based carbon nanofibers (LCNFs) were controllably fabricated as supercapacitors from melon seed shells (MSS) and peanut shells (PS) through electrospinning and carbonizing processes. As a result, the optimal specific capacitance of 533.7 F/g in three-electrode system, energy density of 69.7 Wh/kg and power density of 780 W/Kg in two-electrode system were achieved. Surprisingly, the LCNFs also presented a satisfied electromagnetic absorption property: The minimum reflection loss (RL) value reached âˆ’37.2 dB at an absorbing frequency of 7.98 GHz with an effective frequency (RL < 10 dB) of 2.24 GHz (6.88 to 9.12 GHz) at a thickness of 3.0 mm. These features make the multifunctional LCNFs highly attractive for light-weight supercapacitor electrodes and electromagnetic wave absorbers applications.
