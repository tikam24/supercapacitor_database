A high performance, transparent, and simultaneously mechanically flexible supercapacitor, with electrodes based on a bio-inspired, quasifractal metallic network is demonstrated. Excellent performance parameters, such as the specific capacitance of 5.6 mF cmâˆ’2 (at 45% transparency), great long-term electrochemical and mechanical stability under stress, and low cost, make this one of the best reported, and most promising candidates for applications in the wearable, transparent integrated electronics.
