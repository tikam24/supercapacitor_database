A simple and controllable strategy has been developed to fabricate CoMoO4 microplates/CoMoO4 microprisms (CMCMs) structures on Ni foam via a facile, cost-effective, two-step hydrothermal route. The as-grown 3D architecture exhibited excellent areal capacitance of 4.33 F cm−2 at a galvanostatic charge-discharge current density of 50 mA cm−2 (6 A g−1) and outstanding cycle performance with only 2.8% degradation over 6500 cycles in the 3 M KOH solution. The asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors based on activated carbon (AC) and CMCMs exhibited much better electrochemical performance than the symmetric counterpart, showing an areal capacitance of 95.22 mF cm−2 at the current density of 12 mA cm−2 and excellent cycling stability with 92.27% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. These results may provide useful guidelines for materials selection and configuration designs for the novel energy storage devices based on CoMoO4 components and substrates.
