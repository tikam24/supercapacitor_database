A Zn-doped Ni-based metalâˆ’organic framework (Ni-MOF) material with honeycomblike hierarchical spherical structure is synthesized by a microwave-assisted method using HCl as the modulator for the first time. By adjusting the amount of the Zn ions doped, an optimal Zn doped Ni-MOF electrode material is obtained, which possesses a superior electrochemical performance: specific capacity of 237.4 mA h g-1 and 122.3 mA h g-1 at 1 A/g and 20 A/g, respectively. This is one of the highest performances reported so far for MOFs. The excellent electrochemical properties are ascribed to the unique crystal structure and special morphology of the Zn-doped Ni-MOF material. This work shows that the microwave-assisted synthesis is a rapid and efficient method for preparation of Ni-MOF supercapacitor electrode material.
