The paper is devoted in the study of the simple method to study the performance of aqueous electrolytes, whereas the custom-made FBNC-700 (FB represents FAC-brown, N represents “nitrogen-self-doped,” C represents mesoporous-carbon materials, and 700 represents carbonization temperature.) was utilized as the electrode material, where the C 4 O 6 H 4 KNa solution was utilized as an aqueous electrolyte. The polarization curves was be used in the three-electrode system to conduct the voltage window preliminary selection of the C 4 O 6 H 4 KNa solution, the voltage window was 1.3 V (−0.8 V to 0.5 V). The concentration had minimal effects on the voltage window. The method is faster and more efficient way to study the performance of aqueous electrolytes for supercapacitors. In the 2 M C 4 O 6 H 4 KNa solution, the FBNC-700 displayed a 97 F g −1 specific capacitance at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 in the two-electrodes tests. Also, following 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g −1 , the FBNC-700 had good stability with 76.22% capacitance retention.
