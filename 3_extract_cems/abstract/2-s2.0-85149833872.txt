Since advancements in energy conversion technologies and energy storage devices, the use of supercapacitors has become more prevalent recently. Their high energy density, consistent cycle life, and extended lifetimes of supercapacitors have been thought to be their key benefits. The development of supercapacitor technology has also been greatly aided by sustainability nanotechnology. Cerium oxide (CeO2) is a type of ceramic material that is demonstrated as having a positive electrochemical behavior among a variety of widely used materials. A prospective active material for supercapacitor applications is CeO2, together with its nanostructured composite materials, which is the subject of extensive research. Recent developments in this field necessitated the requirement to develop an alternative, thus giving rise to the supercapacitor. Supercapacitors utilize the same fundamental formulas as normal capacitors. Those characteristics enable it to behave at densities of energy and power that are higher than that of battery and ordinary capacitors, respectively. Due to their unique physicochemical characteristics, rare-earth minerals have garnered a lot of research interest as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Therefore, in this review, cerium composite-based electrode materials, cerium oxides and composite, ceria nano enzyme behavior, and rare earth oxide have all been covered as far as energy storage device applications are concerned.
