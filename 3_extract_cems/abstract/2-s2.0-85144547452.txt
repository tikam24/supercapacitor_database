A typical biocompatible and electrolyte inscribed textile based supercapacitor approached for wearable smart devices. The flexible electrolyte imprinted textile based supercapacitors designed from Chitosan/MnO2@MnCO3 chelate decorated fabrics. The active materials fabricated under BMIMBF4 ionic liquid assistance through hydrothermal method. The physiochemical properties, surface morphological notes are inspected by examining out X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy investigations. The XPS outlines of the composite disclose typical peaks of Mn2p1/2 (653.4 eV), Mn2p3/2 (641.5 eV), N1s (401.2 eV), and C1s (285.5 eV). The flexible supercapacitor exhibits notable areal capacitance of 2.5 Fcm−2 and 0.35 Wh cm−2 energy density. The fabric supercapacitors perform decent capacity retention around 90–89 % after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles with good mechanical flexibility performance. Moreover the obtained biocompatibility results are good to recommend for wearable devices (~90 % cell viability). The chitosan bio-ternary composite crafted textile based supercapacitor may newcomer for the suitability to wearable textile based energy storage system.
