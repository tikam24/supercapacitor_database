This review investigates the synthesis and electrochemical performance of the electrode of the electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices obtained from peels and scraps of the citrus fruits. The EES devices include batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid systems that have considerable value and various applications. The electrode is considered as the most important part of all EES devices. Tremendous efforts have been done to enhance the electrochemical energy storage electrode (EESE). The citrus fruits abundance leads to a decrease in their price and makes possible to use them as ingredients to fabricate EESE. Also, the electrochemical analyses determined that citrus fruits have considerable potential to use as the EESE. Using citrus fruits peels and scraps as biomass substances to prepare EESE leads to the electrodes which have low cost, environmentally friendly and appropriate electrochemical applications.
