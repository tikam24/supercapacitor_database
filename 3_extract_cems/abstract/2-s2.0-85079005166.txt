In association with increasing in penetration of distributed generation sources (DGs) into power systems, and their power management of different DGs and the grid has elevated as a major concern. Though, Microgrid (MG) is the extensively an accepted concept for the association of DGs in power system networks. Integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), which are often connected via power electronic interfaces into the power grid, can sometimes be a stimulating task just from a purely technical point of view. Thus, the MG is a promising option for future power system interfaces. Evolving the challenges has taken place in terms of the power system control, power quality improvement, reliability, and energy management. The MG operational performance, stability, basic control issues and, concept of MGs are presented in this paper.
