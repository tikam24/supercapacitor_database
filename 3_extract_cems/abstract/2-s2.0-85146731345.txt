Conventional MPPT algorithms, which are proposed regardless of the impact of Partial shading, are unrealistic considering that PV system might be frequently subjected to this phenomenon. This is because, in partial shading conditions, PVs experience several maximum power points compared to normal conditions where there is only one global maximum power point. For this purpose, this work proposed a fast and reliable two-stage MPPT algorithm. The first stage attempts to define a close vicinity of where the local maximum power points are while at the second stage, the conventional perturb&observe MPPT algorithm is utilized to find exact location of all maximum power points which leads to finding the global maximum power point eventually. The proposed algorithm supremacy is proved by comparison with a GA-based MPPT algorithm using simulation studies.
