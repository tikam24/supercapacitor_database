Binary metal niobium oxides can offer a higher specific capacity compared to niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) and thus are ideal anode candidates for lithium ion capacitors (LICs). However, their lower electronic conductivity limits their ability to achieve high energy and power densities. In this paper, one-dimensional (1D) copper niobate (CuNb2O6) nanowires are successfully prepared by electrospinning technology and then immobilized on two-dimensional (2D) reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets to form a unique 1D nanowire/2D nanosheet CuNb2O6/rGO structure. The 1D/2D CuNb2O6/rGO electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 312.2 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 as the anode of LICs. The proposed Li+ storage mechanism of the CuNb2O6 anode involves CuNb2O6 decomposition into lithium niobate (Li3NbO4) and copper (Cu) during the initial lithium insertion process. The intercalation-type Li3NbO4 will further serve as the host to Li+ and the inactive Cu phase will act as a conductive network for electron transportation. Furthermore, the energy density of the assembled CuNb2O6/rGO//activated carbon (CuNb2O6/rGO//AC) device could achieve a value as high as 92.1 Wh kg−1 and could thus be considered as a possible alternative electrode material for high energy and power LICs.
