Polyaniline-nickel oxide (PANI/NiO) nanocomposites synthesized successfully by chemical polymerization method. Prepared nanocomposites (50%) were investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). XRD results revealed that, NiO retain its structure even though it is dispersed in PANI during polymerization. TEM image of PANI/NiO nanocomposites shows predominant formation of spherical nanoparticles within PANI matrix of size 20»nm. The electrochemical properties of NiO, PANI/NiO electrode having diameter of about 4.2»mm and height is 4.7»cm examined through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The electrochemical results were improved for synthesized NiO electrode which demonstrated that NiO is promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitor applications.
