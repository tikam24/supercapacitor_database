This paper presents the charge and discharge combination of the supercapacitors and the AC power source in storing and supplying energy for computer backup power. According to the behavior of storing and supplying energy, the SC can be charged with high currents. Whereas the battery cannot. The supercapacitors efficiency in storing and supplying power at high voltage and low current is 95.20%. An analysis also revealed that the charging time of the supercapacitors is less than 199 s. The combination of the supercapacitors and the battery required 604 s for charging time. The battery alone is the longest at 1080 s. Moreover, the study showed that the discharging time of the supercapacitors and the battery combination was more than 610 s. The discharging time of the battery and the supercapacitors were 285 and 579 s, respectively. Therefore, the combination of the supercapacitors and an AC power source can replace battery in the design of computer backup.
