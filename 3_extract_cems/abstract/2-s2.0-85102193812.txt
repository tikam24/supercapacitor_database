Designing nanocomposites with good electrochemical properties is one of the challenges in constructing supercapacitors. Adjustable metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have potential research value in improving charge storage and transfer due to their multi-porosity. Moreover, MOFs can serve as a precursor to various derivatives. Herein, a series of core-shell structures with macro-microporous ZIF-67 (M-ZIF-67) as the core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) as the shell were synthesized based on polystyrene spheres (PSs) template via a simple ion etching method. As a result, the sample of M-ZIF-67@LDH4 shows a specific capacitance of 597.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high rate retention of 92% at 3 A g−1.
