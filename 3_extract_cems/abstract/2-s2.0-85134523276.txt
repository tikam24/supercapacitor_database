Few-layer Ti3C2Tx was prepared in high yield by a solvothermal intercalation and exfoliation method. Due to the abundant oxygen-containing functional groups on the Ti3C2Tx surface present after the solvothermal reaction, polyaniline (PANI) nanorods were loaded on the Ti3C2Tx sheets by in situ polymerization to obtain a Ti3C2Tx/PANI composite electrode material. Benefiting from tight molecular binding and fast ion transport channels, the composite material exhibited excellent capacitor properties with a specific capacity of 508 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an energy density of 8.93 Wh kg−1.
