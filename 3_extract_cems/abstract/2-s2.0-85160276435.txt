Cobalt-manganese bimetallic oxide MnCo2O4 has potential application value in the research of cathode materials for supercapacitors. The structure of the MnCo2O4 nanomaterial directly affects its electrochemical performance. A series of MnCo2O4 electrode materials with different sintering temperatures were obtained by hydrothermal synthesis of a cobalt-manganese precursor. The relationship between the microstructure and electrochemical properties of the samples was investigated. The sample sintered at 700°C had the best electrochemical performance, and the specific capacity of the sample reached 2065 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor MCO-700//AC had a capacity retention rate of 67% after 10,000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The stable structure and excellent electrochemical performance of MnCo2O4 material were obtained by controlling the sintering temperature, which provides a reference for developing cobalt-manganese-based capacitor materials.
