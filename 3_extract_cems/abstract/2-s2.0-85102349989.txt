Recently, activated carbon derived from different agricultural by-products or bio-waste is receiving a great deal of attention due to its low or zero cost and environmental friendliness. In this work, flowers obtained from Borassus flabellifer (BFL) is used as a carbon source and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as activation precursor to produce activated carbon with high specific surface area and predominant micropore. The obtained carbon material was activated at 650 Â°C. The as-prepared sample had a specific surface area of 930.3 m2/g and pore size distribution of 1.96 nm. The carbon material exhibited high electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 247 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and an excellent cycling stability of 94% after 2500 cycles. A specific energy of 101.1 Wh/kg and a specific power of 4500 kW/kg were obtained. Based on the electrochemical properties exhibited by BFL, it could be used as an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
