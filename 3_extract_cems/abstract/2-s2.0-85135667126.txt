An ever-increasing demand for flexible/wearable electronic devices has incentivized the development of high-performance flexible micro-supercapacitors. Electrode materials, one of the key components, play a central role in deciding the utilization of micro-supercapacitors for real-world applications. This chapter describes typical configurations, fabrication techniques, state-of-the-art materials, and the impact of other influential parameters to obtain high-performance electrodes for flexible micro-supercapacitors.
