This document shows the scheme for controlling induction motor performance for certain transient conditions. The purpose of the work is for solving the problem of induction motor overloading and grid overloading too. A detailed approach is used for designing the system model with the concept of mechanical coupling within two motor drives. Therefore a DC motor is used which will mechanically be coupled with three phase induction motor and also ultracapacitor being a storage device is used which will provides its stored energy into the system. The system will also consist of dc-dc boost converter. This paper represents the overall model simulation carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software and study its dynamic performance.
