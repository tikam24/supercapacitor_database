The conversion of discarded biomass into biomass activated carbon is a major trend in its high-value use. Herein, a template-free, eco-friendly, simple, and scalable-produced hierarchical ordered porous WO3-C (HOP-WC) is creatively fabricated through one-step glue milling and carbonization-activation. Owing to the optimized porous structure, the resulting HOP-WC-800 presents a large specific surface area (1964.9 m2 g-1) and high pore volume (1.56 cm3 g-1). As a supercapacitor electrode, it displays a high capacitance of 554.6 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. Moreover, only around 10% capacitance fading is observed after 10000 cycles at a scan rate of 500 mV s-1. As an electrocatalyst material, the Pt (20 wt %) modified HOP-WC-800 electrode exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic performance toward methanol oxidation. It is found that the specific current of Pt-mass activity is high as 541.4 mA mg-1 in the potential range of 0.6-0.8 V. In a word, the strategy of constructing hierarchical ordered porous carbon-based materials via one-step glue milling and carbonization-activation offers a great referential value for developing other multifunctional materials, such as fallen leaves, withered grass, and other waste biomass materials.
