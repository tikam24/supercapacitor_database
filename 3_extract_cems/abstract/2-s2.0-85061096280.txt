Recently, natural biomass has been widely explored as a precursor to prepare carbon materials due to its abundant, low-cost, and renewable character. Herein, a series of high-performance heteroatom-doped carbons hase been successfully produced from natural biomass small molecular peach gum for the first time. The sheet-like O-doped carbons PG-C and HTC-PG-C are synthesized by pyrolyzing peach gum (PG) and hydrothermally treated peach gum (HTC-PG), respectively. The three-dimensional hierarchical porous O-doped carbons PG-AC, HTC-PG-AC, and N/O-codoped carbon HTC-NPG-AC are prepared via KOH activation of PG, HTC-PG, and a hydrothermally treated mixture of peach gum and 1,6-hexanediamine (HTC-NPG), respectively. The PG-C, HTC-PG-C, PG-AC, HTC-PG-AC, and HTC-NPG-AC possess specific surface areas of 274.3, 374.3, 1256, 1279, and 1535 m 2 g -1 , respectively. In particular, PG-C, HTC-PG-C, PG-AC, HTC-PG-AC, and HTC-NPG-AC exhibit excellent capacitances of 199, 223, 334, 322, and 406 F g -1 at 0.2 A g -1 in 6 M KOH and high rate capabilities of 61.4%, 72.3%, 65.6%, 73.1%, and 76.2% from current densities from 1.0 to 20.0 A g -1 , respectively. Moreover, the PG-C-assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays an energy density of 9.38 W h kg -1 at a power density of 375 W kg -1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, while the HTC-PG-C-, PG-AC-, HTC-PG-AC-, and HTC-NPG-AC-assembled supercapacitors exhibit high energy densities of 14.66, 16.09, 18.04, and 22.84 W h kg -1 at 400 W kg -1 , respectively. Additionally, using 1 M Na 2 SO 4 as electrolyte, the PG-C-, HTC-PG-C-, PG-AC-, HTC-PG-AC-, and HTC-NPG-AC-assembled supercapacitors deliver outstanding energy densities of 11.25, 16.94, 19.31, 20.83, and 25.56 W h kg -1 at 500 W kg -1 , respectively. The strategy to utilize cost-effective renewable biomass small molecule peach gum as precursor to achieve large-scale repeatable production of heteroatom-doping carbons is promising. The peach gum-based heteroatom-doped carbons are prominent electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
