The rational designing and fabrication of transition metal selenium-based nanomaterials showed great attraction to improve the reliable and proficient energy storage device. NiCo2Se4@ NiWO4 nanocomposites prepared using a two-step hydrothermal process for high-performance supercapacitor's applications. The XRD, SEM, FT-IR, Raman, UV–Vis and PL emission spectroscopy were used to investigate the structural, morphological, elemental composition and optical properties of the as-prepared samples. Moreover CV and GCD used to study the electrochemical properties. The result indicates that crystallite size increasing while the bandgap energy reduces to 2.07 e V as the NiWO4 content increases. SEM revealed that prepared samples have irregular shape non uniform nanoparticles. Among all composites we obtained a high value of capacitance of 828.731 F/g for the 6 % composite of NiCo2Se4@NiWO4 at the scan rate of 50 mV/s within the potential range of 0.0–0.7 V. Thus 6 % composites show best electrochemical property. The prepared nanomaterials have the potential to be a promising electrode material for further study and practical applications in the energy storage industry.
