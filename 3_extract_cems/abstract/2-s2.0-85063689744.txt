On-chip micro-supercapacitors are promising miniaturized micro-power sources for wireless sensors, portable electronic devices, and implantable medical devices due to their advanced features such as high power densities, fast charge-discharge, and superior cycling lifetimes. Transition metal silicide nanowires can meet the desired requirements for electrode materials for on-chip micro-supercapacitors, as they provide advantages such as high conductivity, high surface area, effective electrolyte transport, and ease of fabrication and integration on silicon. In the present work, we introduce freestanding single-crystalline Co2Si nanowires directly synthesized on a Si substrate for application in a high-performance on-chip micro-supercapacitor. Compared with the previously reported supercapacitors comprising Si-based nanowires, the single-crystalline Co2Si nanowires-based supercapacitor exhibits good supercapacitor performance, namely, high areal capacitance (∼983 μF cm−2 at 2 μA cm−2), high energy density (∼629 μJ cm−2 at 2 μA cm−2), and excellent cyclability (∼94% after 4000 cycles) in an ionic liquid electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the electrochemical performance of metal silicide nanowires directly grown on a Si substrate for supercapacitor application. Our results demonstrate the potential of metal silicide nanowires as electrode materials for on-chip micro-supercapacitor application.
