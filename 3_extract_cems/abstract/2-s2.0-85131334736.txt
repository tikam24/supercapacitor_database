Using the same materials for the cathode and anode in energy storage devices could greatly simplify the technological process and reduce the device cost significantly. In this paper, we assemble a dual carbon-based Li-ion capacitor with the active materials derived entirely from a single precursor, petroleum coke. For the anode, petroleum coke-derived carbon (PCC) is prepared by simple ball milling and carbonization, having a massive tap density (1.80 g cm−3) and high electrical conductivity (11.5 S cm−1). For the cathode, the raw petroleum coke is activated by KOH (petroleum coke-activated carbon (PC-AC) sample) to achieve a well-developed pore structure to meet a rapid capacitive behavior. As a result, in addition to the robust structural stability of both the anode and cathode, the assembled dual carbon Li-ion capacitor shows a high energy density (231 W h kg−1/206 W h L−1) and ultralong cycling life (up to 3000/10,000 cycles) at a wide voltage window. The excellent electrochemical response and simple production process make the PCC materials have great potential for practical application.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
