At present, the electrode materials of supercapacitors are still restricted by high cost and complex manufacturing process. In this paper, we carbonized the leaves of Platanus acerifolia and activated it to explore the possibility of being used as supercapacitor electrode material. The results showed that the as-prepared biomass-derived hierarchical porous carbon (PAL-b) materials had a high specific surface area of 2046.1 m2/g after KOH activation, and contained the microporous (1.9096 nm) matching with the electrolyte 1 M H2SO4. And the specific surface area of PAL-a is 1766 m2/g. The specific capacitance of incubated and activated product (PAL-b) reaches 404 F/g, which is higher than that of most biomass carbon. After 5000 constant current charge/discharge cycles, its capacitance retention rate is still as high as 79%. The product of PAL-b was confirmed to be rich in oxygen-containing groups and graphitization structures by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectrum measurements. This is the reason of its good cycle stability. We used waste materials to obtain the electrode material with high specific capacitance by a simple and low cost method. This work provides a promising approach to realizing the Platanus acerifolia leaves into a high-valued energy storage material. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
