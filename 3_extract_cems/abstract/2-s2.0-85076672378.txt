Fibrous graphene electrode (FGE) based supercapacitors have great potential as flexible power sources for wearable electronics. However, their low electrochemical performance is limited by the restacking and intrinsic hydrophobicity of graphene sheets. Intercalation of nanofillers within graphene materials has been proved as an effective way to enhance the capacitance but often negative to the mechanical property and conductivity of FGE, thus influencing practical applications in wearable electronics. Herein, an approach for fabricating inorganic hybrid fibers from graphene oxide (GO) and nano Clay via non-liquid-crystal spinning and following by chemical reduction is presented to fabricate high performance graphene fiber. The resultant rGO/Clay hybrid fibers had the enhanced mechanical property, good hydrophilicity, as well as excellent capacitive performance and kept a high conductivity. Notably, the sample with a GO/Clay weight ratio of 100/20 possessed a high capacitance of 230.9 F cm−3, a strength of 102.7 MPa, a contact angle of 58.3°, and conductivity of 10.4 S cm−1. Moreover, a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor was assembled with a high energy density of 6.14 mWh cm−3 (5.24 mWh g−1) at the power density of 28.33 mWh cm−3 (24.17 mWh g−1), capable of being applied in wearable electronics.
