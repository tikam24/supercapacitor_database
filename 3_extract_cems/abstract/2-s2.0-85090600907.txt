The development of porous carbon materials from sustainable natural sources is an attractive topic in the field of energy storage materials. This study proposed the production of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) materials from the renewable cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) as carbon source and water-soluble urea as nitrogen source without any external activation. The liquid compounding treatment and subsequent carbonization provided the NPC materials a uniform and stable N-doping (7.4% nitrogen content), high specific surface area (366.5 m2/g) and various superior electrochemical properties. The fabricated NPC sample (CU-3, with the weight ratio of 1:10 for CNC and urea) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 570.6 F/g at a current density load of 1 A/g and good cycling stability (91.2% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g) in the 6 M KOH electrolyte. Applying this NPC material as the electrode component in the assembled symmetric supercapacitor demonstrated the promising electrochemical stability with the specific capacitances of 88.2 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and capacitance retention of 99.8% after 5000 cycles. The developed N-doped porous carbon material from CNCs and urea is expected to be a sustainable electrode component for the supercapacitor materials.
