We report a type of MEMS-technique processable micro-supercapacitors built on 3D graphene nanowall (GNW)/Ni core-shell electrodes. While the growth of GNW on quartz glass and other conductive substrates were rationally revealed, the microfabrication of hybrid electrodes was realized by uniformly coating Ni on GNW to simultaneously serve as a shadow mask for patterning and an active material for capacitance augmentation. With 10-fold larger capacitance of 337 F/cm3 than that using pure GNW and Ni, the core-shell electrodes enabled a high on-chip energy and power density delivery of the capacitor. The non-catalytic growth and micromachining strategy possibly promote applying GNW in various microsystems.
