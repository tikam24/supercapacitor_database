Finding alternative routes to access and store energy has become a major issue recently. Transition metal oxides have shown promising behaviour as catalysts and supercapacitors. Recently, liquid exfoliation of bulk metal oxides appears to be an effective route which provides access to two-dimensional (2D) nano-flakes, the size of which can be easily selected. These 2D materials exhibit excellent electrochemical charge storage and catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, various sized selected cobalt hydroxide nano-flake materials are fabricated by this time efficient and highly reproducible process. Subsquently, the electrochemical properties of the standard size Co(OH)2 nanoflakes were investigated. The oxide modified electrodes were prepared by spraying the metal oxide flake suspension onto a porous conductive support electrode foam, either glassy carbon or nickel. The cobalt hydroxide/nickel foam system was found to have an overpotential value at 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M NaOH as low as 280 mV and an associated redox capacitance exhibiting numerical values up to 1500 F g-1, thereby making it a viable dual use electrode.
