Due to the urgent demand for portable electronics, enormous research efforts are devoted for the development of flexible, wearable and lightweight supercapacitors. Herein, we report a cost-effective chemical liquid process followed with a refluxing route to grow CC@CoMoO4-Co(OH)2 nanosheets with Co-based MOF as precursor. The resulting CC@CoMoO4-Co(OH)2-4 electrode delivers a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 2028 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and capacitance of 1581.8 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. Furthermore, the flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (CC@CoMoO4-Co(OH)2//AC) is assembled, displays a high energy density of 61 Wh kg−1 at power density of 800 W kg−1, with an excellent cycle stability. These exceptional electrochemical performances could be ascribed to the unique structure and multi-metal ion combination contributes to the ideal synergistic effects, which also signify that the potential application of CC@CoMoO4-Co(OH)2 nansheets in high-performance supercapacitors.
