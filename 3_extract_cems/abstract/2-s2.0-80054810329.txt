This paper proposes a solution for using supercapacitors to power mobile phones. Based on a DC/DC voltage converter and a supercapacitor stacking scheme, this solution is designed to maximize the usable energy of the supercapacitors as well as the converter's performance, which is confirmed in simulation. A specific charging scheme for this design is also proposed and simulated, enabling fast and efficient charging of the mobile device. Â© 2011 IEEE.
