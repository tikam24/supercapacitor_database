In the development of better-architectures in nanomaterials for energy storage devices, heterostructures have played an important role. In this paper, we have reported a new class of nanocomposite with two-dimensional plate-on-sheet heterostructure Bi2O2CO3 nanoplates@α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets (BCNP@NHNS) based nanocomposite was synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach. The fabricated BCNP@NHNS plate-on-sheet heterostructure exhibit better cyclic performance with higher specific capacitance than those of pristine Bi2O2CO3 and α-Ni(OH)2. The optimized electrodes delivered a high specific capacity up to 743 F g−1 at an applied current density of 3 A g−1. Further, fabricated two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) with KOH aqueous electrolyte delivered an energy density of 73.7 Wh kg−1 coupled with a power density of 872.7 W kg−1 and high capacitance of 725 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The retention of specific capacity up to 92.8% was achieved after 5000 cycles. The superior performance of BCNP@NHNS nanocomposite as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors with long cycling life is owed to the synergetic effect of the heterostructure in the nanocomposite.
