Nanoarchitecture of transition metal oxides has been deemed to play an important role in the supercapacitor electrode material. In this regard, transition metal (Ni, Mn, and Zn) doped Co3O4 has been synthesized using a facile co-precipitation technique. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the face-centered cubic lattice of Co3O4 with slight variation in lattice parameters when iso-valent metals are doped at the Co site. Densely packed spherical grains of pure Co3O4 with an average grain size of 50 nm are observed. However, the incorporation of a nominal amount of Ni, Mn, and Zn at Co-site resulted in a favorable porous morphology. Therefore increasing porosity with substitution and presence of constituent elements is noticed from the scanning electron microscope and elemental mapping, respectively. Electrochemical measurements including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are carried out in 4 M KOH solution in three-electrode systems. It has been observed that all electrode materials displayed typical pseudocapacitive dominant behavior but it is more obvious in Mn0.05Co2.95O4. This composition also exhibited the highest value of specific capacitance of 80.8 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Therefore, based on the calculated values of energy and power density we claim that the Mn0.05Co2.95O4 is a potential candidate for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
