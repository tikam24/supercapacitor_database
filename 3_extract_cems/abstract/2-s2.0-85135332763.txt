Ag-NiS material was synthesized by a facile and low cost effective process through hydrothermal method. The sulphide based nanomaterials revealed excellent pseudo-capacitance and great electrochemical stability because of their good mechanical stability and electrical conductivity. The reversibility of the charge discharge cycle has been optimized at the voltage range between 0 V and 0.75 V. The Ag infused NiS materials showed significantly higher specific capacitance in comparison to the pristine NiS. The specific capacitance of Ag-NiS and pristine NiS materials were calculated as 661F/g and 592F/g at the current density of 2 Agâˆ’1. The materials retained the cyclic stability for the recorded 2000 charge and discharge cycles. The integration of Ag in the NiS nanostructure of NiS enhanced the electronic conductivity thus the redox response of the NiS center has been improved. The Ag-incorporated NiS exhibited higher power density and energy density to pristine NiS. The symmetric infusion of the Ag, a metal has enhanced the charge transfer across the material resulted in the enhancement in the specific capacitance.
