Large offshore wind farms (OWFs), when connected to the onshore grids through the voltage source converter based HVDC (VSC-HVDC) transmission systems, do not provide inertia support for the onshore grid under the traditional control mode. Therefore, this paper proposes a supercapacitor-based coordinated inertia support (SCIS) strategy for the VSC-HVDC connected OWFs. Under the SCIS strategy, the DC side of each wind turbine is added with a supercapacitor. By varying the DC voltage of the supercapacitor the required inertia is emulated; at the onshore side the VSC of HVDC employs a DC voltage/frequency droop control to convey the onshore grid frequency to the wind farm side VSC through changing the HVDC voltage. Then the offshore frequency is regulated accordingly to ensure its coupling with the onshore frequency. Moreover, in this paper, the key parameters of the strategy are optimized through analyzing the small signal stability. Finally, a simulation model of the VSC-HVDC connected OWFs is established in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The SCIS strategy is verified and evaluated under three events: the onshore load changes, the wind speed changes and the onshore grid faults. The results show that the SCIS effectively emulates the inertia with the added supercapacitors in the wind turbines, providing the inertia support to the onshore grid through the VSC-HVDC and improving the frequency stability of the onshore grid significantly.
