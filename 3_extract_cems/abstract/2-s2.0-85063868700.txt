Activated carbon (AC) materials derived from the addition of graphene foam, carbon nanotube and expanded graphite mixed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were synthesized and then exposure to microwave irradiation and tested as electrodes for supercapacitor after the exposure time. Samples before radiation were designated as ACGF, ACCNT and ACEG when 100 mg of graphene foam (GF), carbon nanotube (CNT) and expanded graphite (EG) were added in a PVA/PVP solution, respectively. The microwave expanded AC obtained from ACEG (EACEG), shows the highest electrochemical capacitors performance with high discharge capacity compare to the other samples and non-expanded sample. The results shows that microwave irradiation exposure on material can have a significant change on increase the specific surface area (SSA) which in turn increases the capacity of the electrode materials. By increasing the active surface during microwave radiation, the discharge capacitance improved and shows more stability compare to the material before radiation. These results suggest that expanded carbon material with microwave radiation has a great potential for high-performance electrode in electrochemical energy storage applications.
