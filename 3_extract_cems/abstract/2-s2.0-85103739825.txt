The light-fostered supercapacitor performance introduces a new realm in the field of smart energy storage applications. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with direct band gap are intriguing candidates for developing a light-induced supercapacitor that can enhance energy storage when shined with light. Many TMDCs show a transition from a direct to indirect band gap as the layer number increases, while ReS2possesses a direct band gap in both bulk and monolayer forms. The growth of such multi-layered 2D materials with high surface area on conducting substrates makes them suitable for smart energy storage applications with the ability to tune their performance with light irradiation. In this report, we present the growth of vertically aligned multi-layered ReS2with large areal coverage on various conducting and non-conducting substrates, including stainless steelviachemical vapor deposition (CVD). To investigate the effect of light illumination on the charge storage performance, electrochemical measurements have been performed in dark and light conditions. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves showed an increase in the area enclosed by the curve, manifesting the increased charge storage capacity under light illumination as compared to dark. The volumetric capacitance value calculated from charging-discharging curves has increased from 17.9 F cm−3to 29.8 F cm−3with the irradiation of light for the as-grown ReS2on a stainless steel plate. More than 1.5 times the capacitance enhancement is attributed to excess electron-hole pairs generated upon light illumination, contributing to the charge storage in the presence of light. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further augments these results. The high cyclic stability is attained with a capacitance retention value of 81% even after 10 000 repeated charging-discharging cycles.
