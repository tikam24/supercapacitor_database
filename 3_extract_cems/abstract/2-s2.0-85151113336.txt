In this work, CuS, Cu7S4, Cu9S5, Cu7.2S4, and Cu2S with the same morphology were successfully synthesized by the hydrothermal method. According to the calculation, their galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves were 43.29 (CuS), 86.3 (Cu7S4), 154 (Cu9S5), 185.4 (Cu7.2S4), and 206.9 F/g (Cu2S) at the current density of 1 A/g. The results showed that the energy storage capacity of copper sulfide with the same morphology increased with the increase of the copper sulfide stoichiometric coefficient. At the second part of this work, the agglomerated cuprous sulfide and the microporous cuprous sulfide were successfully prepared, respectively. In addition, the porous spherical cuprous sulfide was annealed to get nano cuprous sulfide. It is found that the specific capacity of the agglomerated structure is the highest, which had reached 206.9 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, and 547.9 F/g at the current density of 10 A/g after activation.
