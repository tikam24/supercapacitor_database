The double-activated porous carbons (DAPCs) with unique bimodal pore structure were prepared by activating commercial microporous carbon (CMCs) twice through KOH (double activation) at high temperature. The as-prepared DAPCs show larger surface area (833 m2·g−1), and the pores are composed of micropores (size of ~1.8 nm) and mesopores (size of ~4.5 nm). Such special hierarchical porous structures integrate the dual advantages of micropore and mesopore, having not only the high energy storage of the micropores but also the high-rate performance of the mesopores for supercapacitors (SCs). As a result, the optimized DAPCs-3-1 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 277 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, enhanced rate performance of 197 F·g−1 at a high current density of 10 A·g−1, and excellent cycling stability with 94.2% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles in the 1 mol·L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte. The facile double activation could be a promising method to prepare suitable porous carbons with exceptional electrochemical properties for SCs.
