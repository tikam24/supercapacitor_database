To meet growing demands for energy consumptions in modern society, it is necessary to develop different energy sources. Renewable energy such as wind and solar sources are intermittent, therefore, energy storage devices become more and more important to store energy for use when no wind or no light. Supercapacitors play a key role in energy storage, mainly due to their high power density and long cycling life. However, supercapacitors are facing the obstacle of low energy density, one of the most intensive approaches is to rationally design new electrode materials. In this review, we focus on metal oxides-based materials and present an electronegativity criterion for the design and appropriate selection of new electrode chemical compositions. Metal elements with proper electronegativity scale have the potential to transfer electron for energy storage. Suitable positive and negative electrodes matching can enhance many properties of supercapacitors, which may overcome many related obstacles. Furthermore, electronegativity scale may also help people to find novel metal oxides based supercapacitors.
