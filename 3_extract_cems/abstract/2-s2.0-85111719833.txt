Polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized using oxidative polymerization in a mixture of water with pyrrolidinium hydrogen sulfate [Pyrr][HSO4], which is a protic ionic liquid PIL. The obtained PANI (PANI/PIL) was compared with conventional PANI (PANI/HCl and PANI/HSO4) in terms of their morphological, structural, and storage properties. The results demonstrate that the addition of this PIL to a polymerization medium leads to a fiber-like morphology, instead of a spherical-like morphology, of PANI/HSO4 or an agglomerated morphology of PANI/HCl. In addition, PAN/PIL exhibits an improvement of the charge transfer kinetic and storage capability in H2SO4 1 mol·L−1, compared to PANI/HCl. The combination of PANI/PIL and graphene oxide (GO), on the other hand, was investigated by optimizing the PANI/GO weight ratio to achieve the nanocomposite material with the best performance. Our results indicate that the PANI/PIL/GO containing 16 wt% of GO material exhibits a high performance and stability (223 F·g−1 at 10 A·g−1 in H2SO4 1 mol·L−1, 4.9 Wh·Kg−1, and 3700 W·Kg−1 @ 10 A·g−1). The obtained results highlight the beneficial role of PIL in building PANI and PANI/GO nanocomposites with excellent performances for supercapacitor ap-plications.
