It is crucial to develop high-performance electrode materials for the increasing energy demands of various energy storage systems. Biomass-derived carbons demonstrate great potential due to their rich structure, low cost, abundance in reserves, and excellent electrochemical performance. So far, various carbon structures ranging from highly disordered non-graphitic carbon to locally ordered graphite-like carbon have been achieved from different biomass. And they are employed as electrodes for different energy storage systems. However, to our best knowledge, there is no systematic review to show the latest progress in this area. Herein, we have systematically classified the waste biomass and discussed the microstructures of their derived carbons. In particular, as electrode materials, the effects of biomass-derived carbons' structure, porosity, interlayer spacing, and heteroatomic doping on different energy storage devices are analyzed in detail. Furthermore, the challenges, as well as the corresponding solutions and developing trends to biomass-derived carbons, have been summarized.
