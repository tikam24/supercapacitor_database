Herein, a high performance Ni-Fe composite nanowires array based supercapacitor anode was fabricated via electrochemical deposition using polycarbonate membrane. The synthesized nanowires demonstrate outstanding electrochemical performance with good specific capacitance of 1255.17 Fg-1 at 3 Ag-1 and 80% capacitive retention at the end of 5000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, an asymmetrical supercapacitor (Ni-Zn//Ni-Fe) was also fabricated that demonstrates 95.23% of capacitive retention after 2000 cycles. The fabricated supercapacitor device showed energy density of 63.62 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 0.64 KW kg-1. Further, the practical performance of a single asymmetrical supercapacitor device was demonstrated by lighting up a 2.2 V green LED. These results reveal the potential of the synthesized nanowires in potable energy storage gadgets.
