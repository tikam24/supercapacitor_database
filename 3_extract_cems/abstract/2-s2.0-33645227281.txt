Nano-thin polypyrrole (PPy) films were deposited on vapor grown carbon fibers (VGCF) by using an in situ chemical polymerization of the monomer in the presence of FeCl3 oxidant. An ultrasonic cavitational stream was used during polymerization of pyrrole, to enable the deposition of uniformly nano-thin PPy films on the surface of VGCF. The PPy/VGCF composite was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy. Surface morphology of the polymer films was characterized by using scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The capacitance of the composite electrodes was investigated with cyclic voltammetry. As results of this study, thinner layer of PPy in the composite electrode (< 10 nm) was effective to obtain fully reversible and very fast Faradaic reaction. Hence, most mass of the PPy could contribute to the pseudo-capacitive charge storage. This nano-thin PPy layer exhibited higher specific capacitance of ∼588 F g- 1 at 30 mV s- 1 and ∼545 F g- 1 at 200 mV s- 1 along with an excellent power capability. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
