Room temperature molten salts or ionic liquids are promising "solvent-free" electrolytes for high-voltage double layer supercapacitors. In this work, a novel binary room temperature molten salt electrolyte based on LiBOB and acetamide has been prepared. The electrolyte shows excellent thermal stability, high ionic conductivity and a wide electrochemical stability window, especially at higher temperatures. The temperature dependence of conductivity for the electrolytes follows the VFT equation, which demonstrates a solvent-assisted ionic conductivity mechanism. The EDLC with the LiBOB-acetamide complex electrolyte at molar ratio of 1:6 can be charged up to 2.5 V with better rate performance. The specific capacitance based on activated carbon electrodes can reach 103.1 F g-1. It is reasonable to assume that LiBOB-acetamide complex system has advantages as electrolyte for EDLCs with high energy density. Â© by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag,.
