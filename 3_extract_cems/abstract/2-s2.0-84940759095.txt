Three-dimensional (3D) network structure nickel bicarbonate/nickel foam (Ni(HCO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>/NF) composite was synthesized by a simple one-pot hydrothermal process. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared samples were investigated through the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. The results show that the specific capacitance of Ni(HCO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>/NF reaches up to 2128.57 F g<sup>-1</sup> (corresponding to a specific area capacitance of 7.45 F cm<sup>-2</sup>) at a current density of 2.5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, and the capacitance is still 876.19 F g<sup>-1</sup> (3.07 F cm<sup>-2</sup>) even at 50 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Considering the excellent electrochemical performances of Ni(HCO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>/NF electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni(HCO<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>/NF anode and Fe<inf>x</inf>C<inf>y</inf>/C cathode was assembled, which exhibited high energy density and power density. The maximum energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor is up to 24.96 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 87.75 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, besides, the power density can reach 1754.37 W kg<sup>-1</sup> at 6.92 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, two such 1 cm<sup>2</sup> devices connected in series could light five LED indicators (40 mW) after charging only 50 s, and power a LED indicator with the same power for half an hour after charging to 3.2 V. The results demonstrate that our asymmetric supercapacitor is a promising device for practical applications.
