A highly uniform porous 1-D nickel pyrophosphate (PNP) nanorods have been developed by a simple and green approach for the first time and served as excellent electrode materials for energy storage application. The as-prepared materials were characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM and cyclic voltammetry methods. The PNP materials have demonstrated good performance in capacitance, with a higher specific capacitance of 1517 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, good capacity retention (58%) at 5 A g−1, and excellent cyclic stability up to 3000 charge-discharge cycles (81.5%).
