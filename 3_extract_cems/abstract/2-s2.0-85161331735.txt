The efficiency of a supercapacitor depends heavily on the materials used to create its electrodes. Physicochemical properties have piqued interest in using transition metal molybdates as electrode materials in supercapacitors. Monodisperse CoMoO4 nanorods with a modest dimension (about 40–60 nm in width and 1.5–2 μm in length) were created on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Hybrid CoMoO4@rGO electrodes have shown exceptional electrochemical properties, especially when compared to pure CoMoO4 in an alkaline electrolyte. In particular, the maximum specific capacitance of CoMoO4@rGO is 1425 Fg−1 at a current density of 1Ag−1, while the greatest specific capacitance of CoMoO4 is 751 Fg−1 at the same current density. Both the pure and hybrid electrodes show excellent rate capability and long-term cyclic stability, even at high current densities of 20 Ag−1. Also, at a current density of 20 Ag−1, the constructed asymmetric supercapacitor generated a maximum power density of 4.5 kWkg−1, and at a current density of 1 Ag−1, it generated a high energy density of 51.2 Whkg−1. Based on their promising electrochemical performance, the hierarchical CoMoO4@rGO nanocomposites were discovered to provide for a promising electrode material in the creation of highly effective supercapacitors for power storage.
