The search for faster, safer, and more efficient energy storage systems continues to inspire researchers to develop new energy storage materials with ultrahigh performance. Mesoporous nanostructures are interesting for supercapacitors because of their high surface area, controlled porosity, and large number of active sites, which promise the utilization of the full capacitance of active materials. Herein, highly ordered mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanowires have been synthesized by nanocasting from a silica SBA-15 template. These nanowires exhibit superior pseudocapacitance of 1210 F g-1 in the initial cycles. Electroactivation of the electrode in the subsequent 250 cycles causes a significant increase in capacitance to 3080 F g-1. An asymmetric supercapacitor composed of mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanowires for the positive electrode and activated carbon for the negative electrode demonstrates an ultrahigh energy density of 42.8 Wh kg-1 with a power density of 15 kW kg-1 plus excellent cycle life. We also show that two asymmetric devices in series can efficiently power 5 mm diameter blue, green, and red LED indicators for 60 min. This work could lead to a new generation of hybrid supercapacitors to bridge the energy gap between chemical batteries and double layer supercapacitors.
