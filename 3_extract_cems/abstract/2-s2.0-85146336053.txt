In this work, conducting polymer modification on metal oxide surfaces was targeted to improve the composite conductivity and stability for electrochemical energy storage applications. Polyhedral cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was prepared using a molten salt combustion method and coated with polyaniline (PANI). The composite (PANI-CoM) was characterized using XRD, TGA, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, and BET. From cyclic voltammetry analysis in 6 M KOH, PANI-CoM shows a high CS (985 F/g) compared to bare Co3O4 (278 F/g), indicating that PANI coating has improved pseudocapacitive charge storability of the electrode. The electrolyte diffusion on the internal active surfaces has increased from 11% to 31%, contributed by the reduction of internal resistance by 29%. Activated carbon and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) were used to manufacture two sets of asymmetrical supercapacitor devices, and PANI-CoM/OMC functioned the best performance with an ED of 22 Wh/kg at a PD of 400 W/kg.
