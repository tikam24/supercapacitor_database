In this study, nanoporous pyropolymer nanosheets (NPNs) were fabricated from Citreae peels by simple pyrolysis with potassium hydroxide. The NPNs have a high specific surface area of 1522 m2 g−1, numerous nanometer-scale pores, a high electrical conductivity of 210 S cm−1, and a large amount of oxygen (19.4 wt.%) and nitrogen (3.4 wt.%) heteroatoms. These unique material properties lead to good electrochemical performance of NPNs as supercapacitor electrodes; they showed high specific capacitance of 330 F g−1, good rate capabilities (221 F g−1 to 60 A g−1), and stable cyclic performance for more than 20,000 cycles. This study provides information on the simple fabrication of sustainable and functional carbon-based materials containing numerous nanopores and redox-active heteroatoms. In addition, these materials demonstrate superior electrochemical performances as electrodes for supercapacitors.
