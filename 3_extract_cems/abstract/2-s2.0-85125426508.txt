Planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) as a promising energy storage device have been widely used in portable, wearable, and implantable electronics. However, the energy density is still limited by the plane configuration and relatively low loading of electrode active material. Here, we reported a facile approach to fabricate the interdigitated current collectors architecture by direct laser engraving of nickel (Ni) foams, followed by electrodeposition of pseudocapacitive materials for fabricating all-solid-state 3D MSCs devices. The fabricated hybrid AMSC (Ni foam-MnO2//Ni foam-PPy) presented a large areal capacitance of 59.29 mF/cm2 at 1 V/s and excellent capacity retention of 95.6% after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, the hybrid Ni foam-based AMSC exhibited a high areal energy density range from 42.99 to 77.94 Î¼Wh/cm2 with a corresponding power density range from 0.272 to 6.818 mW/cm2. This prototype of laser-assisted all-solid-state AMSC demonstrates the potential of Ni foam-based energy storage devices applications for 3D MSCs that require high energy density.
