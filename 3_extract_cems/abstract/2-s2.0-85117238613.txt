With the increase of the mileage and shift of high-speed railway in China, the braking power and energy fed back to the power grid by high-speed railway locomotive when braking is increasing. In order to make full use of this energy, a hybrid energy storage system based on super capacitors and lithium-ion batteries and its optimal configuration method are proposed in order to obtain the maximum economic benefits. Firstly, the mathematical model of hybrid energy storage system is established. Secondly, the economic optimization model of daily operation cost of high-speed railway traction power supply system is established. Taking the lowest cost as the optimization objective, the energy storage configuration scheme is optimized by using the mixed integer linear programming method. Finally, taking the actual load of a domestic high-speed railway station as an example, the results show that the economic benefit is the highest when the hybrid energy storage system is used to partially absorb regenerative braking energy, and the total daily cost is saved by 3%.
