The highly wrinkled and porous nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) is prepared through a simple microwave irradiation reaction from graphene oxide (GO) and ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). Microwave irradiation reaction with solvent assisted bubbling nitrogen source facilitates a safe-gram scale, nitrogen doped and porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The nitrogen doped amount and surface area of NrGO is increased as the reaction ratio of NH4OH. The highly nitrogen doped and porous NrGO exhibits superior capacitance performance.
