This review investigates the electrochemical energy storage electrode (EESE) as the most important part of the electrochemical energy storage devices (EES) prepared from fruit-derived carbon. The EES devices include batteries, supercapacitors, and hybrid devices that have various regular and advanced applications. The preparation of EESE from fruit wastes not only reduce the price of the electrode but also lead to enhance the electrochemical properties of the electrode. The astonishing results of fruits biochar at electrochemical analyses guarantee the performance of these electrodes as EESE. Also, using fruit waste as the precursor of the EESE due to protect the environment and reduce environmental pollutions.
