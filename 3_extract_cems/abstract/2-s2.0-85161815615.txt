Natural rotten wood is an excellent precursor to prepare porous carbon. Cellulose carbon of rotten wood (RWCC) has been prepared through carbonizing cellulose extracted from rotten wood followed by ZnCl2 activation. RWCC exhibits a large specific surface area (SSA) of 1714.27 m2 g11 and uniform microporous structure. RWCC shows a high specific capacitance of 350 F g11 at 1 A g11 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Fungi-assisted method is low-cost and efficient for preparing porous carbon-based electrode materials.
