The glass–ceramic nanocomposites, based on 18.75Na2O–18.75Li2O–37.5P2S5–25V2S5 mol% glass, were successfully fabricated via heat treatment (HT) process at 405 °C for various times in the midair. The effects of HT time and nanostructure on the electrochemical performance for the glass–ceramic nanocompositions electrodes were examined by using DSC, XRD, TEM, FESEM, and electrochemical techniques, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The crystallite size was between 37 and 50 nm. FESEM morphologies displayed no uniform particles, which change with a difference of HT time. Benefiting from the existence of nanostructure in the glass–ceramic nanocompositions, the electrodes show a high specific capacitance up to 227.36 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (based on the glass–ceramic nanocomposition heat treated for 20 h, which has the smallest crystallite size) and outstanding cycling stability (94% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). In addition, the glass–ceramic nanocomposition electrode heat treated for 20 h demonstrated a higher energy density of 31.58 Wh kg˗1 at 500 W kg˗1. Thus, the outstanding performance of this fabricated glass–ceramic nanocomposition electrodes have delivered a suitable design strategy for improving high-performance supercapacitors.
