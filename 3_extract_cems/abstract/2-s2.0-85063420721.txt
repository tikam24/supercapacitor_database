Electrospinning of polymers blends solutions offers the potential to produce nanofibers for using in a variety of applications. Here, we report the synthesis of nanofibers with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and activated carbon (AC) composite by employing this technique. As-produced material is an electrical conductive and high-surface material electrode with outstanding electrochemical properties, which we explore electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) coin cell devices. Our results show that EDLCs manufactured with PAN/AC composite have fairly high specific capacitance, low internal impedance and high lifetime. All these results encourage further development of PAN/AC materials as electrode for EDLCs and Li- Air batteries devices. This new generation of devices are opening niches of applications on multi-millionaire markets such as electric vehicles & solar and wind power systems.
