Graphene hydrogels with high electrical conductivity were prepared by a one-step process using hydrazine hydrate as gel assembly agent (GH-HD). Conventional two-step process of gel formation and further reduction to prepare highly conducting gels was replaced by a single step involving equivalent amount of hydrazine. Optimized graphene oxide concentration was established to facilitate such monolith formation. Extensive characterization and control studies enabled understanding of the material properties and gel formation mechanism. The synthesized gel shows a high electrical conductivity of 1141 S/m. The supercapacitor based on GH-HD delivers a high specific capacitance of 190 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and 123 F/g at very high current density of 100 A/g. Furthermore, excellent power capability and cyclic stability were also observed. 3D macroporous morphology of GH-HD makes it ideal for high rate supercapacitor applications.
