Recently conducting polymers have attracted great interest for supercapacitor applications. Among conducting polymers polypyrrole is most popular due to its unique electrical conductivity, optoelectrical properties, redox property and excellent environmental stability. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of polypyrrole and polypyrrole based nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications. We have included study of various parameters like power density, energy density, specific-capacitance by various authors for different kinds of nanocomposites where fillers are metal oxides, metal sulphides, graphene etc. Some polypyrrole nanocomposits show good electrochemical performances. The extremely stable supercapacitors with excellent flexibility and scalability hold considerable promise for the commerical application of flexible and wearable electronics.
