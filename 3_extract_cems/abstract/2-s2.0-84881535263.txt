In this study, flower-shaped NiO/-Ni(OH)2hybrid structures were synthesized by a solvothermalprocess. The microstructure, surface morphology, and surface area of the synthesized materials werecharacterized by XRD, SEM, and BET. It was discovered that this unique hybrid structure exhibits outstand-ing capacitive performance in basic electrolyte. From galvanostatic charge-discharge test, the hybridcomposite itself demonstrates a solid capacitance value of 707 F/g at 2 A/g and 474 F/g at a high dischargerate of 10 A/g. In order to further improve the performance and the capacitance retention with enhancedcurrent density, carbon nanomaterials were used as supports for the NiO/-Ni(OH) 2hybrid. These carbonnanomaterials are believed to form conductive network around NiO/-Ni(OH)2flowers. The effects of 4different carbon nanomaterial supports, including carbon black, carbon nanotubes, and graphene, werethoroughly investigated, and specifically the addition of single-walled carbon nanotubes to the compos-ite significantly enhanced the performance to 810 F/g at a high current discharge of 10 A/g. Moreover,this carbon supported hybrid composite exhibits an impressive specific power density of 7200 W/kg anda steady energy density of 21 W h/kg. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
