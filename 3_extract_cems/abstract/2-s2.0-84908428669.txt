A composite electrode comprising of flower-like zinc sulfide/titania nanotube has been synthesized through an electrodeposition technique for supercapacitor application. The morphology and phase evolution of the electrode were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The cyclic voltammetry studies of the electrode indicated that a high specific capacitance (226 F g-1) can be achieved in the electrode together with high stability during large charging conditions.
