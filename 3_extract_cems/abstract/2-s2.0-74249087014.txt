Amorphous hydrous ruthenium oxide was prepared by a chemical precipitation method. Two ruthenium oxide samples with different contents of Na and Cl impurities were obtained by changing the number of times for washing sediments with distilled water. The experiment results showed that the Na and Cl impurities exist as hydrated Na+ and hydrated Cl-, respectively. Sample W 5 (sufficiently washed 5 times with distilled water during its preparation) has lower content of Na+ and Cl+ impurities in comparison with sample W_1 (insufficiently washed once with distilled water during its preparation). Cyclic voltammetric measurements indicate that the specific capacitance and power performance of W_5 are all higher than that of W_1. Hydrated Na+ and Cl- impurities not only decrease the specific capacitance of ruthenium oxide, but degrade the power performance. The reason for the deleterious effect of hydrated Na+ and Cl- impurities on the super-capacitive properties is discussed.
