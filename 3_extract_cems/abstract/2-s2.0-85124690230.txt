Energy storage system (ESS) is a critical component in all-electric ships (AESs). However, an improper size and management of energy storage system will deteriorate the technical and economic performance of the shipboard microgrids. In this paper, a joint optimization scheme is developed for ESS sizing and optimal power management for the whole shipboard power system. Different from traditional ESS sizing methods, which solve a minimum cost problem, a novel coordinated framework is proposed to jointly optimize the ESS size and voyage route for an AES, considering the time-dependent electricity price of onshore power. The main goals of this method are to reduce the capital and operational cost, GHG emissions and navigation time. Furthermore, the dynamic electricity prices are adopted to assist ship operators to select the optimal voyage routine. Several cases are compared to verify the proposed algorithm and numeral simulation results clearly demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method and necessity of navigation route scheduling.
