Recovering high value-added resources from waste activated sludge (WAS) is a potential way for the sustainable wastewater treatment. In this study, hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C was used to simultaneously improve sludge dewaterability and recover sludge organic matters (SOMs). The recovered SOMs were subsequently employed as precursors to prepare nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets via a facile stepwise synthesis method. The as-prepared optimal carbon (AP-SOM800) was characterized with an ultrahigh specific surface area (3473 m2/g), appropriate porosity (1.77 cm3/g), and abundant heteroatoms (1.47% N and 7.44% O). AP-SOM800 exhibited a high specific capacitance (409 F/g at 0.25 A/g), low resistance (0.52 Ω), and superior cyclic stability (only 9.09% loss after 10,000 cycles) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Furthermore, AP-SOM800 demonstrated an extraordinary adsorption capacity (1528 mg/g for methyl orange (MO) and 1265 mg/g for tetracycline (TC)) that can be maintained (˃ 1200 mg/g) over a wide range of pH conditions. Specifically, 80.97% of MO and 66.67% of TC were rapidly absorbed through AP-SOM800 within 10 min, and 90.27% of MO and 81.24% of TC were eventually removed from wastewater after 60 min. The adsorption processes fit closely with the pseudo-second-order kinetic (R2 > 0.999) and Langmuir models (R2 > 0.914), revealing that the adsorption processes were dominated by a monolayer chemical adsorption reaction. This study suggests that high value-added materials can be obtained from the WAS through improving and extending the traditional sludge treatment processes, which will enrich the technical options available for future sustainable sludge treatment and disposal.
