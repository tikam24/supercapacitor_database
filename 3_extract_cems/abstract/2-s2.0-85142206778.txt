Energy is an unseen component of the worldâ€™s development and expansion. Energy storage, in addition to supplying energy from primary or secondary energy sources, such as renewables, is an important consideration. In order to meet, the demand for high-energy storage devices has grown globally as a result of rising energy consumption, and research into electrode materials for supercapacitor use has progressed. Various types of carbon-based materials have been used as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications over the years. Graphene is one of the most extensively used carbon-based materials due to its unique properties, which include a high surface area and great conductivity. To take advantage of more of its intriguing features, graphene is customised to make graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide, which have better water dispersibility and are easy to combine with other materials to form binary or even ternary composites. Due to the fact that binary composites cannot meet the requirements of a high-performance supercapacitor, ternary composites have sparked a lot of attention recently. As a result, a variety of ways have been used to create ternary composites for high-performance supercapacitor applications by combining three different types of electroactive materials. The supercapacitive performance of graphene-based ternary composites with various active components, such as conducting polymers, metal oxide, and other carbon-based materials, is the subject of this research. The performance of graphene-based composites as electrodes in supercapacitors has been greatly improved. This article discusses the synthesis, graphene based supercapacitor electrode materials as well as the application of graphene based nanocomposites as supercapacitor application.
