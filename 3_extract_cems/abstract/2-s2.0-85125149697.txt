Two-dimensional inorganic borophene nanosheets based nanoformulations obtain great attention in energy storage applications for the development of supercapacitors due to their superior flexibility, high capacitance, and conductivity properties. Herein, the preparation of a novel poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) / β12 Borophene nanocomposite electroactive material using a simple-solution approach at room temperature has been demonstrated. Borophene with β12 phase crystalline structure has been prepared via a facile and low-cost sonication method to be used in (PEDOT: PSS) / β12 Borophene inorganic-organic hybrid electrode production. The electrochemical measurements have revealed that the specific capacitances of PEDOT: PSS electrode, PEDOT: PSS / Borophene (75/25, wt%) electrode, and PEDOT: PSS / Borophene (50/50, wt%) electrode were 230 Fg−1, 622 Fg−1, 853 Fg−1, respectively. The capacitance retention of the PEDOT: PSS / Borophene (50% Borophene) electrode was 95% after 1000 cycle, it revealed that the PEDOT: PSS / Borophene electrodes have good stability PEDOT: PSS / Borophene (50/50, wt%) is a potential electroactive nanomaterial for high-performance supercapacitors.
