Nowadays, waste tires bring the world increasing environmental and economic issues. Although pyrolysis seems to be a feasible process, a proper application of generated residues needs to be solved urgently. In this work, activated carbons (ACs) derived from the industrial pyrolytic tire char were first evaluated as potential electrode materials for supercapacitor. The obtained ACs display good eletrochemical properties, with initial specific capacitance of about 200 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, long cycling life, low equivalent series resistance and relaxation time, which indicate the ACs are suitable for supercapacitor.
