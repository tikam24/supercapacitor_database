Porous carbon materials are synthesized from pomelo valves by the hydrothermal activation of H3PO4 followed by simple carbonization. The as-synthesized hierarchically porous carbon electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 966.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an ultra-high stability of 95.6% even after 10 000 cycles. Moreover, the supercapacitor also demonstrates a maximum energy of 36.39 W h kg-1 and a maximum power of 33.33 kW kg-1 with an energy retention of 25.56 W h kg-1, which paves the way for the development of high-performance, green supercapacitors for advanced energy storage systems.
