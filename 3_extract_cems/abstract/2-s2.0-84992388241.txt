In this paper, we successfully designed and synthesized Co3S4/NiS nanoplates by both ion-exchange action and Ostwald ripening reactions during the sulfurization process. As asymmetric supercapacitor electrode material, Co3S4/NiS exhibited an ultra-high specific capacitance of 1810 mF cm-2 at a current density of 4 mA cm-2, 12 times larger than the pristine Co3O4 electrode, as well as good rate capability and excellent cycling stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on Co3S4/NiS can work steadily at a voltage of 1.6 V and deliver a high energy density of 6.44 W h m-2 at a high power density of 32 W m-2. Moreover, we applied this device to successfully light light-emitting-diodes in a simulated solar illumination system. The perfect integration of two types of capacitor materials into Co3S4/NiS satisfies the requirements of high energy density supercapacitor. Co3S4/NiS nanoplates may have practical applications in the field of energy storage.
