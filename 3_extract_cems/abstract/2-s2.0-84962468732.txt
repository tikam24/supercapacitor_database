Conductive polymers are usually used as an electrode in redox supercapacitor. However, due to accumulation of stress on polymer during repeating charge-discharge process, the cycle life of pure conductive polymer is poor, which needs to be further improved. For this purpose, combining conventional conductive polymers active material and nanomaterials to fabricate hybrid electrode has been considered to be one of the efficient avenues. In this paper, a simple and rapid electrochemical method has been carried out to prepare Eu2O3 nanoparticles and hybrid POAP/Eu2O3 to serve as the active electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. Structural and morphological characterisations of Eu2O3 and composite film were carried out using powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion of X-rays. Their electrochemical properties were also investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-prepared composites had excellent properties in the specific capacitance and a coulombic efficiency of 95%. The as-prepared composites had excellent properties in the capacitance, and its specific capacitance was up to 375 F g-1 and a coulombic efficiency of 95%. This work introduces new nanocomposite materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with advantages including ease synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
