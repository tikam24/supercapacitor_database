A facile hydrolysis method was applied to fabricate high-performance Co-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanocages/graphene composites for supercapacitors. The materials exhibit enhanced rate capability than the counterpart electrode free of graphene while maintaining a high specific capacitance. In addition, such Co-LDH nanocages/graphene composites display an excellent cycling stability; the capacitance retention of Co-LDH nanocages/graphene composite electrode remains 90.4% after 10000 cycles at a current density of 2 A gâˆ’1. The integration of high capacity of double hydroxide and outstanding conductivity of graphene makes the delicately-designed composites promising candidates for electrode materials for supercapacitors.
