Porous network nanostructures have been demonstrated as one of the most ideal electrode materials in energy storage systems due to their advantages of both microstructures and their high surface area. In this study, a facile electrospinning method with subsequent heat treatments is employed to firstly prepare a CuCo2O4 network structure. The CuCo2O4 network electrode delivers a remarkable areal capacitance of 443.9 mF cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. The electrode also presents excellent cyclic stability of 90% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 1 mA cm-2. We have successfully fabricated a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor based on the CuCo2O4 network nanostructure and active carbon as positive and negative materials, respectively. The assembled novel asymmetric supercapacitor device with an extended operating voltage window of 1.5 V exhibits excellent performance such as a high energy density of 0.806 mW h cm-3 and good rate capability. The high-performance nanostructured CuCo2O4 has significant potential applications in electrical vehicles.
