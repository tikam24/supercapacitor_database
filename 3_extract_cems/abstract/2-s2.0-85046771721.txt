In this paper, three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon framework (CF) is prepared using commercial sponge as template and furfuryl alcohol (C5H6O2) as carbon source, through polymerizing and solidifying by oxalic acid (H2C2O4) followed by a carbonizing process at high temperature. Then, one-demensional (1D) polyaniline (PANI) nanowires are deposited on the CF substrate by a simple one-step electrodeposition method to obtain CF-PANI energy storage electrode. The CF-PANI maintains initial 3D porous structure as CF substrate with PANI layer, benefiting for the diffusion of electrolyte and the contact between active material and electrolyte. Besides, the carbon skeleton is surrounded by the PANI nanowires, which provide more transfer channels for electrons during the charge/discharge process. The loading mass of PANI on CF is as high as 21.3 mg cm−3, and the gravimetric and volumetric capacitances reach 866 F g−1 and 18.5 F cm−3, respectively, at the scan rate of 2 mV s−1. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on CF-PANI as anode electrode and CF as cathode electrode exhibits a high energy density of 44 W h kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1, indicating its promising applications as the electrode material for supercapacitors.
