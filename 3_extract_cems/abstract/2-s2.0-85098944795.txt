Different strategies have been reported to prepare electrode matrices to enhance the performance of electrochemical energy storage systems. In this work, electrode composite materials have been developed, combining intrinsic conductive polymers (ICP) such a polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy) into two different porous matrix, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and cellulose. With the aim to improve the cycling stability of the electrode materials, a thin coating of polydopamine (PDA) was applied, providing enhanced anchoring properties. Cellulosic and PVDF membranes are decorated by homogeneously distributed globular nanoparticles of PDA, PANI or PPy, resulting from the in-situ polymerization. Nanocomposites are characterized by good electrochemical performance owing to the large electrochemical active area and high structural stability benefiting from the synergetic effects between the substrate and PDA/PANI/PPy chains. A maximum capacity of 32 F·g−1 is achieved for cellulose based composites (scan rate of 10 mV·s−1). Composites are able to retain 96% of their initial capacity after 250 cycles, indicating an efficient doping/dedoping process. These results highlight the potential of cellulosic and PVDF membranes to fabricate flexible and hand-held energy storage materials.
