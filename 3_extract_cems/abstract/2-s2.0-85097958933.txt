In this article, binder-free TiO2 nanofiber-based electrodes have been fabricated via fast, cost-effective, and environmental-friendly electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique on a graphite substrate for energy storage devices such as supercapacitor for low-power electronic applications. The experimental studies confirm that the surface morphology of the fabricated electrodes is greatly dependent on the EPD voltage, which is one of the key factors, which controls the electrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanofibers-based electrodes. The binder-free, TiO2 nanofiber-based electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 408 Fg-1 ± 5 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 current density. The fabricated electrode shows a higher diffusion coefficient ∼ 2.81 × 10-10, which facilitates an easy diffusion of electrolytic ions inside the sample and a very small relaxation time constant ( τo = 98 ms), which allows the system to deliver its energy in a quick manner. Moreover, the fabricated electrode retains 85 % of its initial capacitance value after 1000 successive cycles. It can be believed that the reported EPD technique can be used to fabricate the electrodes for energy storage devices for portable low-power electronic applications.
