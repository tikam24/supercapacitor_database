Although coupling highly pseudocapacitive species with flexible carbon substrates to fabricate hybrid electrodes holds promise for high-performance flexible supercapacitors, the structural collapse and performance degradation under repeated mechanical deformation remain a bottleneck to be tackled owing to the weak binding force between carbon and electroactive materials. Herein, well-controlled three-dimensional (3D) NS@NCCH tree-like core-shell microarrays grown on flexible and conductive Ni-plated carbon cloth (NPCC) are fabricated, with NiSe (NS) nanorods as the core and NiCo(CO3)(OH)2(NCCH) nanosheets as the shell. The dense NS nanorod corein situgrown on NPCC, as a highly conductive and robust support, promotes electron transport as well as hindering the agglomeration of NCCH nanosheets. The NCCH nanosheet shell with a high specific surface area provides a bridge to combine the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions and ionic accessibility to the overall electrode surface. The synergistic contributions from the NPCC substrate and the core-shell NS@NCCH microarrays together with the natural gift of a 3D tree-like architecture enable the NS@NCCH/NPCC electrode to exhibit a high capacity of 6.89 F cm−2(1642 F g−1, 228 mA h g−1) at 4 mA cm−2and good rate performance. Furthermore, an assembled flexible all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (FASSAS) based on the NS@NCCH/NPCC electrode retains an energy density of 53.8 W h kg−1at a high power density of 15 kW kg−1and exhibits excellent cycling stability with 91.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Especially, bending or twisting the FASSAS device to 180° causes negligible electrochemical property attenuation.
