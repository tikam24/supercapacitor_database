Nanosized manganese oxide (MnO2) is a widely studied material for electrochemical capacitors because of the high specific surface area and excellent electrochemical properties leading to improved rate capability and enhanced energy/power densities. Most of the research on MnO2 is aimed at improving the capacitance whereas only a few studies are focused on cycling stability of these electrodes. In this work, degradation in capacitance of arrays of gold core nanowire encapsulated within a hemicylindrical shell of MnO2 is studied. Raman spectroscopy experiments performed on a single core/shell nanowire indicated changes in spectral shifts of the prominent Raman modes for Î´-MnO2 as well as changes in the intensity of these modes.
