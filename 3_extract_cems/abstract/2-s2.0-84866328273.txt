In this article, we briefly summarized our recent work on the studies of crystallization and functionality of inorganic materials. On the basis of the chemical bonding theory of single crystal growth, we can quantitatively simulate Cu 2O crystallization processes in solution system. We also kinetically controlled Cu 2O crystallization process in the reduction solution route. Lithium ion battery and supercapacitor performances of some oxides such as Co 3O 4 and MnO 2 were shown to elucidate the important effect of crystallization on functionality of inorganic materials. This work encourages us to create novel functionalities through the study of crystallization of inorganic materials, which warrants more chances in the field of functional materials.
