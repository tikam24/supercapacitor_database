The electrochemical performances of 3D flowerlike PEDOT are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It shows high specific capacitance of 111 F g -1, which is greatly higher than that of 1D PEDOT nanofibers we reported before. In addition, on the basis of this PEDOT matrix, 3D flowerlike PEDOT/MnO2 composite is synthesized by a two-step approach as a high-property supercapacitor electrode material. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy show that 3D PEDOT matrix is kept well and decorated well by MnO2 nanoparticles (2-5 nm). And the capacitive performances are tested as well. The specific capacitance of this composite can highly reach around 183 F g-1, and retain more than 90% of the original value after 1000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles. These results indicate that the 3D flowerlike PEDOT/MnO2 composite possesses a synergy effect of complementary properties of both components, which results in higher specific capacitance and better stability.
