High performance, flexible graphene electrode on PET (In2O3/Au/Ag on PET) substrate prepared through potentiodynamic reduction of graphene oxide in neutral medium shows enhanced specific capacitance and cyclic stability in supercapacitor application. The specific capacitance achieved for flexible graphene electrode is 787.37 Fgâˆ’1 with a cyclic stability of more than 1000 cycles. The supercapacitance performance of graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide on PET is compared with that on FTO substrate. The attained specific capacitance and cyclic stability for reduced graphene oxide on FTO is respectively 479.65 Fg-1and 500. The factors that contribute to the enhanced performance of PET based flexible graphene electrode are (i) better interfacial adhesion between graphene and substrate (ii) the application of a widened potential window and (iii) the more porous nature of the graphene electrode.
