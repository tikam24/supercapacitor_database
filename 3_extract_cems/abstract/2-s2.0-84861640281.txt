A new well-aligned nanofibers structure of polypyrrole (WAPPy) has been successfully grown on glassy carbon electrode by using a simple, reliable, and template-free electrochemical technique. The unique structure and design not only reduces the diffusion resistance of electrolytes in the electrode material but also enhances its electrochemical performance. Electrochemical supercapacitors based on WAPPy achieved a specific capacitance of 365 F g -1 with an applied charge/discharge current density of 1 A g -1 over a potential window of -0.5 to 0.5 V. For comparison, the granules PPy particles have been also electrochemical synthesized by using KCl as electrolyte (PPy-Cl). The specific capacitance of PPy-Cl electrode is 120 F g -1. The high specific capacitance and good stability of the WAPPy electrode has great potential in various applications such as energy storage. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
