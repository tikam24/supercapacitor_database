In this study, activated carbon nanofibers (ACNFs) were prepared for supercapacitor electrode applications by using nanosize polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers as a precursor, following treatments under various activation conditions. The surface morphologies and structural characteristics of the ACNF were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. The N2 adsorption isotherm characteristics at 77K were confirmed by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) equations. The mesopore size distributions of the samples were obtained by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) equation. The ACNFs were applied as an electrode for electrical double-layer capacitors and analyzed in relation to the activation conditions. SEM analysis confirmed that many pores or excessively-oxidized structures were found on the fiber surfaces after KOH activation. The specific surface areas and specific capacitance of the prepared ACNFs were enhanced with increasing activation time.
