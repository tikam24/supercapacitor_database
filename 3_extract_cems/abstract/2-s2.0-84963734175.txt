In this work, reduced graphene oxide/boron doped zinc oxide (RGO/ZnO:B) composites were fabricated by a hydrothermal process and their electrochemical properties were investigated as a function of dopant concentration. First, boron doped ZnO (ZnO:B) particles was fabricated with different boron concentrations (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) and then ZnO:B particles were embedded into RGO sheets. The physical properties of sensitized composites were characterized by XRD and SEM. Characterization indicated that the ZnO:B particles with plate-like structure in the composite were dispersed on graphene sheets. The electrochemical properties of the RGO/ZnO:B composite were investigated through cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance values of RGO/ZnO:B electrodes increase with increasing boron concentration. RGO/ZnO:B composite electrodes (20 wt% B) display the specific capacitance as high as 230.50 F/g at 5 mV/s, which is almost five times higher than that of RGO/ZnO (52.71 F/g).
