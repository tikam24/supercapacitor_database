Pure and Cr-doped Mn3O4 thin films have been successfully prepared by the SILAR method. The prepared films' microstructural, morphological and electrochemical behaviours were analyzed by various techniques such as, XRD, TEM, SEM, FT-Raman and FTIR. The electrochemical characteristics of the prepared films for supercapacitor electrode in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution were analyzed via cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The XRD patterns reveal the Mn3O4 has a polycrystalline nature with the tetragonal phase. The presence of the functional group and the formation of the pure and Cr doped Mn3O4 were confirmed by FTIR and FT-Raman spectroscopy. A morphological investigation of SEM and TEM confirms the nanoneedle like structure. The electrochemical studies were carried out for all the samples. The 3 wt% Cr-doped Mn3O4 electrode exhibited the 181 F g−1 specific capacitance at the current density of 1 A g−1.
