Nano- and micro- structured Nickel oxide (NiO) were fabricated through electrospinning and hydrothermal approaches. It is found that the obtained NiO through electrospinning and hydrothermal method exhibit single-phase cubic crystal structure and well-aligned nanofibers and microspheres, respectively. Furthermore, their photocatalytic and electrochemical activities were systematically carried out and discussed in detail.
