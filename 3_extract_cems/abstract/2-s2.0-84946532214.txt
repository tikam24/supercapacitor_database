With increasing demands for clean and sustainable energy, the advantages of high power density, high efficiency, and long life expectancy have made supercapacitors one of the major emerging devices for electrochemical energy storage and power supply. However, one of the key challenges for SCs is their limited energy density, which has hindered their wider application in the field of energy storage. Despite significant progress has been achieved in the fabrication of high-energy density positive electrodes materials, negative electrode materials with high capacitance and a wide potential window are relatively less explored. In this review, we introduced some new negative electrode materials except for common carbon-based materials and what’s more, based on our team’s work recently, we put forward some new strategies to solve their inherent shortcoming as electrode material for SCs.
