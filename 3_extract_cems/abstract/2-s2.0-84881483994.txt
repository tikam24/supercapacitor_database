Three dimensional manganese dioxide/Pt/nickel foam (shortened to MnPtNF) hybrid electrodes were prepared by double-pulse polarization and potentiostatic deposition technologies for supercapacitor applications. The decoration of Pt nanoparticles onto nickel foam varies the nucleation mechanism of the manganese dioxide species, inducing the formation of manganese dioxide nanosheets. Additionally, controlling the size of the Pt nanoparticles leads to modulated nanosheet architecture and electrochemical properties of the manganese dioxide electrode, as revealed by XRD, Raman spectra, SEM, TEM, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanosheet architecture of the MnPtNF electrode favors the transportation of electrons and ions, which results in the enhanced electrochemical properties. Importantly, the optimized MnPtNF electrode obtains a maximum specific capacitance of 1222 F g-1 at 5 A g-1 (89% of the theoretical specific capacitance of MnO2) and 600 F g-1 at 100 A g-1. Moreover, the presence of Pt nanoparticles in the MnO2 electrode effectively improves its cycling stability, which is confirmed by the increase of the specific capacitance retention from 14.7% to 90% after 600 cycles.
