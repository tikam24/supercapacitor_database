An ionic liquid (IL) incorporated in a quasi-solid-state electrolyte (ILQSE) is prepared using 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF4) and poly (ethylene glycol dimethacrylayte) (PEGDMA) for high-temperature application of supercapacitors. The prepared ILQSE displays a thermal stability up to 150 Â°C and the supercapacitors exhibit a specific capacitance of 134 F g-1,.
