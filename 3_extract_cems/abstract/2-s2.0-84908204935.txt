Mechanical stability of electrolyte in all-solid-state supercapacitor attains immense attention as it addresses safety aspects. In this study, we have demonstrated, the fabrication of stretchable supercapacitor based on stretchable electrolyte and hydrogen exfoliated graphene electrode. We synthesized ionic liquid incorporated stretchable Poly(methyl methacrylate) electrolyte which plays dual role as electrolyte and stretchable support for electrode material. The molecular vibration studies show composite nature of the electrolyte. At least four-fold stretchability has been observed along with good ionic conductivity (0.78 mS cm-1 at 28°C) for this polymer electrolyte. This stretchable supercapacitor shows a low equivalent series resistance (16 Ω) due to the compatibility at electrode-electrolyte interface. The performance of the device has been determined under strain as well.
