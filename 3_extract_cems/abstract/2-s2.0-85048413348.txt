In order to prevent the agglomeration and effective utilization of surface area of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets for supercapacitor electrode, layered molybdenum disulfide/ reduced graphene oxide (MoS2/rGO) nanocomposite has been synthesized by layer-by-layer self-assembly of positively charged MoS2 nanosheets with negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) nanosheet followed by vacuum-drying and hydrothermal reduction of GO. Ternary MoS2-rGO@PPyNTs nanocomposites were obtained by combining pre-synthesized Polypyrrole nanotubes (PPyNTs) with layered MoS2-GO followed by in-situ hydrothermal reduction of GO. The porous layered structure of MOS2-rGO nanocomposite provides enormous surface area, enhanced electronic conductivity and additional electro-active sites. MoS2-PPyNTs, rGO-PPyNTs and PPyNTs electrodes were also prepared and compared their electrochemical performance with the ternary electrode. The synergetic effect of layer-by-layer assembly of MoS2 and rGO nanosheets with PPyNTs imparts immense electrochemical activity with an extraordinary specific capacitance of 1561.25 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The ternary nanocomposite possess energy density and power density of 555 W h kg-1 and 800 W kg-1, respectively at 1-fold current density in the potential range −0.3 to 1.3 V. MoS2-rGO@PPyNTs/ITO ternary electrode also possesses cycling stability of 72% of initial specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 10-fold current density.
