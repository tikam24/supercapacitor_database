Due to inherent volatility and intermittence, the increasing penetration of distributed renewable energies brings significant voltage deviation problem in active distribution network. In this paper, a novel two-stage distributionally robust optimization (TSDRO) strategy of hybrid energy storage systems is proposed for voltage regulation in active distribution network. The prediction errors of distributed renewable generation with different time-scales are considered in constructing Wasserstein ambiguity sets. In the first stage, distributed battery energy storage systems are scheduled day-ahead in distributionally robust optimization with chance constraints. In the second stage, model predictive control is utilized to roll optimize the intraday charging/discharging strategy of the supercapacitor energy storage systems. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed TSDRO strategy.
