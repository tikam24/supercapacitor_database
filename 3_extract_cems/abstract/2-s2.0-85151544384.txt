Self-supported carbon electrodes have been intensively explored in the fields of materials chemistry, energy storage, and conversion due to the unique features of carbon materials. Herein, we report a facile strategy to construct a freestanding carbon membrane (CM) electrode consisting of a microfiltration CM and two-dimensional (2D) ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets (NSs), which is successfully applied as an efficient and binder-free carbon electrode in the electrochemical applications of enzyme-free glucose detection and supercapacitors. Owing to the inherent structural merits, including the three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous network in the membrane, structural integrity, high conductivity, and the well-dispersed and in situ growth of 2D Co3O4 NSs, the obtained Co3O4 NSs/CM demonstrated superior electrochemical performances and excellent long-term operation stability. Our present work paves the path to fabricate low-cost and efficient carbon electrodes with a rational structure design for multifunctional materials.
