Combining hybrid polymeric platforms with laser-assisted reduced graphene oxide (LArGO) could bridge the gap between a battery and supercapacitor device, overshadow the drawbacks of polymeric configurations, and boost the cyclic stability, specific capacitance (SC), and energy density of the resulting configurations. Herein, drawbacks of polymeric configurations such as polypyrrole (PPy) and polyindole (PIN) are modified via reinforcement with silver nanowires (Ag-PPy and Ag-PIN), and their performances are compared via in-depth fundamental analyses to select the superior one. Accordingly, the SC of PPy and PIN increased from 282 and 324 F.g−1 to 452 and 587 F.g−1 at the current density of 1 A.g−1 upon reinforcement with silver nanowires, respectively. The Ag-PIN configuration as the superior modified polymeric platform is assembled in an asymmetric supercapacitor along with LArGO. The as-developed electrodes show an ideal synergic effect and reveal favorable SC retention (94.2%) after 5000 cycles, high specific capacitance of 368.8 F.g−1, and energy density of 41.5 W.h.Kg−1 at the power density of 450 W.Kg−1. The obtained data illuminate the great capability of the hybrid package that bridges the gap between a high-performance battery and supercapacitor.
