Three kinds of activated carbons were prepared from Taixi anthracite by NaOH activation. As-obtained activated carbons were adopted as electrode materials to construct asymmetric and symmetric supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of as-constructed supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte (3.0M KOH) were investigated. Results show that the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with activated carbon of a higher specific surface area (S BET) as the positive electrode exhibits better ion diffusion behavior and higher cell gravimetric specific capacitance (C g). This is different from the case in non-aqueous system, mainly because pseudo-capacitance rather than double-layer capacitance has a more important effect on C g in the aqueous electrolyte. Namely, the wettability and pseudo-capacitance of activated carbons decrease with increasing mass ratio of NaOH to anthracite, which is more prominent for activated carbons used as negative electrode materials.
