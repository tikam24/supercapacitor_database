MnO2 nanowires/graphenated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been fabricated on stainless steel (SS) substrate through chemical vaporous deposition (CVD) and electrodeposition method as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes. The MnO2 nanowires/graphenated CNTs nanocomposites have high areal capacitance of 492.5 mF/cm2 (615.6 F/g) at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm2 and outstanding energy density of 985 Wh/m2 with power density of 2.98 kW/m2. After 5000 cycles at 0.5 mA/cm2, the capacity retention of the MnO2/graphenated CNTs is still maintained 95% of the initial capacitance, suggesting exceptional capacitance retention and superior stability. The predominant electrochemical performance of the MnO2/graphenated CNTs is contributed to the synergistic effects of high conductivity of graphenated CNTs and high pseudocapacitance of MnO2 nanowires.
