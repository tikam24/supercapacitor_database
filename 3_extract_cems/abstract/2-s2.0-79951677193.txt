We synthesized Fe3O4 nanoparticle-dispersed multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to evaluate their potential applicability to supercapacitor electrodes. Nanosized Fe3O4 was deposited by chemical coprecipitation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the presence of MWNTs in alkaline solutions. Fe3O4 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 14 nm were prepared within several minutes. The structure and morphological characteristics of the Fe 3O4/MWNT composites were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical performance of a Fe3O 4/MWNT composite electrode and a pure MWNT electrode was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge in a sulfite electrolyte. The results showed that the Fe3O4/MWNT electrode had typical pseudo-capacitive behavior in a 1 M Na2SO 3 solution and a significantly greater specific capacitance than that of the pure MWNT electrode. It could also retain 85.1% of its initial capacitance over 1000 cycles. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
