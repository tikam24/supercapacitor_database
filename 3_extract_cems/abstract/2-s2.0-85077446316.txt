In this paper, an accurate efficiency evaluation of an innovative three-switch double input DC-DC converter for hybrid vehicle applications was carried out. The converter was used to interface two storages, (e.g., supercapacitor and battery) to the DC link. A refined model was created in MATLAB/Simulink Plecs environment and it was used to compare the traditional four-switch converter (i.e., two DC-DC converters in parallel connection) with the innovative three-switch converter. Loss and efficiency contour maps were obtained for both converters and a comparison between them was performed. A prototype of the three-switch converter was realized and used to validate the simulation thermal model by comparing both efficiency and current waveforms obtained with simulations and experimental tests.
