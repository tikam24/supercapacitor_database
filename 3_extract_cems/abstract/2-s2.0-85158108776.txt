In the battle between industrialization and conserving the environment, ecologically viable biomass niches are in high demand. Storing and delivering energy with durability and steadiness has been crucial. Conventionally, carbonaceous materials have been used for years in supercapacitor fabrication. A sustainable supply of energy with minimum cost and huge benefits has made biomass-derived nanostructures suitable for supercapacitor applications. The design of customizable nanostructures (e.g., nanorods, nanoflowers, nanosheets, nanotubes, etc.) has been found to be dependent on dopants, the morphology of precursors, surface area parameters, and many more factors. An enormous number of biowaste and biomass materials have been employed to attain various nanostructures that are beneficial for electrochemical energy storage. Auxiliary, doping metals, and heteroatoms are found to be advantageous as they can lead to the generation of redox active sites, increased cyclability, and reduced resistance to charge transfer. The overall electronic framework has played a significant role in the stability and robustness of the nanostructure in supercapacitors. This chapter discusses the various superstructures derived from biomass, as well as their intrinsic electrochemical performance on metal doping. Metal doped nanostructured carbonaceous materials derived from replenishable, inexpensive, and environmentally friendly biomass have become the “cherry on top” in supercapacitor research communities.
