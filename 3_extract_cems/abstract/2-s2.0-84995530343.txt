Herein, we report a good capacitive storage performance of nanorod assembly of polyaniline (PANI). PANI was synthesized by a facile method using nanostructured γ-MnO2 as a sacrificial template as well as an oxidant. As-synthesized PANI was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy and surface area analysis. X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopic studies confirmed the formation of PANI. Microscopic studies revealed that the morphology of PANI is spherical brushes comprising of straight and radially grown nanorods of different lengths. Capacitive storage performance of PANI was studied in a mixed perchlorate electrolyte consisting of HClO4 and NaClO4. A specific capacitance of 394 F g−1 with good rate capability was obtained for nanorod assembly of PANI. The improved storage performance of PANI is attributed to its morphology, which provides easy access to the electrolyte and short diffusion path length for ions.
