Here, a stable PANi doped with graphene quantum dot (GQD) was synthesized by a new synthesis process for application in electrode materials of supercapacitors. Furthermore, the effect of GQD content on structure and electrochemical properties of PANi was investigated in detail. It showed excellent specific capacitance (3632.0 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1) as electrode of supercapacitor for GQD@PANi nanocomposites with 10.0 wt%. The result was attributed to PANi with more benzenoid structure, which provided more electrochemical active sites and reduced internal resistance under assistant with GQD. The findings open a new path to design and prepare high-performance electrode materials based on PANi materials.
