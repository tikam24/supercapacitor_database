The safety of aircraft operations depend on the quality of supplied power. Modern aircraft power sources are based on the power electronics processing including ground, internal, and external power sources (e.g., auxiliary power unit). In this paper, the concept of hybrid power system of secondary-power-source based on super-capacitor with Variable Speed - Constant Frequency (VSCF) electronic generator is preented to improve power density and dynamic behavior. The design and provision of electrical power systems design for visual navigation endures information to the pilot during the time-period when the primary-system power supply fails.
