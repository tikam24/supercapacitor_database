In order to improve the performances of the electric vehicle power supply, an active Battery/Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) has been proposed. Actually lot of authors proposes different strategies to manage the power between the two power sources. These strategies allow the improvement of the HESS size or the decreasing of the stresses applied to the battery. This paper presents a new energy management strategy for Battery/Supercapacitor HESS to minimize the booth parameters: the sizing of the HESS and the stresses applied to the battery. The proposed strategy is simulated and compared with the classical energy management methods. Simulation results show significant performance enhancements for the battery with our strategy.
