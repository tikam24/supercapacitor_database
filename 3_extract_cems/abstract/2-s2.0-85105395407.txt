Ni-Co MOF-based systems have been proposed as supercapacitor electrode materials due to their high energy capacitance. This study aims to determine the effect of Ni-Co MOF addition in the ZnO-FC-NiCo MOF as supercapacitor electrode. ZnO and functionalized carbon (FC) materials are mixed with the addition of Ni-Co MOF mass of 10% and 20% of the total mass then deposited onto the Al foil substrate. The supercapacitors were arranged symmetrically using 0.5 M H3PO4electrolytes. The sample characterizations were carried out using XRD, SEM, TEM and Cyclic Voltammetry. It is shown that specific capacitance is increasing, ranging from 1.15 to 6.62F/g.
