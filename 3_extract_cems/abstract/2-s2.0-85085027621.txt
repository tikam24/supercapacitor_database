This experimental research proposes a supercapacitor-based regenerative shock absorber (RSA) capable of harvesting the vehicular suspension-vibration energy and converting it into electrical energy to extend the battery life and driving range of electric vehicles (EV). The proposed RSA composed of three main parts; the suspension vibration energy, conversion mechanism and energy storage modules. Simulations were carried out and an RSA prototype fabricated and bench-tested subject to sinusoidal vibration. The experimental total energy harvesting efficiency (Î²) of the supercapacitor-based RSA is in the range of 38.70% - 67.29%, with the average total efficiency of 53.15%. In addition, the RSA total efficiency is positively correlated to the vibrational frequency and amplitude. The proposed supercapacitor-based regenerative shock absorber is thus capable of harvesting the suspension vibration energy and efficiently converting it into electrical energy used for renewable energy applications to extend the EV driving range.
