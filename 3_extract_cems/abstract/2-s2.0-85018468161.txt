It is very important to exploit new electrode materials to enhance supercapacitor performances. In this study, the mesoporous cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanowire arrays on carbon cloth have been fabricated by low-temperature phosphidation of hydrothermally obtained Co precursor. The CoP electrode shows a remarkable areal capacitance of 1.89 F/cm2 at current densities of 3 mA/cm2. Furthermore, the electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability (~3% loss after the repetitive 4000 cycles at 18 mA/cm2) and Coulombic efficiency (~97.6% after 4000 cycles).
