Nanomaterials have been used for various applications as their unique thermal, mechanical, electrical, and surface properties. These nanomaterials are extensively studied and have a wide range of applications when forming a composite by incorporating them with a suitable matrix in appropriate amounts. Nanomaterials are also being used in energy storage applications with a huge success. These nanomaterials offer extra edge in energy storage applications as these have superior mechanical properties as well. Different nanocomposite materials have been used for the energy storage as latent heat-based thermal energy storage (LHTES). Biomass-derived char and activated carbon with a blend of nanomaterial can improve the energy storage capacity of a cell or supercapacitor up to a very high extent. Nanomaterials have applications in solar energy-related applications as well. The current book chapter will discuss the applications of nanomaterials in energy storage applications with a focus on the energy storage materials which are biomass derived char or activated carbon. Moreover, it will analyze the challenges faced by these materials in the energy storage applications and the future scope of these materials as energy storage applications.
