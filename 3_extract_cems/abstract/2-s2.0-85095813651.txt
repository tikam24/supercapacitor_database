The hybrid fuel cell/supercapacitor (FC/SC) system is a promising onboard power supply system for more electric aircraft (MEA), where system stability is a critical issue due to the high penetration of constant power loads (CPLs) in MEA. This article proposes a composite finite-time controller for decentralized power sharing and stabilization of the hybrid FC/SC system with CPLs. It consists of an integral droop (ID) + finite-time controller for the SC converter and a proportional droop (PD) + finite-time controller for the FC converter. First, the coordination of PD and ID achieves decentralized power sharing between FC and SC such that SC only compensates fast fluctuations and FC provides smooth power at the steady state. Then, a finite-time observer is designed to provide feedforward compensation for the disturbances and enables accurate tracking with fast dynamics. Finally, a composite finite-time controller is constructed following a nonrecursive synthesis procedure with a rigorous large signal stability analysis. The proposed controller guarantees finite-time convergence even under large signal variations and can be easily implemented with a practical gain tuning procedure. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the proposed technique.
