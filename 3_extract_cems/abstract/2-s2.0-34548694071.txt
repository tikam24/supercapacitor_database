Two types of carbon aerogel-based functional electrodes for supercapacitor applications are developed. To improve the electrochemical performance of the electrodes, carbon aerogels are doped with pseudocapacitive tin oxide either by impregnating tin oxide sol into resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) wet gels (Method I), or by impregnating tin tetrachloride solution into carbon aerogel electrodes (Method II). The electrodes are heat-treated to 450 °C in air to activate the electrode surface and complete the oxidation of tin-precursors in the network structure of the aerogel. The effects of different impregnation methods on the physical/electrochemical properties of the composite electrodes are investigated. Microstructural and compositional variations of the electrodes with tin oxide doping are also examined by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The tin oxide/carbon aerogel composite electrodes synthesized by both methods have similar specific capacitances (66-70 F g-1). Composite electrodes synthesized via Method II showed better cyclic stability compared with electrodes synthesized via Method I. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
