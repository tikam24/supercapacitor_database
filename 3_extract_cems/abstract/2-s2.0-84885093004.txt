Coaxial PANI/TiN/PANI nanotube arrays prepared by electrochemical polymerization of PANI on nanoporous TiN nanotube arrays exhibit a high specific capacitance of 242 mF cm−2, excellent rate capability with the capacitance remaining at 69% when the current density is increased 50 times from 0.2 to 10 mA cm−2, and a long cycling life with less than 0.005% decay per cycle. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
