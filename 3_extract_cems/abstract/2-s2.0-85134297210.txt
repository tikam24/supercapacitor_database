The investigation of renewable, cost-effective, and environmentally gracious electrode materials with high adsorption, fast ion/electron transport, and tunable surface chemistry is immediately desirable for the development of next-generation biocompatible energy-storage devices. In recent years, biomass-derived carbon electrode materials for energy storage have attracted significant attention because of their widespread availability, renewable nature, and low cost. More importantly, their inherent uniform and precise biological structures can be utilized as templates for fabricating electrode materials with controlled and well-defined geometries. The current review mainly spotlights on recent research progress towards biomass derived carbon electrode materials include plant, fruit, vegitable, animal waste, and microorganism based carbon electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. And over view of different synthesis methods for conversion and activation of biomass waste are discussed. Furthermore, summary and future research trends in this filed are projected.
