Advanced two-dimensional (2D) materials with excellent physicochemical properties create huge interest in developing high-energy-density supercapacitors without diminishing their power densities. Herein, a novel bismuthene/antimonene nanocomposite (Biene/Sbene NC) has been employed as an efficient active material to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance. As a result, the Biene/Sbene electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 1003.3 C/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s and an outstanding cycling stability of 87.3% for 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, the composite electrode provides the total, outer, and inner capacity of 2857.14, 80, and 2777.14 C/g respectively based on Trasatti analysis and their capacitive and diffusion contributions of 97.2 and 2.8% correspondingly. The hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) has been fabricated by the Biene/Sbene NC cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode which demonstrates a high energy density of 131.44 Wh/kg and a maximum power density of 8262.2 W/kg. In addition, the Biene/Sbene//AC HSC demonstrates practical utilization by illuminating the red light-emitting diodes for 5 min by interconnecting three HSCs in series. This work will stimulate an alternate idea to fabricate electrode materials by utilizing novel 2D materials with excellent physicochemical properties for next-generation energy storage devices.
