V 2 O 5 spheres were successfully synthesized via solvothermal treatment using a super critical fluid. Structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the V 2 O 5 spheres were analysed. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of V 2 O 5 with orthorhombic structure. Scanning electron microscopic images shows the formation of spheres and High resolution transmission electron microscopic images confirms the formation of spheres. The V 2 O 5 sphere exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 451 F g −1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s −1 . Galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis reveals the maximum specific capacitance of 431 F g −1 at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Asymmetric V 2 O 5 //AC device exhibits the energy density of 27.4 W h kg −1 and a power density of 747.3 W kg −1 with excellent cyclic stability i.e., 94% capacitance retention even at 2000 cycles.
