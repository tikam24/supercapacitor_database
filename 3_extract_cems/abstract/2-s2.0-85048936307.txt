Lignin, a renewable resource, has been used as carbon precursor to prepare porous carbon nanofiber films by electrospinning with PVP as spinning agent and Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O as additive. The effect of the content of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O on the morphology, microstructure, surface chemistry, specific surface area and porous structure of the lignin-based porous carbon nanofiber films (LCNFs) is investigated. Results show that with the increase of the content of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O in the spinning solution, the average diameter of fibers is decreased obviously, while specific surface area and mesoporosity are increased significantly. When mass ratio of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O/lignin is 2:1, the resultant LCNFs possessed an increased specific surface area of 1140 m 2 g −1 and a significantly improved mesoporosity of 78%, and showed hierarchical porous structure. LCNFs were cut into electrode for supercapacitors directly and were evaluated in three-electrode and two-electrode cell. With increase of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O, the capacitive performance of LCNFs turn better. When mass ratio of Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O/lignin was 2:1, the specific capacitance of LCNFs reached 248 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 , much higher than that of sample without Mg(NO 3 ) 2 ·6H 2 O (173 F g −1 ). Moreover, LCNFs showed an outstanding rate performance (capacitance retention of 59–67% from 0.2 to 20 A g −1 ) and a good cycling stability (capacitance retention of 97% after 1000 cycles at 20 A g −1 ).
