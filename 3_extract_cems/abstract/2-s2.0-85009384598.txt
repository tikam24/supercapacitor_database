Noble metal-based materials have been intensively investigated as good additives of electrode materials for supercapacitors, since they can improve the specific capacitance, conductivity, and chemical and thermal stabilities of the electrode materials. This review carefully summarizes noble metal-based materials for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. The advances of hybrid electrodes are then assessed to include hybrid systems of noble metal-based materials with compounds such as carbonaceous materials, metals and transition metal oxides or hydroxides. A variety of synthetic methods such as hydrothermal/solvothermal methods, polymerization, and electrodeposition methods are also discussed to prepare noble metal-based materials. This review comprehensively summarizes and evaluates the recent progress in the research on noble metal-based electrode materials for supercapacitors, including synthesis methods, electrochemical performances, and related devices.
