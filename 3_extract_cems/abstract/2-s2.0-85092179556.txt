An integrated hybrid structure of SnS2[sbnd]Ni3S2 on nickel foam (SnS2[sbnd]Ni3S2@NiF) was prepared via a one-step hydrothermal route as a supercapacitor electrode. A piece of nickel foam was used as the backbone as well as the precursor for Ni3S2. During the hydrothermal process, the S species released from the thioacetamide react with the Sn ions and Ni foam and produce a SnS2[sbnd]Ni3S2 hybrid nanostructure at the surface of the Ni foam. The prepared material was characterized by state-of-the-art techniques and used as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrode was studied in a three-electrode system using a 2 M KOH aqueous solution as the electrolyte. The SnS2[sbnd]Ni3S2@NiF electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 272 mAh/g at a current density of 4 mA/cm2 accompanied by a cyclic stability of 91% over 3000 charge-discharge cycles (at a current density of 20 mA/cm2). We believe that this work provides an easy and scalable strategy to prepare a highly efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.
