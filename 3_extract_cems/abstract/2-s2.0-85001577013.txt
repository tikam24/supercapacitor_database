Supercapacitors are finding wider applications in modern power systems due to a controllable fast dynamic response. Use of power electronically interfaced supercapacitors for frequency support is a proven technique. In practical applications the heat generated from the Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) can significantly reduce the life of supercapacitor. Hence thermal issues must be addressed for optimal operation. It is infeasible to use traditional optimization control methods to mitigate the impacts of frequent cycling due to the lack of active thermal management. This paper proposes a Front End Controller (FEC) using Generalized Predictive Control based on real time receding optimization. The constraints in the optimization are based on thermal management to enhance the efficiency of utilization life of the supercapacitors. A rigorous mathematical derivation is provided and supporting simulation results are obtained using Real Time Digital Simulator to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
