This paper presents the design of an efficient energy management strategy (EMS) for fuel cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV). The studied hybrid system is composed of fuel cell/ultracapacitor (FC/UC) source allowing increasing both the power capability and the energy capacity of FCHV. The designed EMS uses a wavelet approach to share the power flow between energy generation by sources and traction load. This leads to a natural frequency decomposition of the power demands without slop limitation to provide any load requirement. An analysis of the simulation results is carried out under Matlab/Simulink environment in order to assess the effectiveness and the performance of the proposed control strategy.
