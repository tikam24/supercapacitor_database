Flower-like nanosheets of pure molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and Fe-doped MoS2 (FM) with 2, 4 and 8% atomic-doped iron of FM-2, FM-4 and FM-8, respectively, were successfully synthesized using the hydrothermal method. The effect of iron doping on the MoS2 morphology, composition, and supercapacitor behavior are systematically investigated. In the Fe-doped MoS2 samples, iron atoms replaced the molybdenum atoms in the MoS2 structure through the hydrothermal process. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted on a three-electrode system to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. The specific capacitance of the FM-2 electrode was 240 F g−1 at a 10 mV s−1 CV scan rate, which was higher than that of the pure MoS2 and the other two Fe-doped MoS2 electrodes. Furthermore, EIS tests exhibited that doping iron in the MoS2 structure contributes to a rapid decline in charge transfer resistance and, therefore, a higher probability of energy storage. The results revealed that the synthesized Fe-doped MoS2 samples are potential electrode materials for future energy storage devices.
