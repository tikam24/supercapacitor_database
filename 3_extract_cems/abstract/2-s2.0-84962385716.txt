Supercapacitors benefit from unique features including high power density, long cycle life, wide temperature operation range, durability in harsh environments, efficient cycling, and low maintenance cost. This paper presents a validated lumped and computationally efficient electrical and thermal model for a cylindrical supercapacitor cell. The electrical model is a two-state equivalent electric circuit model with three parameters that are identified using temporal experiments. The dependence of the parameters on the state of charge, current direction and magnitude (20-200 A), and temperatures ranging from -40 째C to 60 째C is incorporated in the model. The thermal model is a linear 1-D model with two states. The reversible heat generation which is significant in double-layer capacitors is included in the thermal model. The coupling of the two models enables tuning of the temperature-dependent parameters of the electrical model in real time. The coupled electrothermal model is validated using real-world duty cycles at subzero and room temperatures with root-mean-square errors of (82 mV-87 mV) and (0.17 째C-0.21 째C) for terminal voltage and temperature, respectively. This accurate model is implementable in real-time power applications and also thermal management studies of supercapacitor packs.
