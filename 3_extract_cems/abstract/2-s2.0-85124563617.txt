A nanocomposite of carbonaceous aerogel (CA) supported by modified MnO2 nanoparticles with ferrocene (Fc) moiety (MnO2-Fc/CA) was prepared by a simple and environmentally friendly approach in two steps. In the first step, a porous carbon-based material was synthesized using watermelon as a starting material. Then, 5-ferrocenylpentanoic acid was covalently grafted onto the α-MnO2 surface through hydrothermal route, and finally, MnO2-Fc/CA was obtained by simply physically mixing MnO2-Fc and CA in acetone. After thorough characterization of as-prepared nanomaterial via appropriate analyses, the MnO2-Fc/CA nanocomposite reveals excellent electrochemical performances (Cs value: 963 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (~96% after 3000 CV cycles). Moreover, the constructed symmetric cell reveals a high-energy density of 38.1 Wh kg−1 and a high-power density of 4556 W kg−1. The final high-performance nanocomposite is a very favorable candidate for energy storage applications.
