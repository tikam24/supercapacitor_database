Activated carbon / graphene hybrid aerogels (AC/rGO) with high surface area and 3D structure were prepared with a simple hydrothermal treatment of a mixture of AC and graphene oxide (GO) aqueous solution. The AC/rGO aerogels with high surface area of 2400 m2 g−1 exhibit good electrochemical performances as an electrode material for supercapacitors in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. In 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, a satisfying specific capacitance of 294 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability retention of 70.4% at 20 A g−1 can be obtained for the AC/rGO electrode, indicating the rGO can dramatically improve the rate performance with negligible sacrifice of the specific capacitance. Furthermore, due to the high electrode density (0.58 g cm−3), the volumetric capacitance of AC/rGO electrode reaches up to 170.5 F cm−3 at 0.05 A g−1. In 1 M TEABF4/PC non-aqueous electrolyte, the AC/rGO electrode presents capacitances of 144 F g−1 and 96 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. The superior performance of the AC/rGO aerogels can be attributed to the synergy between the AC with high surface area and the rGO aerogel with 3D conductive structure, which makes the AC/rGO aerogel a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
