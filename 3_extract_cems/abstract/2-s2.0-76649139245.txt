Challenges and opportunities for real-world applications of electrochemical capacitors are discussed. An electrochemical capacitor (EC), sometimes called a supercapacitor or an ultracapacitor, stores electrical charge in the electric double layer at a surfaceelectrolyte interface, primarily in highsurface-area carbon. The concept of storing electrical energy in the electric double layer that is formed at the interface between an electrolyte and a solid has been known since the late 1800s. It is important to keep firmly in mind the basic differences between electrochemical capacitors and batteries both in their materials/structures and in the different physical/chemical mechanisms involved in how they function. The energy stored in an EC can be released within that time frame, and it can, as well, be recharged in the same time. Lithium ion batteries, on the other hand, take several minutes or more time to release all their energy, and similarly several minutes to tens of minutes to hours to be recharged.
