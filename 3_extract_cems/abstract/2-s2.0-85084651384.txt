In this report, manganese cobalt MnCo2O4 spinel with different morphologies like nanofibers (MCFs) and nanocubes (MCCs) were successfully synthesized by facile hydrothermal route. The structural, morphological, textural, and chemical composition of the samples were analyzed through powder X-ray diffraction, Scanning electron microscope, Raman, N2 adsorption–desorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis. The XRD results exposed that the spinel cubic structure and the different morphologies like nanocubes and nanofibers were confirmed through SEM images. The N2 adsorption–desorption results illustrate that MnCo2O4 nanofibers exhibit high specific area of 102 m2g−1 than that of nanocubes (73 m2g−1). The prepared novel nanoarchitecture electrodes showed multi-functional electrochemical performance. Interestingly, the MnCo2O4 nanofibers electrode exhibits an excellent value of 1064 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1. The specific capacitance retention was almost 97% for MnCo2O4 nanofibers electrode at 2 Ag−1 after 5000 cycle. The MnCo2O4//AC asymmetric device was fabricated and it delivers high energy density of about 48 Wh kg−1, still it is maintained as 18 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 5400 W Kg−1.
