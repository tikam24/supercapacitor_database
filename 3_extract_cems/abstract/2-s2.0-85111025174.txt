Highly oriented Co-MOF nanoneedle arrays are in situ constructed on Co foam (Co-MOF@Co) by using a one-pot solvothermal strategy. As-prepared Co-MOF@Co can be directly served as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor, which exhibits wonderful electrochemical performances, i.e. high specific capacitance (12783.0 mF cm-2 or 1164.2 F g-1), exceptional cycling stability (90.5% retention over 10 000 cycles at 250 mA cm-2) with a loading of 10.98 mg cm-2. Meanwhile, an asymmetric supercapacitor of AC//Co-MOF@Co delivers a high ratability (87% retention upon ten-fold current density) and high energy density of 43.4 W h kg-1 at the power density of 145.1 W kg-1.
