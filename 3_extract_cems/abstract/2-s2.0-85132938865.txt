Development of binary spinel-type mixed metal oxide and fabrication various morphological heterostructure nanomaterials having two distinct metals paid a wide attention in emerging field. Here, we prepared three-dimensional (3D) marigold flower-like Ni3V2O8 structure via a simple and facile technique for electrochemical supercapacitor applications. 3D Ni3V2O8 with thick petals as cathode materials exhibits high specific capacitance of 263.12 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.5 mA cm−2. The high energy density of 32.98 W h kg−1 at power density of 189.96 W kg−1 is obtained by the cathode formation of marigold flower-shaped Ni3V2O8, indicating excellent ions accessibility and large charge storage ability of Ni3V2O8 structure. It is also observed that even after 5000 cycles charging-discharging profile analysis, Ni3V2O8 cathode retains 32% of its initial capacitance along with 100% Coulombic efficiency. This higher capacitance retention strengthens its adoption as a potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
