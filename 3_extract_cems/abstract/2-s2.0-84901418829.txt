In this paper, using Ni3S2@MoS2 as an example, we report the successful design and synthesis of a novel hybrid core/shell metal sulfides with a conductive Ni3S2 core by a green, scalable and one-step solution strategy. When they are tested as supercapacitor electrodes, the Ni3S2@MoS2 heterostructure exhibits about 2 times the capacitance (848Fg-1) compared to the pristine Ni3S2 sample (425Fg-1), excellent rate capability (46.6% capacity retention at 20Ag-1) and outstanding cycling stability (91% retention after 2000 cycles). The enhancement is ascribed to the robust hierarchical core/shell structures which provide an increased reaction area and a close contact of electrolyte with the active material. In addition, a highly conductive 1D core material endows the quick transport of electrons along Ni3S2 nanorods to Ni foam. It is prospected that such novel hybrids can offer great potential promise in large-scale energy storage device applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
