In order to decrease the consumption of hydrogen fuel in fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid system, meanwhile, to reduce charge or discharge times of supercapacitor and extend its lifetime, this paper proposes an energy management method based on hysteretic control of the supercapacitor's state of charge(SOC) about fuel cell/supercapcacitor hybrid system. The energy management method is based on the size of load and supercapacitor's SOC, it lets fuel cell system work in highest efficiency interval and maintains the SOC of supercapacitor in suitable range. This paper set up the test platform of fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid system, and verified the proposed energy management method, the results of experiment demonstrated that the energy management method could effectually decrease the consumption of hydrogen fuel and maintain the SOC of supercapacitor, and the proposed energy management method could help supercapacitor to extern lifetime.
