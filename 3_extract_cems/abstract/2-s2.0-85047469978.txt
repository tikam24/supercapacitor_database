In stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems, due to daily and weather solar irradiation variability, special devices are used for energy storage, most often batteries. In order to remove stress from batteries during sudden load change, it is advisable to use hybrid energy storage systems (HESS), by adding a supercapacitor module to the battery. In this work, two battery/supercapacitor HESS configurations are investigated - active with two DC-DC converters and semi-active with one DC-DC convertor. Both HESSs are represented as port-controlled Hamiltonian systems, and the synthesis of energy-shaping control systems (ESCS) is carried out using the IDA-PBC method. As a result of the synthesis three structures of ESCSs were obtained. The conducted simulation studies in the Matlab/Simulink environment allowed us to justify the appropriate structures of the ESCSs for each of the HESSs configurations and showed that both systems satisfactorily fulfill management strategy. As a simpler and cheaper, the semi-active battery/supercapacitor HESS can be recommended for use in stand-alone PV installations.
