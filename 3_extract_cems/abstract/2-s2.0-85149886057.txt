Mixed oxides are gathering a lot of interest in research for different applications due to their promising properties, which arise due to the synergy effects when two or more than two oxides combine. This chapter provides a comprehensive study of the synthesis of mixed oxides using solution-processed approaches. The mixed oxide formation using solution-processed methods such as electrodeposition, precipitation, successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, sol-gel, and chemical bath deposition is explored in this chapter. A comprehensive overview of mixed oxide synthesis using these methods, structural characterization, and application is provided to understand the synthesis approaches and progress in this field.
