The transient behavior of a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell System (PEMFCS) under an efficient Adaptive Predictive Control with Robust Filter (APCWRF) is analyzed. This control scheme is tested to evaluate its performance when sudden changes in the load occur. It is produced by the demands of the electric motor of a hybrid vehicle, powered by a PEMFC and a supercapacitor bank to fulfil Standard Driving Cycles. The objective of the proposed advanced strategy is to control the oxygen excess ratio in the cathode to improve the system efficiency and to ensure a safe operation for the PEM. Several results through a simulation environment are presented. They are useful for showing the potentiality of the APCWRF for the proposed exigent scenarios.
