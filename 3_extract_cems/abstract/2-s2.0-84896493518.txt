Alpha-phase MoO3 is electrochemically deposited on well-aligned TiO2 nanotubes which are synthesized by anodic oxidation. The morphology, composition and electrochemical behaviors of MoO3-coated and bare TiO2 nanotubes are studied. The former deliver greatly higher capacitance than the latter and their performance can be readily optimized by varying MoO3 deposition cycles. The large areal capacitance of 209.6 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 is firstly achieved for TiO2 nanotube array electrode. In addition, the coated TiO2 nanotubes show significantly more capacitance than a dense MoO3 film. For example, they exhibit a capacitance up to 74.9 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in 1 M KCl solution, while the dense film only shows a capacitance of 32.3 F g-1 under same conditions. Such improvement is found ascribed to MoO3 with high pseudocapacity and TiO2 nanotubes with large surface area allowing efficient MoO 3 nanoparticle loading and rapid charge transfer. This nanostructured electrode with features of facile synthesis and excellent performance is believed as a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
