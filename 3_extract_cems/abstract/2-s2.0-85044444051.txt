The metal organic framework (MOF) [Ni3(HCOO)6] was synthesized via the simple and fast microwave method, and the effect of irradiation power on crystallinity of synthesized Ni-based MOF was studied. The samples were characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The synthesized Ni-based MOF was electrochemically characterized by using galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The synthesized MOF showed the highest specific capacitance of 1196.2F/g at 1A/g with excellent cyclability (86.04% capacitance retention after 2,000 cycles), thereby demonstrating its potential application in supercapacitors.
