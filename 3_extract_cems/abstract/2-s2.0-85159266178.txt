MXene is a graphene structured layered 2D nanomaterial with high electrical conductivity and large specific surface area, which is commonly used in energy storage. MXene is rich in end-group functional groups, which efficiently facilitated the formation of cross-linked structures with biomass based nanomaterials and then widen the layer spacing of MXene, thus improving the flexibility of devices and providing more ion transport channels. Therefore, the use of MXene in biomass energy storage nanomaterials is becoming a hot topic of research. This paper reviews the recent applications of MXene combining biomass based nanomaterials in the fields of energy storage. Firstly, the various MXene preparation methods and their advantages/disadvantages are introduced. Secondly, the optimized modifications of MXene energy storage devices with CNF, BC, CNC and other materials are presented, respectively. Then, the physical/chemical characteristics and the performance advantages of the three cutting-edge energy storage devices of supercapacitors, nanogenerators and secondary batteries derived from MXene-biomass based nanomaterials are also summarized, followed by emphatically focusing on the functions of biomassbased nanomaterials in MXene-biomass based nanocomposites. Finally, the challenges faced by MXene composited with biomass based nanomaterials in the energy storage areas and their future applications are analyzed and prospected.
