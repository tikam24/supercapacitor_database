NiCo2O4 nanoparticles anchored onto 2D-carbyne nanosheets is prepared to use as a new nanohybrid electrode to enhance the capacitive performance of hybrid supercapacitors. The developed heterogeneous nanohybrid takes advantage of 2D-carbyne with high electrical conductivity and NiCo2O4 with a short ion diffusion pathway and hence the synergy between 2D-carbyne and NiCo2O4 enhances the capacitive performance with a specific capacitance of around 1766.7 F g−1. Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor device with a maximum voltage of about 1.7 V is fabricated using NiCo2O4@2D-carbyne and activated carbon as the positive electrode and negative electrode. The hybrid supercapacitor device exhibits a high energy density of 62 W h kg−1 at a power density of 5.31 kW kg−1 over 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of about 81%. This outcome provides a new approach to develop hybrid supercapacitors with superior characteristics.
