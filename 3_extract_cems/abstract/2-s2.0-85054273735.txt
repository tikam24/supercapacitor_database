Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors, store electrical charge in the electric double layer at an electrode–electrolyte interface, primarily in a high–surface area electrode. The high surface area and the small thickness of the double layer (in the order of angstrom) enable these devices to exhibit high specific and volumetric energy and power density with an essentially unlimited charge–discharge cycle life. The operational voltage in these devices is governed by the breakdown potential of the electrolyte and ranges usually between <1 and <3 V for aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively.
