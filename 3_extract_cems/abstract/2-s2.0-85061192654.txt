As a green and effective energy storage device, supercapacitors have been attractive due to their high power density along with long cycle stability. Among various electrode materials, carbon materials have drawn significant attention due to their wonderful properties, such as high specific surface area, electronic conductivity, chemical stability and porous structures. In addition, challenges come from global warming and environmental pollution, biomass derived carbon materials feature the concepts of the sustainable development of chemistry. In this, the review not only summarizes the most advanced progress in biomass derived heteroatoms self-doped carbon materials for supercapacitor, but also provides important guidelines for the future design of biomass-derived carbons with heteroatoms doping in specific energy applications.
