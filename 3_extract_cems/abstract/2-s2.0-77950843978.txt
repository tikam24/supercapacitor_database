Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) or Supercapacitors (SC) are useful in many pulse power applications such as memory backups, mobiles, laptops and communication systems. Symmetrical, aqueous, metal oxide based 8F, 5.5V SC module is developed and its charging with solar array has been investigated. Use of this capacitor for pulse power application was investigated. Standard Maxwell, Nesscap SC and the developed module was tested for flash gun operation of camera. SC is a power rich device and photovoltaic system being energy rich; makes best pair to give new stable power source. Â© 2009 IEEE.
