Considering the demand for miniaturization, flexibility, and reducing the intricacy of the whole system, designing high-performance energy storage devices that are lightweight, flexible, wearable, miniature, or even integrated with other parts is of great significance. Unfortunately, due to major shortcomings such as weight, stiffness, and bulkiness, current conventional energy storage devices cannot be used directly for those applications. Therefore, the intensifying demands for portable electronic devices require flexible energy storage devices. Recently, flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted much attention due to their prominent features such as lightweight, portability, flexibility, safety, eco-friendliness, and ease of embedding into any system. In particular, fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FCs) have attracted great attention owing to their exclusive features and potential to be integrated into wearable electronics. This chapter briefly summarizes the identity of nanofibers for energy sectors. Consequently, the advantages and use of nanofibers for SCs are explained. Fundamental requirements and the configuration of a flexible SC device are described. Various synthesis approaches for nanofibers and their functionalization are summarized. A detailed description of various types of current collector-based nanofibers and their electrochemical performance is outlined. Moreover, a detailed description of the effect of functionalization of nanofibers on SCs has been elucidated. Finally, the integration of fiber-based devices for self-powered systems and future perspectives are briefly discussed.
