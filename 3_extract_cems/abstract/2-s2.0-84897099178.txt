A simple and effective method using 6-amino-4-hydroxy-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) for the synthesis of water dispersible graphene has been described. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy reveals that ANS-modified reduced graphene oxide (ANS-rGO) obeys Beers law at moderate concentrations. Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies provide quantitative information regarding the removal of oxygen functional groups from graphene oxide (GO) and the appearance of new functionalities in ANS-rGO. The electrochemical performances of ANS-rGO have been determined by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. Charge-discharge experiments show that ANS-rGO is an outstanding supercapacitor electrode material due to its high specific capacitance (375 F g-1 at a current density of 1.3 A g-1) and very good electrochemical cyclic stability (∼97.5% retention in specific capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles). ANS-rGO exhibits promising characteristics with a very high power density (1328 W kg-1) and energy density (213 W h kg-1). This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.
