Supercapacitors are critical for storing alternative energy and powering electrical systems or portable electronics. By combining carbon-based nanomaterials with redox-active materials such as ferrocene (Fc), it should be possible to improve energy and power densities. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) was first incorporated into an Fc-containing polymer matrix under simple and mild conditions (room temperature). Then, the Fc-modified CNT was intercalated into graphene oxide layers (GO). The advantages of these novel electrode materials are the fast redox response of the as-prepared nanocomposites due to the presence of Fc and the durable stability of the nanocomposites due to the presence of carbon-based nanomaterials such as GO and CNT. The CNT-But/GO1:1 electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 456 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1 with excellent charge retention (96 % after 5000 GCD cycles). The symmetric cell was then successfully fabricated based on the CNT-But/GO1:1 nanocomposite. The fabricated cell exhibits high specific capacity (104 mAh g−1), excellent charge storage retention (91 %), and high energy and power densities of 94.5 Wh Kg−1, and 8370 W Kg−1, respectively.
