A facile method was successfully developed for the preparation of a hierarchical nanocomposite of vertical polyaniline (PANI) nanorods aligned on the surface of functional multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWNTs) by in situ polymerization of PANI on the surface of FMWNTs. The formation mechanism was illustrated according to the morphological evolution of PANI-FMWNTs nanocomposite at different polymerization times. The hierarchical nanocomposite possessed higher special capacitance and better stability than each individual component as supercapacitor electrode materials due to the synergistic effect of both components, as well as to the special hierarchical structure, which not only increases the specific surface area of the nanocomposite but also facilitates the penetration of electrolyte ions. This research gives a better insight into the preparation of functional hybrid nanocomposites by combining different dimensional nanomaterials. Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
