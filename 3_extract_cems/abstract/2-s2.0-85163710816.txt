Herein, we demonstrate a facile and low-cost method for preparing flexible and transparent multilayered graphene films for electronics and supercapacitor applications. The method involves manually coating graphite powder onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet using a cotton cloth multiple times to create a thin multilayered graphene film. In order to confirm the fabrication of the multilayered graphene film and characterize its properties, various techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy were utilized. The transmittance of the graphitic thin film electrode was determined to be 78.5% at 550 nm wavelength, while the sheet resistance was found to be 101 MΩ/sq. The thickness of the multilayered graphite thin film was determined using a coherence correlation interferometer. Additionally, the supercapacitive performance of the fabricated film was also evaluated. Electrochemical supercapacitive measurements showed a specific capacitance of 36.01 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. The method presented in this report has several potential applications, including flexible displays, LEDs, touch screens panels, optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, and supercapacitors. Overall, the potential applications of the proposed method, combined with its reproducibility and scalability, make it a promising approach for the development of flexible and transparent electronic devices and energy storage systems.
