Herein we fabricate and synthesize Polyaniline Nanospheres (PANINS) via simple oxidative polymerization of Aniline, HCl, APS as an oxidant and TX-100 as a non-ionic surfactant. It is expected that the specific capacitance of Polyaniline (PANI) should change as the morphology of PANI changes due to increase in the porosity of the structure and an enhanced surface area. The diameter of the synthesized PANINS is in the range of 500–780 nm. The structural morphology PANINS is investigated by FESEM, FTIR and XRD respectively. To study the behavior of PANINS for electrochemical properties, CV is done at scan rates of 10, 50, 100 mV/s. The calculated PANINS have a specific capacity of 589 Fg−1 in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution at 10 mV/s. The present nanospheres morphology of PANI projects to be one of the good candidates for its application as supercapacitor electrode.
