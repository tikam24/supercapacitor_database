A series of carbon aerogels (C-AGs) were prepared by the pyrolysis of resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels at 700–1100 ◦C as potential supercapacitor electrodes, and their texture and electrochemical properties were determined. The specific surface area of all C-AGs was in the range of 700–760 m2/g, their electron conductivity increased linearly from 0.4 to 4.46 S/cm with an increase of the pyrolysis temperature. The specific capacitance of electrode material based on C-AGs reached 100 F/g in sulfuric acid and could be realized at a 2 A/g charge-discharge current, which makes it possible to use carbon aerogels as electrode materials.
