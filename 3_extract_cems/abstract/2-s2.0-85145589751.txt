Storage of energy and the pollution of the environment are two of the world's primary challenges currently. As a consequence of the diminishing supply of fossil fuels, renewable energy production has become of great significance. As a result of the high energy/power density and extended life cycle of hybrid supercapacitors, these have recently attracted the attention of energy experts. As new hybrid supercapacitor electrodes, a straightforward two-step technique was developed and constructed a ternary PANI/GO/CuFe2O4 nanocomposite. The copper ferrite (CuFe2O4) nanoparticles were disseminated on graphene oxide (GO) sheets, utilizing a hydrothermal approach, followed by an in situ polymerization procedure for a coating with polyaniline (PANI). Various electrochemical techniques were utilized to evaluate the instances' electrochemical characteristics, and the ternary system's linked topology enabled an array of electrochemical characterizations.In comparison to studies of single and binary samples, the ternary PANI/GO/CuFe2O4 electrode had the highest specific capacitance (SC) of 614.76 F/g at 1 A/g and the best cycle stability (remaining at 88% after 3,500 cycles) while exhibiting the lowest resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A constructed asymmetric supercapacitor that utilized hybrid PANI/GO/CuFe2O4//GO electrodes indicated an SC of 124 F/g at 1 A/g. The asymmetric supercapacitor provided 49.72 Wh/kg and 923 W/kg energy density and specific power, respectively. These findings indicate that the ternary PANI/GO/CuFe2O4 composite material has the capability to be employed as unique electrode material in supercapacitor applications to produce high-efficiency and reliable energy storage devices.
