Improving the electrochemical performance of biomass-derived carbon electrode-active materials for supercapacitor applications has recently attracted considerable attention. Herein, we develop hybrid electrode materials from rice-husk-derived porous carbon (RH-C) materials and βNi(OH)2 via a facile solid-state reaction strategy comprising two steps. The prepared RH-C/Ni(OH)2 (C−Ni) was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS)), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to acquire the physical and chemical information, which was used to demonstrate the successful fabrication of C−Ni. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement results confirmed that the thermal stability of C−Ni changed due to the presence of Ni(OH)2. As expected, C−Ni possesses a high capacitance of ∼952 F/g at a current density of 1.0 A/g. This result is higher than that of pure biomass-based carbon materials under the three-electrode system. This facile preparation method, which was used to synthesize the electrode-active materials, can extend to the value-added utility of other waste biomass materials as high-performing supercapacitor electrodes for energy storage applications.
