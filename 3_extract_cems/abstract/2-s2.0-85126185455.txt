IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge is an annual activity that is organized in cooperation with the IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC). This activity focuses primarily on energy management of electric vehicles (EVs). The challenge of this sixth event brings together two fundamental issues which are sizing and energy management of hybrid dual-energy storage for EVs. The platform for this challenge is the Mitsubishi i-MiEV. Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) model and Inversion-based control of the studied system are provided with all necessary characteristics of energy storage elements. Worldwide participants from industry, academia and students are welcome to join and submit their solution for this Challenge.
