A simple hydrothermal technique was applied to synthesize ZnO@ZnS nanocomposite for hybrid supercapacitors (SCs). As an electrode for SCs, ZnO@ZnS revealed good reversibility, a capacitance of 440.6 F/g, and low charge transfer resistance in an aqueous solution. A hybrid SC was further developed, which delivers a high energy density of 31 Wh kg−1, a power density of 4520 W kg−1, and supreme stability of 94.7 % till 5500 repeated charge–discharge cycles. These exciting findings demonstrate that ZnO-based functional materials might be an excellent option for high-performance hybrid SCs.
