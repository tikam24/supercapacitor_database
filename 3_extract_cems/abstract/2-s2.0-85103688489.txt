The development of energy storage materials with high specific energy for futuristic applications is high in demand. Hybrid electric vehicles, solar energy harvesting, and commercial energy management systems are a few of the prospective applications of supercapacitors. We report the fabrication of symmetric tandem supercapacitors (STSC) using PANI-RGO-ZnO nanocomposite. The in-situ polymerization of PANI ensures the formation of a well-mixed nanocomposite. The detailed morphological analysis reveals that the PANI-RGO-ZnO 2:1 (PANI:ZnO) possesses a higher surface area, which contributes significantly towards excellent ionic diffusion resulting in a high specific capacitance (~40 F g−1) at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device (SSC) exhibits excellent electrochemical performance and high capacitance retention of ~86% over 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The SSC device reveals notable specific energy and specific power of ~5.61 Wh kg−1 and ~403 W kg−1, respectively. The STSC system exhibited a steady voltage ~6.0 V, and demonstrated the performance of the fabricated device by glowing LEDs and operating a DC motor. The exquisite properties of the SSC electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects of ZnO, PANI, and RGO in PANI-RGO-ZnO 2:1 nanocomposite.
