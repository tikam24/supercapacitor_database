In this work, 0.5Mn-NiCo2S4 core-shell nanowire arrays are rationally designed and directly employed as binder-free electrode materials for supercapacitors. The as-fabricated product exhibits a high areal capacity of 3.13 C cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2 and an excellent stability with 78.59% capacity retention after 6000 cycles. An asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor, assembled by utilizing 0.5Mn-NiCo2S4 core-shell nanowires as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, achieves a relatively high volumetric energy density of 8.80 mW h cm-3 at a volumetric power density of 220.103 mW cm-3 and a high retention of 2.29 mW h cm-3 at a power density of 704.51 mW cm-3. Besides, the asymmetric device shows remarkable cycling stability with 83.93% capacity retention after 6000 cycles.
