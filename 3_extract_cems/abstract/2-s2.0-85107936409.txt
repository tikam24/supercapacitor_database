Bio-derived carbon has been remarkably emerging potential candidates for high performance super-capacitive materials. Herein, we report the spray deposited vertically aligned nanosheets (thickness ~ 46 nm) carbon network on nickel foam electrodes using natural coconut liquid as a precursor for high-performance supercapacitor device application. These binder-free fabricated bio-carbon electrodes have characterized using XRD, FESEM, XPS, Raman, Elemental mapping, and EDS. The carbon was coated on nickel foam at different spray pyrolysis deposition times viz. 14, 18 and 22 min. This carbon deposited nickel foam electrodes were investigated for electrochemical characteristics viz EIS, CV, and GCD using 1 M KOH aqueous solution within 0–0.6 V potential window. The electrode CWC-22 exhibited the specific capacitance of 782.7 Fg−1 for 1 Ag−1 current density. The energy density of 12.29 W h/kg and 1600 W/kg power density were achieved for CWC-22 electrode. The stability of the CWC-22 was studied by performing 3000 GCD cycles with excellent capacitance retention rate of 89.4% recorded at 5 Ag–1. The device fabrication and demo performance were also studied. This approach has the potential to accomplish cost-effective, green synthesized bio-derived carbon for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor devices.
