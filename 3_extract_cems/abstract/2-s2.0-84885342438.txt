Polypyrrole nanoparticles were prepared by unstirred oxidation polymerization with TSA as dopant, the structure and morphologies of PPy/TSA nanoparticles were examined by X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Results showed that the diameter of the sphere-like PPy/TSA nanoparticles was ca. 40 nm. The electrochemical performances of PPy/TSA were examined by the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, the results indicated that PPy/TSA nanoparticles were characterized by promising reversible capacitance and had high rate-capability. Their specific capacitance was 270 F g -1 at charging current of 10 mA cm -2. However, the specific capacitance decreased by ca. 25.5% after 1000 charging/discharging cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the repeated charge/ discharge process could increase the charge transfer resistance, and reduce the high-frequency capacity of PPy/ TSA nanoparticles due to the decrease of pore diameter and specific area of the nanoparticles. In contrast, the capacity at low-frequency increased after 1000 cycles. Raman and infrared spectra proved that the deterioration of specific capacity of PPy/TSA nanoparticles was ascribed to the chemical degradation of the PPy/TSA owing to the repeated redox processes of PPy/TSA molecules.
