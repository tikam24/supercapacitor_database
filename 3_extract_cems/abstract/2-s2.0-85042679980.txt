A thermally reduced graphite oxide and carbon nanotube (TRGO-CNT) composite is synthesized for supercapacitor applications by using a simple chemical method. The TRGO-CNT composite shows higher capacitance then the precursors (TRGO and CNT), and its impedance is lower than that of CNT, meaning that TRGO of high surface area connected with a CNT could provide highly efficient surface area and good connection for supercapacitor electrodes. Different weight ratios of TRGO to CNT are investigated, and the results show that the composite with more TRGO has better performance in the electrochemical measurements. Based on these findings, the proper TRGO amount is necessary for a high-performance supercapacitor. Neither CNT nor TRGO by itself can give the highest electrochemical performance for the supercapacitor; thus, the synergistic effect of TRGO and CNT is important.
