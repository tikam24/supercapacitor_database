Zinc stannate (ZTO) nanopowders are synthesized using different cationic surfactants (CTAB, EDA, TEA) via hydrothermal technique. The as prepared samples were then characterized for their structure and optical properties through XRD, FESEM with EDAX, UV-DRS and FTIR techniques. It has been observed, that the surfactant played a crucial role in modifying the morphology of the samples. The reduction in the crystallite size was found when TEA was used as a surfactant. The specific capacitances of the prepared electrode materials using the synthesized samples were evaluated through three electrode system and that the capacitance value increased from 32 to 41F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s for TEA assisted ZTO nanopowder.
