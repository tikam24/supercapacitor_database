This paper proposes a low complexity control and energy management for DC-coupled hybrid microgrid with hybrid energy storage system. The features of the proposed energy management scheme are use of sharing coefficient for effective power sharing between energy storages and grid, seamless mode transitions, faster DC link voltage restoration and improved power quality features in AC grid. In the proposed system the average power demand is shared between the grid and the battery using a dynamic sharing coefficient. Furthermore, supercapacitor is used to reduce the stress in the battery during sudden variation in load demand and power generation. The effectiveness of the proposed energy management scheme is verified by both simulation and experimental studies.
