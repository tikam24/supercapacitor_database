To enhance the energy density, hybrid supercapacitors were fabricated, and their electrochemical features were investigated using a two-electrode configuration. By assembling nitrogen-doped graphene/magnetite (NG/Fe3O4) on indium tin oxide-coated (ITO) glass as a cathode and NG/carbon dots(Cdots)/Fe3O4 on ITO glass as an anode, a much higher gravimetric specific capacitance of 252.2 F/g, at a current density of 0.5 A/g, was obtained from this asymmetric supercapacitor compared with that (212.0 F/g) of a symmetric supercapacitor (NG/Cdots/Fe3O4)//(NG/Cdots/Fe3O4). A gravimetric energy density of 90.1 Wh/kg was obtained for an asymmetric ITO glass device at a specific power density of 400.0 W/kg. On the other hand, when an asymmetric two-electrode cell was fabricated with a Cdots/polypyrrole (PPy)/Fe3O4/TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCNF)-film electrode and a Cdots/PPy/TOCNF-film electrode, the specific capacitance (107.1 F/g) at a current density of 0.8 A/g was lower than that (456.4 F/g) of a symmetric (Cdots/PPy/Fe3O4/TOCNF)//(Cdots/PPy/Fe3O4/TOCNF)-film cell. Subsequently, a gravimetric energy density of 40.6 Wh/kg was achieved for a symmetric-film device at a specific power density of 320 W/kg. These results suggest that our method offers an efficient approach to developing symmetric and asymmetric devices consisting of hybrid materials for meeting the ever-increasing demands on energy-storage devices.
