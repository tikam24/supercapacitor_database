Layered double hydroxides are one class or kind of 2D layered materials that are considered promising for use in the supercapacitor. Although there have been many studies on the structure, composition, properties, and electrode fabrication of layered double hydroxides, none summarize the effects of various modification methods on the structure and performance of layered double hydroxides in the supercapacitor. In a bid to fill this gap, in this review, we summarize the progress of modification methods such as exfoliation, intercalation, vacancy, doping, phase transformation, and composition regulation of layered double hydroxides in the field of the supercapacitor and put forward some opinions regarding the progress of research on the methods used in modifying the layered double hydroxides.
