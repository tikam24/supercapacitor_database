Here, we prepare a ternary hydroxide composite (NiCo2CrX-OH) by a simple one-step hydrothermal method, and the effect of the ratio of Cr on the final composite morphology and electrochemical performance are systematically studied. We find that NiCo2Cr1.5-OH in 6 M KOH has the best electrochemical performance, the mass capacitance is 1101 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and the specific capacitance of NiCo2–OH under the same conditions is 323.7 F g−1. A biomass activated carbon with a porous structure is prepared by the KOH activation method with one-off chopsticks, and it has a specific capacitance of 422.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Using this carbon as the negative electrode material and NiCo2Cr1.5-OH as the positive electrode material, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled and it has an energy density of 33.6 Wh kg−1 (power density, 374.6 W kg−1) when the current density is 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. To prevent the leakage of the electrolyte in the actual application process, the prepared gel electrolyte is used instead of aqueous electrolyte.
