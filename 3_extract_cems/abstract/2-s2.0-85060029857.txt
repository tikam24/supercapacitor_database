The dielectric and electrochemical studies for graphene oxide (GO) incorporated poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PVA/PEDOT:PSS) composites are reported here. A high dielectric constant (ε′) of 2.45 × 10 4 and dielectric loss (ε″) of 1.2 × 10 6 were observed for 1.5 wt.% GO in PVA/PEDOT:PSS at 303 K. This is due to the inter-barrier layer created by GO between PVA and PEDOT:PSS through strong π-π interaction between GO and PEDOT:PSS as well as inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding with PVA. The interaction between GO and PVA/PEDOT:PSS resulted in the formation of rod-like structure of GO/PVA/PEDOT:PSS composite. A semiconductor-insulator-semiconductor transition was observed in the GO/PVA/PEDOT:PSS composite due to the removal of hydroxyl groups and reduction of GO. An interesting cross-over in ε″ was observed at 353 K due to the removal of hydroxyl groups followed by a decrease in ε″ with increasing temperature and GO content. Electrochemical studies suggested that composites are pseudocapacitive in nature. Specific capacitance for 3 wt% GO in PVA/PEDOT:PSS (PPGO3) was calculated to be 205 Fg -1 at 1 Ag -1 . Cyclic stability greater than 100% and 99% Coulombic efficiency were observed for PPGO3 at 3 Ag -1 and 3000 charge-discharge cycles, respectively.
