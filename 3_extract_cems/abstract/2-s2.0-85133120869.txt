The current problem of ensuring the load schedule of the electric power system (EPS) is a long-term one that needs constant development and improvement of the means of solving it. Modern EPS have characteristic features, the steady growth of uneven load curves; increasing the steepness of the load curves; the inevitable enlargement of power plant equipment. In recent years, a real opportunity has appeared to create a capacitive-storage energy source based on supercapacitors with increased energy intensity. At present, on the basis of anomalous capacitors, an energy storage device (ES) and an experimental process have been created, the power of which in EPS model is 10 kW. The level of stored energy is determined by the type of storage element (30 kJ or more). The purpose of this article is to develop effective methods to improve the reliability of power supply to Consumers based on modern energy storage devices.
