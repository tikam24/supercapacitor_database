Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (NHCs) are novel energy storage devices between traditional capacitors and batteries; the electrode materials of NHCs have attracted increasing attention. In this study, a NiMoO4 and activated carbon (AC) have been used as the anode and cathode materials of NHCs, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the NiMoO4//AC NHC system has been reported for the first time. The NiMoO4 was successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal route. The NiMoO4//AC system has a high energy density of 62.4 Wh kg-1 and a high power density of 3500 W kg-1. It also exhibits prominent cycling stability, with a capacity retention of about 70% after 6000 cycles. This excellent electrochemical performance can be attributed to the nanosheet structure of NiMoO4, which can increase the contact area between the electrolyte and the active material, thus promoting the rapid insertion and extraction of Na ions. Therefore, the NiMoO4 are promising anode materials for NHCs.
