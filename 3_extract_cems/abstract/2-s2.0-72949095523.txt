Sliding mode control of boost converter is studied. In order to improve dynamical performances with static and dynamic specifications, we propose a systematic procedure to compute the gains of the controller based on an optimization scheme. This method is applied to the control of an energy storage system based on supercapacitors technology in order to regulate the output voltage. Given a system with large variations of input voltage and load, it is necessary to guarantee good performance of the controller for large variations of operating point. Our study shows the great influence of the controller gains on the static and dynamic performances of the system. Hence, we point out a methodology for choosing the gains.
