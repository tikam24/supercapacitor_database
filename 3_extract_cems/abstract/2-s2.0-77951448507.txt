The sheet-like α-Co(OH)2 composed of the uniform nanoparticles was successfully prepared using cobalt chloride as the raw material and polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the dispersant by chemical precipitation method. The components of products were analyzed by FTIR and the structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM), respectively. The electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge techniques. The test results show that an extraordinary high specific capacitance value of 1220 F/g is achieved, and the α-Co(OH)2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
