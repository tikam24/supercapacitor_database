Diabetes is a serious medical disease that involves regular blood glucose monitoring. There is a huge demand for cost-effective glucose sensors that can rapidly and accurately measure blood glucose levels. To meet this demand, nonenzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors have been developed for clinical research and are of significant interest. A CuO/rGO/BiOBr (CRB) composite was synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Electrochemical studies were conducted on the as-prepared composite to evaluate its suitability for sensing and energy storage applications. In this study, the sensing ability of the composites was examined at various molar concentrations of glucose. Thus, the synthesized composite exhibited a high sensitivity and excellent selectivity for glucose sensing. In addition, the CV, GCD and EIS findings indicate that the electrode is a suitable candidate for supercapacitor application. The synergetic effect of the materials makes the composite well-suited for dual applications.
