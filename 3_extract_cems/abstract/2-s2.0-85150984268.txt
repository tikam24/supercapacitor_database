Ag mixed Cd–Cu nanoferrite (Cd0.5Cu0.25Ag0.25Fe2O4; Ag-CCF) has been successfully prepared by co-precipitation method. The grain size of Ag mixed Cd–Cu ferrite was 10 nm estimated by HRTEM; while the specific surface area was measured by BET was 161 m2/g. The XRD measurement shows a good crystallization ferrite phase and FT-IR spectrum represents two characterized bands of spinel ferrite 428 cm−1 and 596 cm−1. The three broad peaks of Raman spectrum 276 cm−1, 386 cm−1 and 643 cm−1 are characterized of spinel phase. The VSM measurement has represented superparamagnetism with saturation magnetization 30 emu/g, remnant magnetization 1 emu/g and coercive field 38G. The Ag-CCF/rGO (reduced grapheme oxide) composite used for electrode in supercapacitor deliver specific capacitance of 306 F/g at scan rate 5 mV/s. Nyquist plot represented that charge transfer resistance of the Cd–CuFe2O4/rGO composites (82.3 Ω) was much smaller than that of the pristine Cd-CuFe2O4 (591 Ω). This can be ascribed to the introduction of conductive graphene improved the electrical conductivity of the composites, leading to the better rate capability and higher specific capacitance in comparison with the pristine Cd–CuFe2O4.
