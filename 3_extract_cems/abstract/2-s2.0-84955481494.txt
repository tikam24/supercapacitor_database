Micro energy storage devices have drawn increasing attention due to the importance of power supply in miniaturized multi-functional systems. This paper reviews the recent progress in micro energy storage devices, particularly the micro supercapacitors, including the design issues of device architectures, electrode materials, and fabrication technologies. The work developed in our laboratory is then demonstrated, mainly a method of direct prototyping of nanoporous carbon for batch-fabricated micro energy storage devices, like three-dimensional micro supercapacitors and silicon-based anode for Li-ion batteries.
