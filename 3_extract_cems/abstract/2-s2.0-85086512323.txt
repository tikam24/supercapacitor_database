Electrodes have been recognized as one of the most influential components in the performance of electrochemical supercapacitors. Due to decades of research by scientists, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors has reached a constant level where it needs considerable progress for use in practical high-power applications. Recently discovered carbon-based quantum dots can overcome the limitations of current supercapacitors. These materials can contribute to blooming supercapacitors with significantly higher specific capacitance, energy density or power density thanks to synergistic effects of improved electrochemical reactivity, electrical conductivity, and the charge accumulation on the surface. In this review, it is tried to comprehensively understand the fundamentals of quantum dots especially carbon dots and graphene quantum dots briefly. Then properties and synthesis routes of graphene quantum dots and carbon dots are studied in detail. Finally, their contribution to supercapacitorsâ€™ improvement and development since their discovery is reviewed.
