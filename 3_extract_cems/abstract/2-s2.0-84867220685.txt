In the present work, the atmospheric pressure plasma jet and magnetron sputtering deposition technology was used for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. It was shown that the parameters of supercapacitors strongly depend on the secondary carbon layer thickness. The increase of the carbon layer thickness from 1 to 2 Î¼m, the relative oxygen quantity decreases from 8 dawn to 1.5 at.%, meanwhile the supercapacitor capacity increases from 7 up to 16 mF.
