Herein, a facile synthesis has been explored to prepare carbon aerogel/Ni foam. Graphene oxide, resorcinol and formaldehyde serve as precursors and polymerize in-situ on the Ni foam after hydrothermal synthesis at 85 Â°C. After lyophilization treatment, the carbon aerogel/Ni foam with porous structure can be obtained. Electrochemical investigations reveal that the carbon aerogel/Ni foam exhibits superior performances in both aqueous and organic electrolytes involving high specific capacitance and long-term cycling stability. The excellent properties can be ascribed to the unique formation and porous structure, which allows more effective transportations of electron and electrolyte ion.
