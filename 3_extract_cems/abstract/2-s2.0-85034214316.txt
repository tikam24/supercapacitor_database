The graphene with 3D porous network structure is directly laser-induced on polyimide sheets at room temperature in ambient environment by an inexpensive and one-step method, then transferred to silicon rubber substrate to obtain highly stretchable, transparent, and flexible electrode of the all-solid-state planar microsupercapacitors. The electrochemical capacitance properties of the graphene electrodes are further enhanced by nitrogen doping and with conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) coating. With excellent flexibility, stretchability, and capacitance properties, the planar microsupercapacitors present a great potential in fashionable and comfortable designs for wearable electronics.
