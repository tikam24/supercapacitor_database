Three-dimensional (3D) graphene network deposition on Ni foam without any conductive agents and polymer binders was successfully synthesized by radio frequency magnetron sputtering at low temperature. The direct and close contact between graphene and Ni foam is beneficial to the enhanced conductivity of the electrode, as well as the improvement of ion diffusion/transport into the electrode. As a result, the 3D graphene network deposition on Ni foam electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 122.0 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability with capacitance retention of 99.0% after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. The work shows a new way to facile synthesis of 3D graphene network for various applications in the future. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
