A novel high efficient hybrid power with ultra-capacitor (UC) for electric vehicle (EV) is proposed in this paper. On this basis, the energy management strategies are designed according to various work modes of the EV. Two switch schemes could be achieved in the proposed hybrid power while discharging, and the UC would have the highest priority to recycle the energy in the recharge scheme. Simulation results show that the over-discharge of the batteries could be avoid and efficiency could be improved up to 3.5% in the proposed hybrid power, comparing to the equally improved hybrid power.
