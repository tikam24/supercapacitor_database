To prepare an efficient supercapacitor, an activated carbon from agave wastes was prepared and their electrochemical performance was evaluated as a novel electrode for supercapacitor. The carbon was prepared by two thermal pyrolysis processes under nitrogen atmosphere. The first pyrolysis was achieved at 500 °C until the charring of the bagasse; in the second pyrolysis step, the char was impregnated with different mass ratios of KOH (1:2–1:4) and thermally treated at 800 or 900 °C, for 1 h under N2 flow. The textural analysis showed that the activated carbon had a specific surface area of 1462 m2 g−1 and depicted a type I isotherm (IUPAC) characteristic of a microporous carbon. Raman spectroscopy and XRD measurements confirm that the activated carbon contains a small graphitization degree and a disordered structure. The electrochemical study of the symmetric carbon supercapacitor was carried out in 1 M Li2SO4 solution as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of the coin cell supercapacitor was evaluated under an accelerated aging floating test consisting of potentiostatic steps at different voltages (1.5, 1.6 and 1.8 V) for 10 h followed by galvanostatic charge/discharge sequences, and the overall procedure summarized a floating time up to 200 h. The highest capacitance was observed at a floating voltage of 1.5 V, with a large initial specific capacitance of 297 F g−1.
