The composite hybrid with novel hierarchical structure composed of 1T/2H MoS2 nanoflower and watermelon-like FeS2@carbon nanospheres (FeS2@C@MoS2) were synthesized via a facile method. Morphologies and structures of the hybrid were investigated thoroughly by using SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, XPS and BET. The optimized composite hybrid with an appropriate ratio of carbon, FeS2 and MoS2 performs a high specific capacitance (1321.4 F·g−1 at 2 A·g−1) and a capacitance retention rate of 81.2% at 6 A·g−1 after 1000 cycles charge-discharge. Such new material has the potential to be a strong competitor in high performance supercapacitor electrode materials, and this facile synthesized method can hopefully be applied or as a reference to develop other metal sulfide@MoS2 hybrid or multiple sulfides hybrid.
