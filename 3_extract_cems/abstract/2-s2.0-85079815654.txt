Bamboo-derived cellulose fibers/RGO carbon aerogel composite was prepared by using a facile aerogel-based method, in which bamboo pulp fibers were dissolved and incorporated in an ionic liquid system, and RGO was introduced by thermal reduction approach. The obtained bamboo-derived cellulose fibers/RGO carbon aerogel composite shows a large specific surface area, and excellent electrochemical performance. When the GO content was 2.5 wt%, the obtained composite showed a high specific surface area of 1957 m2/g, and high specific capacitance of 351 F/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution even with a more than 90% capacitance retention at a high scan rate of 200 mV/s. The bamboo-derived cellulose fibers/RGO composite electrodes show the low equivalent series resistance of 5.0 Ω and small charge transfer resistance of 0.30 Ω which further demonstrate the excellent electrochemical behaviors.
