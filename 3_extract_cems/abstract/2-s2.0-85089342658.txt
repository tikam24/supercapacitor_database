Recently, the rapid progress of flexible electronics has attracted tremendous attention for the potential on revolutionizing human lives. Originally, flexible on-chip energy-storage devices, such as micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), have become the matchable microscale power source for wearable and portable electronics. Herein, latest advances of flexible planar MSCs and their integrated systems are briefly reviewed. Firstly, the fundamentals of flexible MSCs including planar and sandwich configuration of MSCs, one dimensional (1D) nanomaterials, 2D nanomaterials, and 2D nanocomposites electrode materials, different kinds of gel polymer electrolytes, fabrication technologies, and performance evaluation metrics are investigated. Secondly, MSCs powered integrated systems for flexible electronics with multifunction of photodetection, gas sensing, motion monitoring, body fluid monitoring, and lighting micro-LED are reviewed comprehensively. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for industrial manufacturing technology and practical applications of micro-supercapacitors powered integrated systems are briefly discussed.
