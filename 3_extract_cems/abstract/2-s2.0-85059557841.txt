Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ), a graphene-like two-dimensional layered material, exhibits a great application prospect in high-performance energy storage devices. To overcome poor electrical conductivity and large volume change of pure MoS 2 material, we herein apply an effective encapsulation strategy to prepare a core-shell structured MoS 2 @mesoporous hollow carbon spheres nanocomposite, which is used as an excellent electrode material for aqueous supercapacitors and hybrid Li-ion capacitors for the first time. The results indicate that mesoporous hollow carbon spheres shell not only effectively confines the growth of MoS 2 nanosheets inside shells, but also improve significantly the conductivity and structural stability of the nanocomposite. The nanocomposite electrode delivers a high specific capacitance (613.4 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and good rate performance (358.2 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 ) as well as excellent cycle performance for aqueous supercapacitors. More importantly, an ultrahigh specific energy density of 208 Wh kg −1 at 200 W kg −1 (82 Wh kg −1 at 10,000 W kg −1 ) is demonstrated for hybrid Li-ion capacitors based on the nanocomposite anode. The observed specific energy density is among the highest values reported to date.
