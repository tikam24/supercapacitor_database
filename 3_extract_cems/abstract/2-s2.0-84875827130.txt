In order to enhance the application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in electrochemical energy storage, we reviewed the production and purification technology of CNTs, as well as the application in Li-ion battery, supercapacitors (SC), and asymmetric SC. In detail, the formation mechanism, the effects influencing the diameter, diameter distribution, yield and growth rate of CNTs, and the reactor technology for scale up were thoroughly discussed. And the purity, the type of impurities and factors influencing the formation of impurities, and the purification method of CNTs were summarized on the basis of the requirements in the electrochemical use. Finally, the performance of CNTs used in energy storage systems and the challenge for the commercialization were analyzed. The review provides abundant information for better understanding of the relationship between the structure, property of CNTs and its performance.
