Newly developed electrochemical energy storage devices are typically produced as single/small quantity and small size devices. This makes their evaluation very difficult in high power applications that would require production of much larger size devices and higher quantities. Also, doing practical work in an electrical engineering labs with chemical devices not fully certified from safety point of view may raise additional restrictions. This paper investigates the implementation of a digitally controlled power electronics based emulator that can be used to implement the behaviour of various energy storage devices. The evaluation of the emulator performance is done in conjunction to the previous work characterising a novel energy storage device, the Supercapattery.
