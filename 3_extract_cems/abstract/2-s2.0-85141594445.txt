With the development of science and technology, wearable electronic devices have become an important part of people's life, and there are higher requirements for energy storage devices. As a branch of fibrous electronic energy storage devices, fibrous supercapacitors have the advantages of high power density, fast charging and discharging, long cycle life and environmental friendliness of ordinary supercapacitors, but also have the advantages of light mass, small size, and good mechanical properties to satisfy the energy storage requirements of wearable electronic devices, so they are considered as one of the important energy storage devices for wearable electronic devices. However, the substrate of fibrous supercapacitor electrodes has various defects. In order to explore the methods to improve the electrode performance, this paper focuses on the modification strategies of fibrous electrodes from different electrodes, including two parts of surface modification and bulk phase doping, and summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of different modification strategies. In addition, a summary of the preparation of fibre electrodes, the structural configuration of fibrous supercapacitors, and the evaluation parameters of the performance of fibrous supercapacitors is also described. Finally, a short conclusion on the current development situation of fibrous supercapacitors, the risks and challenges faced, and the solutions are given.
