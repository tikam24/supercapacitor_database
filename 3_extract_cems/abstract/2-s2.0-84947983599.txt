Cadmium hydroxide [Cd(OH)2] nanowires have been successfully synthesized by a simple chemical bath deposition method (CBD) on a stainless-steel (SS) substrate. By scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the surface architecture displays the formation of bundles of high-surface-area nanowires (NWs), which are beneficial for supercapacitor applications. Cd(OH)2 NWs on SS has been tested as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications via electrochemical studies by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in an aqueous electrolyte. Electrochemical data confirm that Cd(OH)2 NWs thin-film electrode exhibits supercapacitor behavior, having a yield of 267 F g-1 specific capacitance at 5 mV s-1 scan rate with excellent cycling life (86% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles). A Cd(OH)2/Cd(OH)2 symmetric supercapacitor device provides a maximum energy density of 11.09 W h kg-1 and a power density of 799 W kg-1 at a current density of 0.84 A g-1. The present work demonstrates that Cd(OH)2 NWs thin film is a promising, low-cost alternative material prepared by a simple, binder-free chemical bath deposition method (CBD) for supercapacitor applications.
