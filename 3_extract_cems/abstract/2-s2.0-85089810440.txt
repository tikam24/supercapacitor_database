The large-scale application of wind power eases the shortage of conventional energy, but it also brings great hidden danger to the stability and security of the power grid because wind power has no ability for frequency regulation. When doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind turbines use rotor kinetic energy to participate in frequency regulation, it can effectively respond to frequency fluctuation, but has the problems of secondary frequency drop and output power loss. Furthermore, it cannot provide long-term power support. To solve these problems, a coordinated frequency control strategy based on rotor kinetic energy and supercapacitor was proposed in this paper. In order to ensure the DFIG provides fast and long-term power support, a supercapacitor was used to realize the droop characteristic, and rotor kinetic energy was used to realize the inertia characteristic like synchronous generator (SG). Additionally, the supercapacitor is also controlled to compensate for the power dip of the DFIG when rotor kinetic energy exits inertia support to avoid secondary frequency drop. Additionally, a new tracking curve of DFIG rotor speed and output power was adopted to reduce the power loss during rotor speed recovery.
