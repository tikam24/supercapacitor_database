Two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets were deposited on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanostructure by in situ hydrothermal method. In this method, MoS2 nanosheets were selectively formed on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets suspended in solution. The resulting rGO/MoS2 hybrid material consists of a few-layered MoS2 structures with abundant exposed edges stacked onto the reduced graphene oxide, in strong contrast to large aggregated MoS2 layer grown freely in solution without GO. The prepared hybrid structure was subjected to XRD, SEM, HRTEM, TGA and FTIR analyses. The Cyclic voltammetric measurement revealed the promising electrochemical property of this hybrid material with wide potential window, high Coulombic efficiency and strong cycling stability.
