We report an effective strategy for the preparation of nitrogen/oxygen co-doped porous carbons (DQPACs) based on a facile, low-cost, high-yield polymerization between 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone and p-phenylenediamine in acetic acid solvent without any catalyst, and then subjected to carbonization and KOH activation at 600–800 °C. The resultant DQPAC-700 exhibits abundant micropores, large specific surface area (1659.97 m2 g–1), and a high level of nitrogen/oxygen doping contents (as high as 4.09 wt.% and 10.84 wt.%, respectively). Therefore, the DQPAC-700 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors, delivering the maximum specific capacitance of 292 F g–1 at 0.5 A g–1 and a good rate capacitance of 167 F g–1 at 50 A g–1 in 6 M KOH electrolytes. The optimized supercapacitor displays a high cycling stability (capacitance retention up to 96% after 20,000 cycles at 5 A g–1) and a moderate energy density (11.3 Wh kg–1 at 103 W kg–1). When using 1 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte, the energy density can be further improved to 25.6 Wh kg–1. The results indicate that our polymerization approach is facile and effective, which can be extended to develop other nitrogen-rich polymers for the creation of more porous carbon materials with abundant nitrogen/oxygen species.
