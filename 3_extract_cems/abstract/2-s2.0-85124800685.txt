The rational construction of hierarchical electrode materials has always been an attractive strategic development in energy storage. In this paper, the porous Ni/C (NC) substrate, which is derived from Ni metal–organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs), is served as the conductive skeleton on Ni foam (NF) for supporting two different morphologies NiCo2O4 nanostructure arrays (NiCo2O4/NC). The hierarchical layered nanomaterial utilizes the porous NC substrate as “favorable skeleton” for electron transfer and is coupled to vertical well-organized NiCo2O4 nanoarrays to improve specific capacitance of composites. Benefits from the advantages of hierarchical layered structure, the electrochemical properties of as-constructed NiCo2O4/NC with two different morphologies were better than those of pure NiCo2O4 prepared under the same conditions. Moreover, the optimized NiCo2O4 nanowires arrays on NC substrate (NiCo2O4NWs/NC) electrode acquire prominent specific capacitance of 1945.9 F g−1 (270.3 mAh g−1) at 1 A g−1 and good rate performance. Additionally, the assembled asymmetric device by NiCo2O4NWs/NC and carbon nanotube (CNT) displays a high energy density of 58.31 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 749.7 W kg−1, as well as good cyclic stability. The remarkable properties manifest that the hierarchical NiCo2O4NWs/NC electrode has a good prospect in electrochemical applications.
