Cobalt-based multicomponent oxides nanocomposites deliver extraordinary rate capabilities and electrochemical capacitance owing to the fast reaction kinetics, regarded as advanced electrodes for novel renewable energy harvest and conversion with great attention recently. Herein, by manipulating the concentration of fluoride ions (F−), the in-situ agglomeration states of cobalt oxides nanowires on 3D Ni Foam are investigated systemically, which benefiting the further growth of novel spinel Co2NiO4 through electrochemical routine. Acting as the positive electrode for supercapacitor, Co2NiO4@Co3O4 composite exhibits the specific capacitance as high as 1241.8 F g−1, together with the excellent rate capabilities of 92.83% retention with a 20-fold specific current increase. Based on the kinetics analysis, the capacitive contribution achieves 83.3% at the scan rates of 50 mV s−1. Matching core-shell like Co2NiO4@Co3O4 composites with self N,O-doped conducting polymers derived carbon, as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices could deliver an energy density of 85.97 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 0.8 W kg−1. Taking advantage of Faradic redox electrodes couple with pseudocapacitive ones can be proved as a promising way to obtain high performance energy storage devices.
