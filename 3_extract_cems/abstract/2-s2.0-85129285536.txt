An attempt has been made to prepare Graphene-Fe3O4-polypyrrole (GFP) based ternary material as an electrode for pseudocapacitors. The GFP nanocomposite materials were fabricated well by a simple hydrothermal route. The as-prepared materials were well characterized by conventional analytical techniques. Polypyrrole helps the Fe3O4 nanoparticles to anchor on the graphene oxide surface and inhibits the aggregation of sheets of graphene as well as Fe3O4 particles. It also improves the electrochemical performance to estimate the performance of electrochemical behavior of the prepared ternary electrode material for cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge, and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI) in which a three-electrode system has been used at room temperature in an aqueous electrolyte. The effect of scan rate and current density has also been studied on electrochemical performance. At a constant current density of 2.5 A/g, the maximum specific capacitance 180.18F/g is found and the specific capacitance is 204F/g in 1 M KOH solution of the ternary composite at a 5 mV/s scan rate. Furthermore, the energy density of 140.76 Wh/kg exhibited by the capacitor at a reasonable high-power density of 5680 W/kg, which is appreciably greater than parent materials.
