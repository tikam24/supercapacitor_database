The graphene-like carbon was obtained from macadamia nut shells by an activated hydrothermal method and applied for high-performance supercapacitors. The morphologies and microstructures are investigated by X-ray diffractometer, Raman spectrometer, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results show that the obtained carbon exhibits perfect graphene-like structure filled with more micropores and mesopores. The graphene-like carbon displays high surface areas of 1057 m2 g−1. The graphene-like carbon delivers an impressive specific capacitance of 251 F g−1 and has no capacitance loss at the current density of 1 A g−1 after 1000 cycles, which demonstrates the excellent cycle stability and high specific capacitance. The graphene-like carbon derived from macadamia nut shells can be expected for the widespread application of supercapacitors.
