Electric vehicles (EVs) have been recently developed in advance levels and in particular the battery technologies have also been developed. Although the development in battery technology has been advanced, the usage does not entirely accompany the power consumption. There are harmful electrochemical processes in battery technology. But there is a solution by changing its architecture to couple the battery with a supercapacitor to have a high rate battery cycle and a better capability. A supercapacitor gives more energy to battery in case more energy is needed. In this designing and architecture, supercapacitor and battery are considered to be different units and in electrical engineering point of view it is considered to be a hybrid system. This manuscript is devoted to review recent works on applications of battery and supercapacitor of EVs.
