In the work, we report a facile synthesis of Bis-(pththalimidoethyl)-amine functionalized graphene oxide (GO-bis(PIEA)) using a masked diethylenetriamine derivative as an intercalating agent on the surface of GO for the supercapacitor applications. The prepared material was fully characterized by XRD, XPS, Raman and microscopic techniques and its fluorescence behaviour due to the presence of phthalimide conjugate was also studied. The GO-bis(PIEA) material shows the sheets like nanostructure with d-spacing of 1.1 nm (2θ = 8.7 deg.) between the sheets due to the covalent intercalation and thereby exhibits better specific capacitance of 287 F g−1 at a specific current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. A very low capacitance degradation of 5.5% was noted up to 1000 cycles. The GO-bis(PIEA) material was also working well as a selective fluorescent chemosensor for Ni2+ ion in aqueous solution at neutral pH and proves no cross-reaction with any of the potential interfering metal ions. The dual enhancement of dissimilar properties such as capacitance and fluorescence emphasized the continued significance of covalent functionalization towards tuning the properties of graphene-based materials.
