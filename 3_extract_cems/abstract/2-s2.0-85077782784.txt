Despite the great advantages of manganese oxide/carbon composites as the electrodes for supercapacitors, homogeneous hybrid with intimate contact between manganese oxide and carbon has been rarely achieved. Here, spindle Mn2O3/carbon hybrid was designed and synthesized via a hydrothermal process following a heat treatment procedure, in which Mn2O3 was homogeneously and intimately contacted with carbon. When the Mn2O3/carbon hybrid was evaluated as the active material in an asymmetric supercapacitor, a specific capacitance of 235 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 50 mA g−1, and a rate capability was 44.9% specific capacitance retention even when the current density is increased by 100 times, as well as a long-term cycle was stabilize.
