With increasing energy demand driving the need for eco-friendly and efficient energy storage technology, supercapacitors are becoming increasingly prevalent in wearable devices because of their portability and stability. The performance of these supercapacitors is highly dependent on the choice of electrode material. The high capacitance and mechanical properties needed for these materials can be achieved by combining graphene’s stable electrical properties with renewable cellulose’s excellent mechanical properties into porous aerogels. In this study, graphene-cellulose hydrogels were prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method, with porous, ultra-light, and mechanically strong graphene-cellulose aerogels then prepared by freeze-drying. These composite aerogels possess excellent mechanical strength and high specific capacitance, capable of bearing about 1095 times the pressure of their own weight. Electrochemical tests show the specific capacitance of these composite aerogels can reach 202 F/g at a scanning rate of 5 mA/cm2 . In view of their high surface area and fast charge transport provided by their 3D porous structure, graphene-cellulose aerogels have great potential as sustainable supercapacitor electrodes.
