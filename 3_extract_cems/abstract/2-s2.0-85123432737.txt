Herein, we reported the synthesis of polymer electrolyte prepared using polymer PVDF-HFP and PTA doped using well known solution cast technique method. There was a huge hike in the conductivity recorded while incorporating of PTA with polymer PVDF-HFP which was scrutinized by complex impedance spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was done to check the complexity of blended polymer PVDF-HFP with PTA. Polarized optical microscopy was also done to check the amorphousity of the polymer electrolyte. A good stable Electric double layer capacitor was fabricated using optimized polymer electrolyte film which shows reasonable efficiency.
