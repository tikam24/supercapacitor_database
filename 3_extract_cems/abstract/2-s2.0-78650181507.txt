Classical wind energy conversion systems are usually passive generators. The generated power does not depend on the grid requirement but entirely on the fluctuant wind condition. A dc-coupled wind/hydrogen/supercapacitor hybrid power system is studied in this paper. The purpose of the control system is to coordinate these different sources, particularly their power exchange, in order to make controllable the generated power. As a result, an active wind generator can be built to provide some ancillary services to the grid. The control system should be adapted to integrate the power management strategies. Two power management strategies are presented and compared experimentally. We found that the source-following strategy has better performances on the grid power regulation than the grid-following strategy. Â© 2006 IEEE.
