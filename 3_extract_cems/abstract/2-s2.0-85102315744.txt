The energy density of a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor (ASC) requires new electrode material with special structure and morphology as a prerequisite for its secured improvement. In this paper, a new morphological exploration of chicken nuggets-like core/shell NiCo2O4/MnO2 (NCM) nanosheet arrays on Ni foam was employed. The application of this special morphology aims to greatly improve the electrochemical performance of the cathode electrode. Additionally, Buckwheat Biochar (BBC) is utilized as the anode while the PVA/KOH thin film is prepared as the separator. The chicken nuggets-like core/shell NCM nanosheet arrays were obtained by a two-step hydrothermal method. A series of characterization methods were carried out to further support the core/shell's well-designed structure and precise composition. The tests exhibited excellent specific capacitance of 593.3 F g−1 at 5 mA cm−2 and outstanding cycling stability with a retention of 90% after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled NCM//BBC ASC device indicated a high specific capacitance (239 F g−1 at the current density of 5 mA cm−2), this is in due part of the unique architecture of NCM nanosheet arrays and interconnected special porous structure of the BBC and the thin film PVA/KOH. Hence, the assembled ASC device exhibited high energy density (an energy density of 58 Wh·kg−1 at 3263 W kg−1) and remarkable cycling stability.
