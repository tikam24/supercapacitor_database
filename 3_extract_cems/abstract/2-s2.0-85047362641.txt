Polyaniline(PANI) nanotubes have been successfully synthesised at room temperature by the chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline with Ammoniumpersulphate(APS) in aqueous acetic acid. Chemically synthesised PANI nanotubes were characterized using Field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM), Brunauer - Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, X ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The super capacitive performance of the synthesised PANI nanotubes was tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique in H2SO4 electrolyte with in potential range of -0.2 to 0.8V. The effect of scan rates on specific capacitance of PANI electrode was studied. The highest specific capacitance of 232.2Fg-1 was obtained for the scan rate of 5mVs-1. This study suggests that the synthesized PANI nanotubes are excellent candidate for developing electrode materials for supercapacitors.
