Self-healability is essential for supercapacitors to improve their reliability and lifespan when powering the electronics. However, the lack of a universal healing mechanism leads to low capacitive performance and unsatisfactory intelligence. Here, we demonstrate a multi-responsive healable supercapacitor with integrated configuration assembled from magnetic Fe3O4@Au/polyacrylamide (MFP) hydrogel-based electrodes and electrolyte and Ag nanowire films as current collectors. Beside a high mechanical strength, MFP hydrogel exhibits fast optical and magnetic healing properties arising from distinct photothermal and magneto-thermal triggered interfacial reconstructions. By growing electroactive polypyrrole nanoparticles into MFP framework as electrodes, the assembled supercapacitor exhibits triply-responsive healing performance under optical, electrical and magnetic stimuli. Notably, the device delivers a highest areal capacitance of 1264 mF cmâˆ’2 among the reported healable supercapacitors and restores ~ 90% of initial capacitances over ten healing cycles. These prominent performance advantages along with the facile device-assembly method make this emerging supercapacitor highly potential in the next-generation electronics.
