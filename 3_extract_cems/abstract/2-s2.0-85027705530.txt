Lately, new solutions have been added to the control of autonomous grids, which improve the way the power grids operate. These changes may affect the reliability and safety of power distribution grids, the dynamic stability being a real concern. This issue is more prominent in autonomous microgrids (MGs) with high penetration of renewable energy sources. On this topic, this paper aims to study how photovoltaic (PV) power plants can provide dynamic frequency support in MGs, in order to obtain an improved stability for the entire power system. For this purpose, a supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system is integrated in the PV power plant, by this way ensuring a better control and a higher stability during the transitory regimes. The proposed solution is validated by means of simulation results.
