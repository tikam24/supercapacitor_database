In recent years, the green synthesis of porous carbon electrode materials with high specific surface area has aroused extensive research. In this work, the dictyophora with special inherent structure was employed to prepare porous activated carbon (DHC) by hydrothermal carbonization. Compared with traditional alkali activation, the activation temperature used in this work is lower. The resultant 3D porous carbon, rich in N and O elements, can provide large active surface area, pseudo-capacitance and good electrochemical behavior. Specifically, DHC has high charge storage capacity (up to 310.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), good rate capability (85.4% from 0.5 A g−1 to 10 A g−1) and excellent cycle stability (96.1% after 5000 cycles).
