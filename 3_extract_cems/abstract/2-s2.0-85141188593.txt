Siloxane-based molecular material, by virtue of its unique chemical structure, thermal and electrochemical properties, has triggered tremendous research interest and sparked a revolution for energy storage in the past years. Siloxanes and their analogues are generally demonstrated to be more environmentally friendly, durable, and safer when employed to reconstruct the nano-micro surface structure of electrodes, separators, and their interfaces with electrolytes. To better understand the recent and comprehensive achievement of siloxane-based materials in energy storage, a systematic summary is necessary to provide important clues, aiming at achieving better electrochemical properties. In this Minireview, siloxane materials are presented comprehensively and systematically in terms of molecule design, functionality, and unique superiority for lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The challenges, perspectives, and future directions of siloxane-based organosilicon materials are put forward for higher performance and wider application in electrochemical energy storage devices.
