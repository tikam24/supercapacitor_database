Graphene oxide – Iridium Oxide structures show high capacitance performance potential in terms of applications in supercapacitors. The scope of this study is synthesizing GO via Hummers Method and use it for the coating of various substrates. Accordingly, various supercapacitors in the form of thin film, namely glass/GO/IrO2, PMMA/GO/IrO2, FTO/GO/IrO2 and ITO/GO/IrO2, were successfully produced via chemical bath deposition (CBD) on various substrates. Structural characterizations were analyzed through SEM, XRD, ATR, UV and AFM. In addition, I-V and C-V characteristics were investigated and energy densities were calculated for a voltage range (from −0.2 to 1.2 V), at scanning speed of 25 mV/s, 50 mV/s, 75 mV/s and 100 mV/s. It was found that all thin films supercapacitors structures (glass/GO/IrO2, PMMA/GO/IrO2, FTO/GO/IrO2 and ITO/GO/IrO2) reached their maximum capacitance values at the scanning rate of 25 mV/s, which were found to be 551.7 F/g, 837.7 F/g, 433.2 F/g and 569.7 F/g; and the energy intensities were calculated as 15.3 Wh/kg, 34.9 Wh/kg, 7.2 Wh/kg and 12.64 Wh/kg respectively.
