Nickel hydroxide is a promising material for supercapacitor application due to its relatively low cost, well-defined electrochemical redox nature and easy to prepare with different structural morphologies. In the present study, nickel hydroxide was cathodically deposited on a stainless steel surface from an electrolyte containing Ni(NO3)2as a result of local increaseinp H at the cathode. Anonionicsurfactant (Pluronic P123, HO (CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH2O)20H) was added to the solution in order to get enhanced nanocrystalline nickel hydroxide film. The film was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction method and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to investigate its surface and morphological characteristics. The grain size of the as prepared nickel hydroxide was about 11 nm and this was achieved because of the presence of nonionic surfactant, which influences the microstructure of the deposit. Cyclic voltammetry was used to study the reduction and oxidation processes in the electrodeposited nickel hydroxide electrode, characterize the specific capacitance and evaluate the suitability of the synthesized films for supercapacitor application. The charge-discharge dependences were recorded to study the capacitive property of the material. The results showed that the prepared nickel hydroxide electrodes have specific capacitance of about 494 F/g.
