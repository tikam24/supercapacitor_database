A simple and convenient cathodic electrodeposition was developed to prepare a cerium-nickel-bimetallic organic framework (Ce/Ni-MOFs) on carbon cloth and directly used as a supercapacitor electrode material. The two metal ions produced a good synergistic effect and formed a unique folded morphology. The higher capacitance, charge transfer and excellent multiplicative performance of the bimetallic MOFs compared with the monometallic MOFs were found by electrochemical tests, which also demonstrated the scalability of the cathodic electrodeposition method. In addition, the flexible supercapacitor assembled based on Ce/Ni-MOFs and graphene oxide (denoted as Ce/Ni-MOFs//GO) achieved a high voltage of 1.7 V and exhibited high capacitance (298.8 mF cm−2), excellent energy density (120.1 μWh cm−2) and good durability (93 % after 5000 cycles).
