The development of carbon materials with large specific surface area (SSA) and abundant porosity is very essential to construct high-performance supercapacitors. In consideration of the superiority of polymer-based carbon sources on structure and yield, herein, a unique organic polymer is selected to prepare hierarchical porous carbon material, where the key to converting polymer into porous carbon is to combine the activation process of potassium hydroxide with ammonia, which not only relieves the porosity collapse, but also introduces heteroatoms in the carbon matrix. By adjusting temperature, the optimized porous carbon achieves a high SSA of 3270 m2 g−1, a large pore volume of 2.74 cm3/g, and an appropriate nitrogen-doping level of 2.81%. Benefiting from the favorable structure and interface features of the polymer-derived porous carbon electrode, the as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent electrochemical performances (184 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and capacity retention of 72% at 10 A g−1) in an ionic liquid-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, the assembled supercapacitor delivers an ultrahigh energy density (92.2 Wh kg−1 is achieved at 950 W kg−1), together with a long cycling life (capacity retention of 90.2% after 30,000 cycles). More importantly, such devices in series can light up the logo made of forty LED lights, showing great potential as a power-type device in practical application.
