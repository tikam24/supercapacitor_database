This paper focuses on the development of a supervisory control scheme for improved and profitable operation of a small-rating supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) in load-frequency-control applications. The proposed scheme that is based on adaptive generalized predictive control (AGPC) effectively handles the operational constraints of the SCESS while generating an appropriate power reference for the primary (inner) control loop of SCESS. The primary control loop in turn reacts by forcing the SCESS to follow the power command received from the supervisory (outer) control loop in response to a load perturbation. The conventional tracking controller associated with the inner control loop is tuned offline by employing a genetic algorithm. The overall primary control loop is designed to behave similar to a reference system whose model is utilized for calculating dynamic inequality constraints in the optimization process of AGPC. Various modeling and design aspects are addressed, and simulation experiments are finally carried out on a multiarea power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
