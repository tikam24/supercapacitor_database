Three-dimensional (3D) cotton-like Ni-Co layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays/nickel nanowires (3D Ni-Co LDH/NiNw) were successfully fabricated through a facile chemical bath deposition method. The 3D nickel nanowires are used as a conductive substrate with robust adhesion for high-pseudocapacitance Ni-Co LDH. The 3D Ni-Co LDH/NiNw electrode shows a high areal specific capacitance of 14 F cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2 and quality specific capacitance of 466.6 F g-1 at 0.125 A g-1 with respect to the whole quality of the electrode. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a remarkable energy density of 0.387 mWh cm-2 using Ni-Co LDH/NiNw as the negative electrode. This high-performance composite electrode presents a new and affordable general approach for supercapacitors.
