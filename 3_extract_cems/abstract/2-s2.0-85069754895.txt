Silver doped zinc oxide-polyaniline (Ag-ZnO/PANI) composite was synthesized via facile chemical oxidative in-situ polymerization process. The morphological and structural properties of Ag-ZnO/PANI composite were investigated using field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) techniques. The electrochemical properties of as-synthesized composite were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The Ag-ZnO/PANI, a new electrode showed an excellent gravimetric specific capacitance ∼635 F/g with energy density ∼88W h/kg and power density ∼499W/kg. The 96 %, specific capacitance retention percent and long cyclic stability suggested that Ag-ZnO/PANI composite is a potential candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitor application.
