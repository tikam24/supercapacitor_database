To meet the requirements of balancing the fluctuation of 2 MW direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous generation (PMSG) wind turbine, we proposed a novel hybrid energy storage system, which was composed of vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) and super capacitor (SC), and analyzed the double three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converters PMSG wind power generation system based on hybrid energy storage. Moreover, we analyzed the equivalent circuit model, charge-discharge characteristics, and coordinated control strategy of VRB/SC. Adopting bi-directional DC/DC converter manages energy flow of hybrid energy storage system, we studied the coordinate control strategy of bi-directional DC/DC converter. Finally, we established a simulation model of three-level direct-drive PMSG wind turbine system and hybrid energy storage, and verified the operation characteristics of direct-driven PMSG wind turbine. The results reveal that, when wind power has high fluctuation by collecting wind speed data leading-in model, hybrid energy storage system can smooth the output fluctuation and maintain steady-state output of wind turbine constant at 1.25 MW, which improve controllability and grid friendliness of wind power system.
