Electrochemical supercapacitor is a vital technology for the progress of consistent energy harvesting devices. Herein, we report the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes based on nickel hydroxide nanosheets synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal method. Structure and shape of synthesized materials were analyzed with XRD and SEM measurements. Pseudo-capacitive performances of the fabricated electrodes were evaluated through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements with three-electrode configurations. Results indicated the specific capacitance of l80 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 scan rate and complimented with capacitance retention of 76% for l500 cycles.
