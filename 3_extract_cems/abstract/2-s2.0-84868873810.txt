The increasing energy demand has motivated new system designs to develop; such is the case of small-scale autonomous renewable energy systems that supply small number of households. One of the attractive technologies to be integrated into these systems is the Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). This paper presents a suitable control strategy for a PEMFC-Supercapacitor configuration that enhances the operation conditions of the PEMFC while the power balance of the system is maintained. The system is modeled and implemented in Matlab/SIMULINK, and it supplies a dynamic load that stands for 10 households.
