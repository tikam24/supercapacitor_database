Nanoporous hypercrosslinked polyaniline with SA<inf>BET</inf> of 1059 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> has been synthesized. The specimen showed CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> uptake of 3.52 and 1.01 mmol g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively at 273 K, and H<inf>2</inf> storage capacity of 1.85 wt% at 77 K and 1 bar. The material has a high specific capacitance of 410(Â±5) F g<sup>-1</sup> and has shown good cyclability (100% retention) up to 1000 cycles.
