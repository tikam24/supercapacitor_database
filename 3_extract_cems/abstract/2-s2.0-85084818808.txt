This study concerns a grid-tied photovoltaic (PV) generator related to a hybrid storage system composed of lithium NCA battery (energy source) and Maxwell supercapacitor (power source). Two supervision algorithms have been proposed for energy management system (EMS): a Boolean and a fuzzy logic EMS. Moreover, a comparative study between both supervision algorithms based on levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the lifespan of the storage system has been suggested. The economic analysis is done with two different planned PV power production profiles: one with a “clear sky” bell curve and a second with an ideal forecast. The supervisor based on Boolean method is simple and easy to understand, while the fuzzy logic method offers more flexibility in supervision. It improves the battery lifespan and system performance a little and reduces significantly the system penalties. The simulation results show for all scenarios the achievement of the planned aims in terms of respect of the production program taking into account the constraints of the electrical network manager with an LCOE below 130 €/MWh.
