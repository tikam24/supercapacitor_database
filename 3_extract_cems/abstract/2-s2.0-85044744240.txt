Vanadium oxide 2D layered nanostructures with the hydrous form of potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) are synthesized via hydrothermal reaction between VOSO4 · xH2O and different persulfate oxidants ((NH4)2S2O8, K2S2O8, and Na2S2O8). The physicochemical characterization suggests that the synthesized V2O5 · 3H2O nanostructures possess layered morphology with considerable amount of water molecules accommodated between the interlayer spacing of nanostructures. Moreover, samples obtained using K2S2O8 and Na2S2O8 oxidants have K+ (6.41%) and Na+ (0.38%) ions intercalated on the 2D nanostructure along with the water molecules. Subsequently, the synthesized samples are heat-treated at 400 °C for 3 h in the air and it is observed that the structural and morphological aspects are highly affected due to the removal of surface- and lattice-bonded water molecules. The electrochemical properties of the samples are studied by assembling symmetric supercapacitor devices utilizing the bare and heat-treated samples in 1 m Na2SO4 electrolyte. The fabricated device with bare V2O5 · 3H2O samples shows maximum specific capacitance (>60%) than that of heat-treated V2O5 samples, which represents the positive influence of water molecule on electrochemical behavior of V2O5. Moreover, the bare sample V2O5 · 3H2O (using (NH4)2S2O8) symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an excellent cyclic stability with high capacitance retention of ≈97% after 25 000 cycles.
