Porous manganese oxide thin films for supercapacitors were electrodeposited onto indium tin oxide coated (ITO) glass substrates using various surfactants as templating agents such as polyethylenepolypropylene glycol (F127), cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Electrodeposition of the manganese oxide films was conducted with a standard threeelectrode system using a Pt mesh and Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat’d) as the counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The electrodeposition was performed under a constant potential of 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl/KCl (sat’d) at room temperature. The crystallinity of the synthesized manganese oxides was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the oxidation state of manganese oxide was determined via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology and surface properties of the samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical properties were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with a standard three electrode system and a potentiostat. The results indicate that the surfactants yielded a significant effect with regard to the morphology and specific capacitance compared to manganese oxide that was deposited without surfactant.
