This paper surveys fractional-order electric circuit models that have been reported in the literature to best fit experimentally collected impedance data from energy storage and generation elements, including super-capacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. In all surveyed models, the employment of fractional-order capacitors, also known as constant phase elements, is imperative not only to the accuracy of the model but to reflect the physical electrochemical properties of the device.
