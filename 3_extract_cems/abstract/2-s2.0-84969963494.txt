In addition to the energy storage facilities based on high power technologies, Electric double layer capacitors(EDLC) are today's candidate for power quality stabilization. However, its low energy density is often inhibiting factor for application of electric power industry. Hybrid supercapacitor is an promising energy storage device that positioned between conventional EDLC and Li-ion battery. This paper describes the preparation and characteristics of a hybrid supercapacitor and module for power quality stabilization. A cylindrical 3200F hybrid supercapacitor (60 Ã— 74.5 mm) was assembled by using the Li4Ti5O12 electrode as an anode and activated carbon as a cathode. It shows 2.5 times higher energy density than conventional EDLC with the same volume. In order to determine the characteristics of the hybrid supercapacitor Module for uninterruptible power supply (UPS), hybrid supercapacitor cells were connected in series with active balancing circuit. At even the high current density of 14A(10C), Module prepared by 18 cells showed the capacitance of 170F at 30~50V, suggesting the applicability for UPS.
