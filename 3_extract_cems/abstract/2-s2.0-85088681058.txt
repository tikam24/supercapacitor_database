Flexible and wearable supercapacitor gained considerable attention in recent years due to the demand for flexible energy storage devices in the upcoming wearable electronics appliances. Herein, a highly flexible and wearable planar supercapacitor was fabricated by a simple cut and stick technique over an adhesive tape, utilizing manganese dioxide nanoflowers coated a specially designed carbon fiber cloth (MnO2/CFC) with polyvinyl alcohol/lithium chloride gel polymer electrolyte (PVA/LiCl). The developed MnO2/CFC planar supercapacitor shows a maximum areal capacitance value of ~54 mF cm−2 with excellent energy and power densities (7.5 μWh cm−2 and 2.5 mW cm−2). Moreover, the MnO2/CFC planar device exhibited good cyclic stability of ~89% and ~100% of columbic efficiency for 10000 charge/discharge cycles. And the MnO2/CFC planar supercapacitor considerably retains it areal capacitance even in the bent or rolled state, which demonstrating promising mechanical stability of the device satisfactory for the development of wearable electronic devices.
