With the continuous depletion of fossil energy, emerging energy storage equipment based on supercapacitors has been developed rapidly due to their high energy/power density, low cost, long cycle lives and environmental friendliness. The electrode materials of supercapacitors with high specific surface area, porous structure and excellent electrochemical activity are first important and need to be carefully designed. Here, we propose a three-dimensional chitosan/graphene (CS-rGO) aerogel with vertical alignment as the electrodes for the construction of a symmetrical all-solid-state supercapacitor. The unique structures of the aerogel with low density and light mass, direct channel with low tortuosity, high electronic conductivity favor its high volume capacitance of 184.6 mF cm-3 at a current density of 2 mA cm-3, high energy density of 32 W h kg-1 at power density of 1000 W kg-1 and 89.8% retention rate of the volume capacitance after 5000 cycles at 10 mA cm-3. This demonstrates the potential application of CS-rGO aerogel in symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) for energy storage and conversion.
