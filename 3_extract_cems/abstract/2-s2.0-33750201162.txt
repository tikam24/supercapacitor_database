RuO2·nH2O films used as cathode of supercapacitor were deposited on tantalum foils in water solution of RuCl3 · xH2O by galvanostatic technique. The effect of annealing temperature on the capacitance of RuO2·nH2O films was studied by using an electrochemical system of CHI660B. The micrograph, element and structure of RuO2·nH2O films were respectively analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffractrometer. The results show that the capacitance of RuO2·nH2O films unannealed is unstable. Annealing at temperatures of 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300°C for 2 h respectively, the capacitance of RuO2 · nH2O becomes stable after 60 cycles. The specific capacitance of RuO2·nH2O films annealed at 100°C reaches the maximum of 0.0838 F/cm2.
