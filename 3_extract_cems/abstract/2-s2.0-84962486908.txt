Herein, we report a facile and effective method to fabricate a MnO2-based electrode with high mass loading for supercapacitor applications. This electrode material shows an excellent areal capacitance and considerable capacitive behavior. MnO2 nanostructures were electrodeposited on the nickel foam substrate (NF) decorated by copper particles (NFCuMn). Surface characterization tests revealed that the shape and size of MnO2 nanostructures depend on the time of Cu deposition on the NF substrate. Electrochemical studies showed that the NFCuMn electrode preserves long life cycle stability in addition to remarkable high-rate capability. Also, areal capacitance of 557 mF cm-2 and specific mass capacitance of 687 F g-1 were achieved for the NFCuMn electrode. This work demonstrates the enhancement in the electrical conductivity of the MnO2-based electrode by deposition of copper particles on the substrate which results in the improved capacitive performance of active electrode material.
