Most photovoltaic (PV) systems can supply continuous energy by using storage applications. Generally, the battery is employed for finishing this aim. The expense of the battery occupies a large part in the whole PV system. However, the constant variations of both photovoltaic panel power product and load power demand reduce the life of the battery. At the same time, for providing several large burst power demands generated by the motor based application startup, the sizing of battery should be enlarged. Both of them increase the cost of the PV system. Therefore, supercapacitor is integrated into this system. With a reasonable energy control strategy among the PV panel, supercapacitor and battery, the battery's life could be prolonged and its size can be reduced. A PV system with hybrid storage applications is established in the Matlab/Simulink. Two different loads and weather situations are used to prove the efficiency of this control strategy.
