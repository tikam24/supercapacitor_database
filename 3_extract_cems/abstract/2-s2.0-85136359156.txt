Biochar (BC) based materials are solid carbon enriched materials produced via different thermochemical techniques such as pyrolysis. However, the non-modified/non-activated BC-based materials obtained from the low-temperature pyrolysis of biomass cannot perform well in energy storage applications due to the mismatched physicochemical and electrical properties such as low surface area, poor pore features, and low density and conductivity. Therefore, to improve the surface features and structure of the BC and surface functionalities, surface modifications and activations are introduced to improve its properties to achieve enhanced electrochemical performance. The surface modifications use various activation methods to modify the surface properties of BC to achieve enhanced performance for supercapacitors in energy storage applications. This article provides a detailed review of surface modification methods and the application of modified BC to be used for the synthesis of electrodes for supercapacitors. The effect of those activation methods on physicochemical and electrical properties is critically presented. Finally, the research gap and future prospects are also elucidated.
