In this study, nanostructured nickel sulfides (NiS, Ni3S2 and NiS/Ni3S2) were fabricated directly on the surface of flexible carbon fiber cloths by simply modifying the deposition parameters of pulse-reversal (PR) electrodeposition method and utilized as binder-free flexible electrodes for aqueous hybrid supercapacitors (SCs). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and contact angle measurement studies verifies that the surface of heterostructure NiS/Ni3S2 electrode has enriched Ni3+ sites and highly hydrophilic nature. Consequently, the heterostructure NiS/Ni3S2 electrode demonstrated superior rate capability than that of both single phase NiS and Ni3S2 electrodes. Additionally, the hybrid SC device based on the flexible NiS/Ni3S2 electrode delivered a capacity of 40.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and representing a maximum energy density of 32.3 Wh kg−1 at an impressive power density of 1.6 kW kg−1. Furthermore, the device provided excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 86.2%, even after a 120-h floating test. Hence, the heterostructure NiS/Ni3S2 with interlaced nanosheets morphology should be considered as promising binder-free flexible electrode materials for next-generation energy storage applications.
