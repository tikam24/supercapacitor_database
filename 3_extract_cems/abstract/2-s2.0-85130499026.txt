Commercial activated carbon (AC) was used to adsorb binary mixed dyes of methylene blue (MB) and Carmine (AR18) to prepare AC/(MB+AR18) electrode materials. The electrochemical performance of activated carbon (AC) and that adsorbed different concentration binary mixed dyes [AC/(MB+AR18)] was compared. The test results of the three-electrode system showed that, in 1mol/L H2SO4 electrolyte and under the current density of 1A/g, the specific capacitance of AC/(MB+AR18) after adsorbing in a concentration of 400mg/L pollutants was 182F/g, higher than that of the single AC (109F/g). Subsequently, AC/(MB+AR18)-400 with the best performance was selected as the electrode material to assemble a symmetrical supercapacitor device. It is found that the operating voltage window of AC/(MB+AR18) was increased to 1.5V, compared to 1.1V for the symmetrical supercapacitors assembled with AC only. When the current density was 0.75A/g, the power density was 843.84W/kg, and the energy density reached 32.23W·h/kg, higher than that of the supercapacitor assembled by activated carbon (4.74W·h/kg), which suggested that MB and AR18 not only provided additional Faraday capacitance for AC, but also helped to increase its operating voltage window.
