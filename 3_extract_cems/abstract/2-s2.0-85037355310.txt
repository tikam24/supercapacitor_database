A facile and cost-effective route is developed for synthesizing 3D bush structure of Ag nanoparticles-decorated Ni3S2 grown on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for the first time. In this composite, Ni3S2 exhibits nanosheet networks with porous feature. The electrochemical measurements display that the as-prepared rGO/Ag/Ni3S2 composite possesses a superior areal capacitance of 5920 mF cm−2 at current density of 5 mA cm−2. 77.5% of the initial areal capacitance is retained as current density increased from 5 to 20 mA cm−2. Encouragingly, this electrode exhibits excellent cycle performance with 94% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at a current density of 30 mA cm−2, whereas for rGO/Ni3S2 composite electrode, only 84.7% of the initial value is maintained. The enhanced conductivity and unique structure of rGO/Ag/Ni3S2 composite attribute to its superior electrochemical performance. In addition, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using rGO/Ag/Ni3S2 composite as positive electrode and the nitrogen-doped graphene as negative electrode. The assembled device delivers high energy density of 28.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 425 W kg−1. This work may prompt the development and application of active materials decorated with highly conductive nanoparticles in supercapacitors.
