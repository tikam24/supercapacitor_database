This work reports the electrochemical performance of PANI coated RuO2/TiO2 (RTO) macroporous structures. The PANI-RTO nanocomposites were binder-free deposited on FTO glass substrates by electrostatic spray deposition (ESD). According to physical characterizations, the content of RTO has a strong influence on the morphology of nanocomposites, and hence, on their specific surface area and hydrophilicity. Electrochemical studies performed in a 0.1 M aqueous solution of H2SO4 demonstrate that PANI-10RTO electrode exhibit the best transport properties, with an energy density of 18.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density 150 W kg-1 within a potential window of 0.0.6 V vs Ag/AgCl. Furthermore, it shows a coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and capacitance retention above 81.6% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles. Based on these results, symmetric supercapacitor devices (SSDs) of PANI-10RTO//PANI-10RTO were assembled. When the SSD was operated in a potential window of 0.0.6 V, it provides a capacitance of 67.4 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 alongside a specific energy of 3.37 Wh kg-1 at 60 W kg-1.
