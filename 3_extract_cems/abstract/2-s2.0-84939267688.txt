Highly conductive PPy/graphite nanosheets/rare earth ions (PPy/nanoG/RE3+) composites were prepared via in-situ polymerization with p-toluenesulfonic acid as a dopant and FeCl3 as an oxidant. The microstructures of nanoG and PPy/nanoG/RE3+ were characterized by the SEM and TEM examinations. It was found that nanoG and PPy nanospheres formed the uniform composite with the PPy nanospheres embedded on the nanoG surface and/or filled between the nanoG. The effects of nanoG and RE3+ on the electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance of the composites were investigated. The results showed that the nanoG and RE3+ as the filler had effect on the conductivity and electrochemical performance of PPy/nanoG/RE3+ composites, which played an important role in forming a conducting network in PPy matrix. A specific capacitance of as high as 175 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g was achieved over the PPy/nanoG/Gd3+ composite. The capacitance of the PPy/nanoG/Gd3+ composite decreased only 5.1% after 800 charging/discharging cycles at a current density of 1 A/g. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 54:2731-2738, 2014.
