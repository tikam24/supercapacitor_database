There is a recent increase in the interests of designing high-performance photocatalysts. This chapter gathers some important aspects of nanostructuring of hybrid materials using wrapping approach to enhance the efficiency of visible light-responsive semiconductor photocatalysts, especially reduced graphene oxide-wrapped metal oxides. Graphene is one of the allotropes of carbon which possesses fascinating properties, such as high surface area, planar structure, high chemical stability, superior electron mobility, and conductivity. Due to its distinct properties, it has been considered as a promising support material for different functional materials for various applications such as, photocatalysis, supercapacitor, solar cells, etc. Nowadays, photocatalysis application has got much attention for the energy and environmental remediation owing to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In photocatalysis, mostly semiconductor metal oxides have been used due to their suitable band gaps and band levels. However, it is suffering from poor light absorption, rapid charge recombination and slow reaction kinetics. In this chapter, we discuss and summarize the significance of wrapping of reduced graphene oxide over metal oxides for various photocatalytic applications, particularly the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants and H2 production, the methods used for the preparation of these materials, associated mechanistic fundamentals, some structural, textural, and chemical properties of these materials for better understanding.
