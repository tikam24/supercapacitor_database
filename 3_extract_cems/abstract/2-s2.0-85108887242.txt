Multiwall carbon nanotubes-polyaniline (MWCNTs-PANi) films were fabricated through electrophoretic deposition (EPD) by using crystal violet (CV) and safranin (SAF) as the dispersant. EPD was conducted in deionised water as a suspension medium. The analysis and comparison of the experimental data for CV and SAF conveyed the influence of dyes in the deposition of MWCNTs-PANi. It was discovered that CV and SAF both can be used as a dispersant for EPD of MWCNTs-PANi via in-situ polymerisation. Both dyes were co-deposited on MWCNTs-PANi as it can be observed through FESEM images supported by the FTIR result. Contrariwise, CV appears to co-deposit dominantly compared to SAF. MWCNTs-PANi electrodes were analysed with active mass loading in the range of 7.0 - 7.4 mg cm-2of the nickel foil current collector for electrochemical supercapacitor application. The highest specific capacitance achieved for CV was at 15.94 F g-1and SAF was at 21.32 F g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, charge-discharge curve analysis for MWCNTs-PANi in CV and SAF as the dispersant were evaluated with power density of 12.26 x 104W kg-1and 37.40 x 104 W kg-1, respectively. The organic dyes are the promising dispersant to deposit MWCNTs-PANi composite materials. Nonetheless, the effect of organic dyes used must be taken into consideration since it may influence the material ability to perform as a supercapacitor electrode.
