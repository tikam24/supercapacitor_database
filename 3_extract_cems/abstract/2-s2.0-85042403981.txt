The application of manganese oxide is limited for its difficulty to prevent the generated particles from aggregating. In our study, an optimized polyvinyl polypropylene-assisted chemical coprecipitation method was adopted to improve the dispersion of manganese oxide particles, which was also facilely scalable in large-scale production of materials. The results confirmed that both adding polyvinyl pyrrolidone and conducting thermal treatment for manganese oxide were effective methods to improve the electrochemical properties of manganese oxide.
