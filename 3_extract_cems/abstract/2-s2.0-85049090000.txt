A scanning atmospheric-pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is essential for high-throughput large-area and roll-to-roll processes. In this study, we evaluate scan-mode APPJ for processing reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) that are used as the electrodes of quasi-solid-state gel-electrolyte supercapacitors. rGO nanoflakes are mixed with ethyl cellulose (EC) and terpineol to form pastes for screen-printing. After screen-printing the pastes on carbon cloth, a DC-pulse nitrogen APPJ is used to process the pastes in the scan mode. The maximal temperature attained is ~550 Â°C with a thermal influence duration of ~ 10 s per scan. The pastes are scanned by APPJ for 0, 1, 3 and 5 times. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates the reduction of C-O binding content as the number of scan increases, suggesting the oxidation/decomposition of EC. The areal capacitance increases and then decreases as the number of scan increases; the best achieved areal capacitance is 15.93 mF/cm2 with one APPJ scan, in comparison to 4.38 mF/cm2 without APPJ processing. The capacitance retention rate of the supercapacitor with the best performance is ~93% after a 1000-cycle cyclic voltammetry (CV) test. The optimal number of APPJ scans should enable the proper removal of inactive EC and improved wettability while minimizing the damage caused to rGOs by nitrogen APPJ processing.
