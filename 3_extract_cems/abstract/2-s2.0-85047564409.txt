In this paper, we discuss the design, simulation, and implementation of the bidirectional DC to DC converter circuit for charging a Supercapacitor. Fundamentally, the bidirectional DC-DC converter are consists of buck and boost which working alternately each other. In this work, we implemented our design for electric mini ATV motor application. The Buck-mode is used for charging the Supercapacitor, while the Boost-mode is used for ATV motor's buffering (discharging). The electric ATV motor needs 36 Vdc of the power supply. The Li-Po battery 22.2 Vdc/5000 mAh is used as the main power on ATV motor, then stepped-up by external DC-DC boost converter module till 36 Vdc. To charge the Supercapacitor (25 Vdc/8 Farad), the 36 Vdc should be stepped-down at least above 15 Vdc to keep the circuit in a good performance and under 21 Vdc to preserve the Supercapacitor health. Thus, we set the 18 Vdc as an ideal voltage to charge the Supercapacitor. This paper focuses on the analysis of buck-mode (charging mechanism) only.
