In recent years, islanded microgrid systems have been operated by integrating renewable energy sources, diesel generators and energy storage systems for economical and efficient operation in providing power for local loads. Diesel generators contribute to stabilize the system's voltage and frequency, meanwhile the storage systems respond quickly to changes of the renewable sourcesâ€™ output as well as the load demands. However, the capacity of the energy storage systems is limited and characterized by the state of charge. As a result, a proper energy management strategy based on state of charge of hybrid energy storage system is required to increase the reliability and economic operations of the islanded microgrid system. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy based on Battery State of Charge approach to maintain the stability of the system frequency. State of Charge value is always maintained in the operational limit, in conjunction with the PV output limitation and load shedding scheme to retain the stability. Matlab/Simulink is used to obtain simulation results that show the efficiency of the proposed method.
