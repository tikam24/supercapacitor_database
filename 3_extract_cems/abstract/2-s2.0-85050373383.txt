The synthesis of porous activated carbon (specific surface area=1883 m2 g−1), Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and carbon–Fe3O4 (C−Fe3O4) nanocomposites from local waste thermocol sheets and rusted iron wires is demonstrated herein. The resulting carbon, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and C−Fe3O4 composites are used as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. In particular, C−Fe3O4 composite electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1375 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and longer cyclic stability with 98 % capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles. Subsequently, an asymmetric supercapacitor, namely, C−Fe3O4∥Ni(OH)2/carbon nanotube device, exhibits a high energy density of 91.1 Wh kg−1 and a remarkable cyclic stability, with 98 % capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles. Thus, this work has important implications not only for the fabrication of low-cost electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors, but also for the recycling of waste thermocol sheets and rusted iron wires for value-added reuse.
