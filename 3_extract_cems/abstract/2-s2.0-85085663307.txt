As a type of nanomaterials that has received much attention, carbon dots (CDs) have played distinctive roles in various energy storage materials, benefiting from their advantages of controllable surface structures, good solubility, stable chemical properties, and low cost. However, noncontinuous structures of CDs will hinder their further application due to their unsatisfactory charge transfer performance. Here, we develop a series of carbon materials with CDs-carbon matrix structure based on mixed biogels and through a facile calcination-activation method. The potential applications of theses carbon materials have been demonstrated by electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), where the optimal sample shows 500 F g-1 (1 A g-1) and the maximum rate of increment will be over 73% compared with that of an Agglomerated-CDs sample.
