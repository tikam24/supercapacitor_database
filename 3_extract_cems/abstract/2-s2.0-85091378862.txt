Supercapattery devices are currently gaining remarkable attention since they have the potential to meet the demand for high energy density with no constrain on power density, which is much higher in magnitude than supercapacitors and batteries. Nanomaterials based on metal oxides, phosphates, phosphides and sulfides are well utilized in the development and improvement of hybrid energy storage devices. Challenges facing nowadays by this technology, is to enhance the energy density with no compromise on the power density of the device. Merging the merits of the two technologies (supercapacitor and battery) in a single device will provide high specific power from the capacitive part while the battery counterpart overcomes the high energy concerns. In this review, we have focused our study on the recent progress regarding novel nanomaterials as an electrode material, comprising of high specific capacity and cyclic life, for state-of-the-art supercapattery devices. Furthermore, this study may also enlighten the energy performance of the metal oxides, phosphates, phosphides, sulfides and nitrides as an excellent electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices.
