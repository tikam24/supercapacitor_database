Scaling up energy with volume is critical for fiber supercapacitors to its practical usage in flexible and wearable electronics, which remains a pressing challenge. Here thick fiber electrodes with hierarchical pores are fabricated by programming hundreds of graphene composite fibers into a rope via scalable twisting and braiding. And a volume-independent energy density is achieved from the fiber to the rope with a tremendous volume surge of 1500 magnifications. Based on this rope, a bulky fiber supercapacitor, labeled as rope supercapacitor, is manufactured with a coaxial format. Moreover, highly integrated tandem rope supercapacitors are facilely assembled by sharing electrodes, which are strong and stable in dynamic usage. Furthermore, an 8-unit rope supercapacitor possesses a record high device energy that is 5 times and 35 times higher than that of the state-of-the-art film and fiber supercapacitors, respectively. The idea here can be extended to other fiber-shaped devices to be scaled up without any performance degrading.
