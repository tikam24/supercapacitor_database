A facile approach of chemical bath deposition was proposed to fabricate direct synthesis of silver sulphide (Ag2S) on nickel (Ni) mesh without involvement for binders for supercapacitor electrodes. The phase purity, structure, composition, morphology, microstructure of the as-fabricated Ag2S electrode was validated from its corresponding comprehensive characterization tools. The electrochemical characteristics of the Ag2S electrodes were evaluated by recording the electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge profile in a three electrode configuration system. Ag2S employed as working electrode demonstrates notable faradaic behaviour including high reversible specific capacitance value of 179 C/g at a constant charge/discharge current density of 1 A/g with high cyclic stability which is relatively good as compared with other sulphide based materials. The experimental results ensure fabricated binder-free Ag2S electrodes exhibits better electrochemical performance and suitable for potential electrodes in electrochemical energy storage applications.
