In this work investigated the nano-porous carbon material obtained from prganic raw materials of plant origin and conducted intercalation of cobalt ions into the porous structure of the material "pull" of the electic field. The resulting material was investigate for suitability of use as electrode components ultracapacitor and a studied on the magnetic properties of the material after intercalation.
