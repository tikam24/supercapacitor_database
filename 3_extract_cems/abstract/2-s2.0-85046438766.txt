Carbon fibers, with reduced oxidized graphite layers on the surface obtained using a facile method, were developed as one-dimensional electrodes. The oxidized layers directly formed from the surface of the carbon fibers had a strong interconnectivity with the fiber core, and their conductivity was apparently improved after reduction by hydrazine hydrate. With an abundance of oxygen functional groups induced by oxidation, the one-dimensional electrodes showed a specific capacitance of 213.3 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, which was forty times more than that of the original carbon fibers when tested in a three-electrode configuration. The innately stability in aqueous solutions and the graphite layers from the carbon fibers themselves made the electrodes based on the carbon fibers endowed optimal cycling ability without a decline in specific capacitance after 10000 cycles. The device made of CF-R had a good energy density performance. This strategy provided a facile way to obtain a one-dimensional electrode with a high specific capacitance and good durability for energy storage systems.
