Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based derivatives provide a flexible platform for constructing high performance supercapacitors as electrode materials. Herein, a novel NiFe2O4/NiCo2O4/GO composites has been successfully prepared by dual-MOF as precursor. The NiFe2O4/NiCo2O4/GO composite formed a special structural morphology providing a large surface area. The composite electrode material exhibited an excellent specific capacity of 661.6 C/g (1470 F/g) at 1 A/g, excellent rate capability (from 1 to 20 A/g the specific capacity decreases about 38 %) and outstanding long cyclic life (89.9 % capacity retention after 3000 cycles). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was composed of NiFe2O4/NiCo2O4/GO and activated carbon as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. Meanwhile, ASC exhibited a specific capacity of 373.3 C/g at 1A/g in a potential range from 0 to 1.45 V, it showed the maximum energy density of ASC equal to 109 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1051.17 W kg−1. In addition, the NiFe2O4/NiCo2O4/GO//AC has an outstanding cycling stability (90.7 % capacitance retention after 1000 cycles), which makes it a potential application for in the field of energy storage-conversion application.
