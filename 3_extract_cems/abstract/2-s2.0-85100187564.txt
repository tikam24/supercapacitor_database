The electrostatic spray method is a promising nonvacuum technique for efficient deposition of thin films from solutions or dispersions. The multitude of electrostatic spray process parameters, including surface tension, viscosity, and conductivity of the liquid, applied voltage, nozzle size, and flow rate, make electrostatic spray deposition very versatile for the morphological engineering of nanostructured films. The current state-of-the-art in electrostatic spraying can produce exceptional morphologies. Such tailoring of morphologies is notably useful in electrochemical applications where high electrolyte-accessible surface area often improves performance. Interesting morphologies of metal oxides and their composites are highlighted, including nanopillars, nanoferns, and porous microspheres produced by electrostatic spraying to enhance energy conversion and storage performance. The physics associated with the electrostatic spray process and morphology control using it are also presented. The manuscript highlights the potential of electrospray processing for producing thin films of controlled microstructure, from ultrasmooth layers in organic photovoltaics and perovskite photovoltaics to hierarchical nanostructured films for anodes and photoanodes. It aims to help researchers appreciate essential aspects of electrostatic spray deposition efficiency, process control, and morphology engineering for energy conversion (e.g., solar cell, fuel cell, and photoelectrochemical cell) and energy storage (e.g., lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor) electrodes.
