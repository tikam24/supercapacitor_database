Mixed metal oxides, hydroxides and sulfides have been extensively studied as potential electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions however particularly mixed metal sulfides have not been explored yet as electrode material for supercapacitors. In the present work, mixed metal sulfides (FeNiS2) have been synthesized from a hydroxide precursor. In the second step, these FeNiS2 nanosheets (âˆ¼2.5 nm thickness) are decorated on rGO (reduced graphene oxide) surface by in-situ to design the efficient electrode material for supercapacitor applications. A very high value of specific capacitance as 1013 F/g is observed for a current density of 2 A/g, and it is also seen that a significant enhancement of specific capacitance is noticed for rGO/FeNiS2 as compared to the virgin material (FeNiS2). The capacity retention is enhanced from 22% of FeNiS2 to 61% of G_FeNiS2 when current density increases from 2 to 10 A/g, representing its enhanced rate capability. This work highlights the advantages of FeNiS2 decorated on rGO in electrochemical characterizations and contributes to providing suitable electrochemical activities and long-term cyclic stability for practical applications.
