The control strategy of Fuel cell (FC), battery and Ultra-Capacitor (UC) modules in Electric Vehicle (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) have been studied in proposed 4-Quadrant (4Q) Switch Capacitor (SC) Luo DC/DC bidirectional converter. In addition, FC strategy is one of most popular and favorite Energy Storage System (ESS) in EV for its high efficiency and capability to use hydrogen as the fuel. FCs in conjunction with UC modules can create high power with fast dynamic response, which makes it well suitable for automotive applications. Also, FC include of high energy density and its weight between eight to 14 time less than Lithium-Ion battery (LI-ion) and FC stack can extend the battery life in EV and HEV. This paper presents a proposed Novel topologies and intelligent balancing strategies for EV and HEV Energy Storage System (ESS) applications.
