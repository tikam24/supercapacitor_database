Due to various reasons, the power supply system of LED light sources exist many problems to be solved and optimization. This paper designs a set of small photovoltaic system and equipped with new energy device, provide enough clean energy to LED plant lighting system, reduce electricity costs. We present an improved three point tracing algorithm to trace the maximum power point of solar panel, to maximize the photovoltaic conversion rate. Using double quadrant half bridge current reversible DC/DC converter circuit to realize the automatic charging and discharging of the energy storage module.
