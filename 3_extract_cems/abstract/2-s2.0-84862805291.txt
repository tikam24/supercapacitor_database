Wearable electronics offer the combined advantages of both electronics and fabrics. Being an indispensable part of these electronics, lightweight, stretchable and wearable power sources are strongly demanded. Here we describe a daily-used nylon lycra fabric coated with polypyrrole as electrode for stretchable supercapacitors. Polypyrrole was synthesized on the fabric via a simple chemical polymerization process with ammonium persulfate (APS) as an oxidant and naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic acid disodium salt (Na 2NDS) as a dopant. This material was characterized with FESEM, FTIR, tensile stress, and studied as a supercapacitor electrode in 1.0 M NaCl. This conductive textile could endure 1000 stretching cycles with 100% strain applied, and still retained its electrical conductivity and electrochemical properties. Interestingly, we also found that this material showed improved electrochemical properties when it was being stretched. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
