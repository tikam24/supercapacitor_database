In this paper, a new integrated multifunctional flexible device called the Energy Storage Smart Window (ESS window) was designed and fabricated. The proposed ESS window comprises an integrated supercapacitor and electrochromism function in one flexible device using ordered polyaniline nanowire arrays as electrodes. The ESS window showed high areal capacitance and high stability as a supercapacitor, and in situ optical measurements proved its electrochromic function. Furthermore, the ESS window can be integrated with a conventional solar cell to form a smart device system, which can simultaneously harvest, store, and use renewable energy efficiently.
