This study presents an intelligent hybrid energy management system for electric scooters. The proposed power distribution approach is controlled by a bi-directional converter. The management system is designed according to the property of the battery, supercapacitor, and motion control requirements. The proposed approach keeps the battery working in an effective zone and hence extends the lifespan of the stack. The energy management controller monitors the states of the battery and uses the bi-directional converter to charge the system rapidly and safely and the cost of SC is cheaper than the normal hybrid energy storage system. For charging, the system can be charged by the boost and buck converter and achieves fast charging and voltage balance of the battery.
