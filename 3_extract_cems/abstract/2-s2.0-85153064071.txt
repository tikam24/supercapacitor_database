In order to the increase the popularity of Electric Vehicles in the community the vital component i.e. Charging stations should be properly developed so as they give seamless, reliable service to the customers. With the advancement of technology, the number of electric cars increased, necessitating an increase in the number of charging stations. A charging station prototype is an intelligent device that utilizes automation technologies to handle the whole electrical infrastructure. It is constructed with the latest automation technologies, including a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) and a graphical user interface (GUI). This section discusses automated electric car charging systems. To enable tethered charging, a completely automated system facilitates the whole procedure. Our final year project, the Advanced Charging Station, addresses this issue directly. This report contains comprehensive information on this project, including specifics about the equipment and components used to construct it. Additionally, the report details the project's operation and key variables in plain language that is intelligible to the common individual. The chapters are organized in such a way that it is simpler for readers to grasp the idea of our project. We trust that we have communicated our opinions in this report in the most suitable manner possible by thoroughly discussing each issue and also by removing any concerns or complaints from the reader's mind.
