Herein, we prepared a three-dimensional open petal-like multistage nanolayered structure, which was prepared by electrospinning carbonization process to obtain NiO carbon-based nanofibers (NiO-CNFs), which were then combined with highly conductive nickel foam (NF), and then assembled by solvothermal method to assemble Ni-Co LDH nanosheets around the NiO-CNFs/NF. After electrochemical performance test, NF/NiO-CNFs@Ni-Co LDH-10 electrode shows good electrochemical performance (2774.18 F/g at 1 A/g). When NF/NiO-CNFs@Ni-Co LDH-10 was assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor (NF/NiO-CNFs@Ni-Co LDH-10//AC) with a power density of 849.97 W/kg, the energy density of the device can reach 65.33 Wh/kg. Most crucially, the correct construction of multi-layer nanocomposite structures can provide more possibilities for the development of supercapacitor materials.
