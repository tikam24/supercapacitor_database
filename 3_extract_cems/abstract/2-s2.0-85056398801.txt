Multiport converters (MPC) are becoming one of the most feasible solution in case of integrating multiple energy sources of different voltage range. This paper proposes an isolated five port bidirectional multiport structure for Fuel Cell (FC) and storage devices for DC microgrid (DCMG) application. FC is used as the primary energy source in addition with Battery and Supercapacitor (SC) as energy buffer. A triple active bridge converter is coupled with two half bridge bidirectional switching cells to form the five port topology. This paper presents a modified decoupled phase shifted control strategy which controls the power flow between the ports. This eliminates the interaction effects between different converter ports of wide voltage deviation. The proposed system and control strategy has been validated through simulation results considering load variations.
