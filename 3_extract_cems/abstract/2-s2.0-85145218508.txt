Battery-grade nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) integrated with highly stable metal oxide can abridge the ion diffusion distance, widen the charge-storage abilities resulting in a highly competent electrode material. Herein, electroactive lanthanide-oxide cerium oxide/hydroxide is ornamented over α-Ni(OH)2 through a simplistic coprecipitation method to achieve advanced surface properties. The exclusive nanoarchitecture of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets embedded with cerium oxide/hydroxide spheres facilitates the ion/electron transportation pathways on the electrode surface to accomplish admirable electrochemical charge-storage proficiencies. The electrochemical kinetics and the contribution of diffusion-controlled reaction on the charge-storage performance of the prepared composites were estimated. The symmetric device fabricated using the best prepared composite holds commendable specific energy of 54 W h/kg at a specific power of 1.28 kW/kg, respectively. The heightened electrochemical performance of the prepared cerium oxide/hydroxide–nickel hydroxide composite establishes the potential of being castoff as an electrode in innovative battery-type supercapacitors.
