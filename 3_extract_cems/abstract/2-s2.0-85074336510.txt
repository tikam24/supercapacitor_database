A flexible electrode of MnCo2O4/graphene (MCG) is fabricated via intercalating MnCo2O4 derived from Mn-doped ZIF-67 into graphene oxide sheets followed by hydrothermal reduction. The as-prepared materials are characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-Ray diffractometer. The electrochemical performances are measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode system. Assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is evaluated by a two-electrode method, with the active carbon and MCG as the negative electrode and positive electrode, respectively. The results show that the introduce of graphene can offer the three dimensional conductive framework. The specific capacitance of MCG electrolde can reach 1467 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. And the GCM electrode achieves an energy density of 32.7 Wh/kg and a power density of 6250 W/kg. Furthermore, an ASC, consisting of the MCG electrode and AC electrode, retains 83.9 % capacitance retention after 9000 cycles, exhibiting good cyclic stability and durability. The high flexibility, specific capacitance and rate capacitance endow MCG to be regarded as the promising material for the high performance superconductor.
