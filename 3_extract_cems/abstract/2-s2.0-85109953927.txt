The dihydrophenazine-based covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) were prepared via a zinc chloride mediated ionothermal synthesis. The obtained dihydrophenazine-based CTFs exhibit high surface areas of up to 1213 m2/g with a high nitrogen content of 8.35 wt%. Electrochemcial test of dihydrophenazine-based CTFs shows a high specific capacity of 256 F/g in an aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 0.8 A/g with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.
