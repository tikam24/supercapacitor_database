Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) feature a high-power density, long-term cycling stability, and good energy storage performance, and so, LICs will be widely applied in new energy, new infrastructure, intelligent manufacturing. and other fields. To further enhance the comprehensive performance of LICs, the exploration of new material systems has become a focus of research. Carbon nano-onions (CNOs) are promising candidates in the field of energy storage due to the properties of their outstanding electrical conductivity, large external surface area, and nanoscopic dimensions. Herein, the structure, composition, and electrochemical properties of carbon nano-onion-encapsulated Ni nanoparticles (Ni@CNOs) have been characterized first in the present study. The initial discharge and charge capacities of Ni@CNOs as anodes (in half-cells (vs. Li)) were 869 and 481 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, respectively. Even at a current density of 10 A g−1, the reversible specific capacity remained at 111 mAh g−1. Ni@CNOs were used as anode materials to assemble LICs (full pouch cells (vs. activated carbon)), which exhibited compelling electrochemical performance and cycle stability after optimizing the mass ratio of the positive and negative electrodes. The energy density of the LICs reached 140.1 Wh kg−1 at 280.2 W kg−1 and even maintained 76.6 Wh kg−1 at 27.36 kW kg−1. The LICs also demonstrated excellent cycling stability with a 94.09% capacitance retention over 40,000 cycles. Thus, this work provides an effective solution for the ultra-rapid fabrication of Ni-cored carbon nano-onion materials to achieve high-performance LICs.
