Lead tungstate (PbWO4) nanoparticles were synthesized using plant extracts [Ocimum tenuiflorum (thulasi) and Mentha (mint)] and biomolecules (l-arginine and l-histidine) by a precipitation method. The synthesized PbWO4 particles were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The XRD patterns confirm a pure-phase tetragonal structure for all the synthesized samples, with crystallite size ranging from 31 nm to 73 nm. From SEM and TEM images, morphological changes are observed, due mainly to the influence of adding biomolecules and plant leaf extracts. CV and EIS analysis indicate that PbWO4 nanoparticles are a better material for supercapacitor applications.
