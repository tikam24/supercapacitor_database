Manganese oxides with various phases were prepared by a double solvent precipitation method using manganese chloride (MnCl2), manganese sulfate (MnSO4), and manganese acetate (Mn(Ac)2) as precursors in 2-propanol. The physicochemical properties of as-prepared catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. -Phase MnO2 (with a needle-like shape), -phase MnO2 (with a globular shape), and -phase Mn3O4 (with a mixed shape) were successfully synthesized using MnCl2, MnSO4, and Mn(Ac)2, respectively. In order to investigate the electrochemical properties of the synthesized manganese oxides, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a standard three-electrode system in 1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) solution at a scan rate of 80 mV/s. The electrochemical performance of the samples was strongly influencedby the precursors. The electrode synthesized with the MnSO4 exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability, which were attributed to the high surface area and well-developed morphology.
