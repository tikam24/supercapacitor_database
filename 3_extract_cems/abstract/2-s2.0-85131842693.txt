In this work, we have analyzed the electrochemical performance of various metal-sulfides based nano-composites. Comparison of electro-chemical performance of some commonly seen metal-sulfides such as Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, and Molybdenum based sulfides are done. It is observed that electrodes based on the MoS2 based composites are able to perform better, due to its graphene like behavior. MoS2 performance with other materials is discussed. Various methods to synthesize MoS2 are mentioned. Further, the effect of precursor on the synthesis of MoS2 using hydrothermal technique is elaborated.
