Energy storage devices such as supercapacitors require a superior, safe and reliable functioning over a broad range of temperature combined with high energy and high power densities. Development of improved high performance supercapacitors is important for fulfilling the energy and power needs of hybrid electric vehicles, portable electronics, and specialized pulse-power systems required by the military. To meet this need, Crosslink has developed supercapacitor electrodes based on inherently conductive polymers (ICPs). These electrodes combine both the beneficial pseudocapacitive behavior of the ICP coating and a low equivalent series resistance. In this developmental effort, highly-conductive (> 1000 S/cm) polyaniline (PANI) electrodes are used to fabricate high performance supercapacitors to obtain enhanced charge transfer and redox activity. We find that the high electrical conductivity of PANI leads to an enhancement in electrochemical properties such as energy and power densities. In addition, new n-type conductive polymer systems under development exhibit stable electrochemistry and high faradaic capacitance and are being used with the PANI system to build asymmetric supercapacitors. The conductive polymers may be employed as flexible free standing films or substrate coated electrodes. The conductive polymer-based supercapacitor assembly is designed to function with high energy and power densities, cycle life, and extreme temperature tolerance while keeping production costs low.
