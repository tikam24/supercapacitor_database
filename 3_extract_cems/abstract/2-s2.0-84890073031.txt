High-performance porous carbons as supercapacitor electrode materials have been prepared by a simple but efficient template carbonization process, in which commercially available terephthalic acid-zinc complex is used as a carbon source. It reveals that the carbonization temperature plays a crucial role in determining the structure and capacitive performance of carbons. The carbon-1000 sample has high surface area of 1138 m2 g-1 and large pore volume of 1.44 cm3 g-1 as well as rationally hierarchical pore size distribution. In a three-electrode system, the carbon-1000 sample possesses high specific capacitances of 266.0 F g -1 at 0.5 A g-1 and good cycling stability. In a two-electrode system, the operation temperature (25/50/80 C) can greatly influence the electrochemical performance of the carbon-1000 sample, especially with an extended voltage window (∼ 3 V). The temperature-dependent operation makes it possible for the application of supercapacitors under extreme conditions. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
