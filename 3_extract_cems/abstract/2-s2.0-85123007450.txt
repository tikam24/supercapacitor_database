In this paper, three different morphologies of NiCo2O4 nanoarrays, namely, nanosheet (S-NiCo2O4), nanoneedle (N-NiCo2O4) and their hybrid nanostructure (M-NiCo2O4) were successfully prepared on flexible carbon cloth (CC) by a hydrothermal method. The structures, surface morphologies and compositions of the samples were respectively characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, and XPS, and the effect of NiCo2O4 morphologies on the electrochemical performances was systematically investigated. It is found that the M-NiCo2O4/CC electrode demonstrates the best supercapacitive performance among the three kinds of samples, typically its specific capacitance is 1347.4 F/g at 1 A/g (1509.1 F/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2), much higher than that of S-NiCo2O4 (938.4 F/g at 1 A/g) and N-NiCo2O4 (1022.4 F/g at 1 A/g). Meanwhile, the M-NiCo2O4/CC sample exhibits excellent rate capability (81.6%, from 1 A/g to 15 A/g) and cycling stability (92.4% retention after 10,000 cycles). In addition, an flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with M-NiCo2O4/CC as positive electrode manifests great capacity retention (94% after 5000 cycles) and outstanding energy density of 41.7 Wh/kg at the power density of 750 W/kg. Moreover, the charge-discharge time shows no significant change after 2000 bends, demonstrating its application potential in the field of flexible SCs. The excellent performance is attributed to the unique hybrid porous structure of one-dimensional (1D) nanoneedles and two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets.
