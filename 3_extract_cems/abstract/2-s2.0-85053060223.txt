A novel high-performance supercapacitor was fabricated using spinal (nickel ferrite) nanoparticles uniformly implanted into nitrogen-doped carbon matrix. The nanocomposite was fabricated with bimetallic polymer complexes for the first time. The fabricated nanocomposite was characterized using FTIR, TGA, Raman, XRD, BET, XPS, SEM and TEM technique. The nanocomposite used as the electrode material for assembling electrodes for supercapacitor over nickel foam, and show an excellent specific capacitance of 958.33 F g−1 at a current density of 5.0 A g−1 in a two-electrode system, using 6 M KOH solution as electrolyte. The energy density was observed 43.75 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 516.25 W kg−1, moreover, at a high power density of 882 W kg−1, it still attains the energy density of 26.25 W h kg−1 and, supports the well-known Ragone plot. The high cycling stability (9.75% loss over 6000 cycles) has been demonstrated and shows excellent stability. The results manifest the great potential of this nanocomposite for next-generation high-power applications. Thus, an advanced electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor was successfully assembled first time by a simple and scalable synthesis route.
