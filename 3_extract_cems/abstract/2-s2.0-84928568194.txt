Nanowire-like Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf> arrays, microflower-like CuO standing on Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf> nanowires and hierarchical CuO microflowers are directly synthesized via a simple and cost-effective liquid-solid reaction. The specific capacitance of Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf>, CuO/Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf> and CuO are 511.5, 78.44 and 30.36 F g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, at a current density of 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>. Therefore, the Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf>/Cu-foil electrode displays the best supercapacitive performance. The capacitance retention reaches up to 83% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles with the columbic efficiency of âˆ¼98%. More importantly, the nanowire Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf> transformed into stable nanosheet CuO after about 600 constant current charge-discharge cycles. Additionally, we fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor with nanowire Cu(OH)<inf>2</inf>/Cu-foil as a positive electrode, activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode and 6 mol dm<sup>-3</sup> KOH as electrolyte, which exhibits an energy density of 18.3 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 326 W kg<sup>-1</sup>.
