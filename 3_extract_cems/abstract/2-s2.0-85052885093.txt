Carbon molecular sieve is introduced as flexible supercapacitor electrode for the first time. The carbon molecular sieve electrode generates a specific capacitance of 108.0 F·g−1 and demonstrates an excellent stability with 98.5% preservation of its initial capacitance after 10,000 charging-discharging cycles. To further enhance the electrochemical performance, a flexible 3-D structured composite electrode is synthesized via an electrochemical polymerization method by depositing poly 3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene film on the carbon molecular sieve surface, denoted as carbon molecular sieve@poly 3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene. The specific capacitance of the composite electrode is up to 126.0 F·g−1, higher than both poly 3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene (115.7 F·g−1) and carbon molecular sieve (108.0 F·g−1). Moreover, the flexible composite electrode preserves 96.0% of its initial capacitance after 10,000 charging-discharging cycles at 1.00 A·g−1. The superior performance of the composite electrode is attributed to the combined merits of the superior conductivity and excellent cycle stability of the carbon molecular sieve and 3-D porous network configuration of the poly 3,4‑ethylenedioxythiophene.
