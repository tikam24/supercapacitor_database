This paper describes a simple and well-controlled hydrothermal synthesis of transition metal hydroxide (TMH) based on Nickel Oxide-Zinc Oxide (NZ) nanocomposite to construct free-standing and stable hybrid Wurtz Hexagonal Nanorods (HN) via a hydrothermal technique. The NZ nanocomposite was characterized and analyzed utilizing a variety of techniques, including XRD, FTIR, FESEM, HRTEM, XPS, and Raman Spectroscopy. The fabrication of the symmetrical two-electrode system results in the NZ-15 nanocomposite. It had a high specific capacitance (Csp) of 933.2 Fg−1 at a current density (CD) of 1 Ag−1. And also obtain long-term cycle stability of capacitance retention of 79.64 % and the coulombic efficiency of 97.24 %, even after 5000 cycles. It had a maximum energy density (ED) of 23.7 Whkg−1 and a power density (PD) of 214.1 Wkg−1 as well. The electrode's practical use was tested by lighting them up with a commercial blue LED linked in series, which flashes for nearly 1 to 2 min with intermittent voltage drops. The high electrochemical performance and other results could be evidence that the development of innovative new electrode materials hybrid Wurtz HNs structure is a prominent candidate for high-energy-density supercapacitor applications (SCs).
