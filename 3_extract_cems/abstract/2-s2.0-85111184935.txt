Structural batteries and supercapacitors combine energy storage and structural functionalities in a single unit, leading to lighter and more efficient electric vehicles. However, conventional electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors are optimized for high energy storage and suffer from poor mechanical properties. More specifically, commercial lithium-ion battery anodes and cathodes demonstrate tensile strength values <4 MPa and Young's modulus of <1 GPa. Here, we show that using branched aramid nanofibers (BANFs) or nanoscale Kevlar fibers as a binder leads to mechanically stronger lithium-ion battery electrodes. BANFs are combined with lithium iron phosphate (LFP, cathode) or silicon (Si, anode) particles and reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Hydrogen-bonding interactions between rGO and BANFs are harnessed to accommodate load transfer within the nanocomposite electrodes. Overall, we obtained up to 2 orders of magnitude improvements in Young's modulus and tensile strength compared to commercial battery electrodes while maintaining good energy storage capabilities. This work demonstrates an efficient route for designing structural lithium-ion battery cathodes and anodes with enhanced mechanical properties using BANFs as a binder.
