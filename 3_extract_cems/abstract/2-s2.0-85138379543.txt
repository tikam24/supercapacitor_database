The sustainable development of our society strongly relies on development of sustainable and renewable energy resources. However, in order to fulfill the need for continuous supply of energy across different places, it is necessary to develop durable and efficient technologies. Batteries currently serve most of the energy storage needs but they suffer from relatively low power density and are also prone to high fluctuations in power demand. Electrochemical capacitors also known as supercapacitors are the devices that can store and release energy both electrostatically and electrochemically as it uses two electrodes separated by a thin layer of electrolyte and thus can exhibit interesting properties such as high power density, moderate energy density, longer cycle life. Consequently, supercapacitors have generated huge research interest over the last two decades. A large section of this research is focused on development of novel electrode materials for enhanced storage and cycling ability. Most commonly explored materials are different carbon nanostructures and transition metal compounds. Recently, nanostructured metal chalcogenides have received large attention as electrode materials for their large surface area, dynamic redox activity, low cost and ease of large scale synthesis. In this chapter, we begin by explaining the working of a supercapacitor followed by the roles of its various components with a special focus on electrode materials. We then review the current state of the art of sulfides and selenides based electrodes for supercapacitors and conclude with a summary and outlook.
