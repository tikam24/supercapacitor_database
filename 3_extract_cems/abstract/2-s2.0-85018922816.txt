We demonstrate the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and comparison of Polymethylcarbazole (PMCz) and rGO/PMCz composites and their capacitive performances, which were calculated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1 M H2SO4 solution. These active materials were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy-Attenuated transmission reflectance (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Supercapacitor device performances were taken by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic constant current (CC), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) as two electrode configuration. According to galvanostatic charge/discharge analysis, rGO/PMCz composite represents specific capacitance (Csp) of 526.84 Fg−1 which is higher than that of PMCz (350.00 Fg−1) and rGO (359.06 Fg−1) at current density of 10 mA in 1 M H2SO4 solution. rGO/PMCz electrodes have great potential for practical applications in electrochemical capacitors. There is a positive improvement such as SEM-EDX, FTIR analysis and capacitance, energy and power densities for rGO/PMCz nanocomposite compared to PMCz.
