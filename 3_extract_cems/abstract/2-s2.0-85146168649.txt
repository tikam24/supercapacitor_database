The electrical conductivity and capacitive behavior of supercapacitors (SCs) were found to be improved by the synergistic effects of the violet laser treatment (VLT) of nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) as an electrode and 1.5% (w/v) p-phenylenediamine (PPD)-containing KOH as a redox electrolyte. The SC employing VLT treatment on the N-rGO electrode with 2 M KOH (N-rGO-V) represented a greater specific capacitance of up to 263.6 F g-1 compared to N-rGO in the same electrolyte, which was 232.2 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1. To further improve the charge-storage ability, the SC using the VLT treatment on the N-rGO electrode with the PPD addition into 2 M KOH (N-rGO-V-PPD) revealed the highest specific capacitance, reaching 593.7 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 or 28.6% compared to N-rGO in the same redox electrolyte (N-rGO-PPD). Furthermore, the capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles of N-rGO-V-PPD remained at 62% (265 F g-1 at 100 mV s-1), which is still significantly higher than that of other samples, and the VLT technique provided a lower self-discharge rate. According to the physical characterizations, N-rGO-V-PPD has a rougher and larger surface area due to the exfoliated graphene oxide sheets and has a modest increase in the number of quinone/carbonyl functional groups in the graphene material, resulting in better electrical conductivity. All of these could be contributing factors to the performance improvement. Lastly, PPD provides redox mediators such as H+ and e- in the redox electrolyte, which are anticipated to improve the charge storage.
