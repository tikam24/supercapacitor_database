A hybrid supercapacitor, also known as a supercapattery, combines the high power density of supercapacitors with the high energy density of batteries. In this experiment, we used the hydrothermal technique to synthesize zinc sulfide (ZnS), strontium sulfide (SrS), and zinc strontium sulfide (ZnSrS). The density functional theory (DFT) revealed the metallic behavior of ZnSrS. The surface area measured through Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) graphs for ZnSrS was 13.24 m2/g. The composite zinc strontium sulfide (ZnSrS) had a specific capacity of 469 C/g in three cell arrangement. An asymmetric supercapacitor was constructed using battery-graded zinc strontium sulfide (Zn50Sr50S) as the positive terminal and polyaniline doped activated carbon (PANI@AC) as the negative terminal. The supercapattery device (ZnSrS//PANI@AC) had a maximal capacity of 148 C/g and an energy density of 32.88 Wh/kg at the power density of 800 W/kg. After the completion of 5000 cycles, ZnSrS//PANI@AC retained 90% of its initial capacity. The exceptional electrochemical performance of ZnSrS demonstrates its application as a nanostructured electrode for future energy storage systems.
