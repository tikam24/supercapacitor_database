Three-dimensional (3D) heterostructured molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is used as base materials for aniline monomer in situ polymerization on its surface. It is found that the aniline addition has a remarkable effect on the energy storage of the final compounds due to the improvement of the conductivity and structure stability combined with the synergistic effect between the two types of species. The optimal compound of PANI@MoS2-150 not only shows a high capacitance value of 801.4 F ⋅ g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A ⋅ g−1 but also provides a high retention rate of 77.4 % after 10,000 cycles. The capacitance fading may be due to the increase of the internal resistance analyzed by EIS. Furthermore, a flexible symmetric supercapacitor based on PANI@MoS2-150 has also been fabricated and the specific capacitance reaches 105 F ⋅ g−1 at a current density of 1 A ⋅ g−1. Impressively, the capacitance retention is larger than 100 % undergoing 10,000 cycles. Besides, the highest energy density of 21 Wh ⋅ kg−1 was obtained. Additionally, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor demonstrates excellent flexibility.
