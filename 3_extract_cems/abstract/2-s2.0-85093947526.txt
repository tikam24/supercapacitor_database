To fulfill the increasing energy demand, it is necessary to develop such an electrode material for pseudocapacitors having a high energy density, better cycle life, and potential for commercialization. Herein, we report an electro-codeposition technique to fabricate a high-performance V2O5-PANi composite deposited on the metallic Nickel foam substrate as an electrode for pseudocapacitors. Ni foam serves as a porous and conductive framework and therefore shortens the ions diffusion pathway. Composite shows good performance than pure V2O5 and PANi due to their synergistic effect. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis have confirmed the successful incorporation of metal oxide into the polymer backbone. Moreover, V2O5-PANi composite exhibited a very wide voltage window of 2.5V (between âˆ’ 1 and 1.5V vs. SCE), the highest specific capacitance of 1115 F/g, and less charge transfer resistance. The ability to prepare composite electrodes with high performance via a binder-free electro-codeposition technique could open up new prospects for high energy density pseudocapacitors.
