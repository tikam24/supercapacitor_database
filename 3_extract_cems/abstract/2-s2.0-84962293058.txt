Three-dimensional (3D) graphene frameworks are usually limited by a complicated preparation process and a low specific surface area. This paper presents a facile suitable approach to effectively synthesize 3D graphene frameworks (GFs) with large specific surface area (up to 1018 m2 g-1) through quick thermal decomposition from sodium chloroacetate, which are considerably larger than those of sodium acetate reported in our recent study. The chlorine element in sodium chloroacetate may possess a strong capability to induce in situ activation and regulate graphene formation during pyrolysis in one step. These GFs can be applied as excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors and can achieve an enhanced supercapacitor performance with a specific capacitance of 266 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1.
