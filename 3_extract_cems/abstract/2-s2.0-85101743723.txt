The paper presents accurate and simple dynamic model of a supercapacitor bank system for power system dynamics studies. The proposed model is derived from a detailed RC circuit representation. Furthermore, a complete control system of the supercapacitor bank is also presented. The proposed model is easy to integrate in any power system simulation software and consists of only up to four standard datasheet parameters. The performance of the proposed model in grid frequency control and low-voltage ride through is illustrated on IEEE 14-bus test system in DIgSILENT PowerFactory. It is shown that in case of transient stability simulations the ideal (simplified) model of the supercapacitor can be used while in case of frequency control the ideal representation may not always be appropriate.
