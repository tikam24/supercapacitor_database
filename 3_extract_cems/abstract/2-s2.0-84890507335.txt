The manganese oxide-carbon composite (MnO2-C) containing Manganese oxide nanorods and carbon nanosphere is successfully synthesized based on the direct redox reaction between KMnO4 and carbon nanosphere. The morphology of the resulting composite has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The structure of the as-synthesized sample has been characterized using X-ray diffraction and so on. Electrochemical experimental results, including cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge, have showed that the initial capacitance of MnO2-C composite is 150 F g-1 at a current density of 0.6 A g-1, and a superior coulombic efficiency remains close to 100% with the capacitance above 120 F g-1 during the continuous 1000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge. These results have revealed that the MnO2-C composite displays a prominent capacitive performance, which are important in practical applications for supercapacitorÂ© 2013 American Scientific Publishers.
