The diversified development of electronic products stimulates the great demand for flexible energy storage devices with high energy density. Poly (1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PDAAQ) is considered as a highly promising electrode material due to its unique π-conjugated structure and high theoretical capacitance. Herein, we first prepare cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) modified graphite oxide (GO) coated poly (1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (PDAAQ) nanotubes@Ti3C2TX flexible film (CGO/PDAAQ@MXene) by electrostatic self-assembly. After modification with cationic surfactant, CTAB modified GO coated PDAAQ nanotubes (CGO/PDAAQ) exhibits overall positive charge, and then polymer nanotubes are uniformly inserted into negatively charged layered MXene to effectively avoid self-stacking of MXene layers. Under the synergistic effect, the ordered 1D nanotubes structure of CGO/PDAAQ and excellent intrinsic conductivity of MXene can greatly enhance the electron transfer and ion migration rates for electrode. The flexible self-supporting CGO/PDAAQ@MXene has good mechanical properties and can be completely recovered after 500 bending tests. Electrochemical tests of the flexible electrode exhibit the specific capacitance of 346 F g at 1 A g−1 (865 mF cm−2 at 2.5 mA cm−2), good rate performance and excellent cyclic stability. The as-fabricated flexible asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits high energy density of 41 Wh kg−1 at 404 W kg−1, which can successfully light 35 small LED bulbs.
