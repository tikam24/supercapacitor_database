A large amount of lignin in waste liquid of agricultural straw and paper industry cannot be effectively utilized. Porous carbon materials have the advantages of stable chemical and thermal properties and easy processing, and have a wide application prospect in supercapacitor electrode, solid hydrogen storage and other fields. In this paper, lignin-based carbon spheres were prepared by ultrasonic self-assembly and high-temperature calcination. The lignin-based C/S composite microspheres were formed by loading sulfur with supercritical carbon dioxide method. The surface of lignin carbon spheres is rich in mesoporous and has a high degree of graphitization, and sulfur elements are uniformly loaded on the surface of the microspheres. Then, the lignin-based C/S composite electrode was prepared and electrochemical test was carried out. The results showed that the first discharge capacity of the lignin-based C/S composite electrode was 1172 mAh·g-1 at the current density of 0.1 mAh·g-1, and the capacity remained at 570 mAh·g-1 after 1100 charge and discharge cycles, and the capacity retention rate was 48.6%.
