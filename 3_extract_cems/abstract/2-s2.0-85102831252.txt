Designing and adjusting materials with reasonable microscopic morphology is the key to improving electrochemical performance and assembling hybrid supercapacitors with excellent performance. In this work, firstly, a hydrothermal method is used to grow the NiCo-MOF (NCM) on nickel foam, then NCM is used as the precursor, and the solution containing MXene and Ni2+ and Co2+ are used as the electrolyte to prepare the MXene-Ni-Co@NiCo-MOF/NF (M-NC@NCM/NF) nanosheets through electrodeposition. Since the metal cations will be redistributed between the MXene layers, the nanosheets obtained by electrodeposition in the electrolyte added with MXene exhibit a unique hexagonal nanosheet morphology. This unique form can enhance the electrochemical performance, the capacity retention rate can be maintained at 75.3% after 5000 cycles, and the specific capacity can reach 855.0 C g−1 (2137.5 F g−1) at 1 A g−1.
