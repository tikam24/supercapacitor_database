DC Microgrid power systems are becoming increasingly common in many applications. In this work, the comparative analysis of different energy control techniques for a dc microgrid with pulsed power loads is considered. A laboratory scale hybrid dc microgrid is developed to evaluate the performance of the energy control methods. In the proposed dc microgrid, a supercapacitor bank, acting as power buffer, and a pulse load are directly connected to a common coupling dc bus while the injected power to the grid is regulated through power converters. This microgrid is connected to an AC grid test-bed to further analyze the consequence of the pulse loads. The test results show that the energy control methods are different in terms of their maximum power requirement, their performance on the dc microgrid, and their effects on the ac grid.
