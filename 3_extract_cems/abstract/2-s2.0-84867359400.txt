Manufacturing issues of electrical energy storage devices are very complex as it requires consideration of electrical, mechanical, and economic aspects. Supercapacitor is a new energy storage device. It is operated along with batteries or fuel cells to shave off the pulse power demand. The energy density of supercapacitors depends on many parameters such as surface properties and electrical properties of the electrode material along with the ionic properties of the electrolyte. A statistical method is implemented to get the material-based model of the symmetrical aqueous supercapacitor using innovative sandwich type of supercapacitor construction, to address the issues related to material and manufacturing. Temperature and lifecycle testing is carried out to prove its commercial merit for a hybrid pack of supercapacitor-battery. Â© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
