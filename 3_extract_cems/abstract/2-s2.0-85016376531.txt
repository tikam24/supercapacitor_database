Nanocarbons play a pivotal role in the field of energy storage due to their unique size-/surface-dependent properties. The past decade has witnessed a rapid growth in the R&D on carbon-based materials for supercapacitors. To improve their electrochemical performance, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) consisting of two different electrodes have been designed to increase their specific energy and power densities in comparison to those of symmetric supercapacitors. So far, most progress toward ASCs technologies is mostly benefited from the continuous development of carbon materials. In this chapter, nanocarbon-based electrode materials including activated carbons, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their composites for ASCs are selected and discussed to present higher energy density at high power density. A particular focus is directed to the fabrication and electrochemical performance of various nanocarbon-based electrode materials and some assembled ASCs. The ongoing trends in nanocarbon-based materials for ASCs are also pointed out.
