Molybdenum dioxide/graphene nanocomposites are prepared by hydrothermal method. The synthesized composites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopic analysis. The XRD and Raman studies confirms the in-situ reduction of graphene oxide during the composite formation. The electrochemical properties of the pure MoO2 and nanocomposites were studied by cyclic voltammeter and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The prepared nanocomposite electrode exhibited specific capacitance of 290 Fg−1 with a corresponding energy density of 109.9 Wh kg−1 in an aqueous electrolyte, which is relatively higher than that of pure MoO2. Moreover, the composite electrode maintains high power density of 5774 W kg−1 at high current rates, suggesting that it is a potential energy storage material for portable and consumer electronics.
