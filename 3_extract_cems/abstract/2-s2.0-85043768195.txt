CoFe2O4 nanosphere clusters (CFNCs) with good crystallinity were synthesized through a facile polyol process without using any surfactant or template. FESEM images show cobalt ferrite clusters with a diameter of 200–400 nm with nanospheres grown on the surface. The electrochemical behavior of the CFNCs was investigated in different electrolytes of KOH, K2SO4, and Na2SO3 in the negative potential window of − 0.3 to − 1.3 V for possible application in supercapacitor electrodes. CFNCs exhibited best performance in KOH electrolyte with a specific capacitance of 151 F g−1 in 5 mV s−1 and a cycling stability of 87% over 1000 voltammetric cycles. These studies indicate the potential application of the as-obtained CFNCs as negative electrodes in alkaline supercapacitors.
