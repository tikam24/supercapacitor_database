In this paper, a combination of in-situ polymerization and ultrasonication dispersion method has been successfully utilized to prepare r-GO/carbon sphere/PANI trinary composite. The structural characterizations show that the carbon sphere/PANI composites are wrapped by r-GO sheets in the as-obtained composites. Due to the higher conductivity of r-GO and thus the reinforced charge and ions transport efficiency, the electrochemical performance of carbon sphere/PANI composite are significantly improved after combining with the r-GO. The trinary r-GO/carbon sphere/PANI composite exhibits the largest specific capacitance of 420 F g-1, which is about 75% higher than that of the binary carbon sphere/PANI composite (240 F g-1). Therefore, such r-GO/carbon sphere/PANI composite can be a potential candidate for high-performance capacitors. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
