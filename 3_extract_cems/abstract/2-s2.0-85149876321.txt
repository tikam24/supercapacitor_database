This paper proposes a methodology to increase the lifetime of the central battery energy storage system (CBESS) in an islanded building-level DC microgrid (MG) and enhance the voltage quality of the system by employing the supercapacitor (SC) of electric vehicles (EVs) that utilize battery-SC hybrid energy storage systems. To this end, an adaptive filtration-based (FB) current-sharing strategy is proposed in the voltage feedback control loop of the MG that smooths the CBESS current to increase its lifetime by allocating a portion of the high-frequency current variations to the EV charger. The bandwidth of this filter is adjusted using a data-driven algorithm to guarantee that only the EV's SC absorbs the high-frequency current variations, thereby enabling the EV's battery energy storage system (BESS) to follow its standard constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging profile. Therefore, the EV's SC can coordinate with the CBESS without impacting the charging profile of the EV's BESS. Also, a small-signal stability analysis is provided indicating that the proposed approach improves the marginal voltage stability of the DC MG leading to better transient response and higher voltage quality. Finally, the performance of the proposed EV charging is validated using MATLAB/Simulink and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing.
