A high performance transparent and stretchable supercapacitor was formed by the electrochemical deposition of MnO2 on a freestanding Ni mesh and further integrated with an elastic substrate. The solid-state supercapacitor shows a high transparency of 62% at 550nm and superior areal capacitance of 34.8 mF/cm2 at the scan rate of 0.01 v/s. The supercapacitor device possesses a 98.8% capacity retention up to 30% strain. Moreover, the areal capacitance retention rate kept 87% after hundreds of stretching cycles at 30% strain.
