Supercapacitors fabricated from fiber materials are becoming important electrochemical energy storage devices owing to their high flexibility, light weight and high energy density. They are used in electronic systems such as information sensing, computation, communication and electronic textiles due to their higher power density than standard parallel plate capacitors and batteries. Here, the effects of the composition, spinning and fabrication conditions on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors fibers made from carbon nanotubes, graphene and poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) are reviewed in the context of wearable energy storage devices.
