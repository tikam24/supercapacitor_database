In this work, mesoporous ZnCo2O4 electrode material with necklace-type nanowires was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method using water/ethylene glycol mixed solvent and sub-sequent calcination treatment. The ZnCo2O4 nanowires were assembled by several tiny building blocks of nanoparticles which led to the growth of necklace-type nanowires. The as-synthesized ZnCo2O4 nanowires had porous structures with a high surface area of 25.33 m2 g−1 and with an average mesopore of 23.13 nm. Due to the higher surface area and mesopores, the as-prepared neck-lace-type ZnCo2O4 nanowires delivered a high specific capacity of 439.6 C g−1 (1099 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, decent rate performance (47.31% retention at 20 A g−1), and good cyclic stability (84.82 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles). Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated with ZnCo2O4 nanowires as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode (ZnCo2O4 nanowires//AC), which delivered an energy density of 41.87 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. The high electrochemical performance and excellent stability of the necklace-type ZnCo2O4 nanowires relate to their unique architecture, high surface area, mesoporous nature, and the synergistic effect between Zn and Co metals.
