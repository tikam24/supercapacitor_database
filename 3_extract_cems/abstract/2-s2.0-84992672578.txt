Transition metal oxides with hierarchically porous structures supported by conductive substrates have been considered as promising electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and catalysis. Herein we configure porous Co3O4/C nanowire arrays (NAs) by thermally annealing a Co-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) in Ar and air, respectively. The hybrid Co3O4/C NAs demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 1.32 F cm-2 at a current density of 1 mA cm-2, which is much superior to that of bare Co3O4 NAs. A highly stable symmetric supercapacitor based on Co3O4/C exhibits an excellent durability with only 21.7% capacitance decay after 5000 cycles. Besides electrochemical energy storage, the Co3O4/C hybrids demonstrate an outstanding electrochemical catalysis ability for the oxygen evolution reaction, identified by the high current density of 30 mA cm-2 at low overpotential (Î·30 = 318 mV) and a small Tafel slope (81 mV dec-1). The electrical conductivity of the interconnected C infrastructures and ion diffusion within the hierarchical pores are intrinsic causes to promote the pseudo-capacitive performance and enhance catalytic activity. The synthesis strategy reported here opens an avenue to design high performance electrodes for energy storage and electrochemical catalysis.
