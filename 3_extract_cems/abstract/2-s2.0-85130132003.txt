Porous coordinated polymers also known as metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are the budding part of materials science technology with major role in energy storage field specifically for supercapacitors. The variable functionality, structural richness and rich redox chemistry between metal species and organic linkers are helpful to gain excellent performance for MOF-based supercapacitors. Thermal treatment of MOFs in air or inert atmosphere develops highly porous MOF-derived nanomaterials encapsulated in carbons. The resulting MOF-derived materials show high surface area, high conductivity, which are essential requirement for supercapacitors. Although, the MOF based materials have various applications in different fields, their structural features and synthesis procedures well known, the importance of these materials for the development of next-generation supercapacitors is not summarized. In this article, we will summarize the fundamentals of MOFs, recent development in pristine MOFs and MOF derived porous carbons, metal oxides, mixed metal oxides, carbon/metal oxides composites for supercapacitors. Furthermore, the future challenges and recent trends and prospects of MOFs for supercapacitors are discussed.
