Single phase, ultra-thin, and ultra-long α-MnO2 nanowires were synthesized by facile method and investigated as an electrochemical pseudocapacitor active material. Structural characterizations reveal that the α-MnO2 has a narrow size distribution of ˂5 nm and around 20–30 μm in length. A maximum specific capacitance of 495 F g−1 can be achieved at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 by cyclic voltametrically. The α-MnO2 nanowires exhibit excellent electrochemical performance at various current densities and good cycling ability. These results indicate that the α-MnO2 nanowires are a promising candidate for the supercapacitor electrode active material.
