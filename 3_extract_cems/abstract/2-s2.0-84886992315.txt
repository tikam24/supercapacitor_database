Graphene has received considerable attention in both scientific and technological areas due to its extraordinary material properties originating from the atomically single- or small number-layered structure. Nevertheless, in most scalable solution-based syntheses, graphene suffers from severe restacking between individual sheets and thus loses its material identity and advantages. In the present study, we have noticed the intercalated water molecules in the dried graphene oxide (GO) as a critical mediator to such restacking and thus eliminated the hydrogen bonding involving the intercalated water by treating GO with melamine resin (MR) monomers. Upon addition of MR monomers, porous restacking-inhibited GO sheets precipitated, leading to the carbonaceous composite with an exceptionally large surface area of 1040 m2/g after a thermal treatment. Utilizing such high surface area, the final graphene composite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material: specific capacitance of 210 F/g, almost no capacitance loss for 20 000 cycles, and ∼7 s rate capability. The current study delivers a message that various condensation reactions engaging GO sheets can be a general synthetic approach for restacking-inhibited graphene in scalable solution processes. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
