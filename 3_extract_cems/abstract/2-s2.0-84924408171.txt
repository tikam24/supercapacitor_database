A dual-function coaxial supercapacitor cable, which has the capability to be used as an electrical cable and an energy storage device, is shown. The outer cover facilitates energy storage, while the core within is used for the passing of electricity. Not only is this new architecture pliable, but it also shows high flexibility and gives high energy and power densities. These properties, along with the astounding results of its usage, show that it has successfully married the functions of storing and sending electricity into one device.
