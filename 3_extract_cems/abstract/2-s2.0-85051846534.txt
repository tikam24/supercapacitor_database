Ever increasing energy demands and fossil fuel depletion are compelling humanity towards the development of suitable electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices, that possibly lead to attain a more sustainable society with adequate renewable energy and zero environmental pollution. In this regard, Supercapacitors stand alone as the most prominent energy storage devices that provide cleaner and eco-friendly energy. Incorporation of 2d Graphene and its inorganic analogues, such as: Boron Nitride, Borocarbonitrides, few layered transition metal carbides and carbonitrides, Transition Metal Double Layer Oxides, Transition Metal Double Layer Hydroxides, Transition Metal Layer Dichalcogenides etc as potential electrodes for the development of Supercapacitors with myriad electrochemical performance has drawn a great deal of attention in materials science and various allied fields. This paper provides an overview on the possibilities and challenges in the realization of a novel hybrid Supercapacitor with the electrodes fabricated from a stacked multilayered Graphene with a semiconducting layer of Bi2Te3, also a Topological Insulator (TI) as an intervening layer, along with 2-Dimensional Transition Metal DiChalcogenides (TMDs) as top and bottom Layers. In addition, future research trends and notable opportunities are also discussed.
