Poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/activated carbon (PEDOT/AC) composite was synthesizedby a chemical precipitation method with P-toluenesulfonic acid iron (Fe(TOs)3) as dopant and oxidant. Their morphology and structure were investigatedby SEM, FT-IR and TGA/DTG respectively. Electrodes for spiral wound supercapacitors with varying compositions of PEDOT and AC were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to understand their electrochemical properties. The results show that PEDOT/AC composite has high thermal stability. When the mass ratio of AC and EDOT is 20%, the specific capacitance of composite electrodes estimated to be 176.3 F/g. Moreover, the capacitance retained 83.6% after 1 000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, suggesting a high cycle stability of the composite electrodes.
