Conducting polymers have received more and more attention in energy storage and conversion in recent years. In this chapter, polyaniline and polypyrrole are chosen as typical candidates and their applications focused on supercapacitor, and oxygen reduction reactions have been introduced. In the former field, the pure conducting polymers, their complex with carbons, metal oxides/sulfides and other materials, and their derived carbons and the selection of supporting materials are discussed in detail; in the later one, the carbonized conducting polymers, for example, N-doped carbons and the co-doped carbons with kinds of elements, including nonmetals and nonnoble metals are summarized.
