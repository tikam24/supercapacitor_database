A novel integrated 3D micro-supercapacitor is reported. A through-via bottom electrode technique is utilized for the first time for supercapacitor fabrication, and a highly miniaturized, flexible, and all-solid-state micro-supercapacitor with 3D integration capability is achieved. Module-wise compact integration of supercapacitors and their versatile powering applications are demonstrated. This device enables high-power energy storage in small-scale electronics.
