In quest of potential electrode material with high redox sites, better wettability, rapid ionic channels and high rate capability here we adopted a soft template method (surfactants). This work investigates the effect of non-ionic and ionic surfactant on microstructure and surface morphology thereby its electrochemical properties in detail. The physiochemical characterization of prepared samples stated that purity of prepared Ni2P2O7 was high and its surface morphology were significantly altered by different templating agents. In particular, Ni2P2O7 without and with surfactants (PEG, PVA, PVP and CTAB) showed a specific capacitance of 120, 95, 126, 128 and 250 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, the asymmetric device with NiP(CTAB) as cathode own an energy density of 20 Wh/kg at a power density of 1550 W/kg and retained 70% of its initial capacitance upto 4500 cycles.
