Amorphous carbon nanorods (CNRs) were deposited directly using radio frequency magnetron sputtering. The synthesized CNR electrochemical properties were investigated using graphene as the current collector for an electric double layer capacitor. The CNRs were vertically aligned to the graphene to achieve higher specific surface area. The capacitor performance was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge testing in 1 M KOH electrolyte at 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, and 60°C. The CNR specific capacitance was observed to increase with increasing measurement temperature and could reach up to 830 F/g at 60°C. Even after extensive measurements, the CNR electrode maintained good adhesion to the graphene current collector thereby suggesting electrode material stability.
