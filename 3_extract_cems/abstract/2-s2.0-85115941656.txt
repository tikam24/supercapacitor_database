Design and synthesis advanced battery-type electrode materials with outstanding electrical conductivity and remarkable theoretical specific capacity are crucial to enhance the comprehensive performances for battery-supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, Ni(OH)2/MnMoO4 composite on reduced graphene oxide/Ni foam (rGO/NF) was successfully fabricated through the hydrothermal method and potentiostatic electrodeposition (Ni(OH)2/MnMoO4/rGO/NF). The unique honeycomb structure and the efficient synergistic effects among MnMoO4 and Ni(OH)2 of the as-prepared battery type electrode, as well as outstanding electronic conductivity of the reduced graphene oxide, were beneficial to the enhanced electrochemically active sites and increased specific capacity. Ni(OH)2/MnMoO4/rGO/NF composite employed for SCs yielded the maximum specific capacity of 1329.1 C g−1 and a superb cycle property of 86.8% during 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) device with the Ni(OH)2/MnMoO4/rGO/NF and active carbon (AC) as-prepared samples showed the energy density of 61.4 W h kg−1 at the power density of 428.4 W kg−1. The capacity retention of the as-fabricated hybrid device reached 96.4% over 7000 cycles. Those consequences tested that the Ni(OH)2/MnMoO4/rGO/NF composite should be the promising category of battery-type electrodes materials of the next generation energy storage devices for the high-performances SCs.
