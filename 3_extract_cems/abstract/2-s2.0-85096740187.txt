The effect of superconductive carbon black on the properties of supercapacitor electrode in a 2 M solution of sulfuric acid was studied. The paper considers the results of electrochemical testing of highly dispersed carbon black grades subjected to thermal-gas-chemical treatment and commercial CB Printex XE2-B, which are used both as the electroconductive componentin a mixture with activated carbon Norit DLC Supra 30and as the individual active component. Experimental samples of superconductive carbon black preliminarily obtained using the axial feeding of hydrocarbon feedstock were found to be the best ones.
