In this paper, graphene was prepared via modified hummers' method and then with the help of microwave treatment of as prepared graphene, microwave graphene (MG) was prepared. From the electrochemical experiments, graphene and MG exhibited improved electrochemical performance. Electrochemical performance of graphene and MG electrodes were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge measurement (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance value of 275 Fg-1 And 316 Fg-1 for graphene and MG, respectively. Equivalent series resistance of MG was 1.78 ω and charge transfer resistance was 1.33 ω, smaller than that of graphene. The fabricated electrodes of supercapacitor show the improved equivalent series resistance and capacitance value. The improved performance of MG electrode was ascribed to the porous nature of graphene after microwave annealing. This work gives the great interest towards the material for high performance high energy and power density application.
