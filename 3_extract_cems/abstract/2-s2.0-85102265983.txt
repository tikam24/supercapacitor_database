The authors regret that the draft version of manuscript was used to create the proof and was published online because the authors have missed to identify this during the proofing stage. Refer to the final version, the corrected contents are as follows: 1. In Abstract, the content “which apparently higher than that of micro-nano NiS2/C electrodes” should be “which are apparently higher than those of micro-nano NiS2/C electrodes”. The content “88.1 % retention after 5000 cycles” should be changed to “87.85 % retention after 5000 cycles”. This result is re-verified by re-assembled hybrid supercapacitor (corrected Fig. 7e) according to the requirement of reviewers. 2. The Fig. 1, the molecular formula of PVP K30 is error in the published version (draft). The correct molecular formula of PVP K30 given blew [Formula presented] 3. In 2.6 Fabrication of a hybrid supercapacitor (page 3), the specific preparation method should be corrected to “AC, acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a mass ratio of 80:10:10 were mixed in N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP). For a hybrid supercapacitor, the charge balance between two electrodes needs to follow the relationship Q+=Q-. The optimal charge balance between two electrodes can be obtained according to the equation 1 (Support information).” 4. In Results and discussion (page 3), the statement of Fig. 3a “Its mean particle size is 57 nm from the size distribution histogram, where size of each nano-particle was calculated one by one using nano measure software” should be changed to “The single micro-nano NiS2/C@FHCBL particle consists of amorphous carbon and nano NiS2. The size of nano NiS2 is less than 100 nm.” 5. In Results and discussion (page 3), the statement of Fig. 3c-d “The FHCBL with about 100 nm were constructed by the etch of HCl in Fig. 3c. The Fig. 3d shows that the carbon bubble of FHCBL is about 30 nm,” should be changed to “The majority of FHCBL with about 100 nm are constructed by the etch of HCl (Fig. 3c). The most carbon bubble of FHCBL is about 30 nm in Fig. 3d,” 6. In Fig. 6b (page 5), In order to distinguish the curves, the color was changed according to the reviewer. The corrected Fig. 6b given blew [Figure presented] 7. In Fig. 7b of published version, the low Coulomb efficiency (charge time is significantly longer than discharge time) of hybrid supercapacitor was showed in draft version. According to requirement of reviewers, the hybrid supercapacitor was re-assembled base on exact matching rate of anode and cathode materials. The results show hybrid supercapacitor has high coulomb efficiency at different current densities (corrected Fig. 7b). The corrected Fig. 7 given blew [Figure presented] 8. In Results and discussion (page 6), The statement of Fig. 7 should be changed to “The shortened ion diffusion lengths and highly exposed surface/interface as a result of nano size effects lead to no obvious REDOX peak in CV curves of NiS2/C@FHCBL||AC and GCD curves [30]. The GCD curves of the whole electrode shows a capacitance of about 105.88 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. It shows a specific energy with 47.46 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 449.62 W kg−1 in Fig. 7d. The cycling stability is of great importance for devices based on fabricated electrochemical supercapacitor. The NiS2/C@FHCBL electrode has the excellent cycling stability with keeping 87.85 % retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1 in Fig. 7e. Compared with other methods (Table S1), the FHCBL show the great advantage in cycling stability of hybrid supercapacitor.” [30] Y. Jiang, J. Liu, Definitions of pseudocapacitive materials: A brief review, Energy Environ. Mater., 2 (2019) 30–37. 9. In Conclusion, the statement of hybrid supercapacitor should be changed to “During the fabricated liquid-state NiS2/C@FHCBL||AC hybrid supercapacitor shows a specific energy with 47.46 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 449.62 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (keeping 87.85 % after 5000 cycles).” The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.
