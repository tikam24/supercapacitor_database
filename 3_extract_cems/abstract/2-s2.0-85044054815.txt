Hybrid Energy Storage Modules (HESM) have emerged as a possible energy storage device for naval pulsed power applications [1-6]. A HESM combines energy dense and power dense devices to offer a holistic solution for repetitive loads that are highly transient in nature. Actively controlled power electronic converters are used to regulate the power that flows from each energy storage or generation source to a point of common coupling. In these types of naval applications, it is likely that the system will be comprised of components that are available as commercially off the shelf (COTS) components, though some may be custom designed as well. Combining COTS components in a HESM can be challenging because system-level control must be imposed on top of individual device control. Previous work at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) has demonstrated a basic model of a HESM and a fuzzy logic systemlevel controller through software simulation. Building on the work by UTA, this paper will validate a model of a Hybrid Energy Storage Module with fuzzy logic system-level control under the effects of a transient pulsed power load.
