BiFe1-xCuxO3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) nanoparticles were prepared by a simple solution method. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method analysis using the Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Magnetization properties were obtained using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at room temperature. Magnetization was clearly enhanced by increasing Cu content and decreasing particle size. Zero-fieldcooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) temperature-dependent magnetization measurements showed that blocking temperature increased with increasing Cu content. Electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) method. The performance of the fabricated supercapacitor was improved for the BiFe0.95Cu0.05O3 electrode. The highest specific capacitance was 568.13 F g%1 at 1Ag%1 and the capacity retention was 77.13% after 500 cycles.
