Porous nickel oxides were prepared by hydrolysis and further heat treatment of nickel acetate in air at 300Â°C. A new electrochemical capacitor system with asymmetric configuration was demonstrated. The nickel oxides prepared and active carbon were applied to the positive and negative electrodes respectively. These oxides can provide a specific capacitance of 240 F/g, and maintain high utilization at high rates of discharge (i.e., high power density). The maximum operational voltage of the capacitor was increased and the high power discharge characteristics were improved.
