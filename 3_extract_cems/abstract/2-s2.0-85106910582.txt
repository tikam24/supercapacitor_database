Abstract: The rapid economic development and immense growth in the portable electronic market create tremendous demand for clean energy sources and energy storage and conversion technologies. To meet this demand, supercapacitors have emerged as a promising technology to store renewable energy resources. Based on this, this review will provide a detailed and current overview of the various materials explored as potential electrodes and electrolytes in the development of efficient supercapacitors along with corresponding synthesis routes and electrochemical properties. In addition, this review will provide introductions into the various types of supercapacitors as well as fundamental parameters that affect supercapacitor performance. Finally, this review will conclude with presentations on the role of electrolytes in supercapacitors and corresponding materials along with challenges and perspectives to guide future development.
