Carbon cloth was functionalized through cyclic voltammetric scans in 2 M H 2SO 4 to afford functionalized carbon cloth (FC). The FC was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Self-doped polyaniline (SPAN) was deposited on FC through electro-co-polymerization of aniline and metanilic acid to get SPAN/FC which showed a specific capacitance of 408 F g -1 in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4, based on a constant charge-discharge experiment at a current density of 1 A g -1. A symmetric model capacitor, SPAN/FC-SPAN/FC was assembled by using SPAN/FC as both of the electrodes and 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 as the electrolyte. The charge storage property and charge-discharge cycling stability of SPAN/FC-SPAN/FC were investigated by galvanostatic experiment. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
