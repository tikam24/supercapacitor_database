This paper reports a new graphene oxide (GO)/acenaphthenequinone composite as efficient electrode in electrochemical supercapacitors. The nanosheets of GO provide high surface area and conductivity. The microneedle-like acenaphthenequinone contributes convincible specific capacitance. The structure and morphology of GO/acenaphthenequinone composite have been characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and Raman spectra. According to the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, impedance spectra and cycling life analyses, the GO/acenaphthenequinone composite exhibits brilliant supercapacitors performance with a specific capacitance of 248.7 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and enhanced stability of about 82% (147.5 F g-1) of initial capacitance (179.8 F g-1) after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1.
