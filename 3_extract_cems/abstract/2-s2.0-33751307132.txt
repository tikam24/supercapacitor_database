We present the electrochemical polymerization and characterization of a stable and dopable polyindophenine derivative starting from monomer 5. The fabrication of supercapacitor devices was carried out by direct electrochemical polymerization on an ITO-coated slide. Furthermore, the galvanostatic and potentiostatic experiments conducted on these supercapacitors have shown that the polyindophenine-derivative material has very good cyclability, over a potential range of 1.4 V, and a maximum capacitance of 140 F g-1.
