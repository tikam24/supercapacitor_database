Mesoporous activated carbon for supercapacitor is produced via phosphoric acid chemical activation of treated spent mushroom substrate (SMS). The nature of activated carbon is characterized using X-ray diffraction while surface morphology is performed using scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption at 77 K for specific surface area, pore distribution and pore diameter. The highest specific surface area of 51.6 m2g-1 is achieved in SMS500. The electrochemical capacitance performance of the activated carbon as supercapacitor electrodes are carried out with cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) in 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte. The CV results revealed a maximum specific capacitance of 17 Fg-1 at 3 mVs-1 scan rate and 10 Fg-1 at 1 mA current in CD. A non-toxic and environmentally friendly electrode material is synthesized. The study discovers a new field of SMS into a promising and valuable energy storage material.
