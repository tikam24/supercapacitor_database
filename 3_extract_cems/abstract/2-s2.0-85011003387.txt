The structural and electrochemical properties of lanthanum manganate (LaMnO3) powder prepared by the sol-gel method are researched in this article. The powder calcined at 600°C showed amorphous, and the powder calcined at 700-800°C showed the pure phase of the LaMnO3. The grains with the size of about 80-120 nm were agglomerating together. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical properties in alkaline environment. The electrochemical properties calcined at 700°C showed a specific capacitance of 73 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. The raw materials for preparing the LaMnO3 powder are cheap, and the operation method is simple.
