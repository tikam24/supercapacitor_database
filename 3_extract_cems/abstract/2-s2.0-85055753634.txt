Three-dimensional (3D) flower center/petal nanostructure exhibits excellent electrochemical performance because of their unique unfold ultra-thin multi-layer structure benefit to the rapid transmission of electrons and the full infiltration of the electrolyte. A three-phase Fe5Ni4S8 nanosflower is constructed by one step alcohothermal technique using a mixture solvent of glycerol, diethylene glycol and ethylenediamine. Ethylenediamine successfully functions as the complexing agent of metal ions to slowly release the metal ions in the process of reaction, which encourage the flower petal nanostructure formation. Interestingly, when the proportion of iron increased, a novel Fe7S8@Fe5Ni4S8 flower center/petal nanostructure come into being. Benefiting from the interconnected structure of the multi-layer shell, the Fe7S8@ Fe5Ni4S8 nanosflower displays high specific capacitance of 670.4C g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability of 79.2% (531.0C g−1 at 20 A g−1), and longer cycling stability of 92.1% retained capacitance after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor demonstrates high energy density of 49.9 Wh kg−1 at power density of 770.0 W kg−1. Our results provide a new strategy to design metal sulfides with special structure for application to asymmetrical supercapacitor cathode material.
