This paper presents the world's first flight test results of a hydrogen fuel-cell/battery/supercapacitor triple hybrid power system for UAV propulsion. An introduction to the flight test vehicle is provided, followed by details of the fuel-cell, battery and supercapacitor and integration to form a cohesive triple hybrid power system in the UAV. Flight test results are analysed for two flights, demonstrating the impact of the supercapacitor to provide load smoothing to the fuel cell during dynamic flight conditions. The supercapacitor is found to provide a maximum boost power of 310 W and absorb up to 100 W, and cycles more than 1.4 Wh of energy during the second test flight.
