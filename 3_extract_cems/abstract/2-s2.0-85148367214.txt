Developing advanced electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications is of great significance. However, it challenging due to the low specific capacitance of carbon-based electrodes and the sluggish charge transfer kinetics of pseudocapacitive materials. In this work, a hybrid electrode material was designed and prepared to enhance the electrochemical performance. Pseudo-active copper sulfide (CuxS) particles were uniformly loaded on the skeleton of S-doped sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-derived 3D hierarchical porous carbon (S-CPC). Owning to the good electron conduction at the interface, abundant micro-/mesoporous pathways, large accessible surface, and excellent redox activity of CuxS particles, the optimized CuxS@S-CPC-400 sample showed a high specific capacitance of 1372 F g−1 (191 mAh g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with activated carbon and CuxS@S-CPC-400 as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, displayed an energy density of 75.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 380.8 W kg−1 and excellent long-life stability with a capacitance retention of 86.67% over 10000 cycles. This work provides a feasible route to develop hybrid electrodes for high-performance energy storage systems.
