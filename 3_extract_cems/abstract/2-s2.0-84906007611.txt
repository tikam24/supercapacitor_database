In this work, β-Ni(OH)2monolayer nanosheets were prepared in benzyl alcohol by a facile exfoliation-free sol-gel route. The hydrolysis reaction of metal ions was started with the ring-opening reaction of epoxide. The in situ modification of benzyl alcohol molecules on the surface of secondary growth unit of hydroxide allowed the formation of β-Ni(OH)2monolayer nanosheets and 100 % monolayer state of β-Ni(OH)2in the resultant suspension. As proven in the electrochemical measurement, the maximum specific capacitance of 1735 F g-1was obtained at scan rate of 5 mV s-1within potential window of 0.6 V in 6 mol l-1KOH aqueous solution, which is equal to the theoretical value of β-Ni(OH)2. This high electrochemical performance is attributed to the complete exposure of every structure unit of β-Ni(OH)2to electrolyte. This work demonstrates that monolayer nanosheets can generate from the brucite-type nickel hydroxide through this bottom-up strategy although it had been theoretically considered to be impossible.
