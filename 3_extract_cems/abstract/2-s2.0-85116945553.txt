A Tagetes flower like SnS2nanopetals and nanoseeds has been successfully synthesized via facile solvothermal method without adding any surfactant. In contradiction, the crystal size and morphology plays a vital role for enhancing the electrochemical peformacne. The high capacitance behaviour of an prepared material using acetone indicated the petal-shaped A-SnS2electrode shows the higher specific capacitance value (10 mV s-1at 312 Fg-1) than using water as a solvent the seed like W-SnS2electrode. Moreover, the W-SnS2electrode provides the low charge transfer resistance than A-SnS2electrode. The GCD shows high capacity retention up to 95% cyclic stability at 5 A/g-1. Aforementioned, result suggest that metal sulfides is a good electrode for electrochemical energy storage applications.
