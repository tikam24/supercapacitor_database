Copper/activated carbon composites were prepared from phenolic resins by a doped method. The porous structures of composites with different copper contents were investigated using nitrogen gas adsorption. The electrochemical properties of composite electrodes were compared with activated carbon without copper by constant current cycling (CCC) methods. The microstructure of composite electrode was studied by TEM and XRD method. It was shown that the specific surface and mesopore amount increased with increasing activation time, and the doped copper could improve the specific capacitance of the composite electrodes. The charge-discharge mechanism was also explored.
