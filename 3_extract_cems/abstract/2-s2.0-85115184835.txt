Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted intense research interest for a broad range of device applications. Atomic layer deposition (ALD), a CMOS compatible technique, can enable the preparation of high-quality TMD films on 8 to 12 in. wafers for large-scale circuit integration. However, the ALD growth mechanisms are still not fully understood. In this work, we systematically investigated the growth mechanisms for WS2 and found them to be strongly affected by nucleation density and film thickness. Transmission electron microscope imaging reveals the coexistence and competition of lateral and vertical growth mechanisms at different growth stages, and the critical thicknesses for each mechanism are obtained. The in-plane lateral growth mode dominates when the film thickness remains less than 5.6 nm (8 layers), while the vertical growth mode dominates when the thickness is greater than 20 nm. From the resulting understanding of these growth mechanisms, the conditions for film deposition were optimized and a maximum grain size of 108 nm was achieved. WS2-based field-effect transistors were fabricated with electron mobility and on/off current ratio up to 3.21 cm2 V-1 s-1 and 105, respectively. Particularly, this work proves the capability of synthesis of TMD films in a wafer scale with excellent controllability of thickness and morphology, enabling many potential applications other than transistors, such as nanowire- or nanosheet-based supercapacitors, batteries, sensors, and catalysis.
