In mechanical braking, the kinetic energy is converted into heat losses. The system efficiency can be increased if this kinetic energy is recovered and reused. The regenerative braking in electric vehicles recovers this heat loss as electrical energy is restored in the battery, supercapacitors, or flywheel. The mathematical analysis of battery and supercapacitor is studied in this article. The performance of battery and supercapacitors during regenerative braking is presented. The characteristics of this regenerative braking process were studied using MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.
