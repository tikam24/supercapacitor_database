Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) embedded with a carbon network are gaining much attention because of their high power capability, which can be easily integrated to portable electronic devices. Facile chemical route has been explored to synthesize hexagonal structured VS2 nanoparticles onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) matrix. Such surface-modified VS2/MWCNTs electrode has boosted the electrochemical performance to reach high capacitance to 830 F/g and excellent stability to 95.9% over 10 000 cycles. Designed flexible solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device (FSSD) with a wide voltage window of 1.6 V exhibited maximum gain in specific capacitance value of 182 F/g at scan rate of 2 mV/s along with specific energy of 42 Wh/kg and a superb stability of 93.2% over 5000 cycles. As a practical approach, FSSD has lightened up "VNIT" panel consisting of 21 red LEDs.
