A novel structure of graphene-based hybrid hydrogels was constructed, in which α-Ni(OH)2 nanoflowers with nanopetals thicknesses of approximately 20 nm were uniformly anchored on a three-dimensional graphene framework. Benefiting from the unique morphological nickel hydroxide nanoflowers and hydrogels, the nickel hydroxide nanoflowers/graphene hydrogels exhibited great specific capacitances (1 A·g-1 1632 F·g-1), great rate capabilities, and longer cycle life (after 1000 cycles, 95.2% capacitance retention) when used as electrodes in supercapacitors.
