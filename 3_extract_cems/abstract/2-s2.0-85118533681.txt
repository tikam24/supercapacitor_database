The emerging miniaturized energy storage devices focus on wearable, flexible, and portable electronic devices with high energy density, fast energy transfer capability, long charge-discharge cycles, and low cost. In the present work, a one-step chronoamperometry technique was used to fabricate the three-dimensional ternary architecture of iron oxide embedded polypyrrole-rGO matrix (Fe-PrGO) and the corresponding binary (PrGO) and unary (PPy) to have a comparative study on the enhancement of the capacitance. A thorough investigation was carried out to interpret the crystal structure, composition, material morphology, and electrochemical performance. The structure-property-performance correlation was analysed for realising the suitability of the prepared hybrid nanocomposites as electrode materials. The prepared electrode showcased a specific capacitance of 442 F g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte (1 M KCl) at a current density of 1 A g−1. The Fe-PrGO electrode displayed a good cycle performance with 88% of the original capacity retained over 8000 cycles that may be attributed to the superior ion-transport kinetics offered by the synergistic effect of properly selected components. Our study confirms that Fe-PrGO offers an effective solution to enhance the preparation of metal oxide based low-cost environmentally benign flexible supercapacitors to power the virtual health-care devices that become a permanent outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic and flexible supercapacitor for long cycling applications
