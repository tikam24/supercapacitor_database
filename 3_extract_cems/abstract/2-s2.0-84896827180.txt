To improve the stability of DC bus voltage in DC microgrid, and reduce the impact on microgrid equipments by the DC bus voltage fluctuations, a supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) is designed to connect to the DC bus by the bi-directional converter. The controller is designed by the feedforward control and proportional method with the deadband. The great load disturbance is simulated in PSIM software when the DC microgrid operates in the grid-connected rectification mode. The simulation results show that SCES under the proposed control strategy can reduce the fluctuation range of the DC bus voltage in a wide range of load disturbances, and the dynamic response performance of DC bus voltage is improved.
