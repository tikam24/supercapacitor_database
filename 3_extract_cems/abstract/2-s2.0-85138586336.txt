Hyper-crosslinked polymers are inexpensive materials that have a high carbon content, making them ideal carbon precursor. In this study, hyper-crosslinked PPy was prepared by a solvothermal method. Using it as a precursor, N-doped porous carbon (PPyCN-800-B) was prepared by using urea, and the effects of the N doping ratio on the microstructure, components, and electrochemical properties of PPyCN-800-B were studied. The results demonstrated that PPyCN-800-1:4 was formed by the accumulation of non-hollow nanospheres of different diameters. The N content increased from 3.89% of PPyC-800 to 8.08%. When the current density was 1 A g-1, the specific capacitance of PPyCN-800-1:4 increased from 109.1 F g-1 for PPyC-800 to 228.0 F g-1, and the current density was increased from 1 A g-1 to 10 A g-1, with a specific capacitance decay rate of 16.67% in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. After 5000 charging/discharging cycles, the capacitance retention was as high as 89.53%, showing the good cyclic stability and excellent electrochemical properties of PPyCN-800-B. N doping increased the number of porous carbon defects, produced more active sites with pseudocapacitance, and improved the materialâ€™s wettability. This, in turn, facilitated the adsorption and desorption of electrolytic ions and significantly improved the electrochemical properties of porous carbon
