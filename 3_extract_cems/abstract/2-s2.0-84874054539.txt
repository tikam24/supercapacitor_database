In this study, densely packed Co3O4 nanotubes for supercapacitors have been obtained by means of chemically depositing cobalt hydroxide within a porous anodic aluminum oxide and then annealed at 360Â°C. The morpholog- ical properties obtained Co3O4 nanotubes were studied by scanning electron microscopy, the chemical composition was determined by examination of the energy dispersive X-ray spectra. Supercapacitor characteristics such as charging/discharging and impedance (Z) characteristics were also examined.
