Advanced carbon materials are important for the next-generation of energy storage apparatus, such as electrochemical capacitors. Here, the physical and electrochemical properties of carbonised filter paper (FP) were investigated. FP is comprised of pure cellulose and is a standardised material. After carbonisation at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1700°C, FP was contaminant-free, containing only carbon and some oxygenated species, and its primary fibre structure was retained (diameter ≈20-40μm). The observed enhancement in conductivity of the carbonised FP was correlated with the carbonisation temperature. Electrochemical capacitance in the range of ≈1.8-117Fg-1 was achieved, with FP carbonised at 1500°C showing the best performance. This high capacitance was stable with >87% retained after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. These results show that carbonised FP, without the addition of composite materials, exhibits good supercapacitance performance, which competes well with existing electrodes made of carbon-based materials. Furthermore, given the lower cost and renewable source, cellulose-based materials are the more eco-friendly option for energy storage applications.
