Abstract: NiO–CuO composite oxide electrode materials with different proportions are prepared by the co-precipitation method. The CuO is uniformly doped with NiO, as the CuO content increases, the particle distribution of the composite material becomes more uniform and smaller, and the surface area gradually increases. When the current density is 0.1 A g–1, the NiO–CuO composite oxide ratio of 7 : 3 has the highest specific capacity of 655.76 F g–1. While the current density increases to 3 A g–1, its specific capacity was 264.58 F g–1. After 500 cycles, the specific capacity remains at 89.85%, which shows a good cycle life and low resistance, superior cycle stability and high reaction activity.
