The proceedings contain 105 papers. The topics discussed include: facile synthesis of graphene from graphite using ascorbic acid as reducing agent; toughening and strengthening of ceramics composite through microstructural refinement; the effect of tempering temperature on pitting corrosion resistance of 420 stainless steels; structure and high temperature oxidation of mechanical alloyed Fe-Al coating; microstructure and oxidation behavior of high strength steel AISI 410 implanted with nitrogen ion; characterization of CNTMnO2 nanocomposite by electrophoretic deposition as potential electrode for supercapacitor; the quality of muntilan sand (central Java) as construction material, a longitudinal study; synthesis and visible light photocatalytic properties of iron oxide-silver orthophosphate composites; and structural modification of strontium hexaferrite through destruction process and ionic substitution.
