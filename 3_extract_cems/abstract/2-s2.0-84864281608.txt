A hybrid asymmetric electrochemical supercapacitor is constructed by employing two different nanostructured conducting polymers of polypyrrole (PPy) and self-doped polyaniline (SDPA). Different electrochemical methods, including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), are performed to characterize the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. The maximal working potential window of 1.3 V is associated with more than 97 F g -1 of total electrode materials. The cell maintains approximately 70% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles with an equivalent series resistance (ESR) below 1.6 Ω cm 2. Furthermore, the system shows high specific energy, specific power and maximum power values of 22.87 Wh kg -1, 570 W kg -1 and 45,193 W kg -1, respectively, at a current density of 5 mA cm -2 in 1 M KCl. Long-life cycling is achieved by removing dissolved oxygen and using a mild pH electrolyte, which limits the redox activity of the electrically conducting polymers (ECPs). Moreover, the proposed supercapacitor exhibits high capacitance retention of 89% at a higher current density (40 mA cm -2), indicating good electrochemical stability and rate capability. The performance of the proposed hybrid supercapacitor has been compared with two other symmetric cells. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
