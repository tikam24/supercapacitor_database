The aim of this paper is to evaluate and to describe a Stand-alone renewable energy system (SRES). This latter is composed of three components, namely solar energy system (SES), a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and a supercapacitor device (SCap). As a primary power source of the concerned system, the SES releases firstly the necessary of power to a DC load. A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEL) is considered a long-term storage system that stores the surplus of energy generated by the SES system in hydrogen form. Used as a power generation system, the PEMFC ensures the supply of the load in the event of power failure. The integration of the SCap ensures the elimination of the slow dynamics of the PEMFC during transient event. A novel Energy Management Controller (EMC), which serves to the system handling, is proposed. Simulation results obtained using Matlab/Simulink software are presented to verify and to point out the validity of the proposed system. Â© 2014 IEEE.
