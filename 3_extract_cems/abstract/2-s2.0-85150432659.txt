A practical and straightforward one-step co-electrodeposition process path for preparing electrode (Mo2CTx/PDTDA/rGO) based on poly (2, 2′- dithiodianiline) and 2D Mo2CTx-MXene was developed. The three-dimensional Mo2CTx/PDTDA composite on the rGO electrode facilitated electron transfer and ionic diffusion. Hence, the composite has been recognized as a multifunctional electrode with significant supercapattery and electrocatalytic activity. The laboratory-scale assembled symmetric supercapacitor devices (SSC) have a large energy density 82.5 mWh cm−2 (181.5 Wh kg−1) at a power density of 1000 mW cm−2 (2200 kW kg−1). In addition, the SSC device displays high durability with more than 90.5 % capacitance retention at the current density of 5 A cm−2 after 5000 cycles. The HER electrocatalytic activity of Mo2CTx/PDTDA/rGO electrode exhibited good catalytic activity, and superb stability for HER, demanded low overpotentials of 59 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and also has a low corresponding Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH. The results based on the Mo2CTx/PDTDA show the practical application of the proposed composite as a highly efficient electrochemical catalyst in renewable green energy resources.
