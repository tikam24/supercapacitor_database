Many oxide based materials show excellent pseudocapacitive properties, which are closely related to their surface structure. As a powerful technique that can give detailed local structure information, solid-state NMR spectroscopy has been used to characterize related materials. This chapter introduces the basic principles for supercapacitors, and summarizes recent developments and results in applying solid-state NMR to study surface structure, as well as charge/discharge processes of oxide pseudocapacitors.
