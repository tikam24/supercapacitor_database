Supercapacitors (SC) / Electro Chemical Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC) is yet to experience widespread use. Recently, advances have been made in improving both energy and power density. Due to their limited power and energy capabilities, they saw use in applications such as memory backups. New applications in the area of FCV, EV, EHV, space, military, automotive subsystems and industrial automation are being attempted at an increasing rate. Its use in electronic devices like mobiles, Laptops and communication systems is gaining momentum. Supercapacitor is mainly a pulse power device even though it is seen as a replacement to battery in low power applications. In pulse power, the width of pulse, stability, repetition rate along with commercial aspects like cost, volume, weight and life requires attention. Aqueous metal oxide based supercapacitors are more compatible with battery. Material based models which are useful in fabrication of electrode are presented for their comparative study. Â©2010 IEEE.
