Ultracapacitors is becoming increasingly popular as an energy storage device for the power system. In reality, the control of the DC/DC converter is still a challenging problem to meet the precise charging/discharging of ultracapacitors. In this paper, a discrete-time converter model and a model predictive control scheme are proposed to address this issue. The model is presented by using T-S fuzzy model, which can solve the difficulties in the controller design of the DC/DC converter with nonlinear characteristics. Based on this model, an optimal control problem with the constraints of the duty cycle and the system parameters is formulated. The T-S based model predictive control approach is introduced to design a control system for a highly nonlinear process. In this approach, a process system is described by a fuzzy convolution model. In the controller design, prediction errors and control energy are minimized through an optimization process. A Kalman filter based state estimating is to account for unmeasured load variations and to achieve zero steady-state output error. The proposed scheme can also achieve the real-time control of the system. The simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and stability of the designed controller.
