The poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene/nanoporous gold (PEDOT/NPG) composite electrode materials were prepared by electrochemically polymerizing monomer 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) onto NPG with high conductivity and large specific surface area by one-step method. The scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Raman spectroscopy (Raman) and X-ray energy spectrometer were used to analyze the morphological structure and elemental composition of the composite electrode material. The electrochemical performance of the electrochemical workstation was studied systematically. The PEDOT/NPG electrode material has a mass specific capacitance of 555 F/g at low current density of 3 A/g, and its energy density and power density are 177.58 WÂ·h/kg and 1.73 kW/kg, respectively. The electrode material can still maintain 91.5% of the maximum capacitance after 2 000 cyclic voltammetry test and has excellent electrochemical performance.
