The pitch-based high crystallinity cokes are investigated by evaluating its potential as electrode materials for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). After activation process, the high crystallinity cokes-based activated carbon (hc-AC) demonstrates great potential for use as an electrode material for EDLCs. The specific capacitance of hc-AC with the carbon to KOH ratio of 1:3 is 276Fg-1, even with a low specific surface area of 983m2g-1. These results are comparable to that of the most commonly used material for EDLCs, MSP 20 (256Fg-1), which has a high specific surface area of 1807m2g-1.
