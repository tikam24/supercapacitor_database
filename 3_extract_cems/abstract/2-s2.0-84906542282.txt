Present investigation deals with the formation of ultra-long hairy polyaniline (PANI) nanowire synthesized via mechanochemical (solid state) polymerization method using ammonium peroxydisulphate (APS) as an oxidant and citric acid as a dopant. Solid state synthesis method is a simple mechanochemical route for synthesis of PANI. Granular nanostructure is observed for undoped PANI, whereas doping with citric acid facilitates the formation of nanowire structure. This is the first ever report of nanowire structure of PANI using mechanochemical route. Undoped PANI granules agglomerate directionally or arbitrarily to form rods or clusters. PANI nanowires agglomerate to form irregular structures. FTIR spectra prove successful formation of PANI. Smaller PANI nanoparticles are joined end-to-end by dopant to form ultra-long hairy nanowire. Citric acid doped PANI nanowire exhibits less thermal degradation and superior supercapacitative performance compared to undoped PANI. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
