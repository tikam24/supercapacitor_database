TiO2 nanoparticles for supercapacitor have been synthesized by a solution-based process. The nanoparticles were subjected to X ray diffraction for phase confirmation in the material and its structure. Morphology of the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles was investigated using scanning electron microscope. TiO2 based electrode was prepared on stainless steel substrate by drop casting and drying process. The fabricated device was further analyzed for electrochemical performance. Electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical analysis confirms a good capacitive behavior from the TiO2 nanoparticles. It proves that the synthesized TiO2 nanoparticles may be an important candidate for supercapacitor applications.
