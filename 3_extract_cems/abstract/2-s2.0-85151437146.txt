Prediction of electrical and thermal behavior of lithium-ion capacitor (LiC) technology as an asymmetric technology is feasible by designing a precise model. Such a model should mimic the behavior of LiCs in heavy-duty applications where high current rates are applied. The developed model is used to design a management system based on efficient modeling tools, including 0D (zero-dimensional) electro-thermal models and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) thermal models. A validated model is essential for LiCs as they operate at high dynamic current rates. In this article, the 0D second-order equivalent circuit model is developed to extract the electrical parameters of LiCs. Then, the thermal model is developed to be linked to the electrical model to make an electro-thermal platform capable of identifying the electro-thermal parameters. The characterization tests are performed within a wide range of temperatures, from the freezing temperature of −30 °C to the hot temperature of + 60 °C. Such a temperature range has never been carried out before. The validation is performed based on the owned experimental results. The applied current rates are from 0.1 A to 500 A, which shows the work's uniqueness in the field of electro-thermal modeling. Later, the extracted parameters have been set as inputs to the 3D CFD thermal model to design and develop a hybrid thermal management system (TMS) based on air cooling and heat pipes. Such a hybrid TMS maintains the maximum temperature at 24.6 °C when the temperature difference between the hottest and coldest cells is only 0.5 °C.
