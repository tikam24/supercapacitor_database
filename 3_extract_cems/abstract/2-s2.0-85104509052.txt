This paper is dedicated to the characterization of MoS2 supercapacitor structures by means of electrochemical methods. The pseudocapacitive behaviour of MoS2 structure is suggested as a dominant charge mechanism. The strong impact of the scan rate on the specific capacity is observed indicating a high impact of supercapacitor porosity on the capacity. Supercapacitor structures were subjected to the long-term electrolyte treatment. An increase of the specific capacity upon the electrolyte treatment is analysed by evaluation of morphological factor.
