A silver-incorporated polyaniline (Ag/PANI) pseudocapacitor electrode was produced using a facile electrodeposition method. By applying a static potential of 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl through a glassy carbon electrode in the electroplating solution of 0.2 M aniline in 0.2 M H 2SO 4 containing 0.5 mM AgNO 3 for 5 min, the Ag/PANI composite with ultrahigh porosity was obtained. Silver plays two significant roles for enhancing pseudocapacitance of the Ag/PANI composite: good electrical conductivity and fast ion transportation. The Ag/PANI composite exhibits high specific capacitance of 420 F g -1 measured in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1, which is about 2-fold higher than that of pure PANI. For the cycle stability, 94% of the original capacitance of Ag/PANI is retained after 2000 cycles, indicating excellent cycle stability while pure PANI has only 58% retention of its original capacitance.
