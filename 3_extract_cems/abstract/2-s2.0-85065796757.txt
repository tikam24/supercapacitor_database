A new microwave treated electrode materials have been developed for supercapacitor using graphene and polypyrrole (PPy) composite prepared by the sacrificial-template polymerization method. The prepared nanocomposites were then microwave processed with the help of the microwave oven for 10 seconds. Characterizations of the synthesized and microwave treated composite were performed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman Spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements, electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) measurements and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Then the electrode for electrochemical measurements is prepared by dispersing graphene/polypyrrole composite in an ordinary rubber solution and coated it on a graphite rod. From the BET analysis, microwave treated composite material exhibited the BET area of 34.13 m 2 g -1 . The composite revealed a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 240.4 Fg -1 for MGP175 (mass ratio of graphene oxide to PPy is 5:1.75, microwave operated) at 10 mV s -1 . This simple and low-cost method is used for the development of different composites for energy storage.
