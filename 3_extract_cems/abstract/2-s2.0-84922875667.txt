This paper covers the use of so-called supercapacitors in a general-purpose traversing gear electric drive when an assembly of supercapacitors is connected to a common dc link supplying several independent voltage inverters. In addition, during braking regimes of operation of an electric drive, the braking energy is stored in the supercapacitor and can later be used in motor-operation regimes. It is obvious that, unlike in the case of a frequency-controlled electric drive using braking resistance, saving of electric energy will be observed. The technical and economic efficiencies are determined of using capacitive reserves of electric energy in traversing electric drives. This is done with the use of mathematical models of traversing electric drives with a common dc link. Results of simulation and approximate calculation of electric-energy con-sumption by electric drives with a supercapacitor and brake resistance are presented, a comparative evalua-tion of the technical and economic characteristics of an electric drive is carried out, and an approximate pay-back period of crane electric-drive modernization with the use of capacitive energy storage is given.
