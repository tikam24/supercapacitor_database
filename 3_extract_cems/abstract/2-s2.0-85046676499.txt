Nowadays, hybrid electric vehicles are becoming a major trend of future vehicle industry due to emission reduction and energy conversation requirements. As a key technology, the related energy management strategy is one of the research focus for the purpose of prolonging battery life and increasing the vehicle endurance. This paper proposed a fuzzy control based energy management strategy for precise control of the energy flow between the Lithium iron phosphate(LFP) battery and Ultra-Capacitor(UC) parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The proposed fuzzy controller takes the power requirement of electric vehicle and State Of Charge(SOC) of LFP battery and UC as three input parameters, a power allocation factor between LFP battery and UC is then determined as an output variable. The simulation result proves that the fuzzy control based energy management strategy helps eliminating the surge current and significantly improve the energy utilization rate.
