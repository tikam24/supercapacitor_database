The hybrid power supply of fuel cell and super capacitor combines the advantages of high energy density of fuel cell with high power density of super capacitor. Based on the fuzzy logical control strategy, two fuzzy logical controllers are set up to participate in power distribution, and the simulation verification is carried out under the standard working Condition experiment, which effectively reduces the driving energy consumption of pure electric vehicles. This scheme control strategy is simple and easy to engineer.
