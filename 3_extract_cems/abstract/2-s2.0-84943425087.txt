The square rod-like NiS2 with open ends is synthesized by a general solution method without substrate followed by a post annealing treatment. This method involves a rapid self-assembly and a spontaneous aging process controlled by the time of the solution reaction. And the one-step solution-controlled reaction benefits for the convenient fabrication of metal sulfide precursors. The NiS2 with the length varying from 3 to 8 μm and the width of 2 μm has both open ends, and the BET surface area and average pore diameter of the NiS2 are 59.2 m2 g-1 and 24.4 nm, respectively. The porous NiS2 square rods show a high specific capacitance (1020.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 534.9 F g-1 at 10 A g-1) as well as excellent cycle life (93.4% of the initial specific capacitance remains after 1000 cycles). Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor device fabricated by using the NiS2 as the cathode and reduced graphene oxide as the anode delivers an energy density of 32.76 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 954 W kg-1. Therefore, the porous square rod-like NiS2 synthesized by an effective route exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as a promising cathode material for supercapacitors.
