The on-growing global requirement for sustainable energy has guided researchers to focus on the development of smart hierarchical 2D materials and their composites. 2D materials especially transition metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and graphene oxide (GO), have exhibited huge prospect in the energy storage due to their outstanding features like unique morphologies, great thermomechanical characteristics, electrical, electronic, electromagnetic, and magnetic properties. The combination of these GO-based 2D materials particularly GO/LDHs and GO/MXenes can prevent the chance of agglomeration in layers which enhance the innerlayer spacing, thermomechanical stabilities, along with the formation of interconnected network-like morphology of 2D/2D materials. All these characteristics has led to increase the energy conversion and storage potentials of GO/LDHs and GO/MXenes. In this review, first we illustrate the detail properties of GO/LDHs and GO/MXenes. Thereafter, the advancement in the energy storage applications including as supercapacitor, lithium-ion battery, lithium-sulfur battery, sodium- and potassium-ion batteries, and aluminium-ion battery, of GO/LDHs and GO/MXenes, are described. We summarize the structure-property-performance correlation of GO/LDHs and GO/MXenes. Finally, we have depicted the challenges and future opportunities of these materials followed by conclusions and perspective.
