In the paper, a model of a three‐phase frequency‐controlled induction electric drive has been developed in Simulink Matlab 2019 (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). This model is mathematically converted into a two‐phase model by transforming equations. It is proposed to compensate the voltage drop in the power system during start‐up operation under load by using super-capacitors as a buffer power source. A block of supercapacitors was calculated. Simulation modeling was performed at a different voltage than the network. The diagrams of the transient processes occurring in the electric drive when the power supply is changed were prepared. It was found that such a principle of implementing an additional source of electric energy allows to start induction electric drives in areas remote from industrial networks without significantly affecting their static and dynamic characteristics.
