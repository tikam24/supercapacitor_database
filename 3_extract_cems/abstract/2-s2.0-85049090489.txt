This study compares supercapacitors with reduced graphene oxide (rGO)‑carbon black (CB) and CB nanocomposite coated carbon cloth electrodes. We use a nitrogen DC-pulse atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) to process the electrodes. The APPJ processing time is <40 s. Nitrogen APPJ burns off organic binders to create nanoporous structures. Replacing part of the CB with rGO nano-flakes can increase the overall surface area to improve the supercapacitive performance. Specifically, by replacing 50 wt% of CBs with rGOs, the specific (areal) capacitance can be improved from 91.84 F·g−1 (19.74 mF/cm2) to 162.68 F·g−1 (29.16 mF/cm2), respectively, with 20 s APPJ processing time, as evaluated by cyclic voltammetry under a potential scan rate of 2 mV·s−1. The nitrogen DC-pulse APPJ is demonstrated to be an ultrafast and highly economical tool for efficiently processing nanocomposite electrodes of supercapacitors.
