Rational design of electrode materials with specific compositions and unique morphological and structural features to achieve supercapacitors (SCs) with high energy densities without compromising their inherent electrochemical merits remains a great challenge. Herein, a carbon nitride (C3N4) mediated “one-for-two” strategy was proposed to synthesize titanium nitride/carbon nanosheets (TiN/C) and titanium carbide/carbon nanosheets (TiC/C) with three-dimensional morphology and hierarchical structure, respectively. The derived TiN/C and TiC/C were used as cathode and anode materials, respectively, with excellent capacitor behavior in aqueous electrolyte. Specifically, asymmetric SCs constructed with the TiN/C cathode and the TiC/C anode delivered a large operation voltage of 0.3–1.8 V, a high specific capacitance of 103 F·g−1, and a remarkable energy density of 45.2 Wh·kg−1, outperforming most of the previously reported TiN- and TiC-based SCs. Ex situ XRD and TEM characterizations as well as DFT simulation indicated that the excellent performance could be attributed to reversible pseudocapacitive redox reaction and electro-adsorbed anions at the TiN/C cathode, and fast adsorption/desorption of cations at the TiC/C anode, as well as unique surface morphology and heterostructure. The strategy presented in this work also provides new design concepts for the synthesis of other transition metal nitrides (or carbides)/carbon composites for other advanced energy applications.
