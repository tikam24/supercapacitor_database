A ternary nanocomposite of graphene/polyaniline (PANI)/porous silica MCM-41 (MCM-41) was prepared by a hydrothermal method. The amount of graphene oxide (GO) in the graphene/PANI/MCM-41 nanocomposite had a strong effect on the supercapacitor performance. The experimental results showed that the specific capacitance of the graphene/PANI/MCM-41 nanocomposite could reach the highest value when the GO content was 50%. The specific capacitance of the nanocomposite was 405 F g-1 at a current density of 0.8 A g-1. Furthermore, over 91.4% of the original capacitance was retained after repeating the galvanostatic charge-discharge for 1000 cycles. The performance of the prepared supercapacitor containing different amounts of GO were studied in detail. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.
