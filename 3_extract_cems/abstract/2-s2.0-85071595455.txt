The immobilization of 5,10,15,20-tetraferrocenylporphyrin (TFcP) onto carbon nanotubes to prepare a novel electron donor–acceptor nanohybrid is investigated. The CNT@TFcP/Cu nanohybrid is prepared by in-situ synthesis of copper nanoparticles in the presence of Damson fruits extract and CNT@TFcP nanohybrid as a green method. The morphology and structure of prepared CNT@TFcP/Cu nanohybrid are explored by XRD, FT-IR, EDX, and SEM spectroscopies. The electrochemical efficiency of CNT@TFcP/Cu nanohybrid electrode is studied by CV, EIS, and GCD measurements. The specific capacitances of 280 F g−1 are obtained for CNT@TFcP/Cu nanohybrid at a current density of 10 A g−1. The CNT@TFcP/Cu nanohybrid shows retention time of 80% after 3000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry.
