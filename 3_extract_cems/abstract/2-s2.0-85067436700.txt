In this work, a novel nanohybrid composing of molybdenum disulphide nanosheets and zinc antimonate nanorods was fabricated using ultrasonication assisted homogenous magnetic stirring approach and investigated their electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors. First and foremost, the structural, vibrational, morphological, optical and chemical compositional characteristics of the fabricated nanohybrid electrode material were investigated. Subsequently, the electrochemical properties of the nanohybrid electrode were explored using CV, GCD and EIS studies in 1.0 M KOH solution. The fabricated nanohybrid electrode material exhibited tremendous electrochemical performance by distributing maximum specific capacitance of 469.28 F g−1 at a current density of 5.0 A g−1 with high cycling stability of 102.0% even after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A g−1. These exceptional electrochemical characteristics of MoS2/ZnSb2O6 nanocomposites are ascribed to the influence of ultrasonication on non-aggregated nanocomposite formation, existence of more number of electrochemical active sites and synergistic interactions between two different nanostructures. The acquired results confirmed that MoS2/ZnSb2O6 nanocomposites could be a prospective and electrochemically active candidate as electrode materials for supercapacitors.
