Supercapacitors-also called electrochemical capacitors-are a new type of electrochemical energy storage system applied for harvesting energy and delivering high power in a short time. Their main energy storage mechanism is based on charging an electrical double-layer (EDL) at the electrode-electrolyte interface of high surface area electrode materials. They have attracted attention for a variety of applications, especially in hybrid systems combining with batteries and fuel cells, because of their high power density, excellent cyclic stability, and rapid response to external loading on a powertrain [1-4]. However, their main disadvantage is the relatively low energy density (5-6 Wh/kg based on activated carbon [AC]), which is significantly lower than that of a lithium ion rechargeable battery (150 Wh/kg). Numerous efforts have been made to resolve this problem. In these works, various types and forms of porous carbon materials such as AC [5-9], aerogels [10-14], CNTs [15-22], mesoporous carbon [23-28], and carbide-derived carbons [29-33] have been used as electrodes in EDLCs. However, the reported results are still insufficient for practical applications. As we know, several factors of carbon materials such as specific surface area (SSA), pore size distribution, electrical conductivity, and surface wettability are crucial for electrode performance. Generally, although porous carbon materials have high SSA, the low conductivity restricts its application in high-power-density supercapacitors. On the other hand, although CNT materials possess excellent conductivity, their relatively low SSA affords them a low specific capacitance [16,34]. Thus, great effort is being put into developing novel carbon-based supercapacitor electrode materials with overall high performance.
