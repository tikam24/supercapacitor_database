Electrochemical capacitors, so-called supercapacitors, play an important role in energy storage and conversion systems. In the last decade, with the increasing volume of scientific activity and publications in this field, researchers have developed better tools to improve electrode materials. Although carbonaceous materials seem the most suitable for supercapacitor applications, a large diversity of materials has been proposed and studied. Yet, in order to accomplish performance beyond the limitations of each material, mainly in terms of energy density and durability, composite materials have been implemented, most of them being the combinations of carbon-based materials and other components. In this review, we present the recent advances in the field of composite materials that include at least one carbon-based component for supercapacitor electrodes. We focus on cases in which a single material by itself suffers from a drawback that can be overcome by combining it with other components, enabling the fabrication of a composite material with enhanced performance. We present several important compositions as well as the major routes of synthesis, characterization and performance of composite materials in this field.
