A novel reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified ternary metal oxide electrode material with rational microstructure was successfully developed by the hydrothermal approach following the heat treatment, in which gauze-like rGO sheets were homogeneously decorated on the surfaces of uniform CoMn 2 O 4 hollow microcubes. Benefitting from this special hybrid morphology possessing large specific surface area and good conductivity, the CoMn 2 O 4 @rGO composite gave rise to a greater specific capacitance of 1194.7 F g −1 at a low current density of 2 mA cm −2 , longer cycle life (88.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), and more excellent rate performance when fabricated into a promising electrode for electrochemical supercapacitors.
