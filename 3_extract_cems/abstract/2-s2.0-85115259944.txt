The novel Cu2P2O7 and Cu2P2O7@PPy electrode materials have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The fabricated electrode materials were characterized by XRD, FESEM, BET and XPS techniques to evaluate the structural, morphological, textural and chemical composition of the samples. Monoclinic structure with novel blade and honeycomb-like morphologies of Cu2P2O7@PPy composite sample was identified by XRD and FESEM studies. The BET surface area and BJH pore size of the Cu2P2O7@PPy composite sample were calculated to be 117.2 m2/g and 18.5 nm, which is higher than that of the Cu2P2O7 sample (83.5 m2g−1 and 34.2 nm). The electrochemical results suggest that the fabricated electrode exhibits high specific capcitance of 765 Fg−1at 1 Ag−1 current density. The capacitance retention of composite electrode delivers 99.6% after 6000 cycles. The fabricated ASC cell has a huge capacitance of 115 Fg−1 and capacitive retention of 92 % after 6000 cycles at a low current density of 1 Ag−1. In addition, the cell has a 39.8 WhKg−1 high energy density and a current density of 3582 Wkg−1at 1 Ag−1.
