Hybrid membrane of polyaniline layer/full carbon layer coating on nickel foam (PANI@FC@NF) is designed as supercapacitor electrode with superior anti-corrosion and capacitance performance in an acidic electrolyte. PANI@FC@NF is prepared by fully coating crack-free carbon layer on nickel foam (FC@NF) through hydrothermal and thermal carbonization of glucose, and then PANI layer is coated on FC@NF through the method of electrodeposition. FC@NF shows much lower corrosion current density (0.284 mA cm−2) and higher corrosion potential (-0.171 V) in 1.0 M H2SO4, compared with NF (7.208 mA cm−2 and -0.208 V). PANI@FC@NF electrode achieves specific capacitance of 610 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2 and cycling capacitance retention of 77.63 % at 2.0 mA cm−2 after 1000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4. All-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitor using PANI@FC@NF electrode and polyvinyl alcohol-H2SO4 gel electrolyte achieves 41 μWh cm−2 at 0.9 mW cm−2 and an excellent cycling performance.
