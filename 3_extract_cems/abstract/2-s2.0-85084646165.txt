DC Microgrid has been a key research area for the last few decades because of its ability to integrate renewable energy sources and its islanded operation. Power management for this system is important to guarantee high use of renewable sources and stable operation. This paper presents an Islanded DCMG in which PV connects with the DC bus through the unidirectional boost converter and its duty cycle is controlled by the P O MPPT algorithm. Its power is fed to a variable DC load. DC bus voltage is supported by the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Storage devices connect with the DC bus through the bidirectional buck-boost converters. A MATLAB/Simulink DC microgrid model with the integration of a PV array, battery and Supercapacitor, and a three-step Variable DC load is developed. The results are presented and discussed in this paper.
