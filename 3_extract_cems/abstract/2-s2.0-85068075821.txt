Herein, we have designed and prepared the battery-type redox behavior enabled hybrid V2O5@NiCo2O4 heterostructures on nickel foam by a simple one-step chemical bath deposition method. The structural and compositional analyses confirmed the presence of V2O5 and NiCo2O4 in the as-prepared hybrid V2O5@NiCo2O4 composite. The electrochemical studies reveal that the V2O5@NiCo2O4 composite electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 184.49 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability of 88.5% at 12 A g−1 with good cycling stability (94.3% capacity retention over 3000 cycles), which are superior to the NiCo2O4 electrode. The results demonstrate that the hybrid V2O5@NiCo2O4 composite have a wide range of applications in the energy storage field.
