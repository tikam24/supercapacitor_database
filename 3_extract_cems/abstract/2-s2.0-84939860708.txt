Multi-shelled Mn2O3 hollow microspheres have been achieved through a pH-regulated method and used as supercapacitor electrodes. The designed unique architecture allows efficient use of pseudo-capacitive Mn2O3 nanomaterials for charge storage with facilitated transport for both ions and electrons, rendering them high specific capacitance, good rate capability, and remarkable cycling performance.
