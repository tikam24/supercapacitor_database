This paper presents an energy sources hybridization of vehicular storage system for energy management. In paper fuzzy logic control (FLC) is proposed to decide power sharing of battery (bat) and Ultra-capacitor (UC) with respect to torque requirement of vehicle. In this method power sharing is based upon real time power and long term energy requirements on the basis of State of charge (SOC) and depth of discharge (DOD). Sinking and sourcing of power from/to energy sources is controlled using DC/DC bidirectional converter.
