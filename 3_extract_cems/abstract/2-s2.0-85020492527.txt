In terms of the charge storage mechanism of supercapacitors, there are three types, including electrical double layer (EDL), surface redox reaction and intercalation reaction. The surface redox mechanism of transition metal-layered double hydroxides (TM-LDH) supercapacitor had been previously revealed. A dual charge storage mechanism integrated with surface redox and ion intercalation for LDH-based supercapacitors, however, is seldom reported before. For this purpose, here, we synthesized NiCo layered double hydroxide nanosheets via the intrinsic pillar effect of sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (NiCo-SDBS-LDH), and found that the surface redox and intercalation behaviors take effect simultaneously in NiCo-SDBS-LDH via electrochemical analysis. The NiCo-SDBS-LDH electrode having a relatively low specific surface area (15.28 m2 g−1) still exhibited a remarkable specific capacitance of 1094 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 A g−1, and super long cycle life of 81% retention over 3000 cycles. A dual charge storage mechanism is subsequently proposed based on the analysis of our results to explain the excellent properties of NiCo-SDBS-LDH. We believe that the enhancements should mainly be ascribed to the structural feature of the SDBS stabilized NiCo-LDH and the expanded interlayer space of NiCo-SDBS-LDH. These findings open new doors to functional pillared effect to control the electrochemical behaviors of TM-LDH-based materials.
