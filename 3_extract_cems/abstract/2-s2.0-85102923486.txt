Supercapacitor devices are used as energy storage technology for electrical circuits. Graphene, metal oxide, and conducting polymers are used as electroactive materials to enhance energy, power density, and cycle life. The present study uses TiO2 and rGO materials, which are added to polyaniline (PANI). The nanocomposite structure can be observed using different initial feed ratios of rGO, TiO2, and aniline monomer as [rGO]o/[TiO2]o/[ANI]o = 1:5:1, 1:5:2, 1:5:3, 1:5:4, and 1:5:5. Fourier transform infrared–attenuation–transmission reflectance, scanning electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, thermal-gravimetric analysis (TGA-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photon spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis are conducted. Electrochemical performances of a ternary nanocomposite material are carried out by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). According to results, rGO/TiO2/PANI nanocomposite shows much better performance than its individual components in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, power density, and cycle life. The highest specific capacitance is obtained as Csp = 692.87 F/g at 2 mV/s for [rGO]o/[TiO2]o/[ANI]o = 1:5:4. A new real circuit model of LRs(CR1)(QR2) is adopted to our device, which supplies enough energy to the light LED lamp (1.8 V) for 3 min. As a result, rGO/TiO2/PANI nanocomposite may be used as a promote candidate for energy storage systems. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
