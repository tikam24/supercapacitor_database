High-density carbon with high volumetric energy and power densities is desired for compact supercapacitors. However, most of the traditional solutions for boosting density are based on pore regulation, resulting in an unreasonable sacrifice of rate performance. Herein, from an opposite perspective of carbon units’ orderly stacking, a new strategy for compressing surplus pores between dual-scale carbon units at nanometer and micrometer scales (i.e., two-stage ordering of the first-level carbon nanocages and the second-level micro disc-like carbon nanocage assemblies) has been developed by regulating the template. The optimized carbon packed with ordered nano- and micro-carbon units achieves a high density of 1.08 g cm−3 (two times that of the commercial activated carbon) and yields a record-high volumetric energy density (79 Wh L−1), good power capability (31 kW L−1) in ionic liquid, superb stability (>30,000 cycles), and ideal Coulombic efficiency (∼100%). Even at the commercial-level electrode thickness, the available maximal stack power density is still as high as 12 kW L−1, which is dramatically higher than most of the reported dense carbon. This excellent volumetric performance highlights its practical potential in areas that require high volume energy and power density simultaneously. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
