RuO2·xH2O/AC composite electrode, an ideal electrode of super-capacitors, was prepared. For super-capacitors used usually having lower working voltage of super-capacitors, a newly hybrid super-capacitor was developed. The capacitor was composed of a tantalum metal anode, Ta2O5 dielectric, 38 wt% H2SO4 electrolyte solution and RuO2·xH2O/AC cathode. Test results show that the parameters of the hybrid super-capacitor are 50 V, 2.1 mF, the storage energy density is 1.48 J/cm3, showing that it has the high storage energy density and good impedance performance and can be used in pulse power systems.
