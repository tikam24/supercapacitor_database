Using covalent organic polymer precursors, we have developed a new strategy for location control of N-dopant heteroatoms in the graphitic porous carbon, which otherwise is impossible to achieve with conventional N-doping techniques. The electrocatalytic activities of the N-doped holey graphene analogues are well correlated to the N-locations, showing possibility for tailoring the structure and property of N-doped carbon nanomaterials.
