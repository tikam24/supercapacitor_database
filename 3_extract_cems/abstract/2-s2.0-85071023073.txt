Using hydrated manganese sulfate and general type graphene (GR) as raw materials, Mn3O4/GR composite has been successfully prepared by the liquid phase chemical co-precipitation method at room temperature. X-ray diffraction(XRD) was used to investigate the phase structure of Mn3O4 powder and Mn3O4/GR composite; The electrochemical performances of the samples were elucidated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge test in 0.5 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte. The results show that the Mn3O4/GR composite possesses graphene phase and good reversibility; the composite also displays a specific capacitance of 318.8 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.
