Herein, Ni nanodendrite (ND) with diameter ≈30-100 nm directly synthesized on Ni foam is utilized as an effective support for hydrous RuO2 in symmetric supercapacitors operated at 1.6 V. Highest specific capacitance 678.57 F g-1 can be achieved with energy density 60.32 Wh kg-1. Even at large current density 100 A g-1, high energy density 19.73 Wh kg-1 can still be maintained with power density 40 kW kg-1 owing to the pristine metal nanostructure without any carbon additive and resistive binder. Long lifespan is shown with marginal performance improvement (≈4%) over 10 000 cycles. More importantly, the template-less and self-assembled Ni ND synthesis requires only low temperature and eco-friendly chemicals, and can be simply dip-coated with RuO2 nanoparticles. All of these render the RuO2-Ni ND foam readily adapted into mass manufacturing without efforts. Ni nanodendrite foam (NDF) is synthesized via a self-assembly, acid etching, and hydrogen reduction process. NDF coated with hydrous RuO2 is utilized in symmetric supercapacitors showing a high potential window, superior energy and power density, and a long life cycle. The low temperature, template-less, and environmentally benign process renders this electrode an outstanding option for industrial manufacturing.
