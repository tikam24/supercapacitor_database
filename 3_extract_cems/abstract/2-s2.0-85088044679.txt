This work describes the successful growth of electroactive KNb3O8 nanorods on the flexible and conductive activated textile carbon cloth (aTC) for supercapacitor application. The KNb3O8 nanorods on aTC (aTC-KNb3O8) exhibit reversible redox reactions in 3.0 M aqueous KOH electrolyte and store charges through surface ion adsorption and K+ insertion. Moreover, coating a layer of carbon by oxidative polymerization of dopamine yields the aTC-KNb3O8@C with substantially improved capacitive performances. The carbon serves as protective layer that not only offers double-layer capacitance and enhances the conductivity but also dramatically improves the cycling life of the composite electrode. Accordingly, the aTC-KNb3O8@C electrode delivers specific areal capacitance of 1439 mF cm-2 (corresponding to 470 F g-1 of KNb3O8) at 8 mA cm-2 and retains 86% capacitance at current density up to 50 mA cm-2. Moreover, the aTC-KNb3O8@C electrode also retains 71% of its initial capacitance after cycling the electrode for 10 000 cycles. These performances are much better than those of aTC-KNb3O8 electrode, making the aTC-KNb3O8@C to be one of promising candidates with potential applications in supercapacitor K and Li-ion battery.
