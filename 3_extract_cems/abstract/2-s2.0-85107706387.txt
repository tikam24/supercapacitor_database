This paper presents the synthesis of an induction motor neural controller and a regenerative braking controller for an electric vehicle architecture, based on two energy system, a Main Energy System (MES) and an Auxiliary Energy System (AES). Such controllers are based on system identification, trajectory tracking and state estimation. System identification uses a Recurrent High Order Neural Network (RHONN), trained with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). RHONN obtains an accurate motor model which is robust in presence of external disturbances and parameter variations. To force the motor to track a desired torque trajectory and to reject undesired disturbances, an inverse optimal controller based on the identified neural model is proposed. Therefore, the proposed scheme does not need a-priori knowledge of motor parameters. For state estimation a super-twisting observer is implemented to estimate the rotor magnetic fluxes. The regenerative braking controller addresses the issue when the battery is not capable to accept the generated energy due to braking; Therefore, an AES based on a super capacitor and a buckâ€“boost converter is a solution to recover the braking energy and give power to the motor during acceleration. The regenerative braking controller is based on a PI control to regulate voltage and current of the super capacitor. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the performance of the proposed controllers which are implemented using a rapid control prototyping platform integrated by a dSPACE board. Experimental tests are carried out for a topology with and without AES to illustrate the improvement of the proposed EV architecture.
