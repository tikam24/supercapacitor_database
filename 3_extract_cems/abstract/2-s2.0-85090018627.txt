This paper presents a new and facile method to prepare molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/graphene composites and their inks based on an improved ball milling process. The developed method is cost effective, environmentally friendly, and scalable, producing few-layer MoS2 material and MoS2/graphene-based inks. The prepared inks after characterization by SEM, Raman, XRD, FTIR, CA and rheology were used to fabricate electrodes for supercapacitors by adopting two designs: 2D printed and sandwiched electrodes. The electrodes showed excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 392 Fg−1 at 5 mV s−1 and low equivalent resistance of 0.41 Ω, which outperforms the properties of graphene electrodes. The specific capacitance of electrodes prepared by 2D printing using MoS2/graphene ink was 76 Fg−1 at 5 mV s−1 with an areal capacitance of 58.5 mF/cm−2 at 0.77 mg/cm−2, demonstrating high energy storage capability. The performance of the MoS2/graphene composites and their inks highlights their promising application as electrode materials for high-performance energy storage devices.
