The 2D amorphous cobalt coordination framework/silver nanowires nanocomposites (A-CoL/Ag NC) are successfully synthesized by one-step solution agitation at room temperature. The experimental data reveal that the hybrid provides sufficient contact between active materials and electrolyte, and facilitates the transfer of ions/electrons, resulting in high specific capacitance, high output potential, great rate capacity at high current density, and good cycle stability. As supercapacitor electrode materials, the as-prepared A-CoL/Ag NC electrode exhibits a great specific capacitance which can reach up to 1467 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2, and 1060 mF cm−2 even at 10.0 mA cm−2. The A-CoL/Ag NC// activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor (AC ASC) displays a maximum energy density (110 W h kg−1 at 760 W kg−1) and maximum power density (6410 W kg−1 at 63 W h kg−1) in 3.0 m KOH. Moreover, the developed solid-state A-CoL/Ag NC//AC ASC has a broad operated potential window within 0–1.6 V, long cycle life (95.2% after cycling 7000 cycles), delivering an energy density of 151 W h kg−1 (at 790 W kg−1), and a power density of 7972 W kg−1 (at 70 W h kg−1). The well-synthesized nanocomposite provides a novel way to synthesize prominent electrode materials for supercapacitors.
