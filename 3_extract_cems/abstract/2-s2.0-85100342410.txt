The quest for combining different materials for energy storage has gained key interest in the globe. In this study, titanium nitride (TiN) were synthesized by nitriding of TiO2 followed by subsequent gold (Au) nanoparticles doping using conventional deposition precipitation technique. X-ray diffraction results confirmed the purity of the TiN and Au structural phase. The existence of Au, Ti and N were confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray in each composition. The field emission scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the morphology of TiN in granular shaped nanoparticles and the presence of Au particles. The microstructural analysis was performed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and the results show a well-defined (111) crystal plane. Electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrode with 5% Au/TiN shows a specific capacitance of 787 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 that is far higher compared to 202 F g−1 for the pure TiN electrode. The higher value of capacitance of 5% Au/TiN electrode is attributed due to the conductive and mechanical stable behaviour of both gold and titanium nitride. Hence, the high performing 5% Au/TiN composition can be considered as a favourable electrode material for supercapacitor application.
