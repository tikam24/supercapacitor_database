Well-crystalline porous cobalt oxide (Co3O4) nanorods (NRs) were synthesized through hydrothermal method and applied as electro-active electrode material for pseudo-supercapacitors. At low calcination temperature of 300 °C, the porous and smooth morphology of Co3O4NRs were obtained whereas, the rod morphology changed to stacks of nanoparticles at high calcination at 500 °C. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman scattering spectroscopies revealed the formation of pure and good crystal quality porous Co3O4NRs. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis of porous Co3O4NRs showed the decrease of surface area and pore volume with the increase of calcination temperature. The charge storage ability, cycle stability and ion transport of the synthesized porous Co3O4NRs electrode were investigated by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. As compared to Co3O4NRs-500 °C electrode, the specific capacitance of ∼226.3 Fg−1at a scan rate of ∼10 mVs−1was achieved by the fabricated pseudo-supercapacitors based on porous Co3O4NRs-300 °C electrode. The synthesized porous Co3O4NRs electrode showed excellent stability by maintaining up to ∼76% capacity retention after 5000 cycles.
