The RGO/Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposites were synthesized by an easy and cost-effective graphenothermal process during which GO and Fe 2 O 3 were reduced to RGO and Fe 3 O 4 , thus forming the RGO/Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite. This material possesses high specific surface area of 141.3 m 2 g −1 and average pore diameter of 5.8 nm. The RGO/Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposites showed excellent electrochemical performance in supercapacitors (SCs). As a SC electrode, it exhibited an excellent specific capacitance (C s ) of 498 F g −1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s −1 and maintained 98.7% of capacitance retention at 500 mV s −1 over 5000 cycles. Moreover, it exhibited 94% of capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles at a current density of 3 A g −1 . So, the developed RGO/Fe 3 O 4 nanocomposite materials here hold high potential for energy storage applications.
