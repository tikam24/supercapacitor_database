A poly(ortho-phenylenediamine-co-aniline) copolymer is synthesized via the oxidative route, using a 1:1 M ratio of aniline to ortho-phenylenediamine (oPDA) and ammonium persulfate as the oxidizing agent. Infrared spectroscopy indicates that the copolymer contains the functional groups typically present in polyaniline and poly(ortho-phenylenediamine); whereas UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy shows that the copolymer adopts a phenazine-type structure. Cyclic voltammetry evidences the copolymer synthesis, as a redox peak at −65 mV, different from those exhibited by polyaniline (160 mV and 600 mV) or poly(o-phenylenediamine) (−240 mV) is observed. Finally, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the charge/discharge test provide support to propose the copolymer application in electrodes for supercapacitors.
