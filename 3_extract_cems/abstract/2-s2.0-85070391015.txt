To meet the load demand of 15 rural houses in Sundarban (India) area, standalone solar-wind renewable power generation system along with battery, battery-ultracapacitor and battery-fuel cell hybrid energy storage is considered. Components of the renewable based proposed hybrid system are optimized through Bacteria Foraging Optimization (BFO) technique. The total lifetime (20 years) cost of the renewable system is minimized to meet a certain yearly load pattern. The results obtained show that the battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage-based system accounts least cost compared to battery-only and battery-fuel cell storage system. The program for the optimization algorithm has been done in MATLAB 2015a platform.
