This article presents simulation tests showing the benefits of using an additional energy storage device in the form of a supercapacitor in a hybrid car. An original power flow control system was proposed. The main emphasis was placed on determining the driving characteristics, emissions of harmful substances, fuel consumption and increasing the service life of batteries by limiting rapid changes in the charging and discharging currents and the operating temperature of the cells.
