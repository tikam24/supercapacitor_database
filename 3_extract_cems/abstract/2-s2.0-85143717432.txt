The world energy scenario is rapidly shifting from fossil fuels to cleaner, greener, and sustainable carbon-free energy technologies such as solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. The realization of these technologies heavily relies on the fundamental properties of the electrode materials that are being used to fabricate these energy devices. Nanostructured tungsten oxide (WO3−x) has been emerged as a prominent metal oxide for energy applications due to its inherently tunable nonstoichiometry, surface-active redox states optimized to improve the electrode kinetics in supercapacitor applications. Nanostructuring in WO3−x has led to significant improvement in its electrochemical performance by suitably exposing its active sites, leading to enhanced charge transfer rates, ion diffusion characteristics, and electrochemical stability. The existence of WO3−x into several different polymorphs allows dimensionality-dependent morphology tuning easily achievable by modulating its nucleation-growth mechanisms. This chapter provides an overview of the recent advancement in the tailored synthesis of WO3−x nanostructures and their composites, along with their contribution toward the development of advanced supercapacitors for next-generation energy storage devices.
