Reduced graphene oxide/nickel cobalt oxide (rNiCo) nanocomposites synthesized via one pot hydrothermal procedure were reported. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and High Resolution-Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and High Resolution-Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM) results demonstrates the formation of rNiCo nanocomposites and their morphology. The rNiCo-30 sample exhibits large specific surface area 236.548 m2g− 1 along with highly open mesoporous structure. The electrochemical properties are investigated by employing Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The rNiCo-30 sample achieve specific capacitance of 962.96 Fg− 1 at current density 1 Ag− 1, energy density 308.14 WhKg− 1 and excellent cycling stability (93.5%) for 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 3 Ag− 1. The power density for the sample rNiCo-30 at different current densities 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Ag− 1 are 0.67, 0.76, 0.83, 0.88 and 0.94 KWKg− 1 respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance of rNiCo-30 electrode attributed to easy diffusion of electrolytes and availability of many electrochemical active sites. Moreover presence of rGO in the nanocomposite structure offered uniform porous structures which enables easy flow of electron transportation. These results suggest that prepared electrodes have a great potential for supercapacitor applications. The synthesized nanocomposites could be used as an electrode material for supercapacitor devices.
