A new type of hybrid electric train based on "net+battery+supercapacitor" was studied. The general structure of the train and the methods for calculation of traction power were introduced. The automatic train control method based on target speed curves was given. The energy transfer relationship of the hybrid electric power system was analyzed and the power allocation strategy was proposed. Operation of a hybrid electric train on a railway line was simulated to verify the performance of a hybrid electric train. The simulation results indicate as follows: The train control system is able to generate the target speed curve and control the train to follow the curve automatically; the hybrid power supply distribution algorithm is able to allocate the output power of storage batteries and supercapacitors effectively; adopting the schemes of braking energy recovery and charging at stations, the train can run over a railway line of the total length of 10 km, with 6 stations along the line and without setting up of catenary systems except for the station platforms.
