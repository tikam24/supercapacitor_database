Temperature has a huge influence on supercapacitor cells and modules ageing. Consequently, thermal management is a key issue concerning lifetime and performance of supercapacitor modules. This paper presents thermal modeling and heat management of supercapacitor modules for vehicle applications. The thermal model developed is based on thermal-electric analogy and allows the determination of supercapacitor temperature. Relying on this model, heat management in supercapacitor modules was studied for vehicle applications. Thus, the modules were submitted to real life driving cycles and the evolution of temperatures of supercapacitors was estimated according to electrical demands. The simulation results show that the hotspot is located in the middle of supercapacitors module and that a forced airflow cooling system is necessary. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
