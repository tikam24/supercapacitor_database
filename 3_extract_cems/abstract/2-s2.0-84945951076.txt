The electrochemical properties of porous carbons used as supercapacitor electrodes are largely determined by the pore size and its distribution. Here, we report that high-mesopore-volume nanocarbons (HMC) produced by one-step sintering process considerably improve the capacitive behavior by providing the desired highly accessible surfaces. The symmetric supercapacitors based on the HMC materials show high gravimetric capacitances of ∼180 and ∼215 F g-1 and also high volumetric capacitances in organic and ionic liquid electrolytes. High mesoporous volume ratio of HMC sample (∼76%) facilitates fast ionic transport while preserving good electronic conductivity and thus delivers both high energy and power density. This simple, cost-effective and scalable preparation technique and excellent capacitive behavior of HMC samples encourage their practical application.
