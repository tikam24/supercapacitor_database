Due to their high pseudocapacitance and laminated structure, α-MoO3 nanosheets have been considered as one of the promising electrode materials of energy storage devices. In this work, hierarchical α-MoO3 nanosheet arrays have been in-situ grown on Mo wires (MoO3-Mo wires) via one-step calcination in air. The obtained MoO3-Mo wires possess well aligned laminated structure, which will benefit intercalation of Li-ion into the electrodes. Thus, a type of Li-ion electrolyte was applied in the assembled wire-based supercapacitors (WSCs). Electrochemical tests showed that the MoO3-Mo single wire electrodes can exhibit high capacitance (7.68 mF cm−1 at 2 mV s−1) and excellent cycling stability (nearly 100% after 4000 cycles). Moreover, series of optimization tries indicated that the laminated structure of MoO3 nanosheet arrays can be well tuned by calcination temperature and time, accordingly resulting in the optimized electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the assembled all-solid state symmetrical WSCs based on MoO3-Mo wires showed high energy density (∼1.04 mW h cm−3), high cycling stability, and good flexibility.
