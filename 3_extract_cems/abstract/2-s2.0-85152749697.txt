Since the discovery of the environmental issues associated to the use of fosil-fuel based energy, special attention has been paid to the development of electrochemical energy storage devices.In this context, lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors have been proposed for satisfying the future energy demands. However, the current state of the art for both devices indicates that advanced materials are required to a truly implantation of both technologies for stationary and mobile applications. Mesoporous materials can play an important role in these advances. They mainly show unique textural and morphological properties that can facilitate the electrochemical reactions involved in a lithium ion battery or can improve the necessary electrolyte/electrode surface interaction in a supercapacitor. After an introduction exposing the different mechanism of energy storage for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors, we will focus on how the interesting properties of the mesoporous materials can influence the performance of themost common electrode materials. Finally, we will show our more recent research in the field, namely mesoporous LiFePO4 and template mesoporous carbons for lithium ion battery and supercapacitor electrodes, respectively.
