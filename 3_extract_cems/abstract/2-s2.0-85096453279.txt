The synthesis carbon nanofiber electrode made from biomass materials for supercapacitor application has been successfully performed by using mechanical and alkali treatment method. Synthesis of carbon nanofiber in this study is described in two main steps, namely: (a) the alkali treatment approach and (b) a combination of mechanical and alkali methods. Carbon nanofiber obtained through first method shows a diameter size in the range of 42-131 nm with a relatively low density, whereas a carbon nanofiber with a relatively higher density and smaller diameter size of 25-102 nm by the second method. The performance of supercapacitor cells produced specific capacitance in ranges of 54-178 F g-1. The biomass wastes that have been used as raw material for carbon nanofiber synthesis such as banana stems, pineapple crown, Terminalia cattapa leaves, water chestnut grass, and Areca catechu husk. As a support data, there also has been an analysis of the chemical compositions and the specific surface area of the supercapacitor electrode.
