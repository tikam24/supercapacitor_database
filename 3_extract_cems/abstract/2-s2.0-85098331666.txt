Nowadays, hybrid vehicles have attracted major attention of researchers due to their capabilities to reduce consumption of fossil fuel, decrease air pollution and improve energy and environment sustainability. One of the most important challenges in production of hybrid vehicles is the optimal design of the energy management system in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. In this paper, an adaptive fuzzy logic based energy management scheme is proposed for a combined power generation system containing FC (FC), battery and ultracapacitor. In the mentioned system, the FC is the main source while both the battery and ultra-capacitor are used as auxiliary sources of energy. To evaluate performance of the proposed energy management scheme, ADVISOR toolbox in Matlab software is utilized for modelling different parts of the hybrid vehicle. Furthermore, to adjust scaling factors of the proposed system in order to reduce both the speed and fuel consumption errors, the Social Spider Algorithm (SSA) is suggested. The simulation results in Matlab verify that the proposed method provides a better performance than the well-known Power Tracking Control (PTC) system because this scheme updates its parameters online. Moreover, it reduces fuel consumption and tracks the reference speed better in comparison with PTC.
