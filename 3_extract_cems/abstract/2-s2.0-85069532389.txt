Global demand for energy is on a progressive increase and there is a need for environmentally friendly technologies to meet this demand. Electrochemical energy systems are hinged on clean and sustainable technologies. The latest trend in electrochemical energy systems is the supercapacitors (SCs). SCs are famous for their attractive properties: power density, charging time, life cycle, operational safety, and simplicity. However, their energy density is generally low and to a great extent, this parameter is invariably dependent on the nature of electrode material used. While high energy density is being sought for in SCs, it is necessary to keep abreast of recent electrode materials and their practical performances. This paper gives a concise description of capacitors with a focus on the non-Faradaic SCs. It also compendiously presents an overview of carbon electrode materials with their practical performances (specific surface area, specific capacitance, energy and power densities) for non-Faradaic SCs, with reference to more than 100 reputable works. Development and investigation of highly active carbon materials with optimized electrolytic compatibilities and manipulative morphologies and pore structures were recommended.
