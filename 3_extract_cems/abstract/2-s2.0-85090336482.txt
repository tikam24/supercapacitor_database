In the present manuscript, nanostructured films of polyaniline (PAni), Manganese oxide (MnO2), and hybrid PAni-MnO2 have been prepared by using electrodeposition technique and conceived as electrode materials in energy storage applications. Furthermore, these films have been characterized for their structural and morphological studies with the help of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy measurements respectively. Electro-chemical measurements analysis reveals that the PAni- MnO2 hybrid electrode have been an excellent candidates in the field of supercapacitors; as its specific capacitance measured is noticeably higher (396.89 F/g) than the PAni (125.52 F/g) and MnO2 (100.59 F/g) electrodes.
