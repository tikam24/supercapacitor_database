We developed α-MnO2-sensitized SrCO3−Sr(OH)2 supported on amine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (denoted as MSSG) to understand the energy storage and the electrocatalytic properties. Three different nanocomposites with the tuned Mn precursors such as 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mmol, were prepared and denoted as MSSG-1, MSSG-2 and MSSG-3, respectively and loaded on the electrode's surface. Among the nanocomposites loaded electrodes, MSSG-1 loaded electrodes exhibit a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 792 F/g at 3.5 A/g current density and is morphologically stable even after 5000 cycles with a retention level of 95.9 %. With this outcome, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (AASC) device is mechanized effectively to power the light emitting diodes (LEDs) for 62 s continuously. In addition, the prepared electrode materials were examined for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for enhanced electrocatalytic performance with low overpotential (346 mV at 10 mA cm−2 current density) and Tafel slope (97 mV Dec−1). In addition, the long-term durability study represents a stable performance of the loaded electrode lasting up to 72 h. Notably, the mesoporous nanostructures at the electrode surface offer an effective synergistic effect between SrCO3−Sr(OH)2 supported on NH2-functionalized rGO nanosheets (SSG) and α-MnO2.
