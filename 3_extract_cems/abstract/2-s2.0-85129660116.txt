Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanobelts were synthesized from powder type V2O5 in an environmentally friendly method with high efficiency which is suitable for large-scale production. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized products were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and Nyquist plots. The symmetric solid-state supercapacitor devices have been assembled with V2O5-1MNa nanobelts as both electrodes. Benefiting from the 1D structure, V2O5 nanobelts interweaved electrodes can be assembled into supercapacitors without binder materials. V2O5-1MNa nanobelts-based symmetric supercapacitors have a window potential of 2.5 V and an energy density of 13.9 Wh kg−1 when the power density is 1250 W kg−1.
