This paper presents the synthesis, characterization, and fabrication of a prototype supercapacitor employing lead oxide nanoparticles (Pb3O4 Nps) dispersed reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite as electrode material. Novel minium Pb3O4 Nps and the rGO platelets are synthesized using the precipitation method and modified microwave treatment. The various weight percentages of Pb3O4 Nps (1 wt%, 3 wt%, & 5 wt%) are blended with rGO using ultrasonication process followed by stirring process. The prepared nanomaterials are characterized to predict diffraction patterns, molecular vibrations, surface morphology, and elemental composition of Pb3O4 Nps, rGO, and Pb3O4-rGO nanocomposites. The Pb3O4-rGO nanocomposites are coated on the brass substrate and the charge storing characteristics of the electrode systems are evaluated using an electrochemical workstation which displays a remarkable specific capacitance value of 377F/g for Pb3O4-rGO nanocomposite prepared using 3 wt% Pb3O4 Nps coated electrode system at the scan rate of 5 mV/s and displays high retention stability of 95% after 2500 cycles. A prototype is fabricated in a pilot-scale study, where its charge-discharge behavior is demonstrated using a 9 V battery. After charging, a green light-emitting diode is activated for around 11 min while connecting 7 devices in series.
