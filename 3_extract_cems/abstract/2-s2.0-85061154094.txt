Energy harvesting represents an important option for supplying modern Internet of Things devices. Usually, a large part of the harvested electric energy must be stored for later use so rechargeable batteries or supercapacitors play an important role in the energy harvesting system and their performance has a great impact on system performance. Analyzing the parameters of these storage devices is the motivation of the presented work - an embedded module that monitors and logs currents and voltages during charging and discharging of supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries. The same module can trace the I-V curve for a solar cell in order to find its maximum power transfer point. The module is based on a high performance microcontroller with integrated communication capabilities and stores the measured data in a flash memory that can be read over the serial interface. The paper presents aspects of designing and implementation as well as different tests performed on several solar cells, NiMH and LiIon rechargeable batteries.
