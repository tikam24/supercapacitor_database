A polyaniline modified carbon electrode (PANI/C) has a very large specific capacitance because it can make use of not only the double-layer capacitance of active carbon but also the large specific capacitance of polyaniline. The capacitance performance of PANI/C is discussed. Polyaniline is fabricated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) on surface of carbon electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrometry(EIS) were used to measure the performance of PANI/C electrode. The experiment results demonstrated that in 1 mol·l-1 H2SO4 solution, the specific capacitance of the PANI/C electrode can be elevated from 82 F·g-1 and the value of the carbon electrode to 175 F·g-1. PANI/C-C supercapacitor is manufactured and its capacitance amount to 30.7 F, but the capacitance values decay in the charge-discharge cycle. The PANI/C electrode is attempted to apply as negative electrode, the electrochemical potential window can be expand from 0.6 V to 1 V.
