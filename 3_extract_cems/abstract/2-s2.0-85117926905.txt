Fe2O3-based cathode materials show high theoretical specific capacitance and a wide potential range, but it is limited development due to poor electrical conductivity, undesired rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. Herein, we introduce the interconnected NiS/Co3S4 nanosheets grown on Fe2O3 substrate (Fe2O3@NiS/Co3S4) through a facile in situ solution vulcanization process. Because of the synergistic effect between the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and NiCo-S nanosheets and its unique three-dimensional open structure providing abundant channels and active sites, it is deeply investigated the electrochemical performances as positive material of supercapacitors. Meanwhile, the electrode material exhibits specific capacity of 1213.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, about 64.7% capacity retention at 10 A g−1 and steady cycling performance about 85.2% retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled based on Fe2O3@NiS/Co3S4 and active carbon as the positive and negative electrodes. The energy density is 43.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 810 W kg−1. At the same time, 92.4 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1 was obtained.
