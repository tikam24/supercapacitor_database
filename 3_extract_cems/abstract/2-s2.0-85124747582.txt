In order to further improve the energy-saving and voltage stabilizing effect of the stationary energy storage system (ESS), this article tries to adopt the battery-supercapacitor (SC) hybrid ESS (HESS) as stationary ESS. The advantages of stationary HESS are verified by an example. An adaptive energy management framework for stationary HESS is proposed. A power distribution strategy is proposed to solve the adaptability of two energy storage media to the load variation of rail transportation power system, and to a certain extent, the battery degradation is delayed. The proposed strategy can not only realize the reasonable power-sharing between battery and SC considering the influence of headway on regenerative braking energy but also can keep the battery's charge and discharge capacity for a long time by using fuzzy logic control (FLC). A simulation is carried out to illustrate the advantages of the proposed energy management strategy (PEMS). Finally, the PEMS is compared with two conventional strategies by the hardware-in-the-loop experiment platform, where it is shown to provide better performance (inferred through increases of 1.1% and 5.7% in energy conservation rate, 0.82% and 6.4% in voltage stabilization rate, and reduction of 2.26 and 0.36 A in the root-mean-square value of battery current at different headway).
