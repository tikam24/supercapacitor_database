In this study, it is aimed to obtain Zn doped Mn3O4 (manganese oxide) nanostructured thin films on the soda lime glass substrates by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction technique. The tetragonal crystal structure of the all thin films was detected using XRD spectroscopy. The average crystallite size of undoped Mn3O4 thin films was calculated to be 29 nm and for Zn-doped thin films, this value decreased to 23 nm with increasing Zn concentration. Characteristic peaks for thin films were also confirmed by RAMAN spectroscopy. The morphological structures of zinc-doped manganese oxide nano-sheets thin films were revealed by SEM. Using UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy, it was found that the optical band gap of Mn3O4 thin films decreased from 2.05 to 1.73 eV with Zn doping. It has also been understood from the wettability analyzes of thin films that all thin films have a hydrophilic character. From all these analyzes, it is thought that the Zn doped Mn3O4 thin films have the potential to be used in supercapacitor applications.
