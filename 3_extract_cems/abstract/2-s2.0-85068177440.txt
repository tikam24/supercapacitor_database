The rGO/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a simple facile route through a one-pot hydrothermal approach. Graphite powder was oxidized to obtain graphite oxide (GO) using modified Hummers method. The saturation magnetization at 10 kOe, retentivity, and coercivity magnetism values measured by vibrating sample magnetometry technique are 40.75 emu g−1, 11.02 emu g−1, and 370.69 Oe for CoFe2O4 NPs and 32.41 emu g−1, 0.87 emu g−1, and 70.71 Oe for rGO/CoFe2O4 nanocomposites, respectively. The CoFe2O4, rGO, and rGO/CoFe2O4 electrodes exhibit the specific capacitances values of 65.5, 35.5, and 112.9 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 54.5, 24.2, and 100.4 F g−1 at a current density of 5.0 A g−1, respectively. Clearly, the results assured that the capacitive behavior of the nanocomposite electrode materials can be improved by the decoration of CoFe2O4 NPs onto rGO nanosheets for supercapacitor applications.
