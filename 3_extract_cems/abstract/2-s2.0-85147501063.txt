Herein, we report the effect of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) poly(4-styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) composite-treated cotton on the transparency and conductivity of pure cotton that has been systematically studied using a four-probe stack made of copper (Cu). The surface resistance of the composite cotton was noted at 0.08 Î©/cm which it maintained even after 3 months. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed a good dispersion of SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS over the cotton fibers. Surface morphology was investigated by field emisison scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and the elemental verification through energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX). The structural and bond formation study was performed using Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The AC/SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/AC-based symmetric supercapacitor cotton achieved a specific capacitance of 212.16 F/g at 50 mv/s. Thermal properties were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The low surface resistance and thermal stability showed that cotton fabric can be a promising candidate for smart wearable textiles and supercapacitor applications.
