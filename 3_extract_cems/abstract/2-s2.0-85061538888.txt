Because of the rapid development of wearable electronic devices, energy storage devices with thin, lightweight and flexible have attracted much attention. Hybrid materials consisting of bimetallic phosphides nanoneedle arrays supporting on carbon cloth are successfully synthesized by a single-mode microwave and thermal annealing treatment followed by a low temperature phosphorization. For evaluating as electrode materials of supercapacitor, electrochemical performances of all samples are manipulated by a three-electrode system in 1 mol KOH solution. The results indicate that appropriate amount of Ni substitution could improve the electrochemical performance of NixCo1-xPy nanoneedle arrays as electrode of supercapacitor. Cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge/discharge curve, specific capacitance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy display that NiCo2Py nanoneedle arrays as electrode materials of supercapacitor exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. A symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor is assembled via using NiCo2Py nanoneedle arrays supported on carbon cloth as electrodes. The as-assembled symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors exhibit an excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 236.2 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Good cycling stability of NiCo2Py has been demonstrated and 87.13% of the initial capacitance can be remained after 15000 cycles under a scan rate 3 V/s. This result indicates that NiCo2Py nanoneedle arrays/Carbon cloth hybrids are a good potential candidate as electrode materials for all-solid-state supercapacitor.
