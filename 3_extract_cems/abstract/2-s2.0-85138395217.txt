In the last two decades, the notion of multifunctional composites has sparked a lot of studies. Creating fully multifunctional components that can carry out structural and non-structural functioning in composites will be a huge step forward. The emergence of "textile structural power composites" has resulted from creating rigid, robust, and lightweight continuous fibre structural composites and energy storage capabilities. The capacity to deliver various functionalities resulted in a reduction in the volume/mass of the overall system and enabled them to be used in a variety of sectors, including portable electronic devices, electric automobiles, aeronautical vehicles, drones, and civil constructions, etc. This paper highlights recent developments in textile-reinforced structural power composites, their structure, mechanical properties, and an energy-storing mechanism. This review emphasizes developments in constituting materials for structural supercapacitor composites, electrodes, separators, and solid polymer electrolytes, methods to characterize, fabricate, and evaluate textile structural supercapacitor compositeâ€™s multifunctional performance, its potential applications and existing challenges. Prospects in terms of new structural design are also reported. The textile structural supercapacitor composites are anticipated to play a revolutionary role in various technical engineering applications in the future.
