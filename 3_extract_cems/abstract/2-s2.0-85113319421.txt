Vehicle charging is one of the most discussed topics in the automotive field. Among different technologies, wireless charging systems are becoming a burning issue because of their potentialities related to the advantages introduced in terms of safety and facilities for the final user. In this paper, a focus on the Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) systems is made. In particular, a fuel cell (FC) based one is presented with the aim of supercapacitors (SCs) charging for green transportation applications.
