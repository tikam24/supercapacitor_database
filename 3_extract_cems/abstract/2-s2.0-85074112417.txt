In this paper, Hybrid Energy Storage-based Fast Charging Station, integrated with small scale nuclear power plant (MMR), is offered to charge the electric vehicles. This paper addresses the Micro Modular Reactor (MMR) which is used here as a nuclear power source. Due to small size, affordability, security, reliability, and innovativeness, the MMR is getting more attraction in recent time. In the proposed model, two different energy storage systems, battery and flywheel/supercapacitor, are connected back-to-back to reduce the Electric Vehicle (EV) battery charging time. This paper also evaluates the battery fast charging strategy, estimates the EV charging time, and provides suggestions of the technical requirement for the proposed system.
