Nowadays, lightweight, flexible, and wearable sustainable electric-power sources have attracted increasing attention due to the rapid development of portable electronics. Graphene fiber fabrics, as newly discovered carbon textiles, have exhibited attractive properties for wearable power devices. How to realize scalable construction of non-woven graphene-based fabric electrodes with high areal capacitance is challenging for portable electronics. Here, a novel coagulation bath fabrication technique was firstly reported to prepare reduced graphene oxide fiber fabrics (rGOFFs) for areal-energy-dense supercapacitors. The as-prepared rGOFFs showed high flexibility and conductivity. The symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) assembled with rGOFFs (95 μm) based fabric electrodes performed a high specific gravimetric capacitance (Cm) of 285 F/g at 0.1 A/g and 220 F/g at 1 A/g. The areal capacitance (Ca) of rGOFFs (220 μm) based electrode reached up to 2812 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2. After electrochemical deposition of polyaniline (PANI) on rGOFFs (220 μm) substrate, the Ca of rGOFF@PANI – 220 μm based electrode was intensified to 3828 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 (172 F/cm3). The symmetric all-solid-state SCs showed an energy density from 28 μWh/cm2 (254 μW/cm2) to 11 μWh/cm2 (4950 μW/cm2). Overall, the as-designed rGOFFs based fabric electrodes and their fabrication techniques are of great potential for the next-generation multi-functional textile electronics.
