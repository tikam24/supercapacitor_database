With continuous development of electronics, the requirements for power supply systems are increasing. Supercapacitors (SCs), which have high energy density and excellent power output performance, are ideal power supplies for new generation of miniaturized, intelligent and wearable electronic devices. Thus, developing SCs with fast charge-discharge speed and high stability is a key research topic in the field of energy storage. As the most important part of SCs, electrode materials are critical to its performance. Due to the excellent performances of high-ordered pore structure, large specific surface area, diverse morphologies and dimensions, and adjustable conductivity, conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials have shown great potential as promising SCs electrode materials, and have attracted wide attention. This review introduces the structure, conductive mechanism and preparation methods of conductive MOFs following a short introduction of SCs, describes its design strategy as SCs electrode materials, reviews the research progress of conductive MOFs in the field of SCs, and prospects its future application.
