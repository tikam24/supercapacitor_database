A Co-Ni oxide/vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) composite was prepared by thermal decomposition of cobalt-nickel nitrate precursor on the surface of VACNT electrode. VACNTs were used as 3D nanoporous substrate and were grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition from a mixture of H2 and C2H2. The specific capacitance of Co-Ni oxide (5:5)/VACNT (with equal Co+2/Ni+2 mole ratio) was measured to be 1050 Fg-1, which is about 1.9- and 3-fold that of Ni oxide/VACNT (540 Fg-1) and Co oxide/VACNT (341 Fg-1), respectively. The results show Co-Ni oxide (5:5)/VACNT composite electrode has excellent specific capacitance because of porous network structure, good electrical conduction pathways, high access for the electrolyte solution, and consequently increased composite/solution interfacial contact area. The capacitance property of the Co-Ni oxide/VACNT composite electrode with different Co+2/Ni+2 mole ratios was also investigated and the highest specific capacitance is achieved at equal Co+2/Ni+2 mole ratio.
