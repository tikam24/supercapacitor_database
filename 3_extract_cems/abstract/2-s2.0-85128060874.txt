The distributed finite-time secondary control for the DC microgrid is introduced in this paper. When the microgrid's operating state changes, the finite-time secondary controller can accelerate the DGs' output voltage and current convergence speed and improve the system's rapidity. Virtual capacitors are added to distributed secondary control to increase the DC microgrid's inertia. The simulation example verifies that the finite-time secondary controller can effectively improve the response speed of the microgrid and proves that virtual capacitors can effectively enhance the anti-interference ability of the microgrid.
