A hybrid energy storage system specifically designed for a fully electric aircraft is presented in the paper. The analysis of the time evolution of the power demand of the electric propulsion system during a test mission of Maxwell X-57, an all-electric aircraft developed by NASA, has pointed out the presence of significant peak power during take-off and air tack. Considered the issues related to weight and the volume of the energy storage systems (ESSs) in all-electric aircraft, a hybridization of aircraft ESS with a Supercapacitors (SCs) bank, devoted to smooth peak power demand, has been investigated. A comparison between the simulation results of an electrochemical battery and hybrid ESSs, designed on the test mission of Maxwell X-57 power demand, has been developed. The advantage of hybrid configuration with respect to battery-based one in term of volume and weight reduction is finally presented.
