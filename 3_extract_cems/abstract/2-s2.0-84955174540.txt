Porous hierarchical architectures of few-layer MoS2 nanosheets dispersed in carbon matrix are prepared by a microwave-hydrothermal method followed by annealing treatment via using glucose as C source and structure-directing agent and (NH4)2MoS4 as both Mo and S sources. It is found that the morphology and size of the secondary building units (SBUs), the size and layer number of MoS2 nanosheets as well as the distribution of MoS2 nanosheets in carbon matrix, can be effectively controlled by simply adjusting the molar ratio of (NH4)2MoS4 to glucose, leading to the materials with a low charge-transfer resistance, many electrochemical active sites and a robust structure for an outstanding energy storage performance including a high specific capacitance (589 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), a good rate capability (364 F g-1 at 20 A g-1), and an excellent cycling stability (retention 104% after 2000 cycles) for application in supercapacitors. The exceptional rate capability endows the electrode with a high energy density of 72.7 Wh kg-1 and a high power density of 12.0 kW kg-1 simultaneously. This work presents a facile and scalable approach for synthesizing novel heterostructures of MoS2-based electrode materials with an enhanced rate capability and cyclability for potential application in supercapacitor. Porous materials witha hierarchical architecture are created, in which the secondary building units are only tens of nanometers and the few-layer MoS2 nanosheets are uniformly distributed in C matrix. These materials have a low charge-transfer resistance, many electrochemical active sites, and a robust structure for an outstanding energy storage performance.
