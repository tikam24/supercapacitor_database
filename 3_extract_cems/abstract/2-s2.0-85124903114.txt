The need for green energy and minimization of emissions has pushed automakers to cleaner transportation means. Electric vehicles market share is increasing annually at a high rate and is expected to grow even more. This paper aims to review the energy management systems and strategies introduced at literature including all the different approaches followed to minimize cost, weight and energy used but also maximize range and reliability. Current requirements needed for electric vehicles to be adopted are described with a brief report at hybrid energy storage. Even though various strategies and controlling modules are simplified, there is still option for improvement due to the complexity and quantity of calculated values. Driver behavior, traffic, storage characteristics and power splitting must be taken into consideration to prevent battery aging, oversizing and power losses. Hence battery lifetime will be extended and efficiency can be maximized.
