MXenes are a new family of layered 2D materials with potential over various niche applications. This chapter focuses on the synthesis and characterization methodologies for the MAX phases and MXenes. Different phases (211,312,413) and their structures were explained in detail. A detailed discussion is carried out on the behavior of the material such as metal or semiconductor, the role of surface functionalization (O, OH, F) on MXene surface and their influence on the material properties, the role of defects, advantageous, or disadvantageous, and their electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode.
