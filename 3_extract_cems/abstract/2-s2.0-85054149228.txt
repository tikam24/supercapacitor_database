The hybrid nanocomposite based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/Ag nanoparticle/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was prepared by hydrazine hydrate. The nanocomposite materials have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersion X-ray analysis (SEM-EDX), and Fourier transform infrared-Attenuated transmission reflectance (FTIR-ATR). Electrochemical performance of the electrodes is studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution. We demonstrate a facile and efficient to prepare rGO/Ag/PEDOT nanocomposite for supercapacitor electrode applications. Compared with the PEDOT (Csp= 65.56 F/g at 4 mV/s) the areal capacitance of rGO/Ag/PEDOT nanocomposite (Csp= 612.69 F/g at 4 mV/s) is enhanced with nearly 9.34 times in 1 M H2SO4 solution. In composite electrode, Ag nanoparticles and rGO act as the electrode active materials in chemical polymerization process. In addition, the rGO/Ag/PEDOT nanocomposite showed excellent cycling stability, retaining 101.8% of the initial capacitance with the continuous charge/discharge processes for 1000 cycles.
