A novel reduced graphene oxide/NiO nanosheet composite (r-GO/NiO) (ca. 75 % NiO in weight) was synthesized by a facile two-step method, where the NiO nanosheets were decorated with some voids. The composite was characterized by using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of the composite were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge, and discharge measurements. The results show that the r-GO/NiO composite exhibits a stable average specific capacitance of ca. 1,139 F g-1 (at 0.5 A g-1) during 1,000 charge-discharge cycles, suggesting that the r-GO/NiO composite is a potential supercapacitor material. The main correlation between the electrochemical performance and the structure of the materials was studied, and the formation process of the composite was also discussed.
