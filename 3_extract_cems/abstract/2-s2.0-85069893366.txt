Ru complexes were successfully produced, and their structural properties were investigated using FTIR, Raman, and single crystal XRD patterns. The HOMO, LUMO, Eg, and electronic surface potential (ESP) values of the molecules were calculated by a Gaussian program. The complexes were used for producing hybrid capacitor cells as electrode materials. According to electrochemical analysis, complex 2 showed the best CV graph between âˆ’1 V and +1 V and had the highest current value and hysteresis area when compared with the other complexes. The performance analysis and the capacity fade of the cells were investigated. The first capacity values of the complexes were 57.5, 22.1, 16.9, and 0.0021 F/g for complexes 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The capacitive mechanism of the cells as relates to molecular interactions was also investigated. We suggested that the ESP values of the molecules were directly related to the capacitive performance of the cells. In addition to this, the best cycling performance was obtained for complex 2, which has the lowest Eg value among the complexes. We speculate that the charged regions on the complex materials have a crucial role in the increasing the capacitance of the cells.
