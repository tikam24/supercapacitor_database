Vanadium nitride (VN) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs) with high theoretical capacitance value, but their capacitance at high current densities requires further improvement for practical applications. In contrast, titanium nitride (TiN) exhibits higher electronic conductivity with low capacitance. Herein, a TiVN composite is constructed through a facile solvethermal method issuing nitridation by carbon nitride (C3N4). The TiVN composite with hierarchical mesoporous hollow spheres combines the higher capacitance of VN and higher electronic conductivity of TiN, which exhibits high specific capacitance of 729 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and cycling stability of 85.9% after 300 cycles.
