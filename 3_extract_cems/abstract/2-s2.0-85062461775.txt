Materials with a porous structure and high surface area have gained tremendous research interests in the design of advanced high energy density supercapacitors because of their great capacitance and chemical stability. Herein, an effective method is introduced to achieve a large-scale production of porous graphene network by laser irradiation of graphene oxide films with a short span of time. Interestingly, this method introduces a porous structure, high surface area and promising electrochemical properties which significantly enhances the reversible capacitance behaviour. Notably, laser irradiated graphene oxide films electrodes show excellent areal capacitance of 149.7 mF cm −2 at 3 mV s −1 with a maximum energy density of 7.5 mWhcm −3 . Also, these electrodes demonstrate an outstanding cycling stability, which retains above 85% capacitance of its initial capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles shows a significant enhancement over other values reported in the literature. Furthermore, the bending tests confirms that the superior flexible performance of the laser irradiated graphene oxide electrodes holds a great potential for the development of wearable electronic devices.
