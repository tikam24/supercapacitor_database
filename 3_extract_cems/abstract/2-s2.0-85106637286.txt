Hierarchically porous carbons have shown great potential in the fields of electrochemical energy storage. The template strategy coupled with activation technique is considered as one of the most effective ways to produce hierarchically porous carbon. However, this method uses strong acids and strong bases, causing pollution to the environment. Therefore, it is urgent to develop an acid-free and base-free technique to prepare hierarchically porous carbons. Herein, nitrogen doped hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (NHCNs) are synthesized from cal tar pitch by using the mixture salt of NaCl and Na2CO3 as template coupled with K2CO3 activation. The templates and activators can be removed by water washing without the use of strong acids and bases, and this work provides an acid-free and base-free technique for synthesizing hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets. The as-made NHCNs possess high specific surface area (1597 m2â€¢g-1), abundant micro-/mesopores together with a moderate content of O, N heteroatom. These unique structures give NHCNs electrodes excellent supercapacitor performance. In the KOH electrolyte, NHCNs electrodes show high specific capacitance and good cycle stability.
