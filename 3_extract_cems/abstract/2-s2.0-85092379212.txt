The depletion of fossil fuels, environmental pollution and the discontinuity and instability of clean energy output are the main problems in the current social electricity development demand. In various electrochemical energy storage technologies, supercapacitors have been widely studied because of their fast charge/discharge rate, long service life and high power density. Among the many factors that affect supercapacitors, electrode materials play a decisive role in overall performance. This paper summarizes the energy storage mechanism of various electrode materials for supercapacitors, such as carbonbased material, metal oxide, metal hydroxide and metal sulfide, as well as the research progress of their electrode materials. Finally, the paper looks into the distance of the challenges and future development direction of electrode material research.
