In this paper, the hybrid electric vehicle is equipped with fuel cell/battery/supercapacitor as the research object, the optimal energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed by combining wavelet transform (WT) method and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) for reducing hydrogen consumption and prolonging the lifespan of power sources. Firstly, the WT method is employed to separate power demand of vehicles into high-frequency part supplied by supercapacitor and low-frequency part allocated to fuel cell and battery, which can effectively reduce the fluctuation of fuel cell and battery to prolong their lifespan. Then, considering the low-frequency power, the optimal SOC of battery is used to design the equivalent factor of the ECMS method to improve the fuel economy. The proposed hierarchical EMS can realize a trade-off between the lifespan of power sources and fuel economy of vehicles. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EMS is verified by ADVISOR, and comparison results are given compared with the traditional ECMS method and ECMS combining the filter.
