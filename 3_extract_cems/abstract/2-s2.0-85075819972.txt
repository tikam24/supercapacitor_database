Binary transition metal sulfides would have better electrochemical performance in supercapacitor, which can attribute to the synergistic effect, sufficient redox reaction and diversified nanostructure than single sulfides. In this work, new type clusters of sheet-like nickel sulfide and copper sulfide (Ni3S4/CuS) nanohybrids electrode was transformed from its hydroxide precursor through a facile chemical interface method, followed by an anion-exchange reaction. The Ni3S4/CuS composite electrode delivers much higher capacity of 970 ​C ​g-1 than its hydroxide precursor and those of the pristine Ni3S4 (559 ​C ​g-1) and CuS (148 ​C ​g-1), displays a good rate capability and cycling stability. When assembled an asymmetric capacitor, Ni3S4/CuS//AC (active carbon) presents high voltages up to 1.7 ​V and exhibits top energy density of 18.4 ​Wh Kg-1 even at high power density of 8500 ​W ​Kg-1. Such novel hybrids electrode and its synthesis method may provide a viable solution for energy storage materials issues.
