In this paper, we present a simple, effective, and novel way for fabricating the cathode of N doping Mo3C2/Mo2C nanohybrids using a simple stirring and calcination procedure. The ion exchange mechanism has also resulted in the formation of the nanocrystalline kind of nanohybrids shape. Using the KOH activation technique, the anode activated carbon (AC) was made from onion peel. The electrochemical performances of [MPIMI] (1-methyl-3-n-propyl imidazolium iodide), an ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte, were examined in two and three-electrode configurations. After 10,000 cycles in lL, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of N-Mo3C2/Mo2C//AC showed good electrochemical stability with 86% of the initial capacitances retained. The ASC achieved an excellent rate performance at 0.5 Ag−1 for 246 Fg−1 and 5 Ag−1 for 154 Fg−1, respectively. The ASC device N-Mo3C2/Mo2C//AC based on the nanohybrids has a maximum energy density of 128 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 33.8 kW kg−1. All of these outstanding results demonstrate that the nanohybrids have a nanocrystalline structure and enormous potential for future enhanced nanohybrids-based supercapacitors using a variety of ionic liquid electrolytes.
