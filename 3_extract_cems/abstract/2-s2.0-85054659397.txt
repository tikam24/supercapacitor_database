Fabrication and design of core/shell heterostructures electrodes are considered as a promising strategy to enhance the electrochemical property of the supercapacitors. In this study, we demonstrate the synthesis of the hierarchical hybrid FeCo2O4@polypyrrole core/shell nanowires via a chemical liquid process. As anode for a flexible supercapacitor, the FeCo2O4@polypyrrole core/shell nanowires display a specific capacitance of 2269 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The specific capacitance retains 79.2% at 20 A g-1. Additionally, a flexible ASC was fabricated via combining an FeCo2O4@polypyrrole anode with an activated carbon cathode, which achieves an encouraging energy density of 68.8 Wh kg-1 (0.8 kW kg-1), and long cycle lifespan (91% over 5000 cycles). Moreover, an LED can be lighted efficiently with three devices in series. The FeCo2O4@polypyrrole core/shell nanowires electrode presents considerable potential for electrochemical energy storage.
