This paper reviews the electric double layer capacitor equivalent circuit model, gives an electrical double layer capacitor model in moderate and small power application, and proposes a new parameter identification method. Experiments of an electric double layer super capacitor are performed, and simulation is also performed according to the model parameter that is identified based on the method; Simulation and experimental results show that the model can accurately describe the electric double layer capacitor characteristic in moderate and small application.
