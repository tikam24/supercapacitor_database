Recently, a printable power source that can be implemented on demand in integrated circuitries has gained tremendous attention to facilitate next-generation, form-factor free, miniaturized electronic systems. Among various energy storage units, a solid-state micro-supercapacitor with in-plane device architecture has been recognized as a viable candidate with characteristic advantages of long cycle life-time, high frequency response, and fast charge/discharge rate. However, to date, high performance, all-printed micro-supercapacitors have rarely been reported owing to an absence of printable current collector materials that can sustain high voltage conditions. In this study, a multidimensional printable particle mixture comprising Ni nanoparticles, Ni flakes, and a photoreactive polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone is proposed. The highly conductive, printed metallic current collector is generated with a conductive surface passivation layer in a timescale of 10−3 s by flash-light sintering process. It is revealed that the resulting metallic current collector is stable at a voltage as high as 3 V in the carbon electrode-based device, enabling the fabrication of an all-printed solid-state micro-supercapacitor with an areal energy density of 79–23 mJ cm−2 at an areal power density of 0.4–12.8 mW cm−2. Arbitrarily designed device circuits can be generated on demand simply by using a digitally programmable printing process, without incorporation of additional interconnection lines.
