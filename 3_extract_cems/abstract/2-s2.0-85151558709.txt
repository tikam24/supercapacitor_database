For centuries, optics have been used in various applications like mirrors, lenses, microscopes, and telescopes. The technology has been developed to maneuver photons, which have the potential to replace electronic devices with better speed, lower cost, and more security. The precision and characterization equipment based on electrons and photons required for the fabrication of sophisticated devices have applications in the forensic, medical, scientific, and education fields. The fabrication of optical chips and the processes involved with commercial status is discussed. The status of optical transmission systems and infrastructure being developed based on fibers and wireless depending on losses with applications is stated in the article. The manufacturing processes and hardware fabrication requires simulation, automation, and computational effort to save cost and time. All the devices require energy consumption, which can be sustainably fulfilled through renewable energy, energy storage systems, and good governance. The miniaturized devices require integrated small-size energy storage capabilities like laser fabricated on-chip micro-supercapacitors. The article elaborates on all these aspects of optics required for universal access to energy for humankind.
