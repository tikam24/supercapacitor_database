A simple, scalable approach is developed to fabricate a flexible hybrid paper electrode composed of the polyaniline/graphene and the carbon fiber (CF)-reinforced bacterial cellulose. The prepared hybrid paper presents high areal capacitance of 4.145 F cm −2 at 5 mA cm −2 and an extremely low sheet resistance of 29.7 Ω sq. −1 . The CF endows the paper electrode remarkable foldability with no mechanical destruction. Even after being repeatedly bent 180° up to 1000 times, the initial capacitance can be retained up to 98%. A fabricated all-solid-state supercapacitor based on the resulting paper electrode has an excellent areal capacitance of 630 mF cm −2 and energy density of 2.8 mWh cm −3 . The results confirm that this approach can fabricate the highly foldable and shape-tailorable energy storage devices and may have wide potential applications.
