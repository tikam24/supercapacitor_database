Redox-composited polymers have been chemically fabricated and evaluated for potential use as electrodes within a solid-state supercapacitor. A hydrated perfluorosulfonic acid membrane, Nafion® acts as the supercapacitor solid electrolyte, giving an environmentally 'green' system. Polymer coatings were deposited onto a carbon paper support to form electrodes. When, multiple coats were applied, smooth surfaces were obtained, essential for good contact with the Nafion® membrane. Cyclic voltammetry investigations were carried out in aqueous acid. An evaluation of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs, which are essentially capacitor devices without a casing) was carried out. MEAs were made by hot pressing of the electrodes onto the solid electrolyte membrane in a 'sandwich' configuration. Investigations employed a.c. impedance techniques and d.c. charge-discharge cycling.
