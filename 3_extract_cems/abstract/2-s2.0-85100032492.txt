Renewable energy provides the healthiest options for generating electricity. On the on-grid and off-grid systems can be connected with renewable energy. The main problem in stand-alone off-grid photovoltaic systems is the stability of the power during sudden clouds. A grid system requires storage. Each storage has its positive and negative characteristics. The energy management system acts as a search for a more optimal combination of energy utilization. The main objective is to compare passive filter usage as components in an energy management system between battery and supercapacitor energy storage. The result is that a high-pass filter gives the best results. Undershoot has decreased by 26,464 Watts and overshoot by 10,586 Watts, but the power reserved is reduced by 81,083 Watts due to the large self-discharge effect supercapacitor and increased the steady-state time by 0.0241 seconds.
