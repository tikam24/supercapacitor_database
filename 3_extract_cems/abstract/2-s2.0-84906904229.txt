In this paper, polypyrrole was prepared using the vapor phase polymerization process on membrane filter. The resulting membrane filter is flexible with electrical conductivity of 6.7 S/cm. When used as a binder-free three-dimensional porous electrode for supercapacitor, such membrane filter delivers high specific capacitances of 310 and 130 F/g at current densities of 1 and 5 A/g, respectively, with excellent cycling stability.
