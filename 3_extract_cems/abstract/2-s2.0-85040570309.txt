The preparation of copper oxides/reduce graphene oxide (Cu 2 O-CuO/rGO) nanocomposites via a simple hydrothermal route is reported. The Cu 2 O-CuO/rGO nanocomposites are synthesized through redox reaction between CuCl 2 ·2H 2 O and graphene oxide (GO) without using any reducing agent. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results authenticate the formation of Cu 2 O-CuO/rGO nanocomposites. It is evident from the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images that the Cu 2 O-CuO nanorods are firmly wrapped on the rGO sheets. The electrochemical properties are investigated employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The Cu 2 O-CuO/rGO1 nanocomposites demonstrate highest specific capacitance of 436.6 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and excellent cyclic stability with no variation in the capacitance even after 1000 cycles.
