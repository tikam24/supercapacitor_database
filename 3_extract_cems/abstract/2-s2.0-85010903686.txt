Metal oxides have emerged as one kind of important supercapacitor electrode materials. Herein, we report hierarchical MnO2 nanosheets prepared of indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates via a hybrid two-step protocol, including a cathodic electrodeposition technique and a hydrothermal process. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). SEM and TEM images show that the as-synthesized MnO2 nanosheets are hierarchical and porous, which could increase the active surface and short paths for fast ion diffusion. The results of nitrogen adsorption––desorption analysis indicate that the BET surface area of the MnO2 nanosheets is 53.031 m2 g−1. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the MnO2 are elucidated by cyclic voltammograms (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the as-grown MnO2 nanosheet exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 335 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 when it is applied as a potential electrode material for an electrochemical supercapacitor. Additionally, the MnO2 nanosheet electrode also presents high rate capability and good cycling stability with 91.8% retention after 1000 cycles. These excellent properties indicate that the hierarchical MnO2 nanosheets are a potential electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors.
