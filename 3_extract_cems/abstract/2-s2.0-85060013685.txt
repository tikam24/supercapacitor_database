In this account, a well-aligned hierarchical nickel sulfide@reduced graphene oxide@nickel aluminum layered double hydroxides composite (denoted as Ni 3 S 2 @rGO@NiAl-LDHs) supported on a Ni-foam substrate is successfully designed and constructed via a successive hydrothermal process. Ni 3 S 2 nanorod arrays grown on Ni foam could provide large open space and short ions diffusion path. Graphene with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity can effectively transfer charges; NiAl-LDHs has large contact area with electrolyte, thus enabling a fast and reversible redox process, which could improve the specific capacitance. As a consequence, the Ni 3 S 2 @rGO@NiAl-LDHs fulfills superior specific capacity, pleasurable charge-discharge rate, and outstanding lifespan. Moreover, an advanced asymmetrical device is assembled by employing Ni 3 S 2 @rGO@NiAl-LDHs and rGO@Fe 3 O 4 -C, which delivers high specific capacity (201.3 F g -1 ) and exceptional energy density (71.7 Wh kg -1 ). The well-aligned Ni 3 S 2 @rGO@NiAl-LDHs could provide a promising conception constructing hierarchical structural materials in the area of supercapacitors.
