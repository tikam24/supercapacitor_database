With the objective of development of electrochemical charge storage devices, currently the research in this field is centred on the study of MoO3 nanoparticles doped with copper as an efficient supercapacitor electrode material. The synthesized nanoparticles were examined by powder X-ray diffraction which determined the metastable hexagonal phase of MoO3 and their morphologies were examined using scanning electron microscopy displaying regularly arranged well-defined microrods. The typical vibrational bands of Mo–O were identified from Infra-red and Raman spectral analysis. The ultra violet diffuse reflectance spectra revealed the decrease in optical band gap from 2.96 to 2.78 eV with an increase in Cu concentration. The surface area was recorded to be higher for 5% wt Cu doped nanoparticles (14 m2/g) which was examined from Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) isotherms. Electrochemical behaviour of the nanoparticles was probed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements for which a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) value of 530 Fg−1 was achieved for 5% wt Cu doped MoO3 nanoparticles.
