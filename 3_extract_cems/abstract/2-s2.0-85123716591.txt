Thin film is used for sensing and electronic devices applications. Various techniques are used for thin film deposition. This chapter presents the Spray pyrolysis deposition technique used for the growth of thin films sensing and device material. Spray pyrolysis is an inexpensive method to grow good crystalline thin film compared to other thin film deposition techniques. The chapter gives an overview of the spray process used for thin film deposition. Basic setup for this process is explained. Parameters affecting the deposition process is explained, as are the various spray methods. Finally, some examples of spray pyrolysis in different applications like a gas sensor, UV photodetector, solar cell, photocatalysis, and supercapacitor are discussed.
