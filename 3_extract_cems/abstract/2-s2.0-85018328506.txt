In the current work, the effect of aniline concentration on the polymerization process and supercapacitive behavior of graphene oxide/multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyaniline (GMP) nanocomposites were studied. Based on the obtained results, GMP nanocomposite with 0.5 M aniline (GMP5) was selected as the optimum concentration in terms of high current density and high specific capacitance. Nafion-based ionic polymer-free metal composite (IPFMC) supercapacitor was fabricated for the GMP5 nanocomposite. Solid-state symmetric supercapacitor was made after spraying of GMP5 in. on both sides of Nafion membrane. The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 0.5 M Na2SO4.The specific capacitance of 383.25 F g−1 (326 mF cm−2) and 527.5 F g−1 (42 mF cm−2) was obtained for the GMP5 in solid-state supercapacitor and three-electrode cell at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, respectively. The maximum energy and power densities of 53.64 and 1777.4 W kg−1 were obtained for the IPFMC-based supercapacitor. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
