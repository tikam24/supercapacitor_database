This work provides a new route for high-value-added utilization of hemicellulose extracted from agricultural crops. Hemp stem hemicellulose is chosen as precursor to prepare well-shaped carbon spheres with large surface area of up to 3062m2g-1 by an improved low-temperature hydrothermal carbonization method and KOH activation. A pre-carbonization strategy before activation is also employed to keep activated carbons in perfectly spherical morphology even at a high KOH/carbon ratio 5/1. The influence of KOH/carbon ratio on the structure, surface chemistry and application performance is systematically investigated. Due to abundant micropores and ample oxygen functionalities, the samples can achieve a high capacitance of 318Fg-1 as electrode material in supercapacitors. The plentiful micropores also lead to excellent CO2 and CH4 adsorption capacities at ambient pressure and 0Â°C. Hemicellulose-derived activated carbon spheres should be potentially sustainable materials applied in energy and environmental areas.
