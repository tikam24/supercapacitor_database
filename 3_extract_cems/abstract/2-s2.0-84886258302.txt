In this work, graphene/polyaniline (NGP/PANI) inks are formulated; inkjet printing technology is then used to produce NGP/PANI thin-film electrodes from these inks. With this inkjet printing, good control over a number of key film properties including pattern geometry, pattern location, film thickness, and electrical conductivity is achieved. Two-electrode supercapacitors are fabricated using these thin-film electrodes. Electrochemical measurements with a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte yield a maximum specific capacitance of 82 F g-1, power density of 124 kW kg-1 and energy density of 2.4 Wh kg-1 when a scan rate of 20 mV s -1 is applied. The supercapacitors show a long cycle life over 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
