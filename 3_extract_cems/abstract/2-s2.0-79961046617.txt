A hybrid chemically converted graphene nanosheet/Ni2+/Al 3+ layered double-hydroxide (GNS/LDH) composite for supercapacitor material has been fabricated by a hydrothermal method. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results reveal that Ni 2+/Al3+ LDH platelets homogeneously grew onto the surfaces of the GNSs as spacers to keep the neighboring sheets separate. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The composite exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 781.5 F/g and excellent cycle life with an increase of the specific capacitance of 38.07% after 50 cycle tests. Even after 200 cycle tests, the increase of the capacitance is 22.56% compared with the initial capacitance. Â© 2011 American Chemical Society.
