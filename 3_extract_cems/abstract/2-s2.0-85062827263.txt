Vertically oriented graphene (VG) with three-dimensional architecture has been proved to exhibit unique properties, and its particular morphology has been realized by researchers to be crucial for its performance in practical applications. In this study, we investigated the morphology evolution of VG films synthesized by the plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process, including porous graphene film, graphene wall, and graphene forest. This study reveals that the morphology of VG is controlled by a combination of the deposition and etching effects and tailored by the growth conditions, such as plasma source power and growth time and temperature. The plasma source power relates to the number of branches of VG, and the growth temperature relates to the thickness of each VG flake, whereas the growth time determines the height of VG. Finally, the electrochemical properties of VG films along with morphology evolution are investigated by fabricating as VG-based supercapacitor electrodes.
