This paper addresses the energy management of hybrid vehicles using an economically-oriented model predictive control (EMPC) approach. A control modelling methodology is proposed based on considering the power flows that can be applied to the management of any hybrid vehicle configuration. Then, the proposed EMPC approach is formulated and the control objectives are formulated in terms of a multi-objective cost function. The proposed EMPC is illustrated in a hybrid vehicle that has a PEM fuel cell, a supercapacitor, a battery and a regenerative brake.
