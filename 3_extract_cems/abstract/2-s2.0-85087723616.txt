A flexible zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHS) was constructed using a solid-state cellulose hydrogel electrolyte containing a high concentration of ZnCl2. This biodegradable cellulose hydrogel electrolyte can afford a wide electrochemical potential window and excellent ionic conductivity, resulting in a ZHS with an extremely high capacity of 193 mA h g-1, an energy density of 192 W h kg-1, and a power density of 16?976 W kg-1. The flexible ZHS also shows excellent stability and can work at low temperature of -20 Â°C. This work progresses the field of Zn-based electrochemical energy storage devices and gives a meaningful guide for the design of solid-state electrolytes. This journal is
