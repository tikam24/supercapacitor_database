The composite metal oxide electrode films were fabricated using ex situ electrodeposition method with further heating treatment at 300°C. The obtained composite metal oxide film had a spherical structure with mass loading from 0.13 to 0.21 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>. The structure and elements of the composite was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX). The electrochemical performance of different composite metal oxides was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD). As an active electrode material for a supercapacitor, the Co-Mn composite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 285 Fg<sup>-1</sup> at current density of 1.85 Ag<sup>-1</sup> in 0.5M Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte. The best composite electrode, Co-Mn electrode was then further studied in various electrolytes (i.e., 0.5M KOH and 0.5M KOH/0.04M K<inf>3</inf>Fe(CN)<inf>6</inf> electrolytes). The pseudocapacitive nature of the material of Co-Mn lead to a high specific capacitance of 2.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> Fg<sup>-1</sup> and an energy density of 309 Whkg<sup>-1</sup> in a 0.5MKOH/0.04MK<inf>3</inf>Fe(CN)<inf>6</inf> electrolyte at a current density of 10 Ag<sup>-1</sup>. The specific capacitance retention obtained 67% of its initial value after 750 cycles. The results indicate that the ex situ deposited composite metal oxide nanoparticles have promising potential in future practical applications.
