All-solid-supercapacitor based on chemically synthesized polyaniline (PANI) and sulfonated polymers have been reported. Poly vinyl sulfonic acid (PVSA) is used as a proton conducting solid electrolyte. Fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer grafted with acrylic acid and sulfonated (FEP-g-AA-SO3H) membrane was used as the separator. Composite electrodes were prepared from PANI, PVSA, electronically conducing carbon and poly tetra fluroethylene (PTFE) powder. Electrochemical studies of the supercapacitor were carried out in a unit cell. The unit cell consisted of three layers structure: composite electrode//FEP-g-AA-SO3H//composite electrode. This symmetric configuration of supercapacitor represents type1 (p-p) class, since both the electrodes were made from p-dopable PANI based composite electrodes. Optimization of solid electrolyte in the composite electrode was carried out. Supercapacitor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge cycles. Capacitance of 98 F/g of PANI was obtained. The reduction in the capacitance after 1500 cycles was found to less than 20%. The non-ideal behavior of the supercapacitor was analyzed by impedance analysis. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
