Electrode materials for supercapacitors are extensively studied at present; however, their structural and electrochemcial properties still require further improvement. Hence, a series of polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide binary composites (PANI/RGO, PG-i, i = 1–5) and polyaniline/multi-walled carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide ternary composites (PANI/MWCNT/RGO, PCG-i, i = 1–6) were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The morphology, structure and electrochemical performance of these samples are systematically analyzed and discussed. Analysis shows that all the samples have abundant pore structure. By changing the ratio of components, PCG-5 shows superior comprehensive electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance of 478 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, a considerable capacitance retention (63.56%, from 1 A g−1 to 20 A g−1, and 55.33%, from 1 A g−1 to 50 A g−1) and an extraordinary cycling stability (64% after 3500 cycles, at 2 A g−1) in 1 M H2SO4. The results prove that the PANI/MWCNT/RGO ternary composites have great potential as supercapacitor electrodes.
