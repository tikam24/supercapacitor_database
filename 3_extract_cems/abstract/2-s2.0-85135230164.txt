Although sodium ion capacitors (SICs) are considered as one of the most promising electrochemical energy storage devices (organic electrolyte batteries, aqueous batteries and supercapacitor, etc.) due to the combined merits of battery and capacitor, the slow reaction kinetics and low specific capacity of anode materials are the main challenges. Point defects including vacancies and heteroatoms doping have been widely used to improve the kinetics behavior and capacity of anode materials. However, the interaction between vacancies and heteroatoms doping have been seldomly investigated. In this study, a hybrid point defects (HPD) engineering has been proposed to synthesize TiO2 with both oxygen vacancies (OVs) and P-dopants (TiO2/C-HPD). In comparison with sole OVs or P-doping treatments, the synergistic effects of HPD on its electrical conductivity and sodium storage performance have been clarified through the density functional theory calculation and sodium storage characterization. As expected, the kinetics and electronic conductivity of TiO2/C-HPD3 are significantly improved, resulting in excellent rate performance and outstanding cycle stability. Moreover, the SICs assembled from TiO2/C-HPD3 anode and nitrogen-doped porous carbon cathode show outstanding power/energy density, ultra-long life with good capacity retention. This work provides a novel point defect engineering perspective for the development of high-performance SICs electrode materials. [InlineMediaObject not available: see fulltext.].
