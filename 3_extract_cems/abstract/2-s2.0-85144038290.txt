The supercapacitors that are available today are among the most energy-efficient, have the fastest charging rates, and are environmentally friendly. Temperature has a significant impact on supercapacitor performance for various charging and discharging rates. We use an experimental technique along with an ANSYS simulation in this research to examine performance and safety aspects of super capacitors under various cooling conditions, both free and forced. As a result of the trials, it was found that the Aluminium-Aluminum type of super capacitor performs better than the other conditions. The heat produced is allocated to the Stackable core region when cell voltages are altered from 1.4 V to 2.8 V over time. Force convection cooling methods are used for optimal heat transmission and efficient supercapacitor design. As a result, a transient thermal analysis of a supercapacitor was carried out for various heat transfer coefficient values such as 1,10,20,30, and 50 W/m2.K.When the convective coefficient is less than 35W/m2K, the (induced temperature owing to heat generation) Supercapacitor maximum temperature (111 째 C, 97 째 C, 88 째 C) is higher than the maximum operating temperature (65 째 C).
