We present a zero-waste approach where raw coal from Powder River Basin was depolymerized using environmentally friendly solvents. Sequentially, the depolymerized coal, referred to as coal chars, was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Then, the coal chars/DMF mixture was combined with polymeric precursors (PAN/PVP) to form a homogeneous solution for carbon nanofiber fabrication via electrospinning. By incorporating 20 wt% coal chars to PAN/PVP mixture, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed 1.36% quinone oxygen and 21.2% overall oxygen on the surface of coal-derived carbon nanofibers (CCNF), referred to 20CCNF. Compared to the CNF derived only from PAN/PVP, 20CCNF revealed wider pore size range of 2â€“7 nm and higher surface area (1678.8 m2/g) in the microporous region (<2 nm). Furthermore, 20CCNF showed significantly enhanced conductivity (7.6 S/cm), which may be attributed to the high graphitization degree of coal chars. The combined effects of O2-enriched surface and microstructures resulted in much higher specific capacitance of 20CCNF (299.4 F/g) than the PAN/PVP CNF (157.8 F/g) at a current density of 1 A/g. Additionally, CCNF showed greatly reduced internal and ion diffusion resistances. Finally, 93.0% specific capacitance of 20CCNF remained after 10,000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge, demonstrating that CCNF possessed desirable durability.
