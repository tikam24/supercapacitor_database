Sustainable and effective electrochemical materials for supercapacitors are greatly needed for solving the global problems of energy storage. In this regard, a facile nanocomposite of Pd/NiOPdO was synthesized using foliar phyto eco-friendly agents and examined as an electrochemical electrode active material for supercapacitor application. The nanocomposite showed a mixed phase of a ternary nano metal oxide phase of rhombohedral NiO and tetragonal PdO confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and XPS (X-rays photoelectron spectroscopy). The optical (direct) energy value of the synthesized nanocomposite was 3.14 eV. The phyto-functionalized nanocomposite was studied for electrochemical supercapacitor properties and revealed a specific capacitance of 88 F g−1 and low internal resistance of 0.8 Ω. The nanoscale and phyto organic species functionalized nanocomposite exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties for supercapacitor application.
