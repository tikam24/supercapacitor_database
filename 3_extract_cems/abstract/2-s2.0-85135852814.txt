Herein, we have designed and synthesized a electrode made up of NiFe2O4 nanosheets grown on three-dimensional nickel foam (NiFe2O4/NF) via a facile hydrothermal method. As a pseudocapacitor, the as-prepared NiFe2O4/NF electrode exhibited a relatively high capacitance (975 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1), excellent cycle life (about 95% capacitance retention after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g-1) and good rate capability (74.6% capacitance retention from 1 to 10 A g-1). This work not only shows a simple way to enhance high electrochemical performance, but also demonstrates that the prepared freestanding NiFe2O4/NF electrode could be a potential electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
