Mesoporous hollow carbon spheres have been fabricated from core-shell structured mesoporous silica sphere using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with ethylene as a carbon feedstock. The hollow carbon spheres have exhibited relatively high graphitization degree along with good meso-structural order and high specific surface area of 770m2/g. It was also proved that this material is a great candidate as supercapacitors at high current load. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
