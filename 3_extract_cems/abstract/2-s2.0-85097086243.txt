Besides the inexpensive and simple synthesis, pursuing high-energy density whilst maintaining intrinsic high-power density is a huge challenge for supercapacitors (SCs) application. Herein, in-situ Nitrogen(N)-Oxygen(O)-Sulfur(S) co-doped three-dimensional (3D) porous activated carbon materials (A-LPCs) are successfully prepared from the locust pest via a facile one-step carbonization/activation method. The resultant A-LPCs through self-template method exhibit the perfect combination of micro-, meso-, and macropores, desirable pore distribution, large accessible specific surface area (SSA), high degree of graphitization, tunable N, O, S doping as well as excellent wettability, which are beneficial to charge/ion storage and transfer of electrolyte. These features endow the prepared A-LPCs with a high specific capacitance of 433.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The as-prepared electrode material also displays as high as 79% capacitance retention as the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g−1. Moreover, an extremely stable performance is achieved in the prepared electrode system even after long-term service (about 93.17% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles). Most importantly, the fabricated A-LPCs//A-LPCs symmetric SCs delivers a high coulombic efficiency of 96.18% and the maximum energy density of 23.04 Wh kg−1. These exciting results indicate the A-LPCs derived from locust via self-template shows great potential for high performance SCs applications.
