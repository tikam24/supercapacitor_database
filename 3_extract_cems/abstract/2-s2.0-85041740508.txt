Owing to the advantages of the good conductive AC and high capacitive NiCo2O4, We prepared a series of NiCo2O4/AC composites by a hydrothermal method. The morphology of NiCo2O4/AC composites indicate the NiCo2O4 nanoplates with diameters of about 0.5∼1 μm and thickness of about 20 nm are coated on AC. The electrochemical investigation demonstrate that the specific capacitances of NCO-AC-3 (containing 47 % NiCo2O4) are 273.5 F g−1 and the capacity retention still retains at 96 % (262.6 F g−1) after 3000 cycles at current density of 1 A g−1, especially, the cycling stability maintain more stable at high current density. Therefore, the low-cost NiCo2O4/AC composites can serve as a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors due to the synergistic effect between the electric double-layer capacitance of porous AC and the pseudocapacitance of NiCo2O4 nanoplates.
