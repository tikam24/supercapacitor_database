Biowastes derived carbon based materials are recently gaining attention due to their extraordinary surface and conductive characteristics. Herein, neem leaves derived porous carbon (NAC) with a 3D framework and interconnected pores are synthesized which shows hierarchal pore size distribution along with good conductivity that makes it a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors. However, the surface charge contribution highly affects the electrochemical performance of the electrodes. In addition, a high fraction of surface charge contribution suggests the fast electrochemical kinetics and hence shows the ability of the electrode to work at a high charge-discharge rate. Therefore, the NAC electrode showed a maximum surface contribution of 72% in 6M KOH electrolyte as compared to 1M H2SO4 (21%) and 1M Na2SO4 (20%) electrolyte. Furthermore, the NAC electrode shows a specific capacitance value of 178 F/g using a 6M KOH electrolyte, which is much higher than 93 F/g for 1M H2SO4 and 136.7 F/g for 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte at the constant scan rate of 5 mV/s. Therefore, these results confirm that the study of surface and diffusion charge contribution gives new directions to tune the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes.
