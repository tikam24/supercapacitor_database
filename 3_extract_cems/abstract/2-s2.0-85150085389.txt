Renewable energy sources (RESs) introduce variations in a power grid that limit their integrative capacity in the power grid. The energy storage system (ESS) serves as a pertinent component, as an energy buffer, by compensating for demand-generation mismatch and smoothing the output power variability of RESs by operating as a dispatchable energy source and reducing the impact of RES variation. A meticulous consideration needs to be made for selecting ESSs. The commonly preferred battery ESSs (BESSs) facilitate numerous challenges associated with renewable integration. Nevertheless, due to low power density and slow dynamic response, BESS proves to incur high current stress and limit its application. Consequently, BESS is oversized and requires premature replacement. Therefore, hybridization of BESS with a supercapacitor ESS (SCSS) that facilitates high power density and possesses rapid dynamic response is conferred. Furthermore, the controller should be able to amply allocate low and high-frequency components to BESS and SCSS to substantially respond and compensate for the transient requirement of the system and regulate the DC-bus voltage. This chapter proposes the development of a decoupled controller framework using k- type compensators for BESS and a nonlinear PI controller for SCSS. The proposed controller framework is tested and validated on a solar Photovoltaics-powered microgrid system. Accordingly, an analytical comparison is presented with the benchmark low pass filter power frequency allocation technique to highlight the superiority and the enhanced response achieved with the proposed controller. Besides, the complexity of the proposed controller is comparatively simpler with a lower number of sensing devices that have a negative impact on the BESS-SCSS response over the transient variation intervals.
