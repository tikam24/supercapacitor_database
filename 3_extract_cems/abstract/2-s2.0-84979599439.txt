All-solid-state supercapacitor with the function of displaying energy level is a hot research topic at present. In this research, with Polyaniline (PANI) as the anode, WO3 as the cathode and Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-LiClO4 as the solid electrolyte, an all-solid supercapacitor had successfully obtained with electrochromic function. The results show that the supercapacitor possesses good electrochromic and electrochemical performance, which can thus result in rapid and reversible color changes in different operating voltages (−1 V ∼ 1 V). As for the changing color during the discharge process, it indicates the changes of energy level. Moreover, as indicated by the research mechanism, the supercapacitor provided with the function of color changing has exploited a new path for the development of intelligent all-solid-state supercapacitor in the future.
