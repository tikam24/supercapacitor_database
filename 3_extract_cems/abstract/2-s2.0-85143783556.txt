The integrated device for energy supply and sensing (IDESS) is a potential candidate for relieving the energy and space burdens caused by the rising integration degrees of microsystems. In this article, we propose a force sensor based on an interdigital supercapacitor (IDTSC). The capacitance and internal resistance of the IDTSC change under external loads, resulting in a transient current fluctuation at a constant bias voltage, which can be used to sense external force/acceleration. The IDTSC showed a specific energy and specific power of 4.16 Wh/kg and 22.26 W/kg (at 0.1 A/g), respectively, which could maintain an essential energy supply. According to the simulation analysis, the designed IDTSC’s current response exhibited good linearity with the external force. In addition, benefiting from its light weight and the applied gel electrolytes, the IDTSC showed good high-g impact sensing performance (from 9.9 × 103× g to 3.2 × 104× g). This work demonstrated the feasibility of realizing an integrated energy supply and force-sensing device by empowering energy storage devices with sensing capabilities.
