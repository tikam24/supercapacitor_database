Ordered mesoporous carbon/carbon aerogel (OMC/CA) composites have been obtained by a simple ultrasonic mixing technique. It is found that there exists a synergistic effect between OMC's channel-like mesopores and CA's network-like mesopores during electrochemical charge-discharge process; and the maximum synergistic coefficient arrives at 0.37 when CA content is 30 wt.%. As a result, the as-prepared OMC/CA composites can make full use of the two-dimensional order of mesoporous structure of OMC and the three-dimensional connectivity of mesoporous structure of CA, and thus, exhibit much better electrochemical properties as compared to OMC and CA alone.
