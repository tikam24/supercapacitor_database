A combination of two energy-stored modes, faradaic and electrostatic, has been applied to improve the energy density of supercapacitors with ionic liquid salt mixtures via impregnation of micro- and mesoporous carbon electrodes. An enhancement of capacitance was observed in the supercapacitors containing halide ion treated carbon electrodes, caused by the pseudocapacitive processes related to redox-active halide ions within and near the micro- and mesoporous carbon electrodes. To highlight the contribution of pseudocapacitance, an equivalent circuit model was applied to analyze the impedance spectra in detail. Significant pseudocapacitive behavior was only observed in the supercapacitors with halide ion treated carbon electrodes. A comparable result for both electrical double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance values was obtained based on the direct current electrochemistry measurements as well as impedance fitting results. Meanwhile, according to the resistive behavior associated with the mass-transfer and faradaic processes, halide ion treated systems were more reactive compared with alkali ion treated systems. This article offers a brief and fundamental understanding with a focus on the contribution and distribution of both resistive and capacitive behavior analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy coupled with equivalent circuit modeling.
