With the development of smart grid, energy storage technology will play an increasingly important role in the power system. As an excellent quick energy storage device, supercapacitors have instantaneous power densities more significant than batteries and energy densities larger than dielectric capacitors, and have been widely applied to power quality conditioning equipment, new energy power generation system, etc. However, for the design of supercapacitor based energy storage systems, more insights are needed to analyze the transient response of supercapacitor for many design aspects, such as the design of the voltage balance circuit, the optimization of the energy management scheme, etc. In this paper, a new high frequency simple structure supercapacitor equivalent circuit model is proposed, and a new frequency domain based parameter identification method is described in detail. The experimental and simulation results are presented to verify the analysis. Â©2009 IEEE.
