The polyacrylamide/poly(vinyl alcohol) (PAM-PVA) hydrogels with three-dimensional network structure were synthesized, taking ammonium persulfate (APS) and N-N dimethylbisacrylamide (NMBA) as initiators and crosslinkers, respectively. The gel polymer electrolyte was prepared by immersing the obtained hydrogel in 6 mol/L KOH solution for different duration, and the gel polymer electrolyte was adopted to assemble supercapacitor. The electrochemical performance of the assembled supercapacitor was studied by electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and AC impedance. The stability of the assembled supercapacitor was evaluated by blue electric monitoring system. The results showed that the supercapacitor with the best performance was prepared via the gel polymer electrolyte obtained from the reaction of 2.0 g PVA with 10.0 g acrylamide and further 72 h electrolyte solution absorption. Its specific capacitance can reach 230 F/g and the capacitance retention rate kept 98% after 5 000 cycles.
