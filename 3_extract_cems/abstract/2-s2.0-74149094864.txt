Internal resistance is an importance parameter determining the power performance of a battery or supercapacitor. An 8.5 Ah Li-ion battery and a 350 F supercapacitor were tested as examples to validate the measurement method of dc internal resistance. Voltage data were taken at 10 ms, 2 s and 30 s after the current interruption or pulse. The ac resistances at 1 kHz of the battery and supercapacitor were also measured for comparison with the dc values. Based on these tests, it is proposed that the dc internal resistance of the battery and supercapacitor be obtained from ΔV/ΔI where the ΔV is the voltage change after the current interruption, and ΔI means current change from I to 0. When the voltage change at 10 ms or less is selected, the resistance corresponds to the Ohmic resistance of the device. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
