In this paper, dynamic modeling analysis and a stable control method are presented for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) including the fuel cell (FC), battery (BA), and a supercapacitor (SC). First, based on the dynamical behavior of power sources, a filtered dynamical model of the DC-DC converters is presented. The objective of the suggested scheme is to avoid rapid changes in the dynamic response of power sources. Next, a robust observer-based control method is presented to obtain a stable voltage of the DC-bus and provide proper performance of the energy sources. Finally, a type-2 fuzzy algorithm is proposed for the energy management system (EMS) of the HESS. It can provide reliable situations to compensate for knowledge-based uncertainties of the fuzzy rules. The stability of the proposed method is provided by the Lyapunov approach to ensure the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems under the various levels of uncertainties. To show the performance and efficiency of this work, the proposed strategy is used to control a hybrid tramway including FC, battery, and SC.
