The main challenge hindering the use of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) for electrochemical applications is their high cost and agglomeration. Herein, a trifunctional electrode material based on a two-dimensional cerium-based metal organic framework (2D Ce-MOF) decorated with Pt NPs is constructed. The large specific surface area of the 2D Ce-MOF can effectively prevent the phenomenon of Pt NPs reaction. The strong synergy between Pt NPs and the 2D Ce-MOF not only significantly enhances electron transport efficiency, but also increases the number of electrochemically reaction reactive sites. As a result, the Ce-MOF@Pt presents excellent performance in the HER (Hydrogen Evolution Reaction), OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction) and supercapacitor reactions. The Tafel slopes of OER and HER are 47.9 and 188.1 mV dec-1, respectively. Meanwhile, Ce-MOF@Pt-0.05 shows a specific capacity of 1894F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and remains at 111.5% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. In general, this study highlights the importance of Pt NPs in promoting the electrochemical performance of MOFs and reveals a new way to reduce electrocatalyst prices.
