We created a simple electrodeposition method of preparing Ni3S2 nanosheets deposited on 3D hemp-activated carbon supported by a Ni foam. We selected three optimized deposition cycles because of high capacitances of 3D hemp-activated carbon/Ni3S2 electrodes (2,797.43 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) in a 6 M KOH solution. Meanwhile, the capacitances' retention rate is 82.13%, indicating an excellent cyclic stability. To evaluate the further performance of 3D hemp-activated carbon/Ni3S2 electrodes materials in a full cell, the self-assembled all-solid-state supercapacitors device 3D hemp-activated carbon//3D hemp-activated carbon-Ni3S2 have the energy density of 55.32 Wh kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and a great cycle ability (it retain approximately 83.47% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles).
