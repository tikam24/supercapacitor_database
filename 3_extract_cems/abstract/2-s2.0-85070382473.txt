Ternary metal oxides with unique mesoporous structures grown on nickel foam are considered as attractive candidates for high-performance supercapacitors because of their fast electron-transport access, rich accessibility of electroactive sites to the electrolyte, shortened ion diffusion path and wonderful synergetic effects of different metallic elements. Herein, a novel three-dimensional porous pentahedron structured aluminium manganese cobalt oxide (AMCO) synthesized via a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method followed by a short post-annealing process has been reported. A high specific capacity of 923.1 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 as well as good cycling stability and 100% coulombic efficiency after 8000 cycles can be achieved when used as a supercapacitor electrode. In addition, the as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor based on the as-prepared AMCO positive electrode and an activated carbon negative electrode exhibits a high energy density of 88.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 799 W kg-1, indicating its great promise for constructing high-performance energy storage devices.
