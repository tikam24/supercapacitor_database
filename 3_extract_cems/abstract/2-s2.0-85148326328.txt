With the fast growth of supercapacitors, there are growing demands for more flexible, stable, safer and cost-effective devices. One of the significant challenges is introducing polymers binders in supercapacitors electrodes to improve durable, malleable and eco-friendly devices. A comprehensive review of electrode preparation and physical and electrochemical properties is crucial to understand how various types of binders contribute to the performance of supercapacitor electrodes. This review summarises the application and effect of polymer binders on their performance as supercapacitor electrodes. Polymer binders have an essential role to play in improving supercapacitor electrodes. Notably, binders act as a glue among the current collectors and active materials and can also increase supercapacitorsâ€™ performance and flexibility.
