Due to higher specific power density, longer life time and safer operation, super-capacitors (ultra-capacitors or electric double layer capacitors) are being considered in applications of electric vehicles (EVs). This study deals with design of light electric vehicles or even rail vehicle powered by full or partial pure super-capacitors (SCs). The simulation model of the electric vehicles powered by super-capacitors is proposed for predicting the EV performances of acceleration and travelled distance. The design objectives of a case are presented. Moreover, the development of the super-capacitor pack consisting of body-integrated SC modules is discussed. Simulated results demonstrate that the objective of the designed light EV powered by body-integrated super-capacitor pack is achieved.
