In this work, a novel MnO2/g-C3N4@polypyrrole (PPy) ternary nanocomposite (NC) was fabricated by coupling the MnO2 nanorods with the two-dimensional g-C3N4 sheets and the conductive PPy. The MnO2/g-C3N4@PPy NC electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 274 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, which was 1.88 times than that of the MnO2@PPy NC electrode. The MnO2/g-C3N4@PPy NC electrode also possessed outstanding cyclic stability with 95% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The present strategy for fabricating ternary nanocomposite uses low-cost raw materials and simple preparation method, which provides an alternative route to optimize the SC performance of other pseudocapacitive oxides.
