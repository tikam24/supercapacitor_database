A boost DC/AC converter is popular in AC line-integrated energy storage systems (ESSs) based on low-voltage DC sources such as battery, fuel cell, or supercapacitor. The direct DC/AC power conversion in the boost inverter introduces a second-order harmonic ripple current at the DC side of the boost converter, which leads to internal heating of the energy storage devices and degradation of their lifetime. In this paper, a novel current feedback method is proposed to mitigate the second-order harmonic current component at the DC side. The proposed method is able to significantly reduce the second-order harmonic component in the DC-side current of the boost inverter without increasing other harmonic components. Performance of the proposed method is validated on a single-phase grid-connected DC/AC boost inverter-based battery ESS experimental prototype.
