In this paper, NiO with ordered mesoporous structure was synthesized by replicating template SBA-15 and its electrochemical capacitance characterization was for the first time studied in 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. Electrochemical tests results indicated the ordered mesoporous structure can greatly increase the utilization of NiO, which is attribute to a large effective surface area due to the mesoporous structure. The capacitance of NiO with order mesoporous structure was about 120 F/g, about four times larger than that of NiO prepared by direct calcining Ni(NO3)·6H2O at 550 °C. On the other hand, the mesoporous NiO showed a good rate capability, which is due to that the ordered mesopores did not limit the ion motion within the pores. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
