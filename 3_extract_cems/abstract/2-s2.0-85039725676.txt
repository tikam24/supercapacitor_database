By in-situ oxidative polymerization method, a novel flower-like polyaniline/graphitic carbon nitride (PANI/g-C3N4) nanocomposite was successfully synthesized. In comparison with single PANI, PANI/g-C3N4 displayed enhanced electrochemical performance which had a specific capacitance of 584.3 F g−1 and 81.91% of capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1. This work demonstrated a simple strategy of improving the specific capacitance and cycling stability of polymer electrodes and may be extended to other similar systems.
