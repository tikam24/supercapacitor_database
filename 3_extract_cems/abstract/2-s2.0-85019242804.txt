The power generation from renewable power sources is variable in nature, and may contain unacceptable fluctuations in case of the wind power generation. High fluctuations in power generation may negatively impact the voltage stability of the microgrid. This problem can be alleviated by using hybrid energy storage system consisting of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) at dc grid. A new control scheme is proposed to control the power sharing between batteries and SCs to match the generation-demand mismatch and hence to regulate the grid voltage. In the proposed control strategy, the SC supplies error component of the battery current in addition to the fast transient power demand. This added feature not only improves the dc grid voltage regulation capability but also reduces the stress levels on the battery and hence increases the life span of the battery. The main advantage of the scheme is that, the uncompensated power due to slow dynamics of the battery is diverted to the SC and keeps the state of charge within the limits for longer duration, as compared to the conventional strategy. The proposed scheme is validated through detailed experimental studies.
