The proceedings contain 18 papers. The topics discussed include: characterization of lithium ion batteries with in situ x-ray tomography and radiography; a realistic 3D model of mediator supercapacitors in micrometer level; development of all-solid-state structural supercapacitor using an epoxy based adhesive polymer electrolyte; lithium-ion capacitor based on electrodes constructed via electrostatic spray deposition; forcespinning of microfibers and their applications in lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries; binder-free freestanding flexible Si nanoparticles-multi-walled carbon nanotubes composite anodes for li-ion batteries; performance evaluation of solid oxide electrolysis cells at versa power systems; X-ray tomographic investigation of water distribution in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells with different gas diffusion media; computational simulation of thermal and chemical phenomena for honeycomb-structured catalytic reforming reactor; and ionic conductivity and stability of the lithium aluminum germanium phosphate.
