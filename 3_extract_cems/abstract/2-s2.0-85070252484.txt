The energy shortage and environmental problem due to the production of energy from fossil fuel introduce a new way of generating energy, but due to variant nature renewable energy resources, it is very difficult to maintain the generation load of the power system in equilibrium. To keep the power system in equilibrium, the energy storage is introduced into the power system. Recently supercapacitor (SC) and battery hybrid electrical energy storage (HEES) capture a great attention. Compared with other energy storage technologies the major advantages of SC are the high power density, high cycling life, and high peak current handling capacities. However, SC is also deficient in low energy density. The battery is characterized by large energy density but low in power capacity. Due to high-frequent power fluctuation cause a significant degree of battery power cycling. This, in turn, has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in battery service life. Therefore, the concept of the SC and battery hybrid scheme is proposed to participate in secondary frequency regulation. The simulation is carried out to compare the battery electrical energy storage (BEES) and HEES to verify the efficiency of the proposed modification.
