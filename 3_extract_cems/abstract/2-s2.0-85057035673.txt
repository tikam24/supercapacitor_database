This paper presents a bidirectional converter (BHSI) with a hybrid structure based on a switched inductive cell which helps to achieve a higher conversion ratio. The switched inductive cell has two inductors which are connected in series and in parallel so that an additional current doubling/division is obtained. Bidirectional high ratio converters are useful in supercapacitor (SC) storage applications where the voltage of the SC has a large variation. Mathematical analysis is provided, and performances are compared to other converter topologies. Two experimental prototypes are constructed using Si-MOSFETs and GaN-FETs, and simulation and experimental results are provided in order to show the performances in terms of efficiency and stability of charge/discharge transition.
