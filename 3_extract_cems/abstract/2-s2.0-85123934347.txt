In order to develop greener and more efficient aircrafts, manufactures are wishing to replace conventional aircrafts by More-Electric Aircrafts (MEA). Owing to this, a hike in load demand is noticed during landing stage of aircraft. This can be fulfilled by using fuel cell hybrid power system instead of Ram Air turbine (RAT) or Air Driven Generator (ADG). The load demand can be properly met with the help of efficient energy storage devices. In this paper, the hybrid system is composed of Fuel Cell (FC) (which is the main source of energy), a ultracapacitor and a lithium-ion battery (which are used as secondary sources of energy). However, Energy Storage System (ESS) alone fails to fulfil the desire of active response, life cycle and potential of the system. Therefore, an effective energy management system is necessary for overall optimization of the energy utilization of the hybrid system and proper management of load flow. Keeping this in view, in this paper it is envisaged to design a robust Energy Management Scheme (EMS) based on State Vector Control (SVC) method for a Hybrid Emergency Power System (HEPS) of MEA. The results of the SVC controller are compared with the traditional Proportional-Integral (PI) Control strategy for verifying the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Various system characteristics such as voltage, current and SoC are assessed for comparing the efficiency of the above schemes. The model was designed and simulated with the help of MATLAB/SIMULINK architecture. The results signifies that the SVC technique is more efficient as compared to the traditional PI controller in showing improved efficiency, system response, and transient stability thus justifying its real time implementations.
