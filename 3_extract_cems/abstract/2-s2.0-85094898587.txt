Electrode material is a key component of supercapacitors (SCs). As a porous material, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention in the field of SCs electrode materials due to their high specific surface area, controllable structure, and adjustable pore size. The low conductivity and stability of MOFs are still the main challenges in practical applications. MOF composite materials are a type of composite materials composed of MOFs and one or more different materials. They can effectively combine the advantages of MOFs with the advantages of other functional materials, such as excellent electrical conductivity and unique electrochemical properties. Therefore, MOF composite materials can achieve high reversible capacity and excellent cycle performance, overcome the shortcomings of MOFs materials, and have broad application prospects in the field of SCs electrode materials. According to the dimensional classification of the materials combined with MOFs, they can be divided into four types of composite materials: 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D MOFs. The composition and synthesis methods of these four types of composite materials are reviewed. The application of MOF composite materials in the field of SCs is systematically introduced. Furthermore, its development prospects are prospected.
