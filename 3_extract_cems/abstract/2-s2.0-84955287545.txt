As a result of the popularization of wearable electronics, a variety of compact flexible energy storage devices have been successfully developed recently. During practical application, these delicate devices unavoidably experience all kinds of deformations. These deformations would become irreversible under the long-term concentration of local stresses, leading to structure and functional fatigue. To solve this problem, a shape memory supercapacitor (SMSC) is successfully fabricated for the first time. The SMSC is flexible and easily deformed below its activation temperature. Once it is heated over a trigger temperature, it would automatically recover its original shape, meanwhile restoring all deformations. By embedding with shape memory functions, all potential damage to the supercapacitor would be nipped in the bud, while simultaneously prolonging the life span of the device. Furthermore, an energy storage shape memory textile woven with these SMSCs and traditional fabrics can work as a smart sleeve. It can "remember" its pre-designed shape and realize automatic cooling when it is over-heated, demonstrating a diversity of potential applications other than energy storage.
