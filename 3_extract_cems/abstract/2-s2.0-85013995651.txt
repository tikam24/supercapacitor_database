Controlling the surface morphology of the electrode on the nanoscale has been studied extensively because the surface morphology of a material directly leads to the functionalization in various fields of studies. In this study, we designed a simple and cost-effective method to fine-tune the surface morphology and create controlled nanopores on the silver electrode by utilizing 2-ethoxyethanol and two successive heat treatments. High electrical conductivity and mechanical robustness of nanoporous silver corroborate its prospect to be employed in various applications requiring a certain degree of flexibility. As a proof-of-concept, a high-performance supercapacitor was fabricated by electrodepositing MnO2. This method is expected to be useful in various electronic applications as well as energy storage devices.
