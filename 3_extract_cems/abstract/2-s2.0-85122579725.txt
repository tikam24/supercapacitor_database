In this work, we investigate the supercapacitive properties of MoS2 hollow nano-roses with an open cavity at the centre. The synthesized nano MoS2 delivered specific capacitance of 180 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, whereas it was around 22 F g-1 for the bulk MoS2, which was synthesized in the absence of the micelle. The cycling stability was very high and retained 98% up to 500 cycles, 85% after 3500 cycles and 80% of the initial capacity at 5000 cycles. The enhanced specific capacitance and cycling stability of the nano MoS2 is probably due to its flower-shaped morphology which consist of thin sheets of MoS2 and with a hollow cavity which increases the accessible surface area and stability, respectively.
