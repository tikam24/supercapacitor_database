This paper proposes an energy loss analysis method for a stationary battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in the case of regenerative braking energy recovery. Firstly, the energy loss model of stationary HESS is established. Then, the key parameters of the actual load are extracted to establish a simplified load model. The sensitivity analysis of energy loss is carried out by considering the influence factors such as voltage of substation, the state of charge for battery, and the characteristics of load profile. The simulation analysis of sensitive parameters are performed according to the actual conditions of Batong Line in Beijing.
