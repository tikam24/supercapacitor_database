Activated carbon was prepared from the Azadirachta indica (Neem) tree bark via an anaerobic burning process. The resultant carbon was activated by chemical activation process. The structural, morphological and electrochemical analysis were carried out towards energy storage applications. The existence of carbon was confirmed through structural studies. The ACN electrode yields a highest specific capacitance of 542 F g-1 at a specific current of 5 A g-1 with a small charge transfer resistance of 0.41 Î©. The electrochemical results appear to designate that the neem tree bark derived activated carbon as a reliable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
