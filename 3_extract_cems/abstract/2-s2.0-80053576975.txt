Highly ordered, three-dimensional (3D) cubic mesoporous carbon CMK-8 is prepared by a facile nanocasting approach using cubic mesoporous silica KIT-6 as starting template. Afterwards, in order to increase the active sites of surface electrochemical reactions and promote the wettability in aqueous electrolyte, a chemical surface modification is carried out on the CMK-8 by nitric acid treatment. Two electrodes are prepared from the CMK-8 and the acid-modified CMK-8 (H-CMK-8) and used as the active materials for supercapacitors. The unique 3D mesoporous network combined with high specific surface area makes the nano-channel surfaces of the CMK-8 carbon favorable for charging the electric double-layer, resulting in that the CMK-8 and the H-CMK-8 electrodes both show well supercapacitive properties. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the CMK-8 can be further improved by acid treatment, so that the H-CMK-8 exhibits the largest specific capacitance of 246 F g-1 at a current density of 0.625 A g-1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte. Also, the two carbon electrodes both exhibit good cycling stability and lifetime. Therefore, based on the above investigations, such CMK-8 carbon, especially H-CMK-8 carbon can be a potential candidate for supercapacitors. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
