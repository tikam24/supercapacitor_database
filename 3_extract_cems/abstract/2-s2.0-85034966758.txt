Water-processed, aqueous electrolyte supercapacitors are demonstrated incorporating an alternating copolymer of a functionalized 3,4-propylenedioxythiophene unit with a 2,2′-bis(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) unit (PE2) into carbon nanotube textiles. The side chains functionalizing PE2 allow the solubility to be tuned from the organic soluble precursor polymer, to a water-soluble polyelectrolyte, and finally to a solvent resistant form by a dilute acid wash (SR-PE2). Thin SR-PE2 films (60 μg cm-2) are electroactive over a wide potential window with a mass capacitance of 54 F g-1 at a discharge rate of 1.6 s (38 A g-1). These films exhibit a 65% capacitance retention at an 80 millisecond discharge time (560 A g-1). Flexible, free-standing electrodes were fabricated by depositing SR-PE2 onto a nonwoven carbon nanotube textile (CNT-T) and were assembled into symmetrical, flexible supercapacitors where the addition of polymer resulted in a boost in volumetric capacitance by 400 percent compared to the bare CNT-T electrode. Independent of whether the SR-PE2 films are cast from an organic solvent or water, device electrodes exhibit 11.4 F cm-3 (45 mF cm-2, 15.9 F g-1) which leads to an energy density of 0.10 mW h cm-3 at 7.5 mW cm-3 considering the total device volume. The CNT-T imparts a high degree of flexibility allowing the supercapacitors to retain 88% of their charge storage capacity when bent to a 0.8 mm radius as well as complete capacitance retention after 2000 bending cycles to a 3.5 mm radius. The devices assembled in air with a benign KCl electrolyte maintained 83% capacitance retention after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles highlighting the stability of these materials and utility for this processing approach for high throughput energy storage devices.
