(La0.75Sr0.25)0.95MnO3-δ (LSM)/MnO2 composite for supercapacitor (SC) electrode is successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The LSM/MnO2 composite shows a flower-like structure and possesses numerous active sites and better conductivity. The as-prepared LSM/MnO2 electrode exhibits a larger specific capacitance of 437.2 F g−1, much better than that of pure MnO2. Furthermore, the composite electrode also has a higher rate capability (capacitance improvement can reach to 70%) and better cycling stability. It is believed that the present results provide an efficient electrode materials design and a novel composite for the future practical application of high-performance supercapacitor.
