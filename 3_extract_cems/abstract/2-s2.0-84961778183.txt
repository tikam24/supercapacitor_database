In-situ deposition of MnO2/NiO hetero structure on Ni-foam has been carried out through simple one-step hydrothermal reaction. The in-situ deposited multi-metal oxide shows extraordinary electrocatalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV per decade and very low onset potential of 0.17 V. An electrolyser has been fabricated with MnO2/NiO deposited Ni-foam which effectively achieves a current density of ~24 mA cm-2 at an applied voltage of ~1.57 V. Furthermore, the metal oxide deposited on Ni-foam is directly used as the supercapacitor electrode which shows good rate capability as positive electrode materials. An asymmetric capacitor (ASC) has been assembled by using the MnO2/NiO deposited Ni-foam as positive electrode and thermally reduced graphene oxide as negative electrode. The assembled ASC has a large specific capacitance of 218 F g-1 at a current density of 3 A g-1 and can deliver high energy and power density of 59.5 Wh kg-1 and 25,350 W kg-1, respectively. The ASC shows very good electrochemical stability throughout 10,000 charge-discharge cycles along with the capability to work in the high frequency range.
