Among many energy storage and conversion devices, supercapacitors have been extensively studied due to their high power density, rapid charge and discharge and excellent cycle performance. However, the lower specific capacity and energy density limit the extensive application of supercapacitor as large-scale energy storage and conversion devices. In order to increase the specific capacity of supercapacitors, it is necessary to increase the contact area between the electrode material and the electrolyte, thereby facilitating the electrode material to acquire/release particles from/into the electrolyte. In addition, another effective way to increase the electrochemical performance of the electrode material is to introduce a non-metal atom doping such as S, N or the like. This method can improve the electronic properties of the material to improve electrochemical performance. Herein, porous S-Co2SiO4 nanostructures were prepared by simple solvothermal method combined with high temperature calcination experimental scheme. The specific surface area of S-Co2SiO4 porous nanomaterials was as high as 143.58 m2/g. Due to the porous structural characteristics, the S-Co2SiO4 electrode exhibited a high specific capacity (1 125.3 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) and had a good rate performance (current density increases from 1 to 9 A/g). it retained its initial capacitance of 73.9%.
