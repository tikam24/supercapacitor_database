Double layer capacitors, supercapacitors or ultracapacitors are of particular interest in the sustainable energy field because of the optimization role that they can play in providing a buffer between power and energy supply and demand. The cost per energy stored and the charge - discharge performance still require improvement for large scale implementation of the technology. In this work, the capacitance performance of an activated carbon from an inexpensive fluid coke source is reported. Two aspects were studied. The activated carbon capacitance was compared with and without sulfur impregnation. The effect of sulfur either increased the capacitance or did not contribute to capacitance depending on carbon preparation conditions. High temperature treatment of the sulfur impregnated carbons reduced capacitance. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
