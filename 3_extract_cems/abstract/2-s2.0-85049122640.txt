Super capacitor has the advantages of high power density, fast charging, long service life, and has been widely used in the tram. But the power supply system of super capacitor tram, which uses a large number of power electronic devices, has characteristics of frequently charging, short charging time, and large charging current. Thus, it will bring great harmonics to the power grid. This paper proposes a new treatment measure to decrease harmonics based on single tuned filter, and effect of the novel method is verified in simulation. In the paper, combined with Central China super capacitor tram project, the charging process is simulated, and the negative impact of super capacitor tram on the power quality of the grid is studied, which proves its efficiency. This paper has a certain guiding effect on the theoretical research and concrete implementation of super capacitor tram project in the future.
