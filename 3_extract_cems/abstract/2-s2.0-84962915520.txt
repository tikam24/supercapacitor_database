Optimisation-based Energy Management Strategies for hybrid and electric vehicles have to face some issues for real-time applications. In this study,an online adaptive optimisation-based strategy is used for an electric vehicle with a Hybrid Energy Storage System including supercapacitors and batteries. The SCs voltage limitations are taken into account by using a feedback control. Indeed the voltage limitation is a key point for safe operations in the vehicle. A comparison with a more classical optimisation-based method is performed by simulations on a normalised driving cycle. The results point out a more effective behaviour of the adaptive strategy.
