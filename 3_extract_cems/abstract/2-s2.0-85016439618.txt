Two-dimensional transition-metal carbide materials (termed MXene) have attracted huge attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their excellent electrical conductivity, high volumetric capacity, etc. Herein, with inspiration from the interesting structure of pillared interlayered clays, we attempt to fabricate pillared Ti3C2 MXene (CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2) via a facile liquid-phase cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) prepillaring and Sn4+ pillaring method. The interlayer spacing of Ti3C2 MXene can be controlled according to the size of the intercalated prepillaring agent (cationic surfactant) and can reach 2.708 nm with 177% increase compared with the original spacing of 0.977 nm, which is currently the maximum value according to our knowledge. Because of the pillar effect, the assembled LIC exhibits a superior energy density of 239.50 Wh kg-1 based on the weight of CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 even under higher power density of 10.8 kW kg-1. When CTAB-Sn(IV)@Ti3C2 anode couples with commercial AC cathode, LIC reveals higher energy density and power density compared with conventional MXene materials.
