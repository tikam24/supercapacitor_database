We synthesized the hierarchical ZnO/SnO2@NiCo2O4 core-shell nanorod sheet arrays (NRSAs) grown on a flexible conductive carbon cloth (CC) substrate by a hydrothermal method. The amalgamation and formation mechanism were proposed. The as obtained ZnO/SnO2@NiCo2O4 core-shell heterostructures is investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm analysis. The SnO2 layer which is conducting between ZnO and NiCo2O4 may effectively boost the electrical conductivity of the electrodes and also defend the ZnO from corrosion in the alkaline solution. Benefitting from the core-shell heterostructure formation, the hybrid ZnO/SnO2@NiCo2O4//CC electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 244.5 mA h/g, enhanced cycling stability with a 94.5% retention in specific capacitance even after 10,000 continuous charge-discharge cycles and good rate capability. To utilize the high specific capacity and ultra-long cycling stability, the PVA-KOH gel electrolyte based solid-state hybrid supercapacitor device was assembled with AC//CC as a negative electrode and ZnO/SnO2@NiCo2O4//CC as a positive electrode. The fabricated HSC device delivered a specific capacitance of 117.5 F/g with high energy density (41.7 Wh/kg) and power density (6400 W/kg) along with the outstanding capacitance retention of 94.6% even after 10,000 continuous charging and discharging cycles. With exceptional electrochemical performance, a facile and cost-effective preparation, such ZnO/SnO2@NiCo2O4//CC core-shell heterostructured electrode show a great potential for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor applications in future.
