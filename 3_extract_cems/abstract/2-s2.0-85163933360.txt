The task of designing multifunctional nanomaterials for high-performing electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices has proven to be extremely challenging. Here, we report the fabrication of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based ternary nanocomposite NiO@MnO2@rGO having a range of active sites for enhanced electrochemical activity. Powder-XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, and XPS techniques were used to analyze the prepared samples, revealing that the NiO@MnO2@rGO nanocomposite had smooth cubic particles and 2D rGO nanosheets, with a particle size of 70 nm. The resulting nanostructure included a mesoporous backbone with NiO and MnO2 NPs enclosed between rGO layers, featuring various active sites such as Ni, Mn, and carbon-based species. The novel NiO@MnO2@rGO ternary nanocomposite material combines NiO, MnO2, and rGO to achieve improved electrochemical performance in a cost-effective and scalable manner for supercapacitors. Notably, NiO@MnO2@rGO modified structure exhibited excellent conductivity due to the presence of rGO, demonstrating a high charge storage capacity of 536 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. Furthermore, the nanocomposite displayed exceptional stability, with a capacitance retention of approximately 93% after 3000 cycles. These remarkable properties make the NiO@MnO2@rGO nanocomposite a promising solution to meet future energy demands in a cost-effective manner, addressing the need for sustainable energy storage.
