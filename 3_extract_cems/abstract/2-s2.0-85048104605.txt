Electrochemical capacitors have been developing fast in recent years, and are slowly becoming an increasingly impor tant component in the energy storage mix. Their particular properties, high power density, and medium energy densities, have made them suitable for a growing number of applications such as regenerative breaking and fast charging toys. Owing to its polarizability, electrical conductivity, acces sibility, easy processability, relatively low cost, and chemical stability in a wide range of pH, traditionally, carbon has been the principal component of electrochemical capacitor elec trodes. There are already well-established methods of obtain ing high surface area materials with controlled pore size. Now graphene, with very high surface area and electrical conduc tivity seems a natural candidate material from which to make supercapacitor electrodes. This chapter reviews efforts toward the application of gra phene in its various forms (from exfoliated powder to vertically chemical vapor-grown carbon nanowalls) into supercapacitor electrodes. Starting from a general introduction into the work ing and mechanism of capacitors and the context in which they operate, we review methods of electrode production, cur rent performance, and possible application areas. We end by suggesting routes for further exploration.
