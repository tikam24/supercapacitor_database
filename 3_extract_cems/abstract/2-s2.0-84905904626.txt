In the paper, energy storage system and charge and discharge control strategy for large-scale photovoltaic generation are designed. The optimal energy storage capacity is configurated for PV array. The energy storage system and control module for PV generation are built in MATLAB-Simulink platform. Supercapacitor (SC) is the energy storage element. Considering the insolation and temperature under the changing meteorological conditions, the output power would be fluctuant. By controlling MOSFET switches based on power signal, SC will charge when the lighting is adequate and discharge in the instance of lack of light to keep DC bus voltage in constant. Configuring the optimal energy storage capacity by simulation, the result proves that the control strategy is feasible and the configuration is optimal. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
