3D network-like mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanostructures have been successfully fabricated through a solvothermal route coupled with a post annealing treatment. Benefiting from its advantages of the unique 3D network-like structures with large specific surface area (170.6 m2 g-1), abundant mesoporosity (5-10 nm) and high electronic conductivity, the as-obtained NiCo2O4 manifests high specific capacitance of 931 F g-1 at 3 A g-1, remarkable capacity retention rate of 85.2 and 72.5% at 20 and 50 A g-1 compared with 2 A g-1 and superior cycling stability of 125.2% of initial capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 A g-1. The excellent electrochemical performances coupled with its facile and cost-effective way will render the 3D network-like mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanostructures as attractive electrode materials for promising application in supercapacitors.
