By introducing a graphene oxide (GO) sheet as a phase stabilizer and a mechanical supporter, MoS2/GO hybrid films consisting of a high concentration of distorted 1T-MoS2 are successfully fabricated through a post-annealing process in air with the form of a restacked film. After the annealing process, the MoS2 nanosheets undergo direct binding with the oxygen functional groups of GO, maintaining their highly conducting 1T phase and leading to distorted 1T-MoS2 or 1T′-MoS2. A hybrid film-based supercapacitor reveals significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, such as an ultrahigh volumetric power density (≈207Wcm-3), high volumetric capacitance (≈380Fcm-3 at 10mVs-1), superior rate capability, and a semi-permanent cycle life (95% retention after 10000 cycles) in an aqueous electrolyte.
