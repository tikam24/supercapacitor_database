Paper-based supercapacitors have attracted more and more attention for high electrochemical performance. However, most of them adopt sandwiched structure. Here, we prepared planar polypyrrole (PPy) coated paper-based supercapacitors by applying simple laser carving assisted method. The planar device showed a significant performance improvement (13.9 mF/cm2) compared to the sandwiched device (12.3 mF/cm2). In addition, by adjusting the polymerization time of pyrrole, the device capacity can be further increased to 87.4 mF/cm2. We firmly believed that the laser carving assisted method has a significant role in promoting the development of flexible planar electronic devices.
