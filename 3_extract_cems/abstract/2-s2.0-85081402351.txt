Rapid development of portable and wearable electronic devices has triggered increased research interest in small-scale power sources, especially in micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) because of their high power densities, long service life, and ability to be charged and discharged quickly. Graphene, an ideal two-dimensional energy-storage electrode material with good conductivity, high quantum capacitance, and large specific surface area, can be used as a building block for MSCs with multi-dimensional architectures. Considerable efforts have been devoted to constructing structures with different dimensions for advanced graphene-based MSCs (GMSCS). In this Review, we summarize the recent progress of graphene-based macroscopic assemblies in MSCs, including 1D fiber GMSCs, 2D planar GMSCs; and 3D in-plane or stacked GMSCs, and discuss the relationship between the structures and applications of the devices. In addition, future prospects and challenges in the MSCs are also discussed.
