V2O5 sol was prepared by melting and quenching. Organic solvent exchange was used to get rid of the water from the wet gel coating on a macroporous nickel-foamed metal. The result shows the surface area of the gel is 36.67 m2/g. A supercapacitor device is constructed by using the prepared V2O5 gel as a positive electrode and lithium as a negative electrode, 1 mol/L LiPF6 organic solvent as the electrolyte. The specific energy and power of the supercapacitor are 10 kW/kg and 158 Wh/kg, which is compared with 10 kW/kg and 106 Wh/kg for the V2O5 gel without solvent exchange, assuming that the average working voltage of the device is 2.0V.
