The paper presents the the research work on preparation of polyaniline nanowires (PANI) in order to produce supercapacitor electrodes. The electrodes were tested in the cell model of supercapacitor specifying the ability to store electrochemical energy in the electrical way of pseudocapacitance phenomenon - the charge storing in the activated electroconducting polymer. The results of the influence of technological parameters on electrochemical properties associated with the storing of electric charge of obtained nanowires are presented.
