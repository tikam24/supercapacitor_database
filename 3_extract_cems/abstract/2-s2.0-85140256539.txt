An aqueous electrolyte-based supercapacitor electrode of graphene and amine-functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (AFCNT) is reported. Amine groups were covalently introduced on the surface of Carbon nanotubes (CNT) by diazonium reaction. In-situ reduction of graphene oxide over amine functionalized carbon nanotube template resulted the final composite. At current density of 1 A/g the electrode showed 384 F/g specific capacitance. The electrode had an energy density of 53.33 Wh/kg and power density of 499.13 W/kg. The electrode evinced almost 90 % of capacitance retention even at elevated current density of 5 A/g.
