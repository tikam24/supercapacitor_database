Development of graphene-based membrane electrodes with high electron and charge transfer capability can meet the increasing requirement for high-rate energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrate a novel spin regularization strategy to prepare regularized graphene oxide (GO) membranes with uniform interlayer spacing for high-performance electrodes. The outer stretching forces on the radial direction together with the inner electrostatic interaction can form smoother GO flakes and 2D interlayer channels. The positively/negatively charged laponites embedded between the interlayer or at the edges of the GO flakes can enhance the stability of the channel structure, thus further promoting the mass transfer efficiency. Moreover, the membranes with ordered and stable laminar structures reveal high mechanical strength and water stability. Therefore, the as-prepared 2L@GO-10 membrane with regular interlayer channels exhibits a high gravimetric capacitance (406.5 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and rate capability (53% capacitance retention from 0.5 to 100 A g-1) as well as robust cyclic stability (95% retention after 20,000 cycles). Additionally, the multiple membrane stacked electrode also exhibits high energy storage capacity.
