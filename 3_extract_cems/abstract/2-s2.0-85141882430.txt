– This paper introduces a new Energy Management System (EMS) approach for a stand-alone Hybrid Renewable Energy System (HRES) for residential application. The HRES comprises a solar photovoltaic unit (PV) as a master source, a hydrogen Fuel Cell (FC) as a standby source and a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) combining a battery (Batt) and a supercapacitor (SC). The PV system works at maximum power point whereas the FC and the HESS act as support and storage system respectively. The adopted EMS not only aims at distributing the power between the FC, the Batt and the SC but also focuses on regulating the battery State of Charge (SoC) between two desired limits, while minimizing the cost of battery usage and hydrogen consumption. This is done via a gain scheduled low-pass filter where gain value is adapted online in order to increase flexibility of source’s use. Gain value should be pre-optimized by an optimization problem based on battery usage and hydrogen consumption cost. Numerical simulations using MATLAB/Simulink are carried out in order to evaluate the performance of the new method. Two other different EMS approaches have been utilized to serve the comparison with the proposed technique.
