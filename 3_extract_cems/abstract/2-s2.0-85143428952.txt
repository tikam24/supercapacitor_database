Despite lithium-ion battery (LIB) and supercapacitor materials have gone through numerous enhancements, achieving high energy density as well as power density together is still a dream for the industries. In this scenario, herein we report, boric acid coated α−MnO2 anode with 1288 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C at the initial cycle and of an average discharge capacity of 570 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C over 20 cycles, high-rate capability and 100 % Coulombic efficiency after 60 cycles for LIB. The Li+ diffusion coefficient estimated from GITT and EIS measurements reveals that the H3BO3 coated α−MnO2 electrode has superior Li-ion kinetics ((Formula presented.) ∼10−10 cm2 s−1) than bare α−MnO2. Coin cells with boric acid coated α−MnO2 electrode are able to power up red and blue LEDs continuously for about 24–32 hours. The ex-situ investigations reveal an interesting self-assembled active electrode-electrolyte interfacial bridging Li4B2O5 layer formation. This significant active layer allows free migration of lithium ions across interface that leads to good cyclability. In flexible supercapacitor, the boric acid coated α−MnO2 yields excellent cyclability over 500 cycles with specific capacitance of 35 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and further 200 cycles at 30° acute angle with 21 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The research overthrows the significance of boric acid in conversion reactions for active interfacial bridging layer in LIB and hydroxyl ion capturing agent in flexible supercapacitor.
