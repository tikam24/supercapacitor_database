Mechanically tough large-area hierarchical porous graphene films are fabricated by blade-casting of graphene oxide hydrogel and postcasting reduction. The as-prepared graphene films, which consist of well-exfoliated graphene nanosheets, possess interpenetrating 3D hierarchical porous structures, high strength and modulus, large specific area, and high electrical conductivity. Flexible film supercapacitors fabricated with the graphene electrodes show superior areal capacitance, good rate performance, and excellent mechanical stability.
