Biomass-derived porous carbon with developed pore structure is critical to achieving high performance electrode materials. In this work, we report a grape-based honeycomb-like porous carbon (GHPC) prepared by KOH activation and carbonization, followed by N-doping (NGHPC). The obtained NGHPC exhibits a unique honeycomb-like structure with hierarchically interconnected micro/mesopores, and high specific surface area of 1268 m2/g. As a supercapacitor electrode, the NGPHC electrode exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 275 F/g at 0.5 A/g in a three-electrode cell. Moreover, the NGHPC//NGHPC symmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 12.6 Wh/kg, and excellent cycling stability of approximately 95.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. The excellent electrochemical performance of NGHPC is ascribed to its high specific surface area, honeycomb-like structure and high-content of pyrodinic-N (36.29%). It is believed that grape-based carbon materials show great potential as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors.
