The novel composites of sulfonated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (sMWCNTs) modified polyaniline (PANI) nanorods (PANI/sMWCNTs) were synthesized successfully by in situ oxidative polymerization method in the HClO4 solution. FTIR and Raman spectra revealed the presence of π-π interaction between the PANI and the sulfonated carbon nanotubes and the formation of charge transfer composites. It was found that the specific capacitance of the PANI/sMWCNT composites was markedly influenced by their morphological structure and the content of PANI which was coated onto the sMWCNT. The specific capacitance of the PANI/sMWCNT composite exhibited a maximum value of 515.2 F g-1 at the 76.4 wt% PANI. The charge-discharge tests showed the PANI/sMWCNT composites possessed a good cycling stability (below 10% capacity loss after 1000 cycles) compared to PANI nanorods. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
