Piezoelectric materials have been at the centre of energy harvesting research for a few decades now. This article explores the performance of piezoelectric drum transducers made using piezoelectric buzzer elements as shoe-based energy harvesters. Two sizes of drum transducers were fabricated, viz. 27 and 35 mm. Two different arrangements of these drums in stack as well as individual form were designed, embedded in shoes and tested with walk profile. Peak powers of 3.86 and 3.21 mW were obtained using a standard interface circuit whereas 1.23 and 0.38 mW using a MOSFET bridge with model 1 and 2, respectively. NiMH batteries of different capacities were charged using the shoe-based energy harvesters. An energy harvesting circuit using LTC 3588-1 energy harvesting IC was fabricated to obtain a regulated output voltage of 3.6 V using the shoe harvesters. Results show that these drum harvesters can be easily embedded in shoes and have the potential to act as excellent energy scavengers and generate enough power to drive low power sensors that can be used to design a smart body monitoring system.
