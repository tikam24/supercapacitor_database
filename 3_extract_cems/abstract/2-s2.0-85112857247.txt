The paper discusses the public transportation system, which today there is energy conservation in the environment around the world. Therefore, clean and environmentally friendly energy is used instead of petroleum. Public transport today tends to used only urban electric buses(EB). The objective of this research is to expand the range of running routes used wireless charging system (WPT). When the electric buses are stop to pickup passengers in the route by installing a wireless charger underground at bus stops pickup passengers. Analysis of electromagnetic fields based on Ampere's law, which is the transmission of a magnetic field through a medium in the air for a wireless charging system. Therefore, the research is an experiment that challenges the trends of the renewable energy that can storage energy, promising results from possible research that can used clean energy in the future.
