Coconut husk biomass waste was used as the carbon precursor to develop a simple and economical process for the preparation of hierarchical porous activated carbon, and the electrochemical properties of the electrode material were explored. The important process variables of carbonization, the weight ratios of the coconut shell/KOH, the amount of source dopant, and the carbonization temperature were investigated in order to reveal the influence of the as-obtained microporous/mesoporous/macroporous hierarchical porous carbon materials on the powder properties. Using a BET specific surface area analyzer, Raman analysis, XPS and SEM, surface morphology, pore distribution and specific surface area of the hierarchical porous carbon materials are discussed. The results show that the as-prepared N-, S- and O-heteroatom-co-doped activated carbon electrode was manufactured at 700 °C for electrochemical characteristics. The electrochemical behavior has the characteristics of pseudo-capacitance, and could reach 186 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 when measured by the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) test. After 7000 cycles of the charge–discharge test, the initial capacitance value retention rate was 95.6%. It is predicted that capacitor materials made when using coconut shell as a carbon source will have better energy storage performance than traditional carbon supercapacitors.
