In the present study, a novel attempt has been made to fabricate an asymmetric supercapacitor based on a MgO-multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite as the cathode and activated carbon (AC) as the anode using an organic electrolyte (1 M LiPF6 in EC:DMC 1:1 by volume). Supercapacitance behavior is examined by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. The results reveal that the test cell displayed excellent capacitance performance between 0 and 3 V. The MgO-MWCNT/AC cell delivers a specific capacitance of 66 F g-1 at a current density of 2.2 A g-1. Cycling studies show that this cell can retain 97% of its initial capacitance after 35000 cycles. Additionally, the MgO-MWCNT/AC cell also exhibits a maximum energy density of 30 W h kg -1, which is comparable to the values obtained from other supercapacitor configurations. These results encourage utilization of the MgO-MWCNT composite as a potential electrode in developing green and low cost energy storage devices with high energy and power densities as well as prolonged cycle life.
