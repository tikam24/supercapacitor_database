This article will give an overview of the various possibilities of increased energy efficiency in electrical railway systems. Not only the power systems in the main traction circuit will be emphasized, but also efficient solutions arising from auxiliary-optimization, reduced weight of the vehicles, aerodynamics and efficient rail automation. The main focus will be on the application of energy storage in traction systems. The stationary installation in substations will be described and the advantages demonstrated in a number of applications using different main strategies. A wide and varied range of benefits will arise from the typical application situation.
