Developing two dimensional (2D) materials based ink is an advanced method for fabricating printable and flexible electronic devices. 2D few-layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) reveals a great potential for capacitive energy storage because of its layered structure (for ion intercalation), high surface area (provide active sites) and multi-valence state of Mo (introduce pseudocapacitive reactions). These unique properties could intensively improve the potential of MoS2 for supercapacitors. However, MoS2 is a semiconductor with low conductivity, which limits its performance in electrochemistry. In the meantime, MoS2 based ink for flexible energy storage application has been barely investigated. In this work, we design a MoS2 and carbon nanotube (MoS2/CNT) hybrid ink that uses exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet and CNT to fabricate a paper-based supercapacitor. A strong synergistic effect between MoS2 and CNT in capacitive performance was observed due to the good conductivity of CNT and high capacitance of MoS2. Paper-based solid-state device is also fabricated which reveals good flexibility and high capacitive performance. This hybrid ink represents a new road for flexible paper-based devices.
