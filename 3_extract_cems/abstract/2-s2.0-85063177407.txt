The paper is dedicated to the task of improving of regenerative braking of a DC train with the series-wound DC traction motors. It is proposed the schematic solution for the trains with DC motors, which is based on the storing of recovered energy by the on-board supercapacitor storage system and extending the speed range of regenerative braking. The scheme is described by expressions which allowed to build the time dependences of main values. In addition, the experimental researches with the multiple-unit train were performed to find initial data for calculations and verification the results. The transient processes of charging are analyses for different cases of storage capacitances, residual voltages and initial speed of braking. It was proved, that the scheme allows to increase the value of recovered energy up to 40%, but its value strongly depends on the initial conditions and parameters of the system.
