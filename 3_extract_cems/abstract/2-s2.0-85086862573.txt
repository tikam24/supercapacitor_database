Since the research direction of supercapacitors (SC) has been deviated from the principle of causing capacitance, the revisit may be a future task in exploiting electric power storage. SC have been developed by applying ionic properties in order to enhance heterogeneity of ionic distributions. However, SC belong to double-layer capacitances (DLC), which are caused by orientation of solvent dipoles without any direct relation to ionic properties. DLC are always complicated with ion-independent characteristics such as frequency dispersion, voltage dependence, and participation in redox reactions, whereas these complications have not yet been considered in development of SC. Especially, pseudo capacitances should be examined through isolating the contribution of DLC from the redox properties.
