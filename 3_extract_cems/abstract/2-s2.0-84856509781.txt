Battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems have been gaining popularity in electric vehicles due to their excellent power and energy performances. Conventional designs of such systems require interfacing dc-dc converters. These additional dc-dc converters increase power loss, complexity, weight and cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a new direct integration scheme for battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems using a double ended inverter system. This unique approach eliminates the need for interfacing converters and thus it is free from aforementioned drawbacks. Furthermore, the proposed system offers seven operating modes to improve the effective use of available energy in a typical drive cycle of a hybrid electric vehicle. Simulation results are presented to verify the efficacy of the proposed system and control techniques. Â© 2011 IEEE.
