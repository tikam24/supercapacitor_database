A brief review reporting the recent advances on the applications of graphene/carbon based nanocomposites is presented. In particular, due to the convenient preparatory procedures available for the bulk synthesis of graphene and graphene derived composites as a top-down approach, the number of research contributions has also raised exponentially. The combination of graphene with metal, metal oxide composites resulted in exploration of various applications ranging from energy to biomedical fields. Multidimensional graphene materials were subdivided into supercapacitor electrodes, lithium ion battery electrodes, fuel cells and dye sensitized solar cells for utilization in flexible, clean and safe electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Further, this review explored the fields of sensors, adsorption, anaerobic digestion and drug delivery.
