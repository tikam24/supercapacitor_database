MnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by simple chemical precipitation method and were subjected to different heat treatment process. The structural evolution of as-prepared MnO2 nanoparticles at different annealing temperature was confirmed by XRD analysis. The weight loss as well as the heat flow associated with the thermal decomposition was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) along with differential thermal analysis (DTA). The functional group and phase formation were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Finally electrochemical properties were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The cyclic voltammogram and charge-discharge curve of 450 Â°C annealed MnO2 nanoparticles exhibited relatively good capacitive behavior.
