In order to improve the cycling stability and accelerate the electrons transfer at high current density, a synthetic strategy of Ni@Ni0.85Se composites is proposed by adjusting the molar ratio of Ni and Se elements via one-step hydrothermal method. In addition, the Ni@Ni0.85Se composite shows a special structure with metal Ni as skeleton to support the growth of ultrathin Ni0.85Se nanosheets, which will be further enhance the conductivity and the specific surface area, respectively. Therefore, with the combination of Ni and Ni0.85Se, the Ni@Ni0.85Se composite exhibits well long-term cycling stability and high energy/power density as investigated as electrode materials for hybrid supercapacitors: a high specific capacitance of 140.0 F g−1 is obtained after 10000 cycles at the current density of 2 A g−1.
