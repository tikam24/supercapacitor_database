Present innovation emphasizes the design and development of hybrid nanoarchitecture by using simple two-step chemical routes, namely, "dip and dry", for multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) followed by coating of molybdenum telluride (MoTe2) nanopebbles using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) to form a thin film onto flexible stainless steel (SS) substrate toward the fabrication of a symmetric solid-state and flexible supercapacitor device. The MWCNTs/MoTe2 nanostructured composite exhibits strong synergy and materials mutualism between electric double-layer capacitive (EDLC) behaved MWCNTs and pseudocapacitive MoTe2 leading to the enhanced supercapacitive performance. Interestingly, the formed unique nanoarchitecture offers an excellent charge-storing capability of 502 F/g as the specific capacitance at 2 mV/s in liquid configuration with excellent rate capability and cyclic stability. The formed flexible complete solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (FCSS-SC) device using two SS/MWCNTs/MoTe2 electrodes with poly(vinyl alcohol)-lithium perchlorate (PVA-LiClO4) gel electrolyte as a mediator has demonstrated an upgraded potential window resulting in superior capacitance and energy density. Additionally, mechanical flexibility, cyclic stability, and hands-on application by a glowing light-emitting diode (LED) can attract the value of the formed device toward the advanced energy storage meadow.
