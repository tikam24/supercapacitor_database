Simple and inexpensive two step novel chemical method for the synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) nanoplates has been reported. These PPy nanoplates are characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Polypyrrole nanoplates exhibit amorphous nature as confirmed from XRD study. Based on SEM and TEM analysis, the formation of the spherical bunches of PPy nanoplates with average size of about 20 nm are inferred. The electrochemical performance of PPy electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. A high specific capacitance of 533 F g-1 was obtained within the potential range of -0.4 to 0.6 V in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, PPy electrode exhibited high discharge/charge efficiency of 93% and the capacitance retention of 83% at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 indicating good electrochemical reversibility and rate capability.
