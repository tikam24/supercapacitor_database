Porous carbon fibers (PCFs) have promising prospects as electrode materials for energy storage devices. In this study, the centrifuged electrospun PCFs (cPCFs) were mainly studied. And compared with the traditional electrospun PCFs (ePCFs), cPCFs have significantly enhanced mechanical and electrochemical properties. It was found that the cPCFs exhibited a special nanochannel structures including micropores, mesopores and macropores, achieving a high specific capacitance (Cspe) of 277 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g. The cPCFs also possessed a capacitance retention rate of 99% and 98% after 6700 cycles and 200 bends respectively, which indicated that it had excellent electrochemical stability and flexibility. In addition, the flexible binder-free symmetric supercapacitors displayed a relatively high specific capacitance of 93.2 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g. In this research, a high-efficiency, environmental friendly and low-cost method was used to prepare flexible, binder-free and high-performance electrode materials, which provided new possibilities for flexible wearable energy storage devices in the future.
