In this study, ZnCo 2 O 4 ultra-thin curved sheets which directly grown on nickel foam are fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal method. A possible growth mechanism for the ZnCo 2 O 4 ultra-thin curved sheets involves sodium dodecyl sulfate chains serving as the template under the adsorption of the hydrophilic terminal on Zn 2+ and Co 3+ ions. Active materials grow along the chains after nucleation, these chains in turn attached to each other forming ultra-thin curved sheets in the reaction solution. The ZnCo 2 O 4 ultra-thin curved sheets/nickel foam electrode exhibits super-high specific capacity of 832 C g −1 at 5 A g −1 , remarkable high-rate capability (737 C g −1 at 15 A g −1 ), excellent cycling stability and maintaining 85.5% at 50 A g −1 after 5000 cycles. A button hybrid supercapacitor device operating at 1.7 V is prepared by using activated carbon coating on nickel foam and ZnCo 2 O 4 ultra-thin curved sheets/nickel foam as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. The device shows an energy density of 20.31 W h kg −1 at a power density of 855 W kg −1 while maintaining an energy density of 10.2 W h kg −1 at 4.25 kW kg −1 , as well as good cycling stability (87% retention after 5000 cycles).
