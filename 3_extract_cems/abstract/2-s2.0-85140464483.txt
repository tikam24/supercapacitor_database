Bidirectional DC-DC is widely used in energy storage systems and other fields, and its reliability is closely related to the stable operation of equipment. Electrolytic capacitor is considered as the component with the highest failure rate in the bidirectional DC-DC converter circuit, and its performance greatly affects the efficiency of the whole circuit. In this paper, a capacitance fault prediction model of bidirectional DC-DC converter is proposed based on support vector machine regression algorithm and LSTM-SVR algorithm. Firstly, the failure mechanism of electrolytic capacitor of the bidirectional Buck/Boost converter is analyzed, and the parameters reflecting its degradation law are determined. The capacitor degradation is simulated, and ripple voltage is selected as the fault characteristic parameter. Then, Support Vector Regression and Grid Search are used to optimize the long and short term memory network to determine its optimal network structure. Finally, through simulation experiments, compared with LSTM and SVR models, the prediction accuracy of LSTM-SVR reaches more than 97%, the accuracy of the model was verified.
