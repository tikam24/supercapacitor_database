We have fabricated supercapacitor electrodes consisting of nickel oxide hydroxide (NiOOH) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). The presence of the carbon nanotubes provides a conducting network and also increases the specific surface area. A specific capacitance of 2436 F g -1 and a specific surface area of 274.32 m 2 g -1 were obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s -1 on the 50 wt.% of MWNTs. Energy density and power density were 82.8 W h kg -1 and 8.5 kW kg -1, respectively. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
