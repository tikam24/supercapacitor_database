In this paper, a hydrothermal synthesis method was applied to load Ni-Co Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH) directly on the Nickel foam (NF) as precursor, and by using an electrodeposition method to gain the Co(OH)2/Ni-Co LDH composite. The structure and morphology of as-obtained composite was characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performances of the as-obtained composite were tested by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The Co(OH)2/Ni-Co LDH composite, made by many interconnected nanosheets, was uniformly distributed. The as-obtained electrode achieved a capacity of 825.6 F g-1 at 1 A g-1.
