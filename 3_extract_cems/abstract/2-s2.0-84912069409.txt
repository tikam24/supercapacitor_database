Nowadays, the design of the supercapacitor equalization circuits is a hot topic for researchers, but most literatures focus on the topology of the equalization circuits, and few pays attention to the characteristics analysis of voltage equalization circuit in supercapcitor modules. In this paper, quantitative analysis of the influence of the dispersion characteristics of supercapacitor are presented, and the design method of switching resistor circuit is proposed under two kinds of typical working conditions. Simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the analysis.
