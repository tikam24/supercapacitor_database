Engineering the surface morphology of electrodes plays a vital role in determining the physical and electrochemical properties of energy-storing applications. Especially, properly structured electrode morphology can induce high electrochemical performance owing to its high surface area, short ion path, and structural robustness, which can facilitate high specific capacitance, favorable ion diffusion kinetics, and stable cyclability. Here, we address a hierarchically nanostructured flowerlike copper sulfide electrode (HNF-CSE), consisting of primary one-dimensional (1D) nanorod backbones and secondary two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of copper sulfide materials. Using a facile chemical solution immersion synthesis, those structures can be simply tailored. The hierarchical 1D–2D architecture can present efficient energy storage performance, involving a high capacitance of 1.35F/cm2 at a current density of 2 mA/cm2 with outstanding stability of 93.2% during 20,000 charge–discharge cycles. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitors were fabricated with the HNF-CSE as a positive electrode and activated carbon electrode as a negative electrode. The resulting full cell devices yielded a maximum energy density of 0.20 mWh/cm2 and a power density of up to 15 mW/cm2. Thus, we anticipate that the use of a hierarchical flowerlike configuration for supercapacitor may represent one of promising virtues to fulfill practical and high-performance energy-storing devices.
