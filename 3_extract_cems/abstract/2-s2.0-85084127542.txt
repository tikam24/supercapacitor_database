Individual use of Distributed Generators (DGs) is not preferable due to their highly intermittent nature. Hybrid Energy System (HES) overcome this problem. HES in a dc microgrid involves multiple input dc-dc converters of various topologies. Most of the multiple input DC-DC converters inputs (DG's like solar, fuel cell (FC), battery, super capacitor) were connect in parallel, wherein DGs of same voltage rating has to connect in parallel otherwise separate voltage controllers for each DG is necessary. In this research work, DGs has connected in a series manner due to which DGs with different voltage ratings can integrate into the grid using multiple input buck-boost converter. Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) consisting of battery and super capacitor enhances the dynamic stability of DC-DC converter based Microgrids. In order to manage power between load and the demand a centralized fuzzy logic controller and to maintain constant grid voltage, a centralized voltage controller is used.
