Mesoporous carbons (MCs) with high surface area of 1409-1552 m2 g-1 for supercapacitors were prepared from peanut shell by one-step microwave-assisted ZnCl2 activation. The MC made at the ZnCl 2/peanut shell mass ratio of 4 in 20 min at 600 W microwave power (nominated as MC4-M) retains a high specific capacitance of 184 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1 current density after 1000 cycles, showing perfect cycle stability. At 1.6 A g-1 current density, the energy density of the supercapacitor made from MC4-M reaches 4.94 Wh kg-1 at 740 W kg-1, exhibiting excellent rate performance. The findings clearly indicate that the one-step microwave-assisted ZnCl 2 activation technique is a facile approach to the preparation of high performance MCs for supercapacitors.
