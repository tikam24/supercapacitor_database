There are many challenges related to energy storage system (ESS) in electrical applications and one of the major challenges is to balance the energy and power density across the devices to drive electric vehicle at a long run. Basically, Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) is preferred with battery in parallel with supercapacitor to balance the energy and power supply to the electric vehicle motor. In order to prolong the life of the battery, supercapacitor is be used in this work to reduce the burden on the energy density device namely battery to drive the vehicle. Therefore, this work aims to develop the Semi-HESS topology to drive electric vehicle (EV), design and development of energy balance between the sources and DC-DC converter to drive the vehicle. The high-energy density device which is the battery and high-power density namely the supercapacitor is assembled as semi-active topology to control the speed of the electric vehicle motor which is BLDC (Brushless DC) motor of 48V, 3000 rpm to run smoothly. The study is carried out under different modes of operation of the e-bike vehicle motor through energy and power balance using DC-DC converter which regulate the power and the speed as per the requirement. Study is simulated and the results are validated using MATLAB/ Simulink.
