In this work, we have prepared WO3-CdS nanocomposites for supercapacitor electrode by Microwave-Assisted Method. The orthorhombic and monoclinic mixed structure of WO3 and hexagonal structure of CdS was observed by XRD pattern. The FESEM micrograph showed the irregular particle shape and HRTEM images demonstrated the small rod shape morphology with irregularity. The EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of W and Cd elements. From the electrochemical analysis, we have calculated the maximum capacitance as 650 F/g for WO3-CdS (6 wt%) electrode. The long cycle test showed 133% of capacitance retention with 100% Coulombic efficiency.
