In the present paper, graphene has been addressed as active material for supercapacitor electrodes. In particular we describe an environmental-friendly two stages procedure for the preparation of graphene-based electrodes for supercapacitors. In the first step, graphene oxide was synthesized by means of the modified Hummers method and deposited onto a metallic substrate (titanium, stainless steel and nickel wire meshes) by electrophoretic deposition. The second step consisted in a thermal treatment carried out to remove the functional groups from graphene oxide. The electrodes were finally characterized by cyclic voltammetry in order to measure their electrochemical performances in aqueous electrolytes (0.5 M K2SO4, 1M Na 2SO4 and 6M KOH).
