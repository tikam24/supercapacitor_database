This paper proposes a state of charge (SOC) balancing control strategy for the modular multilevel converter (MMC) with integrated supercapacitor energy storage system (ISC-ESS). The equivalent model is derived by analyzing the behavioral characteristics between the SOC of the supercapacitors and ac-side output power. Moreover, the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage fluctuation suppression and energy management control strategy are put forward. The proposed control strategy enables the converter system to suppress SM capacitor voltage fluctuation during SC charging and discharging. A thorough simulation evaluation of the MMC with ISC-ESS has been conducted to validate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed solution.
