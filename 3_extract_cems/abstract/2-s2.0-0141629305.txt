The ruthenium oxide has been formed by a sol-gel process. The active electrode material was obtained by mixing aqueous solution of RuCl 3·xH2O and NH4HCO3. The fine hydrous ruthenium oxide powder with satisfactory electrochemical characteristic was obtained by annealing the powder at 250°C. The crystalline structure and the electrochemical properties of the powder have been studied as a function of the annealing temperature. At lower annealing temperatures, the powder is in an amorphous phase with a lower active surface area and poor electrochemical capacitance. When the ruthenium oxide was annealed at 250°C, the active surface area of the material is improved and the capacitance is calculated to be 570F·g-1. when the annealing temperature exceeded 300°C, the typical crystalline phase was formed, and the specific capacitance dropped rapidly. The resistivity and the faradic impedance of the pellet made from RuO2 powder have also been studied. The lowest resistance was attained when the annealing temperature is 250°C. A capacitor was made with electrodes comprised of ruthenium oxide and 1mol·L-1 KOH electrolyte. It was also found that the addition of carbon nanotubes in ruthenium oxide can improve the power characteristics of electrode materials.
