Supercapacitors are a promising candidate in applications that necessitate high electrochemical stability and storage energy. In this study, NiCo 2O 4 nanosheets were prepared hydrothermally on an ITO substrate and investigated to be utilized as supercapacitor electrodes. The morphology of NiCo 2O 4 nanosheets was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM ) and atomic force microscopy (AFM ). The SEM results showed a 3D-flower-like nanostructure with interconnected nanosheets which was confirmed by the AFM results. However, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results showed that the as-prepared sample has stoichiometry of Nickle(1):Cobalt(2). The electrochemical measurements of the as-prepared NiCo 2O 4 supercapacitor electrode such as cyclic voltammetry (CV ) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD ) studies were done in a two-electrode system with 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M H 2SO 4. CV curves showed quasi-rectangular shape and high electrochemical stability in KOH and H2SO4 electrolyte solutions. In addition, the integral areas of CV curves for both electrolytes are almost identical, indicating efficient charge transfer and ion transport at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS ) curves of KOH and H 2SO 4 electrolyte revealed a significant difference. This difference indicates that, the charge transfer in H 2SO 4 electrolyte is faster than charge transfer in KOH , resulting in a linear behavior of the EIS curve. A fabricated hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (SC ) composed of NiCo 2O 4/ ITO anode and graphite/ITO cathode delivered a specific capacity of around 235F/g in KOH solution and 723F/g in H 2SO 4 electrolyte at 10 mV/s scan rate. The superior electrochemical performances could be attributed to the large surface area that facilitates charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
