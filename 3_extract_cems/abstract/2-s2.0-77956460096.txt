Two approaches-substrate nanostructuring and incorporation of sulfide-were studied with the aim to increase electrochemical capacitance of cobalt (hydro) oxide. A fiber structure of cobalt was deposited electrochemically with the fibers in the order of tens of nanometers in thickness and hundreds of nanometers in length. Cobalt hydroxide film was formed on the nanostructured substrate by anodic polarization in an alkaline solution. The hydroxide formation and its electrochemical capacitance have been studied by cyclic voltammetry in conjunction with the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). An irreversible behavior was typical of the first anodic polarization cycle; it turned gradually to a reversible one during subsequent cycling. EQCM measurements indicated exponential electrode mass growth during the first cycle, with subsequent transition to a quasipassive state. The redox transitions Co(II)→Co(III)→Co(IV), which determine pseudocapacitance, did not cause remarkable electrode mass change. The electrochemical capacitance of the nanofiber sample was found up to five times higher when compared to that formed on conventional cobalt (abraded surface). Specifics of "per 1 g" evaluation of capacitance performance is discussed. Measurements showed that about 10% of the entire hydroxide structure took part in the capacitive process. The capacitance value determined per 1 g of active Co(OH) 2 was in agreement with the limiting value predicted by the Faraday's law (2,421 F g -1 ) sulfide-enhanced system with 18% CoS exhibited up to three times higher capacitance when compared to that of the sulfide-free counterpart. The system shows promise for practical applications due to its low cost and technical simplicity. © Springer-Verlag 2009.
