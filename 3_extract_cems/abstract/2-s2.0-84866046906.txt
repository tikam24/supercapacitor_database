The present paper reveals the formation of cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4 ) thin film on stainless steel substrate by simple chemical route from an alkaline bath containing Co 2+ and Fe 2+ ions. The films are characterised for structural, surface morphological and FT-IR properties. The XRD and FT-IR studies revealed formation of single phase of CoFe 2 O 4 . The formation of nano-flakes-like morphology is observed from scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical behaviour of CoFe 2 O 4 film has been studied using cyclic voltammetry in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of 366 F g -1 is obtained at the scan rate of 5 mV s -1 . Using AC impedance technique equivalent series resistance (ESR) value is found to be 1.1 Ω. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
