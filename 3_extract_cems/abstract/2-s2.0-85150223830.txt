Designing and developing advanced energy storage equipment with excellent energy density, remarkable power density, and outstanding long-cycle performance is an urgent task. Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZIHCs) are considered great potential candidates for energy storage systems due to the features of high power density, stable cycling lifespans, high safety, low cost, and long-term durability, which originate from the combination of the dual advantages of supercapacitors and zinc-ion batteries. Recently, to pursue the long lifespan of ZIHCs, effective progress has been made in the development and application of ZIHC cathode materials based on carbon-based materials. This review takes carbon-based materials as the starting point and discusses the charge storage mechanism of ZIHCs. Moreover, the application of various carbon-based materials is systematically summarized in ZIHCs, including activated carbon (AC), biomass carbon (BC), porous carbon (PC), and heteroatom-doped carbon (HDC). In addition, recent advances in the structural design of electrolytes and Zn anodes and their effects on electrochemical performance are summarized. Ultimately, the current challenges and the potential directions for ZIHCs are presented. This paper intends to provide directions for the further development of high-performance ZIHCs.
