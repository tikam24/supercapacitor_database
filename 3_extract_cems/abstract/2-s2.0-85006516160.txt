The present trend to increase the energy density of electrochemical supercapacitor is to hybrid the electrochemical double layer capacitance electrode materials of carbon with loading or encapsulation of transition metal oxide or conductive polymeric pseudocapacitor materials as the binary or ternary hybrid electrochemical active materials. In this work, we selected polyaniline salt-sulfonated carbon hybrid (PANI-SA•CSA) as a cheaper electrode material for supercapacitor electrode. Sulfonated carbon (CSA) was prepared from hydrothermal carbonization of furaldehyde and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Polyaniline-sulfate salt containing sulfonated carbon was prepared by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline using ammonium persulfate in presence of sulfuric acid and sulfonated carbon via aqueous, emulsion and interfacial polymerization pathways. Formation of hybrid material was confirmed from scanning electron microscopy. Among the hybrid prepared with three different polymerization pathways, hybrid prepared by aqueous polymerization pathway showed better electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of the hybrid prepared via aqueous polymerization was 600 F g−1, which is higher than that of the pristine PANI-SA (350 F g−1) and CSA (30 F g−1). Hybrid material was subjected for 8000 charge-discharge cycles and at 8000 cycles; it showed 88% retention of its original specific capacitance value of 485 F g−1 with coulombic efficiency (97–100%). These results showed that CSA micro spheres prevent the degradation of PANI-SA chains during charge/discharge cycles. Specific capacitance, cycle life, low solution resistance, low charge transfer resistance and high phase angle value of PANI-SA•CSA supercapacitor cell indicates a higher performance supercapacitor system.
