The exploitation of several renewable energy sources is the optimal and promising solution to provide water for agricultural applications mainly irrigation. Generally, these agricultural areas are isolated where access to the grid is difficult and requires a significant investment. This paper presents a Neural Network-based energy management system (ANN-EMS) for a hybrid system consisting of a wind turbine, photovoltaic panels as the primary sources and batteries as secondary source, supercapacitors are used to satisfy the starting current peaks of the motor-pump unit as the batteries are unable to satisfy them. The system has been designed and simulated using Matlab/Simulink environment. The obtained results proved the efficiency of the proposed ANN-EMS algorithm under random weather conditions and load variations.
