In order to solve the problem of large amplitude fluctuations of bus voltage caused by the instability of generator output power in the island DC microgrid, based on the power output characteristics of the 300 kW ocean energy integrated power supply system, a hybrid energy storage system composed of a battery and a super capacitor is adopted, its three topologies are compared and analyzed to select the optimum topology structure for the integrated power supply system, and then its coordinated control strategy is proposed. The system is divided into five working areas by the proposed control strategy according to three threshold values of bus voltage. The energy storage system can automatically identify and switch between the charging and discharging modes, and can avoid the frequent switching of super capacitor and reduce the harmonics in the system caused by the unnecessary switch actions by making the battery as the main output unit. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control strategy are verified by an established experimental platform.
