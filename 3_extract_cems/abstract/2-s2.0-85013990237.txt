This paper presents a design and implementation approach for charging an electric scooter wirelessly. Based on the demands of high performance charging, the presented system contains both battery and super capacitor as a hybrid energy storage system. The super capacitor facilitates filtering and quick charging. This paper proposes an intelligent switching control to manage the energy system and its performance, which can achieve quick and high power charging in a safe requirement. This approach balances the load distribution across the entire energy system and also improves the energy efficiency, which results in a more reliable battery lifetime and safer operation.
