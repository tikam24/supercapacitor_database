Nanocrystalline powder (~20 nm) with the composition of (ZrO2)0.6(In2O3)0.04 is synthesized on the basis of a co-precipitation method. After its consolidation, a dense and porous ceramic matrix for supercapacitor electrodes is obtained. The deposition conditions are determined for thin nanocarbon and MnO2, Co3O4 layers on the porous ceramic or metal matrix. It is shown that the model supercapacitor with composite electrodes based on nickel foam and thin layers of nanocarbon and MnO2 has the highest average specific capacitance.
