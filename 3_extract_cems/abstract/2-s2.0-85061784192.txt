The knowledge of supercapacitors (EDLCs - Electrochemical Double-Layer Capacitors)is based on understanding the electrochemical phenomena inside them and on the behavior of the chemical materials used to obtain the electrodes and the electrolyte. For a better understanding regarding the operation of the superconductor, the present paper focuses on: A. Influence of charge-discharge current on different supercapacitor's parameters such as equivalent series resistance (ESR), loss power and time for charge or discharge the supercapacitor. B. Analysis of series and parallel connections of three 22 F / 2.5 V supercapacitors, considering the theoretical and experimental capacitance calculation, as well as the influence of stabilization time after the charging effect on the capacitance value. The influence of these parameters on the behavior of the supercapacitor can affect the conduction mechanisms that lead to the formation of the Helmholtz double layer [1].
