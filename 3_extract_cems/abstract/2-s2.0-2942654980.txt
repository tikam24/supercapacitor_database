The composite material silica-ruthenium dioxide was prepared through thermolytic oxidation for the film electrodes of supercapacitor, taking RuCl3·xH2O mixed with TEOS as raw material and Ti slide as substrate. The surface morphology of film electrode was observed by SEM, and the capacitive property of that was studied through cyclic voltammetry to analyze how the mixing ratio of TEOS to RuCl3·xH2O and the sintering temperature/time affect the capacitive property. The results show that the film electrode made from the composite material has excellent capacitive property, e.g., the specific capacitance can be up to 137 mF/cm2 if the mixing ratio is 5:2 with sintering temperature/time at 350°C and for 1 h, which means near three orders of magnitude are available to increase greatly the specific capacitance in comparison with the results as shown in reference.
