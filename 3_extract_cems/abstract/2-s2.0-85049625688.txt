Abstract: With the rise of living standards, non-biodegradable waste, especially waste plastics, has caused serious environmental problems. Herein, we prepare nitrogen doped porous carbon nanosheets (N-PCNs) using magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2] sheets, which are modified by Zn and Co bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework nanoparticles as templates and polystyrene (PS) as a carbon precursor. During the high-temperature pyrolysis process, PS pyrolyzes into small organic molecule gases, which can be converted into graphene-like carbon material under the catalyst magnesia (MgO) and Co species. Nitrogen is introduced into the carbon material in situ by the pyrolysis of imidazole ligands, and the evaporation of Zn helps increase the surface area. The obtained N-PCNs with porous structure and large specific surface area can be used as electrode material for supercapacitors, exhibiting excellent capacitance of 149 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, an excellent cycling stability of 97.6% for up to 5000 cycles.
