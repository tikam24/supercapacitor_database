Developing novel materials with rational structures and excellent electrical conductivity is vitally important for energy storage devices. Herein, hollow cobalt molybdenum selenide (Co–Mo–Se) nanosheet arrays are fabricated via a self-sacrificing template method and selenization process, where cobalt-organic framework serves as the template. Benefiting from unique hollow nanoarrays structure, the Co–Mo–Se electrode offers rich electroactive sites, large accessible regions for electrolyte, and short ions diffusion pathways. Additionally, it is observed that the Co–Mo–Se possesses a low charge transfer resistance owing to the intrinsic metallicity. As a result, the Co–Mo–Se electrode exhibits favorable energy storage properties, including high capacity (221.7 mAh g−1), good rate property, and outstanding stability (95% after 8000 cycles). More importantly, the assembled Co–Mo–Se//active carbon (AC) achieves high energy density (44.7 Wh kg−1) and remarkable durability. Notably, two hybrid devices connected in series successfully power an electronic watch for 70 min, demonstrating its practical applicability. These results indicate that the synthesized hollow Co–Mo–Se nanosheet arrays have promising applications as electrode materials for high-performance energy storage devices.
