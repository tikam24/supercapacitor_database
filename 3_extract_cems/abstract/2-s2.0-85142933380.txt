In this study, the real-time increase in pressure of the accumulated gases at the electrode/electrolyte interface serves as a safety criterion for four conductive electrolytes comprising acetonitrile (ACN) and organic salts. They include tetrafluoroborate as an anion and cyclic 1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium (Pyr11+), spiro-(1,1′)-bipyrrolidinium (SBP+), acyclic methyl triethyl ammonium (Et3MeN+) or standard tetraethylammonium (Et4N+) as cations. The main focus lies on the SPBF4/ACN system. While the concentrated Pyr11BF4/ACN exhibits a minimal pressure evolution (≈25 Pa) under ambient conditions at 3.0 V, its electrochemical stability is inferior to SPBF4 at high operating voltage. The electrolytes with acyclic tetrafluoroborate salts (1.0 mol L−1) reveal a 20-fold increase in pressure due to the weak salt-ACN interactions and the subsequent high solvent evaporation. The pressure evolution at the interface of activated carbon/electrolyte in electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLCs) is merely related to the operating voltage and cation nature, viz. Pyr11+ < SBP+ < Et4N+ < Et3MeN+. The fixed specific capacity of 109 F g−1, volumetric capacity of 76 F cm−3, and moderate gas generation (≈190 Pa at 3.0 V, that shifts to ≈400 Pa at 3.4 V) confirm the safe character of the SPBF4/ACN electrolyte for such energy storage devices.
