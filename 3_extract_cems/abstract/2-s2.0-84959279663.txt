A new 2D sandwich-like zeolitic imidazolate framework derived graphene-based N-doped porous carbons (GNPC) were prepared with the in situ growing ZIF-8 on grapheme oxide (GO), which exhibits well electrochemical properties with the present of GO and high nitrogen content. The specific capacitance of GNPC is 144 F g-1 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 0.1Ag-1, which was potential to be used as a supercapacitor electrode. The GNPC as promising nanomaterials will be suitable for practical applications in a range of fields.
