A control strategy for an autonomous induction generator (IG) system synchronization and seamless transfer to an inverter-based microgrid (MG) is presented in the current paper. The IG system control in autonomous mode is performed by a combination between a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and a Dump Load (DL). The MG consists of an MG leading inverter having on its DC side a supercapacitor-based energy storage system, two MG supporting inverters, and local loads. The paper presents the IG control part for the VSI-DL system, as well as the synchronisation algorithm that enables the smooth interconnection with the MG. An analysis of the IG impact on an islanded MG is also provided. Experimental validations accomplished on a complex laboratory test-bench have focused on the dynamic events associated with the IG system connection/disconnection to/from the MG and also on the MG response to a load being turned on and off when the IG operates connected to the MG. The obtained results have shown that the proposed synchronization algorithm ensures a seamless transfer for the IG system from autonomous to MG connected mode and vice-versa. Moreover, when a significant load transient occurs within the MG operation, the IG presence does not alter the MG stability.
