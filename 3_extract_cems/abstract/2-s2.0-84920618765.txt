Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to provide a simple method for the preparation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by pyrolysing sunflower seed hulls and sago and to evaluate the application of such CNTs in supercapacitors. Design/methodology/approach - The CNTs were obtained by pyrolysing sunflower seed hulls and sago at 800°C. The prepared CNTs were studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge and discharge and electrochemical impedance spectra methods. Findings - The CNTs had large surface areas as determined by the methylene blue method and the Brunauer - Emmett - Teller method. And the CNTs that were prepared by pyrolysing the natural sunflower seed hulls (denoted as CNTs-1) and sago (denoted as CNTs-2) had capacitances of 86.9 F/g and 26.7 F/g, respectively. Research limitations/implications - The capacitances of CNTs can be further improved. Practical implications - The exceptional electronic and mechanical properties of CNTs prepared lend the CNTs to diverse applications including electrocatalysts, hydrogen storage, photovoltaic devices actuators, energy storage, field-emitting flat panel displays and composites. Originality/value - Currently, CNTs have not yet been used in the industry at a mass production scale due to high costs associated. The outcomes of the study reported in this article could provide a convenient method in aid of industrialisation of the production of CNTs. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
