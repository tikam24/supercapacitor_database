In this paper, a simple, low-cost and fast microwave technology of growing vertically cross-linked manganese cobalt sulfide (MCS) on Ni foam (NF) is successfully developed for the first time. As a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors and delivers high capacitance of 2084 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate performance (1200 F g−1 at 100 A g−1) and good cycling stability (80.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). In addition, a asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is composed of MCS/NF as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable performance with a specific capacitance of 134.6 F g−1, an energy density of 48 Wh kg−1, and a power density of 11.8 kW kg−1, which is able to light up a light-emitting diode. This work not only provides a green and rapid synthesis method for preparing electrode materials, but also provides an innovative idea.
