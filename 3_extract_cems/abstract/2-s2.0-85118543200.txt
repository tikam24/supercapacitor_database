Designing highly efficient, low-cost hybrid nanostructures with having favorable morphology and excellent conductivity is very promising for electrodes used in electrochemical storage devices. This study shows the synthesis of a new three-dimensional (3D) hybrid structure consisting of lanthanum nickel oxide (LaNiO3) perovskite, graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (RGOH) structures for the new hybrid supercapacitor (SC) application. The 3D hybrid structure, which is a new SC application, draws attention according to the specific capacitance (Cs) result for graphene-based hydrogel structure. For this purpose, while g-C3N4 is selected to plays an important role to increase the electrochemical activity of SC, the LaNiO3 perovskite structure is used to increase the discharge capacity of SC as well as to provide high discharge current and long cycle life. As a result of electrochemical studies, the superior capacitive performance of LaFeO3/g-C3N4@RGOH showed Cs and unique performance of 750.56 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g–1. The 3D structure is used as anode material for fabricating symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor systems. Moreover, the LaFeO3/g-C3N4@RGOH materials display magnificent cyclic stability of 82% for 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g − 1, which claims the new material progress in the energy ﬁeld.
