Metal-organic framework derivatives are potential candidates for supercapacitors electrodes because of their controllable structure and high surface area. In this study, we report, for the first time, the in-situ conversion of NiCe-LDH from Ni-MOF at different synthesis time and its electrochemical activities towards asymmetric supercapacitor. The flower-like NiCe-LDHs provide extra active sites for redox reactions and achieved a maximum specific capacitance of 1500.6 F g-1 for NiCe-LDH/10 electrode as a result of higher surface area and rich redox chemistry. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibited a maximum energy density of 13.86 Wh kg-1 with superior cyclic stability. This work proves the potential of MOF derived LDH materials for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
