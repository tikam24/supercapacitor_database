In this study, a composite structure based on NiCo2O4/CdS was synthesized on nickel foam using hydrothermal and chemical bath deposition (CBD) methods. An ultrathin nanosheet of NiCo2O4 was coated by CdS nanocrystals by varying the CBD reaction time. Synergistic effects arising from the NiCo2O4 nanosheets and CdS nanocrystals were studied for prospective electrochemical energy storage applications. The NiCo2O4/CdS composite electrode with optimized CBD reaction time of CdS coating exhibited a high specific capacity of 331 mAh g−1 at 30 mA, which is higher than pristine NiCo2O4 (260 mAh g−1). In addition, for practical applications, we fabricated an asymmetric cell based on the NiCo2O4/CdS as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode and its electrochemical performance was studied in detail. This work provides a foundation for different metal-oxide- and metal-sulfide-based composite electrodes for energy storage studies.
