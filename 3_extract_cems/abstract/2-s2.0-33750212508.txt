Taking the nano-sized carbon black and aniline monomer as precursor and (NH4)2S2O6 as oxidant, the well coated C/polyaniline(C/PANI) composite materials were prepared by in situ polymerization of the aniline on the surface of well-dispersed nano-sized carbon black for supercapacitor. The microstructure of the C/PANI composite electrode materials were analyzed by SEM. The electrochemical properties of C/PANI and PANI composite electrode were characterized by means of the galvanostatic charge-discharge experiment, cyclic voltammetric measurement and impedance spectroscopy analysis. The results show that by adding the nano-sized carbon black in the process of chemical polymerization of the aniline, the polyaniline can be in situ polymerized and well-coated onto the carbon black particles, which may effectively improve the aggregation of particles and the electrolyte penetration. With PANI electrode, C/PANI electrode shows more desired capacitance characteristics, smaller internal resistance and better cycle performance.
