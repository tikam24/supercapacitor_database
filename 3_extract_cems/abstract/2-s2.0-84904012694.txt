Due to higher specific power density and longer life time, super-capacitors (ultra-capacitors or electric double layer capacitors) are being considered in applications of energy storage systems. This paper presents the model of super-capacitor modules that consist of super-capacitors connected in series and in parallel. It provides the solution to predict the charging and discharging performances of supercapacitor modules. Thus, this paper provides a valuable approach for performance prediction of super-capacitor modules applied to energy storage systems. Â© 2013 IEEE.
