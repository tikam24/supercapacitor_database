In the present article, graphene oxide (GO) sheets and monoclinic copper oxide (CuO) nanocrystals are connected with each other and result in the formation of CuO/rGO nanopellets, and these nanopellets synthesized using coprecipitation method. The nanopellet structured CuO/rGO composite on carbon cloth, which act as current collector exhibits specific capacitance of 188 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and up to 96.3% capacity retention after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. It shows a maximum energy density of 7.32 Wh kg−1 and power density of 53 W kg−1. The glucose sensing characteristics of CuO/rGO nanopellet is investigated on carbon cloth and ITO substrate. It shows glucose sensitivity of 0.805 mA mM−1 cm−2 and 0.2982 mA mM−1 cm−2 for a bundle like structured CuO/rGO composite on carbon cloth and ITO substrate, respectively. Further H2O2 sensing is studied on ITO substrate, which manifests H2O2 sensitivity of 84.39 μA mM−1 cm−2. The results indicate that nanopellet structured CuO/rGO composite could be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor, glucose, and H2O2 sensor.
