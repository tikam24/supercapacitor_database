A rod-like CoV2O6 material was synthesized via ultrasound and subsequent annealing treatment. The as-prepared CoV2O6/CNTs composites exhibited higher capacitance performance than that of pristine CoV2O6. The obtained CoV2O6/CNTs composites exhibited a large specific capacitance of 226.3 F/g at 1 A/g, good rate capability and excellent cyclic stability with 88% retention of its initial value after 9000 cycles. Also, the assembled devices delivered an energy density of 13.8 Wh/kg at a power density of 800 W/kg and a high power density of 8000 W/kg at an energy density of 11.6 Wh/kg. This work may provide a novel strategy to design and fabricate other energy storage materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
