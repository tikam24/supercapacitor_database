In the paper we dicuss the problem of modelling the RC electrical circuit with a low voltage superacapacitor. From many supercapacitor models which are already proposed we consider the simplest one and concentrate on the relation between optimal supercapacitor order and a chosen measure. The measure means a distance between the measured and simulated data. We prove that for considered seven optimality criteria (different distances between two vectors) we get almost the same results (the supercapacitor order). The investigations confirm the well known fact that the supercapacitor order is fractional and is independent of the optimality criterium.
