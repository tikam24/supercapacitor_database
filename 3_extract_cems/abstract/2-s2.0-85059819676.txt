Abstract: The single and multilayered electrode materials having carbon fiber and polyaniline were prepared. The variation of morphological and electrochemical properties of electrode materials was studied in three different electrolytes. The electrode materials were prepared by taking stainless steel as the substrate using the potentiodynamic technique. The electrode materials were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and N 2 adsorption/desorption measurement. The supercapacitor characteristics of these electrode materials were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance, and charge–discharge cycling techniques. It was found that multilayered electrode material resulted in a specific capacitance value of 350 F/g during charge–discharge cycling studies.
