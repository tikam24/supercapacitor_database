Metal oxides possess high theoretical specific capacitance, but their pseudocapacitive properties are restricted by the poor electronic conductivity. Here we present a strategy to synthesize a three-dimensional binder/conducting agent-free nickel oxide (NiO) electrode through the combination of anodization with calcination. The NiO electrode is composed of a 3D conductive nickel network decorated with nanopetal-like NiO arrays. The influence of calcination temperature has been investigated, with respect to the microstructure and pseudocapacitive properties of the NiO electrodes. The NiO electrode demonstrates great electrochemical properties, especially remarkable rate capability (82% retention of the highest value for the 25-fold enhanced current density) and cycling stability (good capacitance retention after 30000 cycles). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor has been assembled using NiO as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode. The NiO//AC supercapacitor presents excellent cycling stability (91.3% retention after 10000 cycles), and could power a mini fan as well as a commercial red LED for more than 270 min. This journal is
