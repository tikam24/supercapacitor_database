Electrochemical energy storage plays a major rule in the current shift to renewable energy sources in the form of batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. This work represents the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes comprised of activated carbon powder (ACP) and graphene oxide (GOx) drop-casted onto graphite substrates. ACP, based on its performance in a beaker cell in aqueous 1M H2SO4, was used as a current collector to enhanced the performance of the GOx electrodes. A graphitic device fabricated with ACP/GOx layered electrodes produced a specific capacitance of 16.5 F/g and energy density of 2.3 Wh/kg at scan rate of 10 mV/s.
