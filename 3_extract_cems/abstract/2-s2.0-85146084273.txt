Electric vehicles (EVs) utilizing hybrid energy sources is a significant step toward a sustainable future in the transportation industry. The electric three-wheeler (3W) considered in the proposed work includes three sourcesâ€”battery, supercapacitor (SC), and photo-voltaic (PV) panels. In battery electric vehicles (BEV), battery life cycle, energy efficiency, and performance are affected by variations in driving conditions that inhibit their wider adoption. The main focus of the proposed intelligent hybrid energy management strategy (IHEMS) is to enable the vehicle to adaptively manage and diminish the effects of load fluctuations due to varying conditions. IHEMS diverts the load fluctuations to the SC bank by ensuring an effective absolute energy sharing among the sources with a fuzzy logic control algorithm. PV energy is utilized to assist the battery during sunny days. Performance of the EMS in hybrid source EV is analyzed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment with a combination of three different standard real-time driving profiles (NYCC, Artemis Urban, WLTP class-1). Proposed EMS reduces peak battery power by 20% and 14.35% and improves battery life by 16.4% and 11.4% compared to BEV and conventional EMS, respectively. This proves that the proposed EMS exhibits adaptive energy management irrespective of the driving conditions and ensures improved battery performance and longevity.
