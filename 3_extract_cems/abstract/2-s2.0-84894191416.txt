Nano MnO2 powder produced by liquid coprecipitation method was absorbed on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which were synthesized by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition, to form MnO2-CNT composite material using ultrasonic mixing method for supercapacitor electrodes. The electrochemical performance of the prepared electrodes was measured by galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test in 0.5 mol/L Na2SO 4 aqueous solution. The results showed that MnO2-CNT composite electrodes presented good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 238.7 F/g, much higher than that of MnO2 electrodes which the specific capacitance only reached about 78.6 F/g, and the equivalent resistance of MnO2-CNT composite electrodes was about 34.8 μ, half less than that of MnO2 electrodes with equivalent resistance of 87.6 μ. © 2013 IEEE.
