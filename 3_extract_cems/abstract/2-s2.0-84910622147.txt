In most applications an energy storage device is required when solar cells are applied for energy harvesting. In this work, we have demonstrated that composite films of a conducting polymer and a dye can be used as photoactive electrodes in an electrochemical cell for concurrent solar energy conversion and charge storage. A device was made of poly ethylenedioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonate and (PEDOT:PSS) and a porphyrin dye which showed a capacitance of âˆ¼1.04 mF. The device was charged up to 430 mV (open circuit voltage) under a solar simulated illumination and was able to store the charge for more than 10 min in the dark. Further study on the concentration of the dye revealed the importance of the ratio between the dye and the conducting polymer to optimize the photovoltage and capacitance of the device. Also, the effect of the dye material was studied by using a Ruthenium (Ru) based dye. The device with the Ru dye showed a photovolatge of 198 mV and charge stability of more than 2 h.
