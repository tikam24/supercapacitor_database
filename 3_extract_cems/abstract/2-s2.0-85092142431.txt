In the paper, the dependences of energy characteristics of charge circuits of supercapacitors (the electrical charge of which is a non-linear function of the voltage at their terminals) from the source of electromotive force, which can be accumulator battery for capacitive electric energy storage, are determined. The research is aimed at improving the energy efficiency of electrical circuits of supercapacitors by changing their initial voltages. Energy-optimal modes of charge of supercapacitors are determined and the influence of its non-zero initial voltages on the energy transfer coefficient is substantiated. The conditions for reducing energy losses in the circuits of supercapacitor charge from the accumulator battery are determined.
