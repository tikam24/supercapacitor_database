The self-discharge phenomenon is an unavoidable response of super-capacitors and batteries if the charge voltage is interrupted; voltage decay measurements during self-discharge can give information about super-capacitors and batteries. Modeling the selfdischarge phenomenon can be very useful for the energy awareness of supercapacitors and batteries. Because no researchers have realized that the real purpose of search self-discharge model should be to be able to use this model to calculate the finial time that the voltage drops to zero of its initial charged voltage, this paper provided novel model to describe the kinetic behavior of self-discharge from revision on logarithmic model. There are only two parameters in this model. The maximum benefit is that the algebraic representation of the computation for finial time by two parameters of this model and initial charged voltage is obtained. Validation is done based on experimentally observed results and the model results, compared with the thirty-two experimentally observed results, the proposed model can effectively describe the variation of voltage with time during self-discharge at high level precision. Another great benefit is that the quantitative relationships between impacts condition which are holding times, containing ppm water and initial charged voltage on finial time of self-discharge are found.
