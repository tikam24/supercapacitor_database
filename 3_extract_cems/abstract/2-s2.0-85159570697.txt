Flexible supercapacitors are an important portable energy storage but suffer from low capacitance, inability to stretch, etc. Therefore, flexible supercapacitors must achieve higher capacitance, energy density, and mechanical robustness to expand the applications. Herein, a hydrogel electrode with excellent mechanical strength was created by simulating the collagen fiber network and proteoglycan in cartilage using silk nanofiber (SNF) network and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The Young's modulus and breaking strength of the hydrogel electrode increased by 205 % and 91 % compared with PVA hydrogel owing to the enhanced effect of the bionic structure, respectively, which are 1.22 MPa and 1.3 MPa. The fracture energy and fatigue threshold reached 1813.5 J/m2 and 1585.2 J/m2, respectively. The SNF network effectively connected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polypyrrole (PPy) in series, affording a capacitance of 13.62 F/cm2 and energy density of 1.2098 mWh/cm2. This capacitance is the highest among currently reported PVA hydrogel capacitors, which can maintain >95.2 % after 3000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles. This capacitance Notably, the cartilage-like structure endowed the supercapacitor with high resilience; thus, the capacitance remained >92.1 % under 150 % deformation and >93.35 % after repeated stretching (3000 times), which was far superior to that of other PVA-based supercapacitors. Overall, this effective bionic strategy can endow supercapacitors with ultrahigh capacitance and effectively ensure the mechanical reliability of flexible supercapacitors, which will help expand the applications of supercapacitors.
