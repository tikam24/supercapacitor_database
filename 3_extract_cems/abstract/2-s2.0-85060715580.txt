This work reports the recovery of manganese ions from spent primary alkaline battery (PAB) cathode, subsequent anodic electro-synthesis of MnO 2 nanoparticles on Ni foam (MnO 2 NPs/Ni foam) for supercapacitors. The as-fabricated MnO 2 NPs/Ni foam is characterized by common optical and surface analytical techniques. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of MnO 2 NPs/Ni foam matches well with γ-MnO 2 NPs pattern and hence the synthesized MnO 2 NPs mainly exist in γ-phase. The synthesized MnO 2 NPs are mostly in spherical cluster shape with an average size of 15 nm, inferred from the scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) result reveals that, synthesized MnO 2 NPs embraces with two different oxidation states such as 4 + (MnO 2 ) and 3 + (MnOOH). The MnO 2 NPs/Ni foam delivers a maximum specific capacity of 549 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s in three electrodes aqueous K 2 SO 4 system. Further, the two electrode asymmetric supercapacitor device is constructed with MnO 2 NPs/Ni foam as a positive and commercial graphene nanoplatelets coated Ni foam (GNP/Ni foam) as a negative electrode. The assembled supercapacitor device yields a maximum specific capacitance of 105 F/g at 5 mV/s, which achieves a maximum energy density of 14.7 Wh/kg at the power density of 748.9 W/kg between 0 and 1.5 V of working potential. This effort may pave the way for recovery and utilization of spent PAB cathode materials for energy storage devices.
