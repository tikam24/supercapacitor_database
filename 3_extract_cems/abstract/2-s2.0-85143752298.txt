Conventional manganese oxide (MnO2)-based supercapacitors struggle to achieve theoretical capacitance due to the material's low conductivity and large particle size. Consequently, researchers have improved MnO2's properties by incorporating conductive carbonaceous materials to obtain high-performance composite materials. Herein, the full process of engineering a MnO2-graphene oxide (GO) composite and its application as a positive electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) is presented. First, GO using a novel gas expansion precursor allowing an efficient chemical exfoliation of pristine graphite is synthesized. Afterward, size-weakened MnO2 nanoparticles are synthesized and deposited onto the GO sheets by a self-assembly redox reaction method using different MnO2/GO mass ratios. Multiple characterization methods are used to investigate the textural and structural properties of each material. A general electrochemical characterization is conducted using a three-electrode cell; therefore, the synthesized MnO2-GO composite achieves 150 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. Furthermore, an ASC in an aqueous electrolyte using GO and MnO2 or MnO2-GO as negative and positive electrodes, respectively, is assembled. The fabricated ASC based on MnO2-GO composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 38 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent cycling stability after 36 000 cycles, and a steady electrochemical impedance behavior after 120 h of floating.
