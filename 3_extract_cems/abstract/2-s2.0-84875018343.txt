NiO nanostructures with three distinct morphologies were fabricated by a sol-gel method and their morphology-dependent supercapacitor properties were exploited. The nanoflower- shaped NiO with a distinctive three-dimensional (3D) network and the highest pore volume shows the best supercapacitor properties. The nanopores in flower-shaped nanostructures, offering advantages in contact with and transport of the electrolyte, allow for 3D nanochannels in NiO structure, providing longer electron pathways. The XPS and EIS data of the NiO nanostructure confirm that the flower-shaped NiO, which has the lowest surface area among the three morphologies, was effectively optimized as a superior electrode and yielded the greatest pseudocapacitance. This study indicates that forming a 3D nanonetwork is a straightforward means of improving the electrochemical properties of a supercapacitor. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
