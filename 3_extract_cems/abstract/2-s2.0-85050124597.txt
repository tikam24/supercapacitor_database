This paper presents a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) for an all-wheel driven electric motorcycle. The HESS combines the standard battery of the vehicle, which only allows for very limited charging currents but has a high energy density, and a supercapacitor module, adding the possibility of high currents and therefore high power, but shows only limited energy storage abilities. For the HESS components, mathematical models have been retrieved from measurements of the battery cells and supercapacitors within a battery cell test rig. Based on this models, a non-linear observer is implemented, which allows to track the HESS states during operation on-board the vehicle. This state estimation is integrated within the real-time optimal control strategy based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC), allowing for an energy efficient operation of the overall system.
