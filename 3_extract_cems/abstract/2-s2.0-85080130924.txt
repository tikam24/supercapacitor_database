Owing to intrinsic structural limitations, it is difficult to control the pore structure of biomass to synthesize hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) to achieve high supercapacitor performance. As an inevitable by-product of the thermochemical conversion of biomass, wood tar exhibits good thermoplasticity and high-carbon content, and can be used as an alternative carbon source for biomass to prepare HPCs. To improve the utilization of wood tar, a facile synthetic route is proposed for preparing HPCs, based on a natural biological template method coupled with KOH activation. The HPCs possess favorable features in terms of high solid-carbon yield, high oxygen content (~9 at%), large specific surface areas (626.43–2489.62 m2 g−1), and an interconnected hierarchical porous structure, which greatly improved wettability and synergistically enable the construction of high-performance supercapacitors in aqueous and organic systems. The optimized HPC electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 338.5 F g−1 in a 6 M KOH electrolyte, and the constructed symmetric supercapacitors deliver high energy densities up to 9.9 Wh kg−1 and 33.87 Wh kg−1 in aqueous and organic electrolytes, respectively. This study provides an effective route for the utilization of wood tar and crab shell waste.
