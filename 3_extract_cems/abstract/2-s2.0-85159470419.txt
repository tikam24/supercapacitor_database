Due to the most important impact of the transportation sector on climate changes, the Li-ion batteries deployed in electric vehicles (EV) are considered as a suitable choice for reducing the toxic gases and save our climate. But, given the driving range limitations and the lifetime degradation of Li-ion batteries, the EVs based only on batteries still unable to be competitive against ICE vehicles. In this way, the integration of hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) represents a trending research topic in EVs domain with the expectation to enhance the battery lifetime. However, the battery/supercapacitor topology requires a real-time energy management strategy that allows to manage the energy flux in the powertrain efficiently while optimizing the lifetime of the battery. This paper proposes a real-time power management control system based on two levels in which the high level is focused on power sharing between the HESS on-boarded in the EV using If-else rules and frequency-decoupling methods while taking into consideration the electrical limitations of each source. On the other hand, the low level is focused on ensuring the good regulation of the DC bus voltage and control of the battery/SC electric currents. The performance of the proposed strategy is validated over Extra Urban Driving Cycle (EUDC) using MATLAB/Simulink. The results obtained show an improvement in the lifetime of Li-ion batteries which validates the efficiency of the proposed framework.
