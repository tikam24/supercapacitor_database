This chapter describes the substantial benefits of composites of biomass-derived carbon and metal oxides for their applications as supercapacitors. The versatile properties of variable valencies of metal oxides have attracted many researchers for their applications in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, these have a limited surface area and weak conductivity, which severely limits ion/electron transfer and shortens battery lifespan.This chapter emphasizes the advantages of composite material obtained by combining metal oxides with biomass-driven carbon to address these issues effectively for supercapacitors. The objective of this chapter is to highlight the advantageous features of biomass-derived carbon and metal oxide composites.
