ZnSnO3/mesoporous carbon composite (PP-ZTO) and porous carbon (PP-C) were synthesized via a simple combustion method at 500 °C for supercapacitor application. Highly porous composite material of 896.39 m2g−1 was achieved in PP-ZTO. Three well-resolved peaks at 27°, 34° and 52° were observed in the x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern can be indexed to ZTO. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) image of PP-ZTO clearly shown the high porous structure along with ZnSnO3 attached on the carbon surface. The composite material exhibited specific capacitance of 94 Fg−1 at the current density of 0.3 Ag−1. In symmetrical cell, cyclic voltammetry (CV) in PP-ZTO still maintained a nearly rectangular shape as compared to the leaf-shape of PP-C explained the contribution of ZTO in enhancing the electrochemical performance. PP-ZTO also performed excellent capacitance retention of ~80% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles with different current densities implying the high durability of the cell. The results indicating that ZTO/carbon as a promising candidate to be applied in supercapacitor.
