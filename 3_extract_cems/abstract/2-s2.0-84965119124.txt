High specific capacitance performance was exhibited by Mn3O4 cubes interlocked with each other. Galvanostatic charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements can elucidate it. And its specific capacitance is 667 Fg-1 at scan rate of 1 mVs-1, 583 Fg-1 at a low current density of 1 Ag-1. When the current density is increased by 40 times, relative high specific capacitance retention (153 Fg-1) was left. These Mn3O4 cubes were made by simple method: dissolution evaporation and then calcination. The excellent specific capacitance suggests that it could be a promising candidate as electrode material for supercapacitors in terms of fast charge-discharge rate, high specific power and long lifespan.
