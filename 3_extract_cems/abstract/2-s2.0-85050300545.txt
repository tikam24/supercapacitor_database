Compared with the conventional vehicles, pure electric vehicles (PEVs) with the advantages of no exhaust and high energy efficiency have attracted enormous attention from government and corporation. In this paper, the effect of super capacitor is discussed for absorbing the braking energy recovery directly. First, through reasonably matching parameters of battery pack and super capacitor, the vehicle model of PEV is established based on the AVL cruise simulation software. Then, the parallel regenerative braking control strategy is proposed, and the related numerical simulations are conducted. The simulation results indicate that, the PEV, which equipped with super capacitor is capable of further improving the efficiency of driving range and braking energy recovery compared with that without super capacitor.
