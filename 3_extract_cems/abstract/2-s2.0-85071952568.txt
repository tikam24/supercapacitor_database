Red carpet has always been prearranged for innovative structured electrode materials in supercapacitors gallery. Cadmium sulphide (CdS) microspheres have been successfully synthesized via affordable and energy budget approach. The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of CdS structures were studied for supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical investigations (CV analysis) suggest that CdS microsphere electrodes exhibit pseudocapacitive behaviour and capable of delivering the specific capacitance of 592 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. From galvanostatic charge/discharge method, a maximum specific capacitance of 854 F g−1 was estimated at a current density of 2 A g−1. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor has been fabricated by utilizing CdS microsphere and activated carbon as electrodes and it could capable of deliver ultrahigh energy density of 8.4 W h kg−1 with a maximum power density of 7.56 kW kg−1 at a constant current density of 20 A g−1. These profitable features of CdS microsphere electrodes prepared in the present study are quite favourable electrode material for next generation supercapacitors.
