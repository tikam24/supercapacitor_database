The introduction of heteroatoms into carbon materials is beneficial for enhancing zinc ion storage capability, and thereby obtaining excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, the N, S co-doped porous carbons (NSPCs) with well-developed pores and massive surface area are synthesized from natural biomass by the synergistic activation strategy of KHCO3 and Na2S2O3. Accordingly, NSPCK achieves high capacitance (262.7 F g−1) and long cycle life (remains 99.3% after 10,000 cycles) in 1 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte for supercapacitor. Impressively, the NSPC cathode presents high discharge capacity of 136.3 mAh g−1 in the voltage window of 0–1.8 V, good rate performance (86.5 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) and high energy density (122.6 W h kg−1) for zinc ion hybrid capacitor (ZHC). Besides, the ZHC delivers long-term life with 0.5% damage after 15,000 cycles. This study may facilitate the design of high-energy and safe electrochemical energy storage devices based on the heteroatom doping carbons and aqueous electrolyte.
