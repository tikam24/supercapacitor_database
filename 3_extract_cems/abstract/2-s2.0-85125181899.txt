Polymers of natural origin, especially cellulose, have risen to the focus of smart materials, and also energy storage materials' research as sustainable matrix alternatives. In this work, novel composites of cellulose with activated carbon aerogel (ACA) and carbide-derived carbon (CDC) are demonstrated. The composites were formulated as fibers from regenerated cellulose (Cell). The electromechanical response as linear actuation in stress and strain of the fibers was studied in an organic electrolyte at low applied potentials in range of 0.55 to −0.8 V. Cyclic voltammetry and square wave potential steps were performed revealing for both composite fibers expansion at positive charging. The Cell-ACA fibers showed a stronger response compared with Cell-CDC, largely due to the particle structure, reflected in higher electronic conductivity. The chronopotentiometric measurements showed that Cell-ACA also had the higher specific capacitance of the two of 47.5 F g−1. The dual-function of Cell-ACA and Cell-CDC of electromechanical activity and energy storage capability can have potential in smart clothing applications.
