A facile strategy, engineered for low-cost mass production, to synthesize biomass-derived activated carbon/reduced graphene oxide composite electrodes (GBPCs) by one-pot carbonization of blotting papers containing graphene oxide (GO) and zinc chloride (ZnCl2) was proposed. Benefitting from the water absorption characteristic of blotting papers in which the voids between the celluloses can easily absorb the GO/ZnCl2 solution, the chemical activation and reduction of GO can synchronously achieve via one-step carbonization process. As a result, the GBPCs deliver a large specific surface area to accumulate charge. Simultaneously, it provides high conductivity for electron transfer. The symmetric supercapacitor assembled with the optimal GBPCs in 6 M KOH electrolyte exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 204 F g-1 (0.2 A g-1), outstanding rate capability of 100 F g-1 (20 A g-1). Meanwhile, it still keeps 90% of the initial specific capacitance over 10,000 cycles. The readily available raw material, effective chemical activation, simple rGO additive, and resulting electrochemical properties hold out the promise of hope to achieve low-cost, green, and large-scale production of practical activated carbon composite materials for high-efficiency energy storage applications.
