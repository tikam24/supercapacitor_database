Bio-inspired beehive-like hierarchical nanoporous carbon (BHNC) with a high specific surface area of 1472 m2 g-1 and a good electronic conductivity of 4.5 S cm-1 is synthesized by carbonizing the industrial waste of bamboo-based by-product. The BHNC sample exhibits remarkable electrochemical performances as a supercapacitor electrode material, such as a high specific capacitance of 301 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, still maintaining a value of 192 F g-1 at 100 A g-1, negligible capacitance loss after 20000 cycles at 1 A g-1, and a high power density of 26000 W kg-1 at an energy density of 6.1 W h kg-1 based on active electrode materials in an aqueous electrolyte system. Moreover, an enhanced power density of 42000 W kg-1 at a high energy density of 43.3 W h kg-1 is obtained in an ionic liquid electrolyte system, which places the BHNC-based supercapacitors in the Ragone chart among the best energy-power synergetic outputting properties ever reported for carbon-based supercapacitors.
