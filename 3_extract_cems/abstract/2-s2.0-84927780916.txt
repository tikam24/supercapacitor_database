Carbon aerogel spheres were activated by zinc chloride (ZnCl2), and the activated products were made into the electrodes of supercapacitor. The pore structure of carbon aerogel spheres was investigated by SEM and N2 adsorption. The electrochemical properties were tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), AC impedance and constant current charge/discharge methods. The experimental results showed that the pore structure of carbon aerogel spheres was improved after ZnCl2 activation, then the surface area and porosity were increased through the increasing of micropore surface area and volume. Consequently the capacitance properties of the prepared electrodes were enhanced, the resistance decreased and the capacitance were increased twice.
