Graphene was synthesized by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in DMF (N,N-Dimethylformamide) organic solvent. The synthesized graphene was characterized by TEM, SEM, UV-Visible and Raman spectrum. Graphene based paper electrodes were prepared by brush coating technique on A4 size paper. Four different gel electrolytes PVA/H2SO4, PVA/KNO3, PVA/KCL, PVA/KOH were used for making flexible supercapacitors and their characterization was done using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge / discharge (CD) curves. It was observed that PVA/KOH gel electrolyte exhibited maximum specific (Areal) capacitance of 30 Î¼F/cm2 which is greater than capacitance obtained from PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte.
