Bi-based electrode materials with a low redox potential of Bi3+/Bi and high theoretical specific capacity have attracted great attention in alkali metal ion batteries, aqueous batteries, hybrid capacitors, and others. In this review, we overview the structures and detailed synthesis strategies of the Bi-based active materials, and also summarize the theoretical analysis of reaction mechanism and the way to improve electrochemical performance in detail. In addition, the major challenges and perspectives of Bi-based electrode materials are also pointed out, and offer a guideline for other Bi-based electrodes in the future.
