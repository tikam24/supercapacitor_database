To overcome problem of energy crises, and water pollution, multifunctional nanoflower-like FeCo2O4 is synthesized for energy storage and photocatalysis applications. The nanoflower-like FeCo2O4 possesses charge transportation ability. The nanoflower-like morphology of FeCo2O4 is designed by simple hydrothermal synthesis with use of probe sonicator. The systematic analysis is performed for verify relevance of surface characteristics with electrochemical and photocatalytic properties of FeCo2O4 electrode. FeCo2O4 exhibits hierarchical flower-like nanostructure with high surface area and appropriate pore volume, which increases specific capacitance (Cs) up to 1230 F gâˆ’1 with stability up to 5000 cycles. Degradation efficiency of crystal violet using FeCo2O4 photocatalyst is reached up to 94.19% under sunlight irradiation for 160 min.
