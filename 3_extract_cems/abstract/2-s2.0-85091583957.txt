Neural interfaces are the fundamental tools to understand the brain and cure many nervous-system diseases. For proper interfacing, seamless integration, efficient and safe digital-to-biological signal transduction, and long operational lifetime are required. Here, we devised a wireless optoelectronic pseudocapacitor converting the optical energy to safe capacitive currents by dissociating the photogenerated excitons in the photovoltaic unit and effectively routing the holes to the supercapacitor electrode and the pseudocapacitive electrode-electrolyte interfacial layer of PEDOT:PSS for reversible faradic reactions. The biointerface showed high peak capacitive currents of ∼3 mA·cm-2 with total charge injection of ∼1 μC·cm-2 at responsivity of 30 mA·W-1, generating high photovoltages over 400 mV for the main eye photoreception colors of blue, green, and red. Moreover, modification of PEDOT:PSS controls the charging/discharging phases leading to rapid capacitive photoresponse of 50 μs and effective membrane depolarization at the single-cell level. The neural interface has a device lifetime of over 1.5 years in the aqueous environment and showed stability without significant performance decrease after sterilization steps. Our results demonstrate that adopting the pseudocapacitance phenomenon on organic photovoltaics paves an ultraefficient, safe, and robust way toward communicating with biological systems.
