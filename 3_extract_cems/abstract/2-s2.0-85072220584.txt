A novel Mn(II)-porphyrins polycondensation polymer (THPP-PA-Mn) was first synthesized via esterification of meso-tetra(p-hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP) with phthalic anhydride (PA) and then metallizing with manganese acetate. Next, the THPP-PA-Mn was coated on Ni foam and applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that THPP-PA-Mn exhibited a good reversible redox property since the Mn(II)-porphyrins moieties in polycondensation polymer have electron conjugated bonds. According to calculating from discharge curve at current density 2.5 A g−1, the specific capacitance of the THPP-PA-Mn was as high as 90.9 F g−1. Through 3000 cyclic voltammetry tests, the capacitance decay of THPP-PA-Mn/Ni was about 13.7%, which indicated that it had a long cycle life. Finally, THPP-PA-Mn could also be used to assemble a simple solid-state supercapacitor with good performance. In a word, THPP-PA-Mn with a good reversible redox property was reported as a promising electrode material for efficient pseudo-capacitors for the first time.
