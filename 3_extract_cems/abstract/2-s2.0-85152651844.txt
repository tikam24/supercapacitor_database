Storage systems are playing an increasingly important role in a wide range of applications, including electric vehicles. Supercapacitors (SCs) are making strides in this unique situation due to their high-power density, excellent performance, and long support-free lifetime. The SCs were classified, their key features were summarized, and their electrochemical properties were identified using electrical execution. The coordination of a battery and a supercapacitor can provide significant benefits in the power management of an electric vehicle (EV), in terms of both high energy storage capacity and the ability to manage rapid load variations. A comparison of three different hybrid energy storage system topologies is performed. The advantages and disadvantages of a supercapacitor and a battery were discussed and compared. A comparison of different types of isolated and non-isolated bidirectional DC/DC converters was made, as well as the properties of special electric motors such as performance analysis, power density, torque ripple, noise, and efficiency in relation to their applicability in electric vehicles.
