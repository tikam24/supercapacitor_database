High conductivity nanocomposites of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)/polyaniline (PANI) were prepared via direct intercalation of aniline monomer and doped with dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA). The intercalated interaction between PANI and MoS2improves the conductivity and thermal stability of MoS2/PANI nanocomposites with the increasing fraction of MoS2. The conductivity and maximum weight loss velocity temperature of PANI/MoS2-38 sample are 2.38 S cm-1and 353 Â°C, respectively. This architecture is also advantageous for enhancing the capacitance properties and cyclic stabilities of MoS2/PANI electrodes. In comparison to the specific capacitance of 131 F/g and 42% retained capacitance over 600 cycles of PANI electrode, the MoS2/PANI-38 electrode provides a specific capacitance up to 390 F/g and 86% retained capacitance over 1000 cycles. Thus it provides an improved capacitance method which synergistically combines pseudocapacitance and double-layer capacitance for supercapacitor electrodes.
