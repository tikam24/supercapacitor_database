Electric vehicles (EVs) usually face many challenges such as long charging time, frequent discharging, and battery life deterioration. These can be addressed by introducing the capability of wireless power transfer (WPT) to the unit that can store the regenerative braking energy. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) model is shown in this research, consisting of a battery and supercapacitor combination, connected through a bi-directional converter. This topology includes three systems connected to the dc-link, namely, BLDC motor drive system, the HESS, and the WPT system where the WPT system supplies power to the system throughout the drive cycle. Battery has limited power density whereas supercapacitors have limited energy density, hence a combination of both the storage units enables us to have an optimized storage system. Apart from that, a supercapacitor also contributes to battery life extension by redirecting the frequent charging and discharging phenomena. The proposed configuration is simulated in MATLAB environment and practically verified by using a BLDC motor. The proposed topology suits low voltage EVs to run in stop-and- go traffic situation or hilly areas. Regenerative braking of BLDC motor allows it to run as a generator for a while allowing the generated power to boost and store back into battery/supercapacitor. This paper proposes a simultaneous wireless charging method to allow the vehicle to charge while in motion. This research is potentially a future prospective of the developing technology in terms of EVs.
