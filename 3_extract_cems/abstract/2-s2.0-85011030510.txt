In electric vehicles, supercapacitors (SC) are commonly used to perform a hybrid energy storage system (H-ESS). This approach, correctly coordinated and designed, can extend battery lifetime by limiting the battery current stress. SC are often coupled to DC/DC converters. To use the maximum energy stored in SC, high variability of the SC voltage is mandatory. Several time, the associated converter voltage ratio becomes too high and can produce instability of the system. Thus, at each time there is a minimal value for the SC voltage. This article proposes a dynamical limitation method for the SC voltage. The dynamic method is compared with a traditional constant limitation technique. Both are tested under the urban part of New European Driving Cycle with slope. The results point out that the dynamical limitation can ensure a better stability of the system regardless environment disturbance.
