The present work describes the preparation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide-doped Fe3O4 nanocomposites and reduced graphene oxide-cobalt double-doped Fe3O4 nanocomposites via a facile co-precipitation technique. The incorporation of reduced graphene oxide and cobalt play a crucial role in the tuning of structural, optical and morphological parameters of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The supercapacitor performance of the prepared materials is investigated in symmetric two-electrode configuration. The symmetric supercapacitor device fabricated using Fe3O4 nanoparticles, G/F-NCs, and G/Co/F-NCs-based electrodes exhibit specific capacitance values of 94, 168, and 184 F/g at 1 Agâˆ’1. Further, the efficiency of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, reduced graphene oxide-doped Fe3O4 nanocomposites, and reduced graphene oxide-cobalt double doped Fe3O4 nanocomposites as photocatalysts are studied on methylene blue dye. The study reveals that reduced graphene oxide-cobalt double doped Fe3O4 nanocomposites exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity due to their enlarged active sites for the adsorption of MB molecules.
