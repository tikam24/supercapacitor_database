MXenes are realized as an innovative family of two-dimensional (2D) structured materials resembling the structure like graphene and molybdenum disulfide. The extensive research has been explored in this novel family of MXene materials from the discovery of Ti3C2 in 2011. Around 20 variants of MXenes have been synthesized, and the structural properties of more than dozens of MXene materials have been theoretically predicted. Unlike other 2D ceramics, MXenes have excellent electrical conductivity and exceptional efficiency since they are molecular sheets composed of carbide and transition nitride metals such as titanium. MXenes are formed by etching a coating from MAX phases and adding the suffix “ene” to highlight their resemblance to graphene. MAX phases are a family of hexagonal faceted ternary transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides composed of Mn+1AXn, where M represents for transition metals (such as Cr, Nb, Ti, V), A indicates group of A elements (such as In, Al, Si, Sn), X means carbon and/or nitrogen, and n=1, 2, or 3. MXenes have already established numerous applications such as energy storage, modular electronics, optoelectronics, medicine, and nano-biosensors. In this review article, the synthesis technique, configuration, and electronic properties of MXenes are emphasized and extensively discussed. MXenes and MXene-based nanocomposites for electrical energy storage applications are mainly highlighted and outlined. Finally, MXene-based hybrid supercapacitors as next-generation energy storage devices are summarized and briefly discussed.
