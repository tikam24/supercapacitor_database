This work presents a new contribution on energy management of hybrid electric systems for vehicle applications. The studied hybrid electrical vehicle is composed of fuel cell as a main source and the auxiliary system containing the battery and supercapacitor. A programmable load is used to emulate a vehicle load profile. Two methods are combined to smartly and optimally control the energy flow between the used sources. These methods are the Interconnection and Damping Assignment Passivity Based Control (IDA-PBC) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman (HJB) optimization. The source limitation is considered here in terms of the battery state of charge. The experimental works validate the efficiency of the proposed control where the obtained results demonstrate that the used strategy allows regulating the power flow under a realistic load drive profile. The global stability proof is demonstrated using Lyapunov theory.
