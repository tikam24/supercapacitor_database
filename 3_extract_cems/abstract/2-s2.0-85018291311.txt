In this paper, we demonstrate the effects of growing temperature of ZnMn2O4 on structural and electrochemical performance. ZnMn2O4 nanostructured materials were prepared at different temperatures from 140 to 200 °C by hydrothermal method. The synthesized ZnMn2O4 samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectroscope (EDS), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area. The electrochemical performances of ZnMn2O4 grown on various substrates were investigated in details. The results show that the synthesized ZnMn2O4 samples grown on FTO (A SnO2:F thin film deposited on transparent glass) and nickel foam at 140 °C with nanospheres structure, high specific surface area, and mesoporous structure exhibit excellent supercapacitor performance.
