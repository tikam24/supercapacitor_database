A supercapacitor with promising features has been developed by modifying glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with electron beam irradiated ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and oxidized MWCNTs (MWCNTsOX). ZnO NPs of spherical shape was synthesized by sonochemical method. Various quantities of oxidized MWCNTs have been added to improve the specific capacitance of ZnO NPs modified GCE. 1:5 ratio of ZnO NPs and oxidized MWCNTs provides the maximum specific capacitance. The proposed method of electrode fabrication enables us to get the desired specific capacitance values by carefully controlling the ratios of ZnO NPs and oxidized MWCNTs. Surface morphologies of the electrodes have been analyzed by SEM and found that electrode surfaces are uniformly coated with ZnO NPs and oxidized MWCNTs. A specific capacitance of 372 Fg-1 was obtained for present electrode which is highest among similar electrodes. Synergetic effect of irradiated ZnO NPs and oxidized MWCNTs is responsible for unusual enhancement in capacitance. The proposed electrode is found to be easy to prepare, environmentally benign, stable and economic.
