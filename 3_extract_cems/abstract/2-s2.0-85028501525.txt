The results of a studying of autonomous hoppers of electricity based on batteries and supercapacitors are presented. Characteristics of different variants of equivalent circuits of electric power hopper devices were studied by modeling. The optimal operating modes of hybrid electric hoppers were established, as well as the identified parameters of the circuit elements such drives, in which the greatest work efficiency is achieved.
