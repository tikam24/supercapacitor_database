This work presents low-cost production of carbon from KOH activation and carbonization of expanded graphite (EG) and Pinecone biomass (PC). A specific surface area (SSA) of 808 m2 g-1 and 457 m2 g-1 were measured for pinecone-based activated carbon (PAC) and activated expanded graphite (AEG) samples, respectively. The electrochemical characterization of the carbon materials as electrodes in asymmetric 2-electrode device exhibited a high specific capacitance of 277 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 with an energy density of 24.6 Wh kg-1 for a corresponding power density of 400 W kg-1. This asymmetric supercapacitor also demonstrated excellent stability after floating for 110 h in gel polymer electrolyte. These results suggest that asymmetric device based on different carbon materials has great potential for improved performance in energy storage applications.
