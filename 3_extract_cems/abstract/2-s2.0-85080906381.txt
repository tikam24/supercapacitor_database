In this paper, a Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT) scooter system with ultra-capacitor (EDLC; electric double layer capacitor) is described. Proposed a new electric scooter system is highly efficient, easy to use and environmentally friendly. The problem of the Dynamic WPT scooter system is the charging/discharging life cycle of the scooter battery. In general, Li-ion battery used for electric mobility have a charging/discharging life cycle of only 4000 times. Therefore, the proposed Dynamic WPT system uses ultra-capacitor as the power source of the electric motorcycle, which has a much longer life as compared with the conventional batteries. We designed a power transmitter unit using Double D coil and current-controlled single-ended push-pull (SEPP) inverter. Experimental results of prototype evaluation are discussed.
