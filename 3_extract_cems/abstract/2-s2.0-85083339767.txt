Increasing renewable energy penetration into integrated energy storage systems (ESS) requires more efficient methods to store the energy in an effective way. Possibly various energy storage system (ESS) technologies faces various problems such as charging and discharging, reliability, economy, compactness, and safety. This paper audits the diverse sorts of ESS innovations, structures, features, and classifications. Also gives the clear idea about applications, advantages, and limitations of all technologies in grid and transportation system. It also provides a general review of performance capabilities of Li-ion battery and also other advanced ESS for small satellite applications. A hybrid ESS which consists of a battery and a supercapacitor is used in pure electric vehicles.
