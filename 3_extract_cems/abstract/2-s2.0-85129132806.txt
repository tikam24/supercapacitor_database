Perovskite-type oxides are well-known as promising electrode materials toward supercapacitors. We report an electrospinning-chemistry strategy to continuously fabricate perovskite oxide fabric with ribbon morphology. Interestingly, the perovskite oxide fabric exhibits good self-supporting property. Benefiting from the continuous fibrous network structure and large specific surface area (37.2 m2 g−1), the electrolyte ions diffusion in perovskite oxide fabric electrode is rapid, resulting in high mass capacitance of 862F g−1 at 1 A g−1. This work offers an effective electrospinning-chemistry strategy towards perovskite oxide-based fiber electrodes, greatly important for the development of wearable electronics.
