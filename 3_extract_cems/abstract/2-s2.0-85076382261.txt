This paper introduces a power management of a single DC source cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI) with hybrid system based on proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) with Supercapacitor sources used in renewable application. The proposed control technique allows a power management in the converter to obtain stable desired seven levels voltages using only one PEM fuel cell in each phase of the inverter, leading to high performances voltages and currents with reduced number of the isolated DC sources, DC-DC converters and PEM fuel cells. The proposed hybrid control regulates the DC link voltages of PEMFC also for supercapacitors connected of a CMI. The carried out simulations results are explain and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control, and its attractiveness for renewable energy based automotive applications.
