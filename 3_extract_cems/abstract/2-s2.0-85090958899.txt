Hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) are highly in demand as electrode materials for efficient supercapacitors. Herein, a modified template carbonization approach in conjunction with chemical activation is described for synthesis of HPCs by direct one-pot pyrolysis of a mixture of glucose (G), reactive template precursor (Zn2(OH)2CO3)(BZC), and K2CO3 (PC) in which in situ ZnO produced from decomposition of Zn2(OH)2CO3 acts as template and K2CO3 as activator, followed by simple acid-leaching. The resultant undoped carbon [HPC(G-BZC-PC)] is endowed with coral reef-like morphology, 3D porous networks, numerous micro/mesopores, ultrahigh surface area, and goodelectrical conductivity. The specific capacitance delivered by a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor with the HPC(G-BZC-PC) achieves 241.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is superior to that of the two control samples prepared without addition of BZC and PC, respectively. Furthermore, the rate capability reaches as high as to 90.5% and 74.6% with current density from 1 to 10 A g−1 and 50 A g−1, respectively, and an excellent cycling stability is observed with more than 98% of retention after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 6 m KOH. It is concluded that a cooperative effect deriving from the above-mentioned unique features contributes to the enhanced supercapacitor performance.
