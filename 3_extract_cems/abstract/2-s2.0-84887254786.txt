A series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on isonicotinic acid and nickel nitrate were successfully synthesized by a solvothermal method as electrode materials for supercapacitor. The MOF were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms. Electrochemical properties of the materials were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 6 M KOH aqueous solutions. The effect of solvothermal time, temperature and the mol ratio of isonicotinic acid and nickel nitrate on the electrochemical performance were also studied. The maximum specific capacitance is found to be 634 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and the stable cycling properties measurement showed the sample kept 84% after 2000 cycles at a 50 mV s-1 scan rate.
