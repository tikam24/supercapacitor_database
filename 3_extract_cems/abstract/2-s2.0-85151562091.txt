A Renewable energy generation is quickly expanding in the electricity sector. It is true that any new technology has a cost issue at first, but as our minds evolve, we will be able to manage it. It is great need for that source of energy which is economical, high efficiency, commercially available and are less harmful to environment due to use of its. Fuel cells have capacity to replace existing conventional source of energy. The paper provides a detailed overview of FC's, with a focus on the current state of development of various technologies, operational characteristics comparisons and the current techno-economic hurdles to their advancement and future prospects. Without a regulating mechanism, managing large-scale fuel cell-based power systems is problematic. In this paper, thermal, water management and different types of power electronics convertor are extensively discussed, with focus on control strategies to work fuel cell efficiently and effectively.
