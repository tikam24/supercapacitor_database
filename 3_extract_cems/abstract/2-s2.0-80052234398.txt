Polyaniline nanopaticles for supercapacitor were prepared by using polystyrene microsphere as carrier. They were characterized by FTIR, SEM and TGA for structure and electrochemical station for supercapacitive performance. The results show that, the polystyrene-polyaniline composite, about 4∼5 μm, keep the microsphere structure of polystyrene, and was covered on its surface with polyaniline nanoparticle of about 50 nm. The composite shows excellent supercapacitive performance. Increasing the fraction of PANI/PS-PANI (w) result in an increase of capacitance of PS-PANI composite, and a maximum specific capacitance was 275 F/g, and capacitance of polyaniline first increased, then decreased. When w was 0.44, capacitance was a maximum capacitance of 498 F/g. © 2011 IEEE.
