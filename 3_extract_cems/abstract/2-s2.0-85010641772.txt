The aligned mesoporous nanoneedle arrays of MnCo2O4.5(MNA-MnCo2O4.5) are synthesized on Ni foam by using a calcination-process assisted hydrothermal method. Each MnCo2O4.5nanoneedle features abundant mesopores on the surface. The as-fabricated unique MNA-MnCo2O4.5exhibits the prominent electrochemical performances as evidenced by the high specific capacity of 517.9 C g−1at 3.6 A g−1, and 98.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at a current density of 7.2 A g−1. An asymmetric MNA-MnCo2O4.5//active carbon supercapacitor is further fabricated to explore the merits of MNA-MnCo2O4.5electrode, which manifests i) an energy storage density of 40.5 Wh kg−1at 376 W kg−1, ii) a power density of 3.06 kW kg−1at 19.3 Wh kg−1and iii) an outstanding long-term cycle stability with 7.3% capacity loss after 5000 cycles. These results indicate that the synthesized MNA-MnCo2O4.5is promising towards the practical application as high-performance supercapacitor electrode in future.
