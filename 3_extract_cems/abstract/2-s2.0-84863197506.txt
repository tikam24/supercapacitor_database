Sn nanoparticle decorated graphene (Sn-Gr) materials were prepared by adding tin powder to the reaction of graphite oxide during thermal reduction. In this reaction, Sn nanoparticles were directly grown on the surface of graphene sheets. The Sn nanoparticles were distributed on the surface of Gr sheets uniformly, in which Sn nanoparticles act as a spacer to effectively separate graphene sheets. Sn-Gr electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance of ∼320 F g -1 at scan rate of 10 mV s -1 in 2 M KNO 3 aqueous solution. The high specific capacitance and charge/discharge rates offered by such hybrid structures make them promising candidates as electrodes in supercapacitors with both high energy and power density. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
