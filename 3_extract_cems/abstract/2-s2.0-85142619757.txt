The adverse environmental impact due to traditional energy production using fossil fuels calls for extensive research for sustainable and clean energy sources, coupled with cost-effective and efficient energy storage systems. The use of locally available natural materials such as kapok fiber for energy storage furthers the advantages of using renewable energy. Kapok fiber paper (KFP) was successfully integrated with polyaniline (PANI) and carbon black (CB) using different dipping methods to determine which combination will result in a successful synergistic connection of the active materials. The addition of high amounts of CB in the aniline solution during the layer-by-layer deposition of PANI generally resulted in the improvement of the electrochemical properties of the paper electrode. KFP with PANI incorporated with 3 mg of CB per 1 mL of aniline (KFP-PANI/3CB), produced an electrode with an areal capacitance of 183.75 mF/cm2 at 2 mVs-1, conductivity of 0.03984 S cm-1, and electrochemical active surface area of 46.55 cm2.
