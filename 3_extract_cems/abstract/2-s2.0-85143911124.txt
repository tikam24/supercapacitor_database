This paper presents an Improved Bidirectional Hybrid Switched Capacitor DC-DC Converter (I-BHSC). By using switched inductive or capacitive cells, hybrid converters achieve better overall performances: wider voltage conversion ratio, smaller passive components, and lower switching devices stress. Most wide ratio converters have a square wave voltage between the two inputs which alternates with the switching frequency, having a negative impact on EMI. To eliminate this disadvantage and achieve DC voltage between the inputs, the I-BHSC employs split inductors, without inducing detriments in performance. To simplify the manufacturing process, and to reduce parasitic component influences in the switching circuit, the topology is built using conventional half-bridge circuits.
