Low-temperature characteristics of hybrid energy storage system(HESS) and its topological structures are studied. In order to better utilize the high power density of ultra-capacitors, a logic threshold control strategy(LTCS) for HESS used in electric vehicles is proposed. The optimal control strategy can be obtained by using pseudospectral method, and it can be set as an evaluation criteria to evaluate the LTCS. Thus, an optimal LTCS is proposed. In comparison with the simulation results of LTCS, the optimal LTCS can help to make ultra-capacitors better exert the performance of high specific power and significantly reduce the energy loss of battery.
