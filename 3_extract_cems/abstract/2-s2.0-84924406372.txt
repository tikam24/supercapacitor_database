A binder-free composite electrode comprised of nano-WO3Â·H2O/MnO2 (NWMO) has been synthesized through an anodic deposition technique for supercapacitor application. The composite electrode consists of numerous NWMO nanosheets and shows a porous morphology. Electrochemical tests reveal that the as-prepared NWMO has a high specific capacitance (363 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1) and good rate capability (210.3 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), which can be attributed to its unique structure. The capacitance retention still remains 93.8% after 5000 cycles at a relatively high current density of 2 A g-1. These results indicate that NWMO may have great potential as supercapacitor electrode material.
