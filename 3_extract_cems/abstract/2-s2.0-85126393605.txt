With the electrification of underground coal mines, electric explosion-proof rubber-Tyred vehicles will gradually replace high-polluting explosion-proof diesel rubber-Tyred vehicles, but explosion-proof electric rubber-Tyred vehicles have problems such as short cruising range and poor power performance. Based on this, this paper proposes a pure electric explosion-proof rubber-Tyred vehicle with a composite power supply. First, the vehicle power system and control system are calculated and analyzed, and then based on the vehicle power demand and system control strategy, the dynamic elite controlled NSGA-II algorithm is used to optimize the composite power parameters. After optimization, the vehicle economy and mileage have been significantly improved. Finally, an industrial test in the coal mine was carried out to verify the vehicle's dynamic performance and actual cruising range.
