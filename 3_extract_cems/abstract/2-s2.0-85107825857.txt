The combination of polyoxometalate (POM) and metal-organic framework (MOF) composite materials (POMOFs) is desirable, due to their applications in efficient supercapacitors and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, but it is still challenging. Herein, we successfully synthesized {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 through a one-step solution method. Synergy between {Cu2SiW12O40} and HKUST-1 can promote mass/charge transfer and the adsorption/desorption of intermediates on {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1. In a three-electrode system, {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 as the electrode material has a specific capacitance of 5096.5 F g−1when the current density is 1 A g−1. After 6000 cycles, the retention rate is 92%, which is much higher than values reported in the literature. A symmetrical electrode assembled with foamed nickel as the current collector has a power density of 510.81 W kg−1and an energy density of 15.31 W h kg−1, in a 1.0 V voltage window. At the same time, the electrode material in 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution, when the scanning speed is 5 mV s−1, exhibits an overpotential for the electrocatalytic water oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of 340 mV (withoutiRcompensation). Especially at high current densities, {Cu2SiW12O40}@HKUST-1 shows better performance than commercial RuO2. Further, it has excellent catalytic durability. This work provides a basis for the further application of POMOFs.
