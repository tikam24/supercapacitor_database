A novel ternary polyaniline-acetylene black-cobalt ferrite hybrid system was synthesized and confirmed by XRD, FTIR, UV, SEM, EDS analysis. Ternary composite electrode (PACOF) and the corresponding symmetric supercapacitor had high specific capacitance of 747.64 and 282.35 F/g, respectively at 1 mA. The ternary electrode based symmetric system had 39.218 Wh/kg and 3042.77 W/kg of specific energy and specific power, respectively. The ternary system has the least charge transfer resistance value of 2.3 Î©. Ternary hybrid system has the highest specific capacitance retention (81%) after 6000 cycles. The superior performance of ternary composite was due to the synergistic effects between individual components.
