A flexible fiber supercapacitor (SC) was fabricated by using porous carbon as the electrode material and polyvinylalcohol-H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> as the gel-polymer electrolyte. The porous carbon was derived from dead Ficus religiosa leaves through a single-step carbonization method and characterized by using BET surface area and TEM analysis as well as XRD, Raman, and FTIR techniques. The fabricated fiber SC works up to 0.8V and delivers a gravimetric (length) capacitance of 3.4Fg<sup>-1</sup> (4.2mFcm<sup>-1</sup>) at 1mA. In addition, it exhibits a maximum gravimetric (length) energy density of 311mWhkg<sup>-1</sup> (37.3×10<sup>-8</sup>Whcm<sup>-1</sup>) at a power density of 58Wkg<sup>-1</sup> (70.3μWcm<sup>-1</sup>) with a capacitance retention of 88% over 4000cycles.
