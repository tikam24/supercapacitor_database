Flexible piezoelectric self-charging supercapacitors (PSCS) are capable of converting random mechanical energy directly into electric energy and providing sustainable power source for various wearable electronic devices. In this work, using PDMS-rGO/C hybrid membrane as the positive and negative electrodes, P(VDF-TrFE) film as the piezoseparator, a flexible and ultralight PSCS was developed to harvest the mechanical energy of human finger curvature and simultaneously store as chemical energy in supercapacitors. The PSCS can be efficiently charged from finger deformation in the presence of polarized P(VDF-TrFE) separator film. When the finger was bended to 90°, the fabricated PSCS achieved a potential window of 0.45 V with the discharging time of about 18.0 s, and a stable charging current of 6.4 μA, providing a promising power solution to the next-generation self-powered wearable electronics system.
