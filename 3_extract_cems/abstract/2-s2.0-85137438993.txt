A hybrid material, Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) characterize a kind of new and specialized sort of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with imidazole linkers and metal ions with standard aluminosilicate zeolite structure. Their intrinsic pore size, robust functions and high-quality thermal and chemical stability have ended in a huge range of capabilities for diverse ZIF substances. In this promptly increasing area, over the past few years, energetic research activities have emerged from package approaches to potential applications. Herein, a simple method for the preparation of Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) nanocrystals (NCs) has been synthesized by a simple one-step chemical method with starting material such as 2-methylimidazole and Zinc nitrate hexahydrate in methanol solution. Structural, functional, surface morphological and electrochemical performances have been systematically investigated by various analytical techniques. Electrochemical test results show its specific capacitance up to 111.23 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. In particular, the compound exhibits good cyclic stability with 85.36% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at a given current density of 3 A g−1.
