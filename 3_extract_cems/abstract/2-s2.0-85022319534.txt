A flower-like C@Ni0.7Co0.3(OH)2 is designed and synthesized via a novel and facile step-by-step hydrothermal method using glucose as carbon source. The distinct structural designs of the hydroxides significantly enhance the electrochemical performances of the electrode, the amorphous nature of the NiCo(OH)2 facilitates the diffusion and reaction of electrolyte ions and the carbon powder prevents the structure collapse of Ni0.7Co0.3(OH)2 as well corrosion of electrode material by electrolyte during charge-discharge process. In the beneficial of these advantages the nano composites of C@Ni0.7Co0.3(OH)2-2 (the molar ratio of C:Ni:Co is 5:7:3) exhibits higher specific capacitances of 1732 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (∼98.9% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles).
