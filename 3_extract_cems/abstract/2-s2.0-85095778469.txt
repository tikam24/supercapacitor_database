To overcome the inefficient biomass conversion, waste generation, and lack of co-production in biorefineries, an integrated process was proposed for the conversion of corn stover into levulinic acid and biocarbon electrode material. Corn stover was pretreated through hydrothermal process using 0.45 wt% K2CO3 which removed 76 wt% lignin and 85 wt% xylan while preserving 83 wt% glucan. This was followed by acid hydrolysis to produce levulinic acid at varying H2SO4 concentrations and reaction time in a batch reactor at 190 °C. At a reaction time of 5 min in 2 wt% H2SO4, 35.8 wt% and 30 wt% glucan in raw and pretreated corn stover was converted to levulinic acid, respectively. The residue from acid hydrolysis was converted into biocarbon for supercapacitor electrodes via a two-step thermal activation process which showed a specific capacitance of 120 F g−1. The proposed integrated biorefinery concept provides multiple value-added products for a greater financial and environmental sustainability.
