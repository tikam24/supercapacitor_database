A series of porous carbon materials with wide range of specific surface areas and different heteroatom contents had been prepared using polyaniline as carbon precursor and KOH as an activating agent. Effect of surface area and heteroatom of porous carbon materials on specific capacitance was investigated thoroughly in two typical aqueous KOH and organic 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitirle electrolytes. The different trends of capacitance performance were observed in these two electrolytes. Electrochemical analyses suggested that the presence of faradaic interactions on heteroatom-enriched carbon materials in organic environment is less significant than that observed in aqueous electrolytes. Thus, in aqueous electrolyte, a balance between surface area and heteroatom content of activated porous carbon would be found to develop a supercapacitor with high energy density. In organic electrolyte, the capacitance performance of porous carbon is strongly dependent on the surface area. The results may be useful for the design of porous carbon-based supercapacitor with the desired capacitive performance in aqueous and organic electrolytes.
