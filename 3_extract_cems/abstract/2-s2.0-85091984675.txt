This paper presents a complete model of a small electric vehicle consisting of fuel cell, supercapacitor, power conversion system with its control system. This electrical system is loaded by a vehicle model that takes as input a standard vehicle test cycle (such as NEDC, WLTP or other) and translates it into current that must be supplied or consumed from the power conversion system. The model is tested with two different topologies (cascade and parallel) of the hybrid energy source. On the basis of the conducted studies, the paper compares the simulation results for different types of topologies and draws conclusions regarding their applications for different types of electric vehicles. The model allows for observation of both electrical and mechanical parameters as opposed to others available in the literature.
