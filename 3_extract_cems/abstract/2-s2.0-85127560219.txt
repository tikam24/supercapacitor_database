Scientists are increasingly interested in improving electroactive technologies for supercapacitor applications, since energy storage devices have improved considerably. Herein, we design a hierarchical BiFeWO6 array network structure on carbon cloth for energy storage devices as a binder-free electrode material, as the internal resistance and the impedance of binders in energy storage systems induce poor performance of the designed material. The BiFeW@CC fabricated electrode gives a specific capacitance (Csp) of 1200 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, indicating good electrochemical activity with 82% retention of Csp after 5000 cycles. According to studies, the BiFeW@CC nanostructure is a potential candidate for use in high-energy supercapacitors. The remarkable performance of BiFeW@CC is due to its intriguing structural features, the conducting nature of Fe ions, and a binder-free electrode; this fascinating pseudocapacitor for industrial use exhibits exceptional electrochemical properties.
