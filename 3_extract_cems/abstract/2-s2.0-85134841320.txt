Electrochemical conductive hydrogels are being extensively explored in the fabrication of portable batteries and high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, the rational design of a new polyanionic electrically conductive hydrogels based on sodium alginate-g-poly(AM-co-ECA-co-AMPS) are described. rGO was incorporated into the hydrogel during the polymerization process generating rGO@ sodium alginate-g-poly(AM-co-ECA-co-AMPS) composite hydrogels to study the impact of rGO on the performance of the hydrogels. FT-IR, XRD, and SEM-EDX characterized the chemical composition, crystalline, and morphological structure of the new synthesized hydrogels. The electrochemical performance of as-synthesized hydrogels was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic, charge-discharge rate, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The supercapacitor performance for ECH2.5 composite hydrogel showed a capacitance of 753 F. g−1 at 1 A. g−1 with good rate capability and cycling stability up to 5000 cycles. Thus, ECH2.5 hydrogel is a good candidate as electrode material in supercapacitor applications.
