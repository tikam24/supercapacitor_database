This Nitrogen-doped porous carbon which is prepared by ionic-liquid-assisted method with just one-step process is successfully introduced N element and adequate mesopores. Under the suitable carbonization temperature (around 900 °C), this method creates high specific surface area (∼1542 m2 g−1) and appropriate hierarchical pores (∼0.65 and ∼4 nm) for target carbon. As an electrode in supercapacitors, this carbon material shows a 307 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1 A g−1 and an outstanding cycling performance of around 97.9% retainment after 5000 cycles. Even in an all-solid-state supercapacitor, it still performs well in the aspects of energy density and power density. Therefore, we believe this kind of porous carbon material would be a promising electrode material when applied in supercapacitors.
