In this paper, an energy management method for a stand-alone hybrid generation system based on a wind turbine and hybrid energy storage system (battery supercapacitor). The supercapacitor is included to reduce the transient peak energy caused by sudden load or wind speed variations and reduce batteiy charging stress. Consequently, it extends battery life and reduces replacement costs. The power management method is introduced to maintain the necessaiy energy balance between the sides of generation and load. Additionally, a wind boost convener is present to harness the most wind energy possible while meeting load requirements and preserving a constant DC-bus voltage. The simulation results demonstrate how quickly the suggested technique can adapt to wind speed and load power changes.
