As a new type of energy storage device, supercapacitors are widely applied in various fields owing to their irreplaceable extraordinary characteristics. The remaining useful life represents the safe service range of a supercapacitor. Precise monitoring of its value can ensure timely replacement before reaching the service limit. An accurate state-of-charge estimation can ensure that the supercapacitor works in a safe area. Superior precision ensures that the safe area is more explicit. Thus, the supercapacitor can exercise maximum effectiveness without damaging the device. Hence, this paper reviews the above sections. The remaining useful life prediction and state-of-charge estimation of supercapacitors are reviewed based on the model and data. The methods of different innovation points are enumerated, the disparate evaluation frameworks are compared, and their merits and demerits are generalized and reviewed. In the research field, while studying the remaining useful life of supercapacitors based on data, the application of artificial neural networks is emphasized. Hence, this study focuses on reviewing the relevant content for this approach. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the prediction of the above studies are briefly described.
