The electrochemical performance of flexible CNT-based supercapacitors (SCs) was enhanced by adding Cu5(VO4)2(OH)4 (CuVO, turanite), and FeNdCo alloy (FNC) on their electrodes. Firstly, we fabricated SCs with an acidic electrolyte (PVA/H3PO4) and electrodes of CNT/CuVO, CNT/FNC or CNT/CuVO/FNC. Those devices exhibited capacitances/energy densities in the range of 530-710 F g−1/106-142 W h kg−1. Later, eco-friendly devices were fabricated with seawater electrolyte instead of acidic electrolyte and the capacitances/energy-densities increased to the range of 552-869 F g−1/110-151 W h kg−1. Thus, using the seawater electrolyte enhanced the capacitance/energy-density by 4-22%. To demonstrate that such eco-friendly devices are waterproof, we evaluated their electrochemical performance underwater and found an increment of the capacitance from 902.7 to 1093.7 F g−1 after increasing the temperature of the water from 28 to 95 °C (boiling point). We also reached an outstanding energy density of 197.6 W h kg−1 underwater. When the SCs are exposed to high temperatures underwater, the CNT-fibers in the SC-electrodes are more relaxed/open (verified by SEM images), allowing a better charge-storage. XPS/Raman/UV-VIS spectra demonstrated a higher presence of Fe3+/oxygen-vacancies in the SC-electrodes of the devices made with seawater, and additional redox species of V3+/Cu0/Co2+. Therefore, they had higher capacitance than the devices made with acidic electrolyte.
