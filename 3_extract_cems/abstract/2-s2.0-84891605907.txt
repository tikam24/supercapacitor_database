Supercapacitor is achieved by combining tin oxide with three dimensional silicon microchannel plates (Si-MCPs) deposited with nickel film. Electrodeposition is applied to deposit the tin oxide on the Ni/Si-MCPs structure followed by sintering at 450°C. The structure and morphology of the samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties are investigated in 1 M Na 2SO4 solution by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging-discharging, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The highest specific capacitance of 0.814 F/cm2 (171.37 F/g) is achieved from the sample deposited for 2 h followed by sintering for 2 h. © 2013 SPIE.
