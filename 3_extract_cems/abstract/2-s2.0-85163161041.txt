Now days, developing a suitable electrode material with optimum energy density and repeatability is considered as essential criteria for commercial applications. In the current work, aluminium doped MoS2 electrode is directly grown on carbon cloth using facile hydrothermal method. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM) images exhibited the flowerlike morphology and layered structure of MoS2, respectively. The potential of the prepared electrodes is tested using three electrodes, symmetric two electrodes and asymmetric two electrode systems in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Three electrodes system yielded a specific capacitance of 221 F/g at 1 A/g for the best electrode. The symmetric two electrode system yielded a specific capacitance of 111 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with an energy density of 10 Wh/kg at a power density of 175 W/kg. The asymmetric supercapacitor yielded a specific capacitance of 45 F/g at current density of 1 A/g and an energy density of 3.62 Wh/kg at a power density of 424.5 W/kg. The asymmetric capacitor exhibited a capacity retention of 80 % even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 2 A/g.
