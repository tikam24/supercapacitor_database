As a new type of energy storage device, supercapacitors with high specific capacitance, fast charge and discharge, and long cycle life have attracted significant attention in the energy storage field. Electrode materials are a crucial factor defining the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. The standard supercapacitor electrode materials used can be classified into three types: carbon-based materials, metal oxides and hydroxide materials, and conductive polymers. This review introduces the principles of supercapacitors and summarizes recent research progress of carbon-based electrode materials, including pure carbon materials, and the binary and ternary complex materials with carbon.
