Supercapacitors (SCs) have gained considerable attention in growing global demands especially in automobile, renewable energy production, and storage applications. In this work, pure and Strontium (Sr)-doped MoS2 nanosheets have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method for supercapacitor applications. The physical properties (structural, morphological) of Sr-doped MoS2 semiconductor are characterized by fundamental characteristic tools. The electrochemical properties are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic chargeâˆ’discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The 10% Sr-doped MoS2 demonstrated better specific capacitance (Csp 489.75 F/g) at 1 A/g and excellent electrochemical stability (62.5% of capacity retention after 2000 cycle at 10 A/g) when distinguished with other electrode materials. These eminent activities attribute to effective charge transport property in 10% Sr-doped MoS2 compared to undoped and 5% Sr-doped electrodes. Due to this decisive electrochemical accomplishment and remarkable cyclic stability, 10% Sr-doped MoS2 can be an applicable electrode material for SCs. The asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated with rGO and 10% Sr-doped MoS2. Herewith, the power density is 5760 W/kg, and the energy density reaches 31 Wh/kg.
