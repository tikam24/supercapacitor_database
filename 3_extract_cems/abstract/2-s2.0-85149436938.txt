The pore structure of carbon materials strongly influences the electrochemical performance of carbon electrodes. Thus, carbon material pore structure modification methods need to be further explored to improve carbon electrode performance. In this work, fulvic acid is used as a carbon precursor to prepare oxygen-rich hierarchical porous carbon (OAHPC) by H2O2 oxidation followed by synergistic activation with KOH. H2O2 oxidation significantly increases the oxygen functional groups on the surface of the fulvic acid, which helps coordinate the KOH activation process. The prepared OAHPC has a mesopore ratio of 67.77%, a specific surface area (SSA) of 3362 m2·g−1, a total pore volume of 2.23 cm3·g−1, and an oxygen content of 34.01 wt%. The OAHPC is used as a supercapacitor electrode material in a three-electrode system. This OAHPC electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 453 F·g−1 at 0.2 A·g−1 in 6 M KOH as well as outstanding cyclic stability (86.8% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). This method provides a new strategy for adjusting the pore structure of porous carbon materials.
