Silicon nanowire (SiNW) is a promising material for micro-supercapacitors (μ-SCs). However, the practical application of SiNW μ-SCs is hindered due to the instability of Si in aqueous solutions. Here, we demonstrate that the overall capacitive properties of SiNW μ-SCs can be improved by a facile TiO 2 coating treatment. In this study, SiNWs were fabricated by metal-assisted chemical etching and TiO 2 was spin-coated on SiNWs. With the optimal processing condition, the TiO 2 -coated SiNWs (T-SiNWs) exhibit an areal capacitance of 2.69 mF cm −2 at the scan rate of 50 mV s −1 and 3.55 mF cm −2 at the current density of 0.1 mA cm −2 , respectively. Further, an enhanced rate capability of T-SiNWs is observed owing to the TiO 2 coating. Moreover, a retention of 68.8% is obtained by T-SiNWs after 1000 galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles, which is higher than that of the bare SiNWs. The reasons for the capacitive property enhancement of the electrode materials were also investigated.
