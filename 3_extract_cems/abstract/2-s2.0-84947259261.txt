Nowadays energy consumption minimization is very important. It can be done using renewable energy sources or by minimization of energy consumption. In industry case a lot of systems as CNC machines or industrial robots can regenerate energy. Regenerated energy is dissipated in breaking rheostats. To use regenerated energy usually use fast energy storage devices like flywheels or supercapacitors. In this paper are compared two topologies of interface converters for supercapacitor chargerging discharging in industrial DC grid with nonlinear load. These topologies are zeta-sepic and buck and boost. Both topologies are shown appropriate results. Buck and boost topology cheaper and produce less current ripples. Zeta-sepic produces larger current ripples, but better stabilizes grid voltage.
