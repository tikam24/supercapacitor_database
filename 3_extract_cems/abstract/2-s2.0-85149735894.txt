In this work, magnetite (Fe3O4)-NH-Polyaniline (PANI) composite was prepared by polymer grafting on the metal oxide particles. The Fe3O4-NH-PANI nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 191 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1 and specific energy of 9.3 Wh Kg−1 and specific power of 458.3 W Kg−1. For the improvement of electrochemical performance, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was added to the composite. The rGO-Fe3O4-NH-PANI composite exhibited a specific capacitance of 336.4 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mVs-1and specific energy of 11.81 Wh Kg−1 and specific power of 1258.3 W Kg−1.
