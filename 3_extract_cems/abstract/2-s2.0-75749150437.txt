We report the synthesis and pseudocapacitive studies of a composite film (PANI-ND-MnO2) of polyaniline (PANI) and manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles. To enhance the interaction of MnO2 and PANI, the surfaces of MnO2 nanoparticles were modified by a silane coupling reagent, triethoxysilylmethyl N-substituted aniline (ND42). The composite film was obtained via controlled electro-co-polymerization of aniline and N-substituted aniline grafted on surfaces of MnO2 nanoparticles (ND-MnO2) on a carbon cloth in a electrolyte of 0.5 M H2SO4 and 0.6 M (NaPO3)6. In comparison to similarly prepared PANI film, the incorporation of MnO2 nanoparticles substantially increases the effective surface area of the film by reducing the size of rod-like PANI aggregates and avoiding the entanglement of these PANI nanorods. Significantly, we observed significant enhancement of specific capacitance in PANI-ND-MnO2 film compared to PANI-MnO2 film prepared in a similar condition, indicating that the presence of the coupling reagent can improve the electrochemical performance of PANI composite film. A symmetric model capacitor has been fabricated by using two PANI-ND-MnO2 nanocomposite films as electrodes. The PANI-ND-MnO2 capacitor showed an average specific capacitance of ∼80 F g-1 and a stable coulombic efficiency of ∼98% over 1000 cycles. The results demonstrated that PANI-ND-MnO2 nanocomposites are promising materials for supercapacitor electrode and the importance of designing and manipulating the interaction between PANI and MnO2 for fundamentally improving capacitive properties. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
