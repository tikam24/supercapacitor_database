A 5 F-5 V prototype of solid state supercapacitor based on polymer electrolyte (PANI) and XSPEEK composing of six single cells stacked in series has been fabricated. The scale-up from a small single cell to a larger stack prototype of a solid-state electrochemical supercapacitor is discussed in this paper. The developed prototype showed a higher series resistance than estimated in our previous study on individual cell supercapacitor. The fabricated prototype achieved a specific capacitance of 480 F/g. The assembled capacitor has been characterized by cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charging/discharging. The performances of the electrodes have been compared with that of the single cell electrodes of area 4 cm2. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
