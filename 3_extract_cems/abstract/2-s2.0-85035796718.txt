Prussian blue analogues with tunable open channels are of fundamental and technological importance for energy storage systems. Herein, a novel facile synthesis of nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate/reduced graphene oxide (denoted as Ni-CoHCF/rGO) nanocomposite is realized by a reverse microemulsion method. The very fine Ni-CoHCF nanoparticles (10–20 nm) are homogeneously anchored on the surface of reduced graphene oxide by electrostatic adsorption and reduced graphene oxide is well-separated by Ni-CoHCF particles. Benefiting from the combined advantages of this structure, the Ni-. It CoHCF/rGO nanocomposite can be used as electrodes for both supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries exhibits excellent pseudocapacitve performance in terms of high specific capacitance of 466 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 and 350 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 , along with high cycling stabilities. As a cathode material for sodium ion batteries, it also demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 118 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 , good rate capability, and superior cycling stability. These results suggest its potential as an efficient electrode for high-performance energy storage and renewable delivery devices.
