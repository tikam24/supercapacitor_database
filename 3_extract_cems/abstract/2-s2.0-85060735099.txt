The development of supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and other energy storage devices are getting increasing concern. For energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and LIBs whose electrochemical performance depends mainly on the electrode material, the preparation of efficient energy storage materials becomes the key to the development of efficient energy storage devices. This article aims to introduce the preparation and properties of hierarchical transition metal oxide-based electrode materials, specifically summarizing the related work on the study and development of high-performance supercapacitors and LIBs by our group over the past years: surface chemical reaction controlled preparation of hierarchical metal oxides, metal oxides incorporated into carbon matrixes nanohybrids and various three-dimensional (3D) multi-component composites, demonstrating excellent electrochemical properties.
