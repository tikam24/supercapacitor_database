Nanoscale engineering plays an important role in designing novel electrode architecture and boosting energy storage in supercapacitors. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of freestanding tin sulfide based supercapacitor electrode using facile nucleation substrate control, i.e. polyaniline network. This is the first time that tin sulfide based material is fabricated as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The first combination of tin sulfide and polyaniline also evokes synergistic effect to enhance the performance as the polyaniline nanofibers facilitate the growth of tin sulfide flakes in nanosize which is further proved helpful for improving the capacity and stability of the electrode. The as-obtained electrode of tin sulfide nanoflake arrays incorporated on polyaniline nanofibers (365 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1) exhibits superior electrochemical performance compared with micro-scaled tin sulfide (32 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1). The significantly improved pseudocapacitive and diffusive contributions of polyaniline nanofibers incorporated electrode are identified by quantitative kinetics analysis due to greatly decreased particle size and introduced mesopores, nanoclusters, and exposed edges. Profited from effective nanostructure engineering, a Na+ intercalation mechanism is also pointed out in boosting the electrochemical performance.
