As the core component of wearable electronic devices, flexible energy storage materials play an irreplaceable role. At present, it is still a challenge to prepare flexible electrode materials with high energy density. In this paper, a polyaniline-based composite flexible conductive hydrogel (PPG-P) with a two-level conductive network is successfully prepared by a secondary induced assembly in situ polymerization method. The special conductive structure greatly promotes the efficiency of charge transfer and the utilization of electroactive substances, so that PPG-P exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. In a three-electrode system, PPG-P has a mass-specific capacitance as high as 989 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1). After 1000 charge and discharge cycles, the capacitance retention is 87%. Symmetrical flexible supercapacitors based on PPG-P have high specific capacitance (176 F g−1/0.5 A g−1) and high energy density (15.6 Wh kg−1). After 1000 cycles of constant current charge and discharge, the capacitance maintains 78.1%. The preparation of PPG-P with a hierarchical structure demonstrates the possibility of achieving high energy density in flexible electrode materials, which has great application potential in the development of energy storage elements in wearable devices.
