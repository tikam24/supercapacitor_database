Compared with other energy storage devices, supercapacitors have superior qualities, including a long cycling life, fast charge/discharge processes, and a high safety rating. The practical use of supercapacitor devices is hindered by their low energy density. Here, we briefly review the factors that influence the energy density of supercapacitors. Furthermore, possible pathways for enhancing the energy density via improving capacitance and working voltage are discussed. In particular, we offer our perspective on the most exciting developments regarding high-energy-density supercapacitors, with an emphasis on future trends. We conclude by discussing the various types of supercapacitors and highlight crucial tasks for achieving a high energy density.
