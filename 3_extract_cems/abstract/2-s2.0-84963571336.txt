In this paper, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) included a supercapacitor (SC) is proposed for reducing the battery current stress in hybrid electric vehicles. The battery and SC sizes will be optimized based on a desired minimal mileage and a power demand profile, respectively. The proposed energy management strategy will be implemented by fuzzy logic controller (FLC). The proposed strategy offers some advantages, such as less pressure on battery and higher lifetime for it. The proposed strategy is employed for three different topologies of HESS. The simulation results are compared from different points of view, such as current and voltage profiles of topologies, battery current fluctuations, and SC voltage.
