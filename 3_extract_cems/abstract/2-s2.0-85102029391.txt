Coal‐derived carbon nanofibers (CCNFs) have been recently found to be a promising and low‐cost electrode material for high‐performance supercapacitors. However, the knowledge gap still exists between holistic understanding of coal precursors derived from different solvents and resulting CCNFs’ properties, prohibiting further optimization of their electrochemical performance. In this paper, assisted by laser desorption/ionization (LDI) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) technologies, a systematic study was performed to holistically characterize mass distribution and chemical composition of coal precursors derived from various ionic liquids (ILs) as extractants. Sequentially, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the differences in chemical properties of various coal products significantly affected the surface oxygen concentrations and certain species distributions on the CCNFs, which, in turn, determined the electrochemical performances of CCNFs as electrode materials. We report that the CCNF that was produced by an oxygen‐rich coal fragment from C6mimCl ionic liquid extraction showed the highest concentrations of quinone and ester groups on the surface. Consequentially, C6mimCl‐CCNF achieved the highest specific capacitance and lowest ion diffusion resistance. Finally, a symmetric carbon/carbon supercapacitor fabricated with such CCNF as electrode delivered an energy density of 21.1 Wh/kg at the power density of 0.6 kW/kg, which is comparable to commercial active carbon supercapacitors.
