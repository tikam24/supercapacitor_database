Open-switch fault is one of the most common faults of DC&#x002F;DC converter. If the fault cannot be diagnosed in time, it will have a serious impact on the normal operation of the system. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an open-switch fault diagnosis method for bidirectional DC&#x002F;DC converter based on global state observer. In this method, the global mathematical model of two bidirectional DC&#x002F;DC converters in hybrid energy sources system is firstly derived, and then a global state observer is constructed based on Luenberger observer. The open-switch fault detection and location are achieved through the residuals of battery current and supercapacitor current. Both the simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed open-switch fault diagnosis method.
