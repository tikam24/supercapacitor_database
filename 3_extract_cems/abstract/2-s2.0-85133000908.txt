The working performance of hybrid supercapacitor was comprehensively studied. The electrothermal coupling and thermal characteristics of hybrid supercapacitor were discussed. The influences of operation parameters, such as ambient temperature, electrode thickness, thickness ratio of anode to cathode electrodes were examined. The heat generation rate, temperature distribution and working performance of hybrid supercapacitor were analyzed during charge-discharge. The results show that a higher ambient temperature, a greater charge-discharge current, and a thicker cathode electrode will lead to much more obvious temperature rise. Consequently, the high-temperature accumulation effect on the central area of hybrid supercapacitor easily occurs. The low ambient temperature will cause capacitance attenuation, while the equivalent series internal resistance increases greatly. When the ambient temperature is the same, the cathode-electrode thickness will affect the sensitivity of a hybrid supercapacitor. The charge-discharge time increases with the increase of cathode electrode thickness, the average state of charge decreases with the increasing of cathode electrode thickness, the extraction-insertion of lithium ions are happened from the anode electrode, the capacitance of hybrid supercapacitor will finally increase. The average energy density can be significantly improved by increasing cathode-electrode thickness. However, the equivalent series resistance and heat production simultaneously increase, so the power density decreases eventually.
