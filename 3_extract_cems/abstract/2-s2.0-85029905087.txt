MEMS supercapacitor, specifically with interdigital (IDE) electrodes design, has recently gained much interest in fields such as bioMEMS, biomedical implants, power electronic devices and high power applications due to its high charging capacity. This research presents a MEMS supercapacitor with graphene nanolayers grown on its electrodes. The MEMS supercapacitor consists of silicon dioxide (SiO2), nickel, graphene, polypyrrole (Ppy) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layers. This paper more focus on the fabrication of graphene nanolayer structures on MEMS supercapacitor electrodes via several subsequent plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), E-beam evaporation and spin coating processes. PECVD graphene was grown for 10 min at 40 Watt at temperatures between 400°C and 1000°C. Raman spectrum indicates peaks at 1340 and 1580 cm-1 corresponding to D and G band, respectively. The 2D peaks appear in range of 2600 to 3000 cm-1. The intensity ratio of 2D and G peaks at 1000°C is 0.43, which indicates a good quality of multilayer graphene.
