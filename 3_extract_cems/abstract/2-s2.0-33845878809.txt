Experimental studies on some aspects of internal resistance of supercapacitor have been carried out. The results obtained in this course show that the electrode, collector and down-lead of a supercapacitor should employ the materials with high conductivity. The concentration of electrolyte with high conductivity should be in a proper value, for KOH, (6-8) mol/L is acceptable. And the content of the activated carbon electrode and the effect of separator on equivalent serial resistance have been obtained and presented in detail in this article. Â© 2005 IEEE.
