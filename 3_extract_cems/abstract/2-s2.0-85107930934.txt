In this work, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were synthesized at different temperature using chemical co precipitation method at room temperature. The synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles were mixed with activated charcoal powder to make nanocomposite for its application as electrodes material in ultracapacitor. Electrodes formed by synthesized nanocomposite at 600 OC show superior performance, which has been used as the optimized temperature for nanocomposite synthesis. Also nanoparticle and charcoal mass ratio1:1 was found to be optimum for electrochemical performance. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) pattern confirms the monoclinic structure of the synthesised CuO nanoparticles. Electrochemical performances of the synthesised nanocomposite electrode and prepared supercapacitor cell were studied using cyclic voltammetry, a.c. impedance spectroscopy and charge discharge methods with 1 M NaOH as an electrolytes. The specific capacitance of the fabricated supercapacitor cell A is constant upto 2000 cycles at 100 mV cm-2
