Morphology is a key factor in designing novel nanomaterials with controlled functional properties for the electrochemical application. Herein, we demonstrate the supercapacitor applications of the copper selenide (Cu2Se) electrodes with different morphologies prepared by electrodeposition at -0.65, -0.75, and -0.85 V/SCE deposition potentials. The well-defined morphologies of the Cu2Se nanostructures have been useful to develop potential applications in the supercapacitor devices. The nanodendrite-like morphology obtained at the deposition potential -0.75 V/SCE showed maximum specific capacitance (688 F/g at 5 mV/s) as compared to the other morphologies.
