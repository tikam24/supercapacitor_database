Efficient, new combination of a bioelectrocatalytic and a pseudocapacitive cellulose-based composite material is reported. The anode comprising Gluconobacter sp. fructose dehydrogenase physically adsorbed on Cladophora sp. Algae nanocellulose/polypyrrole composite provides large catalytic oxidation currents due to large effective surface area of the composite material, and enables storing of the charge. Supercapacitor properties are useful for larger current demands e.g. during switching on-off the devices. Mediatorless catalytic oxidation current densities as high as 14 mA cm-2 at potentials as negative as -0.17 V vs. Ag/AgCl constitute the best anode performance without using mediators reported to date. The fuel cell with GCE cathode covered with laccase adsorbed on naphthylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes, exhibits improved parameters: open circuit voltage of 0.76 V, and maximum power density 1.6 mW cm-2.
