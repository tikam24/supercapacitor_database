We report the electrochemical performance of aromatic polyimide (PI)-based carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which were fabricated by electrospinning, imidization, and carbonization process of poly(amic acid) (PAA) as an aromatic PI precursor. For the purpose, PAA solution was electrospun into nanofibers, which were then converted into CNFs via one-step (PAA-CNFs) or two-step heat treatment (PI-CNFs) of imidization and carbonization. The FTIR and Raman spectra demonstrated a successful structural evolution from PAA nanofibers to PI nanofibers to CNFs at the molecular level. The SEM images revealed that the average diameter of the nanofibers decreased noticeably via imidization and carbonization, while it decreased slightly with increasing the carbonization temperature from 800 °C to 1000 °C. In case of PI-CNF carbonized at 1000 °C, a porous structure was developed on the surface of nanofibers. The electrical conductivity of PI-CNFs, which was even higher than that of PAA-CNFs, increased significantly from 0.41 to 2.50 S/cm with increasing the carbonization temperature. From cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, PI-CNF carbonized at 1000 °C was evaluated to have a maximum electrochemical performance of specific capacitance of ~126.3 F/g, energy density of ~12.2 Wh/kg, and power density of ~160 W/kg, in addition to an excellent operational stability. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
