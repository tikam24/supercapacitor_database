In this work, nanosized-MnCo2O4-embedded one-dimensional (1-d) carbon (MnCo2O4/C) nanofibres were prepared using a simple electrospinning/calcination method and their electrochemical performance was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and selected area electron diffraction were used to show that copious quantities of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles (10–20 nm in diameter) are homogeneously dispersed and embedded in the 1-d carbon matrix thus produced. The MnCo2O4/C composite nanofibres exhibit high-specific capacitance 125.0 F/g (1.0 A/g) and good cycle stability (119% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance of the composite is due to its unique embedded structure which provides a favourable electron carrier and buffering matrix for the effective release of mechanical stress caused by changes in volume. It also prevents the aggregation of MnCo2O4 nanoparticles during charge–discharge cycling.
