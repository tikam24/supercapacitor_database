The doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) technique equipped with wind turbines (WTs) faces a tough challenge as DFIG is highly sensitive to the network faults. This paper proposes a control scheme using super-capacitors (SCs) with a DC/DC converter to get constant power from the wind-farm and simultaneously improve the low voltage ride-through (LVRT) during the gust. The proposed methodology uses two control schemes (output power controller and DC-link voltage controller) work alternatively. The output power controller acts on keeping the output power constant during the gust as long as no faults occur. However, when a fault occurs, the priority is to prevent any damage to the back-to-back converter, so the DC-link voltage controller is connected to limit the overvoltage. Three cases are studied; case 1 analyzes the effect of a gust, case 2 analyzes the effect of grid-faults during the gust, and case 3 shows the effect of ground resistance on the proposed methodology.
