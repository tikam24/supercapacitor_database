Bismuth oxide-graphene oxide (Bi2O3-GO) nanocomposite was synthesized from Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate, and reduced graphene oxide by microwave combustion. The crystal structure, morphology, and the nanocomposite of Bi2O3-GO were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Its supercapacitors performance was studied as electrode materials on the electrochemical workstation. An electrochemical test of the sample at 800 W 120 s shows that the capacitance of Bi2O3-GO nanocomposite was 1029 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention of 80 % for 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance should be due to the abundant active sites provided by graphene oxide and the massive loading of Bi2O3 materials.
