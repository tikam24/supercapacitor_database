The paper proposes different electrical schemes of power supply which use battery of capacitors. In practice are some cases that require electronic components with specific parameters. For example, due to the very high electrical resistances of the insulating materials, to highlight the very small currents acting on them, it is necessary to use a higher voltage power supply. There is the possibility of studying different solutions to solve specific aspects into high voltage circuits. Commercially, electronic components, for a lower cost, have limited values for voltages below or close to the required supply voltage. The serial connection of the filter capacitors is a solution, but other problems arise due to the inherent differences between the capacitors' properties, even they are made with the same technologies, the same manufacturer and the same batch. Also, the possibility of design the solution for balancing or limit the voltage distribution in the supercapacitors batteries is analyzed in this paper. Due to the way accomplished technology, a nominal voltage of 2.7 or 5.5 volts of supercapacitors is the limit. Simulations and experimental of the analyzed schemes were carried out.
