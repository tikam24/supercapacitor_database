The energy management of a fuel cell system coupled to a supercapacitor energy storage system is studied, both in simulation and on a same-scale test bench. This system can be used to power an urban electric scooter. To obtain a low real-Time hydrogen consumption, an online energy management strategy needs to be embedded. This paper assesses the best energy performance of two promising real-Time energy management strategies for fuel cell electric vehicle applications: Adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy and stochastic dynamic programming. For this purpose, a specific certification driving cycle is considered while an off-line algorithm is used as benchmark. Simulation experimental results show that SDP has a higher potential than A-ECMS, making SDP complexity worth handling.
