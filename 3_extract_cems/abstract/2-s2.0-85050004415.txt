In this work a zero emission public transportation system is proposed. This system uses electric buses and super- capacitors are used as an on-board energy source. Since, it is public transportation system, the bus stops are located every 1-2 kilometers. Each bus stop acts as a charging point and when the bus stops, for passengers to board and de-board, the supercapacitors charge with enough energy to travel 4-5 kilometers. This arrangement obviates the use of high capacity battery on the bus and thus reduces the weight of the system. Furthermore, the presence of the high capacity battery has been validated by analysing grid profile and per unit voltage profile.
