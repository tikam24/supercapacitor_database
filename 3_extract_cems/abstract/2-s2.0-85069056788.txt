Usually a battery is used as the energy storage device in typical standalone solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. It is charged by a solar charge controller. The charging efficiency of the system depends on the efficiency of the DC-DC converter of solar charge controller. However, a considerable amount of usable energy is wasted during the charging process. In this work, a method is proposed to utilize this wasted energy and thereby to enhance the charging efficiency. In the case of an empty capacitor being charged by an external source, it stores only half of the energy delivered by the source as compared to that of an electrochemical battery. Therefore, it wastes 50% of useful energy. A portion of this wasted energy can be collected and utilized if a useful resistive load is connected in series to this capacitor charging loop. In this study, a DC-DC converter and battery bank is connected as the useful resistive load in the capacitor charging loop. A supercapacitor (SC) bank is used replacing the conventional capacitor. Therefore, total energy loss in capacitor charging loop can be minimized by storing energy in both battery bank and SC bank. This concept is introduced into a typical PV system for reducing its energy losses. Experimental results show an enhancement in charging efficiency when this new method is employed. The energy stored in the SC bank could be used for driving loads with required electronics.
