Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), featuring an elastic molecular pattern, highly ordered structures, and persistent porosity, are a new family of covalently connected crystalline organic polymers. Predesigned structure, controlled synthesis, and managed functionalities are the key characteristics of COFs in contrast to other polymers. In principle, extended topological design diagrams volunteer geometrical guidance for the structural tiling of extensive porous polygons, and predesigned primary and high-order structures can be synthesized using polycondensation reactions. The achievement of linking atoms in 2D and 3D to build extensive framework systems pushed the chemistry of COFs from structures to methods, emphasizing the prospective future applications. COFs, on the other hand, have developed into a brand-new class of organic materials that offer a highly stable molecular foundation for the development of intricate structural designs and specialized functional advancements as a result of the accessibility of organic building blocks and the variety of topologies and connections. Moreover, the biggest obstacle to their widespread use in electrochemical energy storage devices is the poor electrochemical performance and low electrical conductivity of pristine COFs based materials. Herein, a thorough chemical analysis of the COFs covering its historical background is carried out. Generally employed to sketch the advancements in topological formulations and reactions, thereby illustrating the structural points, and variations. The growth and ability of different functions can be sorted by different structural-functioning, relations depend on the interactions, key fundamentals and challenging issues. Finally, “capacitors” and “supercapacitors” remaining issues with this kind of materials for practical advantages, limitations, and applications are emphasized.
