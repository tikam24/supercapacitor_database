Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the important types of intrinsically conducting polymers. Processability of PANI is daunting due to high level of conjugation and rigid backbone. PANI-based nanomaterials have been identified as new materials for rapidly growing technologies. Owing to enhanced and exceptional nanostructural characteristics, PANI-based nanomaterials have gained research curiosity. Thus, challenges faced in processing of neat PANI have led to the growth of PANI-based nanomaterials. This article presents development of PANI-based nanomaterials, their potential prospects in various technological fields, and future direction. Potential of PANI-based nanomaterials has been analysed in membranes, anticorrosion, solar cell, supercapacitor, sensor, and biomedical.
