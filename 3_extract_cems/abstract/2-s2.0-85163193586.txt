Power Electronics circuit are the vital part of any electrical vehicle (EV) system. It consists of DC-AC (or AC) Converters and DC-DC (or DC) Converters. The AC Converters are responsible for supplying the high power to electric motor and other miscellaneous systems, whereas the DC Converters are responsible for supplying power to DC loads in car and integrating the EV battery. This paper presents a detailed knowledge about the various charging converters used in the plug-in Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV's) and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV's). The paper summarizes the different EV converter design approaches available in the literature which can be employed at fast charging stations, as well as on the on/off-board chargers and its application with neural network.
