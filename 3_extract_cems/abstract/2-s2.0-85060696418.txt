Owing to their high earth-abundance, eco-friendliness, high electrical conductivity, large surface area, structure tunability at the atomic/morphological levels, and excellent stability in harsh conditions, carbon-based metal-free materials have become promising advanced electrode materials for high-performance pseudocapacitors and metalâ€“air batteries. Furthermore, carbon-based nanomaterials with well-defined structures can function as green catalysts because of their efficiency in advanced oxidation processes to remove organics in air or from water, which reduces the cost for air/water purification and avoids cross-contamination by eliminating the release of heavy metals/metal ions. Here, the research and development of carbon-based catalysts in supercapacitors and batteries for clean energy storage as well as in air/water treatments for environmental remediation are reviewed. The related mechanistic understanding and design principles of carbon-based metal-free catalysts are illustrated, along with the challenges and perspectives in this emerging field.
