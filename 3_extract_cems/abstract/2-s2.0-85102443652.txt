As a tradeoff between supercapacitors and batteries, lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are designed to deliver high energy density, high power density, and long cycling stability. Owing to the different energy storage mechanisms of capacitor-type cathodes and battery-type anodes, engineering and fabricating LICs with excellent energy density and power density remains a challenge. Herein, to alleviate the mismatch between the anode and cathode, we ingeniously designed a graphene with oxidized-polydopamine coating (LG@DA1) and N,P codoped porous foam structure activated carbon (CPC750) as the battery-type anode and capacitor-type cathode, respectively. Using oxidized-polydopamine to stabilize the structure of graphene, increase layer spacing, and modify the surface chemical property, the LG@DA1 anode delivers a maximum capacity of 1100 mAh g-1 as well as good cycling stability. With N,P codoping and a porous foam structure, the CPC750 cathode exhibits a large effective specific surface area and a high specific capacity of 87.5 mAh g-1. In specific, the present LG@DA1//CPC750 LIC showcases a high energy density of 170.6 Wh kg-1 and superior capacity retention of 93.5% after 2000 cycles. The success of the present LIC can be attributed to the structural stability design, surface chemistry regulation, and enhanced utilization of effective active sites of the anode and cathode; thus, this strategy can be applied to improve the performance of LICs.
