Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as one of the most outstanding innovated and functional materials for electrochemical application. Here, the structure of novel MOFs-derived hierarchically porous Nickel@Carbon nanospheres (HP-Ni@C-N) synthesized via pyrolysis after the solvothermal reaction is discussed. The method includes the decomposition of the trimesic acid as an organic molecule at a specific temperature of transformation into a carbon matrix wrapping of nickel nanoparticles (Ni NPs). Furthermore, HP-Ni@C-N supported on nickel foam as an electrochemical energy storage supercapacitor application and obtained 912 F g −1 at 10 mV s −1 is reported. Interestingly, the covalent bridge between the Ni core and carbon shell facilitates the faster ions transportation. Therefore, it is presumed that this work can be informative and elucidative for the construction of MOFs-derived transition metals hybrid nanostructures.
