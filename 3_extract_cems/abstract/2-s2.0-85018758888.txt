Supercapacitors have drawn numerous attentions in recent years since they can deliver relatively high power and energy densities. This article introduces an all-printed paper based surface mountable supercapacitor (SMS), which could withstand the reflow soldering process when integrated into microelectronic systems. The device was fabricated by screen printing and stencil printing processes, contributing to low cost and large-scale fabrication. Furthermore, building electronic devices on ubiquitous paper substrates had advantages of light weight, low cost, and eco-friendliness, etc. Based on activated carbon electrode material and ionic liquid electrolyte, the capacity of the supercapacitor could reach 14 mF at the device volume of 3.2 mm × 2.5 mm × 0.175 mm, besides, the specific volumetric capacity was superior than most of the commercial SMS devices.
