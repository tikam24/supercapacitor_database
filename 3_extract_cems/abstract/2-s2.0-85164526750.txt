The present investigation is dealt with benzene 1,4-dicarboxylic acid (BDC) encapped MOF zinc phosphate (ZP) wrapping up with rGO @ four mass variates (MOFZP@rGOx, x = 25, 50, 75, 100 mg) synthesized by microwave technique by advocating XRD, Raman, SEM, and electrochemical studies (cyclic voltammetry, GCD, and EIS). The XRD reveals MOF with ZP exists in the orthorhombic phase. The Raman deconvolution profile identifies the amorphous/crystallinity of rGO through the ID/IG ratio which is found maximum for 50 mg rGO wrapped MOFZP@rGO2 (0.99). The SEM shows projected homogeneity contour surface morphology for optimal rGO within the MOFZP@rGO2. The electrochemical studies identify MOFZP@rGO2 only showed higher specific capacitance 644 F g−1 @ 1 A g−1 than the other variates. The XPS confirms elemental composition and the corresponding oxidation states of MOFZP@rGO2 (porosity 12.65 nm by BET). The full-cell device is fabricated using MOFZP@rGO2 without binder, first time and rGO negative electrode, in 3 m H2SO4 and its obtained specific capacitance 130 F g−1 @ 1 A g−1 (power density 450 W kg−1 @ 1 A g−1; energy density 58.4 Wh kg−1 @ 1 A g−1) suitable towards supercapacitor applications is recommended.
