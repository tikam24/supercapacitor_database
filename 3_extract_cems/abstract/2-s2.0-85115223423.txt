The design and discovery of sustainable electrode materials with outstanding capacitance for energy storage from environmentally friendly biomass as the raw material are a task filled with challenges and opportunities. In this work, we demonstrate that the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device is assembled by metal silicates for the first time. The amorphous carbon/iron silicate (C/Fe24Si4O43(OH)2, denoted as C/FeSi) anode and cobalt-nickel silicate (CoxNi2-xSiO4, denoted as CoNiSi) cathode materials are derived naturally from bamboo leaves (BLs) for the HSC device. The BLs-derived C/FeSi displays FeSi nanoparticles in situ growth on 3D hierarchical porous carbon, leading to high specific surface area, outstanding specific capacitance of 421 F·g-1 at 0.5 A·g-1, and prominent cycle performance of 86% retention after 10 000 cycles. The CoNiSi presents a 3D petal-like sheet structure and exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with 368 F·g-1 (184 C·g-1) at 0.5 A·g-1 and 89% retention after 10 000 cycles. The fabricated quasi-solid-state C/FeSi//CoNiSi HSC device delivers a remarkable areal specific capacitance of 492 mF·cm-2 (96 F·g-1) at 4 mA·cm-2 and a brilliant energy density of 3.35 Wh·m-2 (6.55 Wh·kg-1) at 3.5 W·m-2 (68.36 W·kg-1), which are preferable to most of state-of-the-art silicates-based SCs. The series-wound C/FeSi//CoNiSi HSC device can light up the red LED for over 2 min. These strengths prove that both C/FeSi and CoNiSi architectures derived from BLs can be regarded as hopeful and first-class electrode materials for SCs with excellent performance. This work not only supplies a potential thread for the construction of metal silicate architectures to recycle biomass rich in silicon to synthesize useful materials but also demonstrates that the high-performance HSC device can be achieved by using the biomass-derived silicates.
