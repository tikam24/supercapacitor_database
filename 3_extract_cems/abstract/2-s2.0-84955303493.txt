Agricultural waste is an abundant and cheap source of carbonaceous materials. In this work we showed that, using this source, it is possible to realize activated carbon (AC) suitable for electrochemical double capacitors (EDLCs). The AC obtained from agricultural waste is microporous and displays high specific capacitance in both, conventional and innovative electrolytes.
