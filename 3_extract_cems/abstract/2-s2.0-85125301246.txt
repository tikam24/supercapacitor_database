Recently, metal tellurides have been widely used as functional materials in energy storage, environment, or catalysis. However, designing synergistic bimetallic tellurides with excellent electrochemical performance remains a huge challenge, especially in high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, high-capacity nickel-cobalt telluride nanosheets were synthesized on carbon fibers (CF@CoTe2-NiTe2). First, using Co-MOF nanosheet arrays as template, nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide nanosheets were prepared by a simple Ni ion etching. Then, the CF@CoTe2-NiTe2was fabricated based on the as-obtained NiCo-LDH nanoarrays in tellurium vapor. Significantly, the CoTe2-NiTe2nanosheets are made up of many interconnected CoTe2and NiTe2nanoparticles, enhancing the effective contact with the electrolyte solution during the oxidation reaction. The as-prepared CF@CoTe2-NiTe2exhibits a high electrochemical capacitance of 261.4 mAh g-1at 1.0 A g-1and an outstanding capacitance retention of 70% when the current density reached 20 A g-1. Remarkably, the hybrid supercapacitor assembled by CF@CoTe2-NiTe2and CF@Fe2O3presents 41 Wh kg-1at 750 W kg-1, with a high capacitance retention (87.6% after 5000 cycles). Therefore, bimetallic tellurides may be used as more functional materials for applying to energy storage.
