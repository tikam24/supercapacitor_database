In this work, the lignin by-products are converted into the three-dimensional interconnected nitrogen and sulfur codoped porous carbon materials by the carbonization and KOH activation process. The as-obtained N, S-HPC-1 shows the multilevel pore structure (macro-, meso-, and micropores) with a high specific surface area of 1454.7 m2 g−1, high nitrogen and sulfur content up to 2.1 and 4.3 wt%. As a result, the N, S-HPC-1-based supercapacitor shows a high specific capacitance of 269 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 62% capacitance retention at 50 A g−1, and favorable capacitance retention of 98.4% after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Furthermore, it can yield a remarkable energy density of 37.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 62 W kg−1. These results exhibit a low-cost and environmental strategy of the lignin utilization for electrodes of supercapacitors.
