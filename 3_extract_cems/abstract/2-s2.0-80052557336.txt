The design and simulation of a fast-charging station in steady-state for PHEV batteries has been proposed, which uses the electrical grid as well as two stationary energy storage devices as energy sources to recharge the PHEV battery. The two energy storage devices comprising the fast-charging station are a supercapacitor and a flywheel energy storage. The current paper justifies the selected power and energy ratings of the respective charging station resources in order to charge the PHEV battery with a maximum capacity of 15 kWh from 20% to 95% of its state-of-charge in a maximum duration of 15 minutes. After the charging stage, the storage devices are replenished in a maximum duration of 7.5 minutes. The methodology, results and its application are presented. Â© 2011 IEEE.
