In this paper, we introduced a novel method to prepare the few-layer nitrogen-doped graphene (FNG) from expandable graphite with melamine. The super-capacitive properties of FNG were thoroughly characterized by a three-electrode system, and the results showed the FNG electrode achieved a specific capacitance as high as 83.8 mF/cm2 together with excellent cycling stability. This method could be a novel approach to combine the pseudo-capacitors and electric double layer capacitors.
