As a kind of promising electrode in flexible supercapacitors, carbon cloth (CC) has been functionalized to boost its electrochemical performance. Here, facile electrochemical copolymerization was used to boost the electrochemical property of CC by adjusting the structure and morphology of electrodeposited aniline-based copolymers. With the optimized feeding ratio of triphenylamine (TPA), the aniline-based copolymer (PANI-T) was obtained on the functionalized CC (FCC) with a unique morphology as network of nanowires, showing the higher areal specific capacitance of 2489 mF cm−2 than the one with polyaniline (PANI) nanorods (FCC@PANI) of 2125 mF cm−2 and the one with copolymer nanoparticles of aniline and diphenylamine (DPA) (FCC@PANI-D) of 1693 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. Compared with the FCC@PANI electrode, the boosting ratio was 126% and 147% for the FCC@PANI-D and FCC@PANI-T, respectively. The electrochemical performance of the flexible solid-state symmetrical supercapacitor (FSSC) indicated the promising potential of the FCC@PANI-T for practical application.
