The nano-sized columned β-FeOOH was prepared by the hydrolysis process and its electrochemical capacitance performance was evaluated for the first time in Li2SO4 solution. A hybrid supercapacitor based on MnO2 positive electrode and FeOOH negative electrode in Li2SO4 electrolyte solution was designed. The electrochemical tests demonstrated that the hybrid supercapacitor has a energy density of 12 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 3700 W kg-1 based on the total weight of the electrode active materials with a voltage range 0-1.85 V. This hybrid supercapacitor also exhibits a good cycling performance and keeps 85% of initial capacity over 2000 cycles. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
