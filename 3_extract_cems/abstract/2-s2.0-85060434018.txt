A three-dimensional carbon nanocomposite based on open-ended carbon microtubes/carbon nanotubes (CMTs/CNTs) is constructed by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The desired CMTs/CNTs could not only possess high electric conductivity for efficient charge transport but could also increase surface area for accessing more electrolyte ions. When assembled into an EDL capacitor using an ionic liquid electrolyte, it exhibits the maximum energy density of 70.9 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 583.0 W kg −1 and remains 28.6 Wh kg −1 at a higher power density of 8.57 kW kg −1 . Even after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles, the EDL capacitor still retains 98% of the initial capacitance.
