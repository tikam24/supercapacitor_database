The super-capacitor SC, due its low internal resistance, can reduce the SLI battery size, prolong its lifetime and improve the starting ability of internal combustion engine ICE namely at low temperature or at worn-out battery. To verify the SC suitability the DYNAST model has been prepared, where various influences can be examined. The actual model includes important resistances and inertias as well as speed reducer between the electric motor (starter) and ICE crankshaft. The results from one-cylinder four-stroke Diesel engine for low-power generator drive are presented.
