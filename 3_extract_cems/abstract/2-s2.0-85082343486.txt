Sandwich-like nanocomposites with CoAl layered double hydroxide(LDH) grown on both sides of graphene oxides were synthesized via a novel strategy. It is found that the CoAl-LDH nanosheet arrays grow perpendicularly and uniformly on both sides of graphene oxide nanosheets, constructing a hierarchical three-dimensional nanocomposite with a well-defined sandwich structure. This uniquely structured nanocomposite has a large specific surface area and typical mesoporous distribution, which is favorable for achieving high pseudocapacitance performance. The free-standing LDH/rGO(rGO, reduced graphene oxide) film exhibits a specific capacitance of 340 F/g(current density 1 A/g) with good cycling stability. The one-pot strategy may pave a way to design and fabricate hierarchical LDH/rGO composites with interesting structures for potential application in supercapacitors and other fields.
