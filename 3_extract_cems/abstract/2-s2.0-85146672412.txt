The application supercapacitors (SCs) alongside batteries is very useful to decrease battery life degradation in the form of hybrid Energy Storage Systems (ESSs). In this regard, the battery responds to low-frequency currents while the SC deals with high-frequency peak currents. Considering that adding SC and batter life enhancement respectively increases and decreases overall storage cost, his paper attempts to optimally size the SC size to increase battery health and hence, its life cycle. The proposed methodology is tested on a Hybrid Battery-SC ESS used for energy management of an islanded microgrid. The results show that by implementing the SC, the battery tends to age about 34% which also decrease the overall ESS cost by 2145$.
