The performance of a polymer redox supercapacitor based on poly(dithieno[3,4-b: 3′,4′-d] thiophene) in liquid and in polymer gel electrolyte was tested for capacity, energy density, power density and self-discharge. The results are very promising and demonstrate the viability of a symmetric supercapacitor based on an n-and p-doped electronically conducting polymer. © 1995.
