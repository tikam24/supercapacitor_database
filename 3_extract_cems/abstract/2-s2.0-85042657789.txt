In this paper, a novel distinctive one-dimension (1D) nanochain structures built by 3D hydrangea-like molybdenum disulfide nanoflowers (MoS2 NFs) decorated on SiC nanowires (SiC NWs) are firstly developed employing a simple hydrothermal strategy. The average diameter of MoS2 NFs is about 500 nm, which is composed of the vertically cross-linked nanosheets with the thickness of ∼30 nm, and the MoS2 NFs are tightly anchored onto the SiC NWs with stacking faults (SiC NWs@MoS2 NFs), directly serving as a class of the free-standing negative electrode materials for supercapacitors (SC). Based on the unique design, this hybrid electrode delivers high specific capacitance, and more importantly, it can manifest intriguing cycling stability with 96.6% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles and stable electrochemical performance at wide temperature range of 25–75 °C. When the electrode cools down to 25 °C again, its electrochemical performance is virtually consistent with the pristine state before heating. Consequently, this pioneering work not only offers a promising candidate for next-generation SC negative electrode materials but also provides a fresh clue in improving the capacitive performance of SC electrode through rational construction of particular nanostructures.
