Activated carbon derived from cellulose with added melamine sulfate, which is known as one of the chemicals having a flame-retardant effect on the cellulose, was produced in order to dope dual hetero elements, such as nitrogen and sulfur, and was used to improve the yields of the carbonization process and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) activation process. The addition of melamine sulfate resulted in suppression of the BET specific surface area. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area for the CO 2 -activated sample with 30 wt.%-added melamine sulfate was 578 m 2 g −1 . The existence of nitrogen atoms was confirmed in the CO 2 -activated sample with the added melamine sulfate. However, no peak assigned to the sulfur atom appeared in the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum for the sample with the 30 wt.%-added melamine sulfate. In spite of the lower specific surface area of the samples containing the added melamine sulfate, the capacitance values of the carbon material derived from the cellulose with added melamine sulfate were higher than those of the carbon material derived only from cellulose.
