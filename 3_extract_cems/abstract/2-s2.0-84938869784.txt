In this work, we demonstrate the results of studies on the synthesis, the structure and properties of carbon inverted opal (C-IOP) nanostructures, the surface of which is modified by oxide and sulfide of nickel. It is shown that the modification of the matrix C-IOP by nickel compounds led to a decreasing the specific surface area more than three times and was 250 m2/g. The specific capacitance of the capacitor with the C-IOP/NiO/Ni7S6 composite as electrode has increased more than 4 times, from 130 F/g to 600 F/g, as compared with the sample C-IOP without the modification by nickel compounds. The significant contribution of the faradaic reactions in specific capacitance of the capacitor electrodes of the composites is marked.
