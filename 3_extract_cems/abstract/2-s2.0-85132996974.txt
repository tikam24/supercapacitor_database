As a new family of 2D material, MXene has shown a huge potential in the application of supercapacitor because of their superior conductivity, abundant active sites and the stable layered structure. However, the electrochemical performance of MXene-based electrodes is limited by the stacking of the nanosheets. Herein, the flexible carbon nanotube (CNT) modified Ti3C2 (CNT@Ti3C2-300) film was obtained via facile filtration of the MXene and CNT suspension mixture followed by annealing. The CNT could effectively pillar the interlayer space of the nanosheets to avoid the layeraggregation and create a cross-linked conductive network in the film. The hybrid film exhibits high capacitance of 366.7 F g-1 at a current density 1 A g-1, excellent rate performance up to 75.1% at 20 A g-1 and long cycling life (98.7 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles at 20 A g-1). The above results indicate its huge potential application as flexible supercapacitors electrode.
