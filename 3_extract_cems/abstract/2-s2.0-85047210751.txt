A hierarchy control system for SPHBus (serial-parallel hybrid bus) was presented based on analyzing the configuration of bus and dynamic characteristics of components, such as the ultra-capacitor. The strategies of identifying driver intend, pattern recognition, and driving force control were studied. The real vehicle experiment analysis and validation of the control strategy were conducted. The simulation and experiment results show that by applying the supervisory control system to the SPHBus, the SPHBus can successfully realize the main functions. With the CUDC (China Urban Driving) Cycle as the objective driving cycle, the energy management control strategy was verified. And control strategy increases the efficiency of the driving system by 10%.
