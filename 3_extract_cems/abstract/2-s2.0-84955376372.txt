Nanoflake MnO2@carbon fiber coaxial nanocables were fabricated by a facile electrochemical deposition-oxidation route. The morphology, structure, composition, and pseudocapacitive performance of the obtained composite material were evaluated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements. The results show that the nanoflake MnO2 on the carbon fibers is highly amorphous and hydrous. The nanostructured material shows nearly symmetrical and rectangular CV curves in the scan-rate range from 2 to 50 mV s−1. When used as electrodes for supercapacitors, the material shows a capacitance of 511.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (based on the mass of MnO2), excellent high-rate capability, and cycling stability.
