In this work, Baoqing lignite was successfully separated into extract and residue by using KOH as the extractant, and then the extract and residue were activated respectively to prepare porous carbon materials (PCs). The results show that the activated extract (AE) is rich in mesopores and micropores, and the specific surface area is as high as 1378.38 m2/g, which is conducive to the adsorption of electrolyte ions. When acted as an electrochemical supercapacitor, the AE and the activated residue (AR) exhibit high specific capacitance of 276 F/g and 209.9 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. These data are better than the traditional KOH blending activation method (175.3 F/g). The specific capacitance of button battery assembled from AE is 299.9 F/g at 0.5 A/g, and the capacitance retention rate is 94.99% after 5000 cycles. Lignite is expected to become a supercapacitor electrode material with higher specific capacity, higher speed, and better reversibility.
