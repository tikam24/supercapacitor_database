Three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide network deposition on Ni foam (3D rGO/NF) was successfully synthesized by a new process. Here, the structure and loading of rGO deposition on Ni foam could be easily controlled by the synthesis conditions. Furthermore, it was directly applied as the electrode of supercapacitor, in which the electrochemical behaviors of 3D rGO/NF with various structures were further compared in detail. As a result, the rGO film deposition on backbones of Ni foam electrode delivered a higher specific capacitance comparing to rGO aerogel deposition on Ni foam. The result was attributed to that the direct and close contact between rGO film and Ni foam was beneficial to the enhanced conductivity of the electrode, as well as the improvement of ion diffusion/transport into the electrode for the rGO film deposition on backbones of Ni foam. The works provided a new way to controlled synthesis of rGO network at large scale for in various applications.
