Solid ionogel electrolytes with superior mechanical and electrical properties are critical to electrochemical power sources. Existing ionogel electrolytes are mainly based on three frameworks, including pristine polymers, copolymers and cross-linking polymers. But ionogel electrolytes coupling different networks are seldom reported. Here, double-network ionogel electrolytes have been developed. The polyacrylamide displays strong affinity to ions, while polyvinyl alcohol provides good mechanical properties. The electrolytes give ionic conductivity as 0.124 mS cm−1, while tensile modulus achieves as 196 MPa with breaking elongation of 2.13 %. The supercapacitors present high capacity of 184F g−1 with long life exceeding 30,000 cycles.
