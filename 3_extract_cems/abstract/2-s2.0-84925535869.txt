In this study, β-phase nickel hydroxide with a hexagonal brucite structure has been meshed with successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction deposited cupric oxide. The nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and UV–Vis-NIR spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the nanocomposite Ni(OH)2/CuO supercapacitor were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests in 1 M KOH solution. With the potential window between 0 and 0.5 V, a maximum specific capacitance ~27 F/g was observed at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Moreover, Ni(OH)2/CuO electrode in the symmetric device shows a low energy (1.0 Wh/kg) and power (242 W/kg) density.
