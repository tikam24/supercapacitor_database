Aqueous energy storage devices have drawn an increasing attention benefiting from their improved safety and reduced cost against the conventional organic systems. Hybrid capacitors that combine the advantages of both secondary batteries and electric double-layer capacitors are considered to be a promising next-generation electrical energy storage device. However, the nature of water decomposition at relatively low potential (usually âˆ¼1.23 V) limits the voltage window of aqueous hybrid capacitors and thereby hinders their application. For this reason, it is vital to develop the aqueous hybrid capacitors that can operate in larger voltage window by means of the electrode and electrolyte engineering. This review summarizes the design of both electrodes and electrolytes, as well as the regulating strategies at their interfaces, to expand voltage window of aqueous hybrid capacitors. Furthermore, suggestions and future vision of the high-voltage aqueous hybrid capacitors are provided to pave the way for their practical application.
