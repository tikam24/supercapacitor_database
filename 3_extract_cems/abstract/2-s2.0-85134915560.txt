Amorphous materials have snatched special attention for electrochemical energy storage applications owing to the presence of plenty of activate sites for energy storage. Herein, we report the microwave-assisted-hydrothermal synthesis of amorphous MoS2 with some 1T phase and in-situ-nano-engineering with C-dots for energy storage application. The specific capacitance (Cs) of a-MoS2/C-dots was found to be 1368 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1), which is ∼ 2.9 and 1.65 times higher than a-MoS2 (without C-dots) and crystalline c-MoS2/C-dots. Capacitance is also strongly dependent on synthesis methods: Cs of a-MoS2/C-dots is 2.15 times higher than h-MoS2/C-dots produced by the normal-hydrothermal method. The asymmetric supercapacitor was designed using a-MoS2/C-dots as cathode and activated-carbon as anode showing Cs 180.82 F g−1 at a maximum potential of 1.5 V. Energy density (ED) of 56.5 W h kg−1 at a power density (PD) of 750 W kg−1 with excellent capacitance retention was observed. The high Cs of a-MoS2/C-dots can be attributed to amorphous MoS2, formation of metallic 1T phase, good charge transport, and strong catalyst support interaction. This synthesis and in-situ nano engineering method of MoS2 may provide a promising technique for developing a high-performance supercapacitor for energy storage applications.
