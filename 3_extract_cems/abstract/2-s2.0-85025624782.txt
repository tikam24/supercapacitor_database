IrO2-Ta2O5 binary oxide coatings were prepared on Ti substrate by thermal decomposition. The influence of annealing temperature on the structure and capacitive performance was investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the structure-performance relationship was discussed. The results show that the phase of the coating annealed at < 350 ℃ still remains amorphous. When annealing at 370 ℃, the rutile phase appears and the coatings contain both crystalline and amorphous structures. The critical crystallization temperature of the IrO2-Ta2O5 is between 350 and 370 ℃. The specific capacitance of the IrO2-Ta2O5 increases with the increasing temperature up to 370 ℃, and then decreases with further increasing temperature. The electrodes annealed at 370 ℃ have the largest integral power, the minimum loss rate of electricity and the highest specific capacitance of 239.2 F/g. With the increasing annealing temperature, the charge transfer resistance Rct decreases.
