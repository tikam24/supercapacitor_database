A kind of Carbon nanotube-implanted mesoporous carbon sphere (CNTs-MCS) is successfully prepared by a facile polymerization-induced colloid aggregation method using gelatin as a soft template. SEM, TEM, BET measurement and BJH method reveal that the obtained CNTs-MCS possess a mesoporous character, with specific surface area (284 m2·g-1) and uniform pore size of 3.9 nm. As the electrode material for supercapacitor in 6 mol·L-1 KOH, a low equivalent series resistance of 0.9 Ω cm2 and a maximum specific capacitance of 189 F·g -1 with a measured power density of 8 kW·kg-1 at energy density of 26.3 Wh·kg-1 are obtained. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
