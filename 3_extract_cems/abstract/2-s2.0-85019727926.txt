The combination of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with silica nanoparticles as shaping agents results in an enhanced surface area of RGO by the inhibition of π–π stacking between the RGO sheets, leading to enhanced electrochemical properties of the polyaniline/RGO/silica nanocomposite. The nanocomposite exhibits a multidimensional structure, in which urchin-like polyaniline nanofibers are grown on the RGO ball and the surface of the silica nanoparticle is entirely sealed with the polyaniline and RGO sheets. The nanocomposite also demonstrates efficient electrochemical properties due to the enhanced surface area, electrical conductivity, and synergetic effects between RGO and polyaniline. This method could pave the way to the development of advanced devices for energy-storage systems.
