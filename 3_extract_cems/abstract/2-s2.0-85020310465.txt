Currently, aerogel materials have drawn great attention due to their excellent porous structure. To further enhance their mechanical and electrical properties, nanostructured carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have been applied to form various composites. In this work, we have employed a facile method to synthesize PEDOT:PSS conducting polymer aerogels embedded with carbon nanotubes. These aerogels are prepared using iron (III) chloride hexahydrate as crosslinkers. Surface morphology, pore properties, compression strength and electrochemical performance of the aerogel composites are evaluated. The effects of carbon nanotubes on aerogel morphology and their electrochemical performance are also investigated. It is found that the increase of CNTs content brings an improved electrochemical performance in term of a specific capacitance of 35 F gâˆ’1 and a cycling stability over 1000 cycles.
