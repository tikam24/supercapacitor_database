Iron oxides (FeOx), such as Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 materials, have attracted much attention because of their rich abundance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, FeOx, which is similar to most transition metal oxides, possesses a poor rate capability and cycling life. Thus, FeOx-based materials consisting of FeOx, carbon, and metal-based materials have been widely explored. This article mainly discusses FeOx-based materials (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) for electrochemical energy storage applications, including supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries (e.g., lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries). Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges of FeOx-based materials for electrochemical energy storage are briefly discussed.
