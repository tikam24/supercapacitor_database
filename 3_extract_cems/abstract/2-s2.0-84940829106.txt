The nucleation and growth of electrodeposited Mn oxide rods has been investigated by preparing deposits on Au coated Si at varying deposition times between 0.5 s and 10 min. The deposits were investigated using high resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy. A model for the nucleation and growth of Mn oxide rods has been proposed. Nucleation begins as thin sheets along Au grain boundaries and triple points. As these nucleation sites are consumed, nucleation spreads across the grains. Nucleation of sheets in close proximity causes agglomeration and the formation of rounded particles. Some of these rounded particles then accelerate in growth, initially in all directions and then primarily in the direction normal to the sample surface. Accelerated growth normal to the sample surface leads to the formation of rods. As rods grow, the growth of other particles accelerates and they become rods themselves. Eventually the entire sample surface is covered with rods 15-20 μm long and about 2 μm wide. The sheet-like morphology of the deposits is retained at all stages of deposition. Electron diffraction analysis of 3 s and 6 s deposits shows that the sheets are initially amorphous and then begin to crystallize into a cubic spinel Mn3O4 crystal structure. High resolution imaging of the 6 s sample shows small crystalline regions (∼5 nm in size) within an amorphous matrix.
