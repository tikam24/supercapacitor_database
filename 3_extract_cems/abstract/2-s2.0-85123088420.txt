Integration of faradaic and non-faradaic mechanisms of energy storage in a single capacitor is a promising approach for enhancing the energy density of supercapacitors. Here, we describe the fabrication and performance of the hybrid capacitor comprised of spinel NiMn2O4 as the pseudocapacitive electrode and activated carbon as EDLC electrode. Besides, the synthesis of binary metal oxide, NiMn2O4, at the nanoscale by simple sol–gel method and the analysis of its capacitive performance are discussed in detail. Because of the involvement of both transition metals, Ni and Mn, in the charge transfer reaction, NiMn2O4 exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 214 F g−1 in the alkaline electrolyte, 2 M NaOH. In hybrid configuration with hierarchically porous carbon electrode derived from corn husk, the potential window of the hybrid capacitor is extended beyond the decomposition potential of water since NiMn2O4 behaves as a positive electrode and activated carbon acts as a negative electrode in the hybrid configuration. As a result, the hybrid capacitor of the configuration AC || 2 M NaOH || NiMn2O4 delivers the highest capacitance of 51 F g−1 within the potential window of 0.0 to 1.6 V. It exhibits a high energy density of 5.33 Wh kg−1 and high power density of 4601.62 W kg−1.
