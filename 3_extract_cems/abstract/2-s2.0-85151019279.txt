Since a composite electrode made of carbon and transition metal oxides has much potential to be the best electrode type for a future energy storage system, the low-temperature solution growth method was used to make a carbon framework from sweet potato with NiCo2O4 nanoparticles attached to it. This method is easy, cheap, and can be used for large-scale commercial production. FTIR spectra a peak band of Ni-O and Co-O and the bending functional group at wave number 857 cm−1. XRD shows the crystal planes (1 1 1), (2 2 0), (3 3 1), (2 2 2), (4 0 0), (4 2 2), (5 1 1), and (4 4 0) at 2θ = 18.97°, 31.97°, 37.51°, 38.10°, 44.55°, 55.51°, 58.65°, and 64.92°, which indicates the NiCo2O4. The typical broad peaks around 23.3° can be linked to (0 0 2) lattice planes of amorphous carbon. The average size of the grains in the NiCo2O4/C samples was found to be 21.5 ± 0.5 nm. VSM shows that NiCo2O4/C has strong magnet properties. Based on the CV curve formed, it can be seen that NiCo2O4/C-2.8 has a balanced cathodic and anodic curve and also a higher current density than the others. It shows that NiCo2O4/C-2.8 has a higher ability to move electrons. The addition of the number of variations in the carbon mixture in NiCo2O4 shows the specific capacitance. It shows that carbon can prevent the movement of electrons in NiCo2O4, causing a decrease in performance. The right amount of carbon can increase the electron transfer ability.
