Nitrogen-co-doped MoS2@rGO composites (named hereafter N-MoS2@N-RGO) are prepared by the hydrothermal method using dicyandiamide or hydrazine monohydrate as the nitrogen source. N-MoS2@rGO is obtained by the hydrothermal reaction of thioacetamide, ammonium molybdate and GO precursors in the presence of dicyandiamide, while N-MoS2@N-RGO is synthesized using the same precursors in the presence of hydrazine monohydrate as the nitrogen source. On the one hand, N-MoS2@RGO displays excellent performance and good capacitance value of 335 F/g acquired at 0.5A/g and improved stability (∼94% of the original capacitance is preserved after 5000 cycles). On the other hand, compared with N-MoS2@RGO, N-MoS2@N-RGO possesses a slightly higher capacitance of 340 F/g recorded at 0.5A/g and better cycling stability (∼98% of its original value after 5000 cycles). Taken together, the results of this investigation clearly indicate that the fabricated composites have application prospect in energy storage devices.
