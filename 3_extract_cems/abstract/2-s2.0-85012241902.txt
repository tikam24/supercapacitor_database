A hierarchical nanostructured hydrous copper oxide/hydroxide (CuO/(OH)2) with tuneable morphologies are grown on stainless steel (SS) as binder free, robust adhesive thin film electrode by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The influence of bath temperature on physico-chemical properties and electrochemical properties are studied. The morphology of the yields can be tailored only by controlling the reaction temperature of the bath and has shown prominence for the self-assembled growth leads transformation from hierarchical nano-bricks, nano-leaves to nanobuds nanostructures. Assisting from the distinctive structural characteristics, the resultant copper oxide/hydroxide nano-bricks, leaves and buds show superior electrochemical performance with specific capacitance values from ∼340 to 140 F g−1at 1 mA cm−2. The improved electrochemical performance of integrated binder free electrode signposts their potential capability in energy storage applications.
