This research focuses on the power flow controlling strategy of a battery/super-capacitor hybrid energy based storage in electric vehicles. When acceleration is abruptly increased, the peak power demand rises, and the battery life decreases. A super capacitor-based additional energy storage device is used to overcome this constraint. The suggested ARDUINO-based system is designed to detect high power consumption, cruise and regular acceleration modes, and switch between battery and super-capacitor storage as needed to extend battery life. The proposed electric vehicle regulating approach has the advantage of effectively tracking a predetermined speed profile. As a result, the battery size is adjusted, and the power efficiency of the hybrid energy storage system is improved. Finally, the MATLAB/Simulink platform confirms the efficacy of the simulated outcome.
