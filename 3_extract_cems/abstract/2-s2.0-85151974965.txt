MnO2 nanowires/polyaniline composite (MnO2NW/PANI) was prepared by combining one-dimensional MnO2 nanowires (MnO2NW) with conductive polymer PANI surface coating. The MnO2NW were synthesized via a one-pot facile hydrothermal method. The composite MnO2NW/PANI was then prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline monomer on the surface of MnO2NW. The MnO2NW/PANI was able to serve as electroactive material and demonstrated a specific capacitance of 306.7 F/g recorded at a current density is 0.5 A/g, which is 28.4% higher than that of pristine MnO2 (only 238.9 F/g). The reduced electric resistance within MnO2NW/PANI interconnection networks and the good synergistic effect between MnO2NW and PANI for fast ion/charge transfer supports the enhanced capacitance of the composite. In addition, the MnO2NW/PANI composite electrode shows stable cycle performance, with capacity retention of 88.7% after 5000 repeated cycles test at a high current density of 5 A/g. The constructed nanocomposites have great potential in the further development of high-performance electrochemical electrode materials for energy storage application.
