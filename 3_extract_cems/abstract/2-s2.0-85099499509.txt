The preparation of stable and efficient thin films with excellent energy storage and conversion capabilities has attracted great attention in the field of supercapacitors and electrocatalysis. Herein, hierarchical nanosheets-based ternary CoNiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) thin films are prepared via an inexpensive and facile electrodeposition method. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of films are systematically studied and compared with their binary counterparts. As prepared CoNiFe LDH shows a maximum specific capacity of 360 C g−1 at the current density of 0.4 A g−1 with a capacity retention of 51% even at the higher current density of 10 A g−1. Moreover, it shows excellent cyclic stability of 84% after 2000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, CoNiFe LDH demonstrates an excellent performance in OER, affording an overpotential of 196 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope value of 49 mV dec−1. Also, it depicts excellent catalytic stability with stable operation for over 10 h. Thus, ternary CoNiFe LDH thin film can be used as a promising electrode material for both electrochemical energy storage and catalysis.
