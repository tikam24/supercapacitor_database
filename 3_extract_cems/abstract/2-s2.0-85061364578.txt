Micro supercapacitor (MSC) featured by high capacitance density, has great potential for replacing bulky electrolytic capacitors in circuits to make electronics of miniaturization, yet suffers from sharp capacitance drop under alternating current. Here, we report a circuit-integratable high-frequency MSC with hybrid architecture electrode, in which 2D pseudocapacitive MXene served as the active material provides large capacitance and multi-walled carbon nanotube applied as interlayer support offers fast ion transport paths. Such design brings the device an excellent frequency response and a capacitance density much higher than commercial tantalum capacitors at 120 Hz. A novel transfer-free filtration technology greatly eliminates the equivalent series resistance and the consequent thermal loss, and makes the MSC a more circuit-integratable planar geometry. Moreover, such high-frequency MSC is applied in a low-pass filtering circuit and a relaxation oscillator circuit, displaying advantages in function, size and intergratability compared with electrolytic capacitors.
