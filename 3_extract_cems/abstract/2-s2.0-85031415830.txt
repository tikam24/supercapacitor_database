MnMoO4 nanotubes of diameter about 120 nm were successfully synthesized by a single-spinneret electrospinning technique followed by calcination in air, and their structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties were studied with the aim to fabricate high-performance supercapacitor devices. The obtained MnMoO4 nanotubes display a 1D architecture with a porous structure and hollow interiors. Benefiting from intriguing structural features, the unique MnMoO4 nanotube electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and cycling stability. As an example, the tube-like MnMoO4 delivers a specific capacitance of 620 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and 460 F g−1 even at a very high current density of 60 A g−1. Remarkably, almost no decay in specific capacitance is found after continuous charge/discharge cycling for 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated from this MnMoO4 nanotubes and activated carbon displayed a maximum high energy density of 31.7 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 797 W kg−1, demonstrating a good prospect for practical applications in energy storage electronics.
