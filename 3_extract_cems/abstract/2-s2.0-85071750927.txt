Energy storage devices with high performance have been extensively studied for decades due to the increasing fuel demands. The physicochemical properties of 2D materials such as MoS2 and graphene, due to their high surface area, versatile electronic structure, high mechanical robustness, high electrical conductivity, and desirable electrochemical characteristics, make them superior candidates for energy storage applications. MoS2/graphene composites specially emerge as exceptional candidates that could offer new solution for energy storage applications. Many fabrication strategies to develop and synthesize MoS2/graphene composites are explored and introduced, such as hydrothermal and solvothermal treatment, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sonication, microwave, and self-assembly. For these composites to be suitable for energy storage devices applications, they are often integrated with other materials such as additional agents to improve their electrochemical and stability properties. In this review, recent progresses on the development of graphene/MoS2 composites for energy storage and conversion applications (supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, and hydrogen evolution) are presented and discussed. Critical review and perspectives on the future directions for MoS2/graphene compositeâ€“based energy storage devices are also presented as concluding remarks.
