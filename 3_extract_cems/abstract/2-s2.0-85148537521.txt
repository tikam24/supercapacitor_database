Hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), which can effectively induce sonochemical effects, is widely considered a promising process intensification technology. In the present study, HC was successfully utilized to intensify the alkali activation of GPs for SCs, for the first time. Five BDCMs were synthesized following the method reported in the literature. For comparison, four more BDCMs with HC-treated, among which a sample was further doped with nitrogen during the HC treatment, were prepared. Then all the samples were compared from microscopical characteristics to electrochemical performance as SCs materials. The morphology study demonstrated that the HC treatment had created many defects and amorphous carbon structures on the GP-based BDCMs, with the highest SSA reaching 3272 m2/g (1:6-HCGP), which 32 folded that of the Raw carbon sample's. The HC treatment also intensified the N-doping process. XRD and XPS results manifested that the N content had been increased and consequently changed the electronic structure of the carbon atoms, leading to the increase of specific capacitance (1:6-HCGP+N-based SC, 227 F/g at 10 A/g). The cycle performance proved that the GP-based BDCMs have long-term stability, indicating that the HC-treated BDCMs were good choices for energy storage technologies. Compared with the ultrasound-assisted method, which may have a high energy density, the HC-assisted method enables high production and energy efficiency. This work is a first time attempt towards the industrial application of HC method in energy-related materials synthesis and encourages more in-depth studies in the future.
