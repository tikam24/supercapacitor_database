Due to the unique properties of carbon nano materials, they exhibit great potential in energy storage and conversion devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. The present work reports a novel method to synthesise of ultrathin graphite film (UTGF) directly on Cu foil using a well-known chemical vapour deposition process. Such electrode materials are attractive for use in supercapacitors as electrodes, due to their high stability, surface area and low fabrication. Existing approaches for fabricating additive-free (binder-and carbon black-free) and metallic current collector-free electrodes are complex. In order to overcome this complexities, we have directly grown UTGF over Cu foil without using any additive.
