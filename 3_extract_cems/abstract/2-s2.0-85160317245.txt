The electrochemical paradigm of a supercapacitor (SC) is effective for investigating cutting-edge deformable and haptic materials made of magnetic compound fluid (MCF) rubber in order to advance the production of bio-inspired sensors as artificial haptic sensors mimicking human tissues. In the present study, we measure the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles and electric properties with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to morphologically evaluate the intrinsic structure of MCF rubber containing fillers and agents. In addition, the electrochemical mechanisms of molecule and particle behavior are theorized using the SC physical framework. The solid-doped fillers in the MCF rubber characterized the behavior of the electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC). Meanwhile, the liquid agents showed the characteristics of a pseudocapacitor (PC) due to the redox response among the molecules and particles. The potential responses to extraneous stimuli relevant to the EIS properties, categorized as slow adaption (SA), fast adaption (FA), and other type (OT), were also analyzed in terms of the sensory response of the bio-inspired sensor. The categories were based on how the response was induced from the EIS properties. By controlling the EIS properties with different types of doping agents, sensors with various sensory responses become feasible.
