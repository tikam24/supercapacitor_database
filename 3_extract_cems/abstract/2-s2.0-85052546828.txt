Conductive polyaniline is one of the most studied conductive polymers in recent ten years. It has the characteristics of high specific capacity, good redox reversibility, high conductivity, simple synthesis method, and low cost. It is the most widely used in chemical power supply and supercapacitor. The synthesis method of conductive polyaniline composite material is mainly divided into in situ composite method, blending method, self-assembly, electrochemical recombination method and so on. Conductive polyaniline composite can be used as a high-energy material to develop electrode materials, but there are few studies on the modification of the lithium-ion battery ternary cathode materials by using conductive polyaniline. The thermoelectric properties of conductive polyaniline and its composites are reviewed. The performance of conductive polyaniline / lithium ion battery composite cathode materials are discussed. Finally, the application and prospect of conductive polyaniline composites were summarized, and the application and prospect of conductive polyaniline coated modified LiNi1-x-yCoxMnyO2 composites were briefly introduced.
