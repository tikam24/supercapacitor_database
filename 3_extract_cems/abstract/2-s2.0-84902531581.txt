In this report, we have systematically investigated the effect of SWCNTs on the electrochemical performance of BiVO4: a material not studied for energy storage. Loading of 20 wt% SWCNTs with BiVO4 exhibited the highest specific capacitance (395 F g-1) and up to 88% coulombic efficiency was obtained over 200 cycles of charge-discharge for this composite.
