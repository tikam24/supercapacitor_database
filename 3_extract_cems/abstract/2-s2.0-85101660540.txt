In the present work, poly(o-anisidine)/carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide (POA/CNT/rGO) nanocomposite is synthesized by in-situ polymerization method. Surface morphology of the prepared nanocomposite is investigated by field emission-SEM. The FE-SEM results show that POA is grew onto the surface of rGO. The POA/CNT/rGO composite exhibits a specific capacitance (Cs) of 142F g−1 by galvanostatic charge/discharge, which is lower than Cs of the POA/rGO, but much higher than pure POA and POA/CNT. These values for POA/CNT/rGO, POA/rGO and POA/CNT are obtained to be 274.9, 300.2 and 226.3F g−1, respectively. The results show that by addition of 1.0 wt% CNTs into rGO, cycle life of the POA/CNT/rGO composite is greatly improved due to the maintenance of highly conductive paths as well as mechanical strength during charge/discharge process. After 500 cycles, Cs the POA/CNT/rGO decreases only 7% of the initial capacitance compared to 50% and 60% for POA/rGO and POA/CNT composites, respectively.
