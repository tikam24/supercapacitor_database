Flexible energy storage systems have become attractive alternatives for applications in wearable energy storage and sensor devices. This study reports a simple electro-polymerization method for the fabrication of PPy films coated on PPy nanotubes (PPy NTs), which are binding-free, self-standing, and could be used as a flexible electrode for supercapacitors. With optimized kinetics for ion transportation, the mass specific capacitance of the flexible porous PPy films can be elevated to 1.36 F cm−2 at a charging/discharging rate of 2 mA cm−2 (0.45 A g−1). The mass specific capacitance of the flexible porous PPy films reaches 6.5 times as large as that of compact PPy films at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Furthermore, due to the large free space for volume change, the capacitance fading of the flexible porous PPy films is less than 3% after 10 000 cycles. This novel design provides an efficient method to synthesize high-performance, flexible and low-cost materials used in supercapacitors.
