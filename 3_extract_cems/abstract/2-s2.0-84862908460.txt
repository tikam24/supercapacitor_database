Supercapacitor electrode materials: Carbon nanocages are conveniently produced by an in situ MgO template method and demonstrate high specific capacitance over a wide range of charging- discharging rates with high stability, superior to the most carbonaceous supercapacitor electrode materials to date. The large specific surface area, good mesoporosity, and regular structure are responsible for the excellent performance. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
