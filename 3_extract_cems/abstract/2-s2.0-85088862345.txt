In this article we report the synthesis of polypyrrole incorporated nickel oxide multi walled carbon nanotube (NiO@NMWCNT/PPy) composites by thermal reduction protocol for supercapacitor applications. The structural and morphological properties of the composites were confirmed by the aid of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM) analysis indicating the hexagonal crystal structure of NiO decorated on NMWCNT/Ppy. The electrochemical characteristics of the NiO@MWCNT/PPy composite were analyzed in the presence of 2 M KOH as an electrolyte. The NiO@NMWCNT/PPy nanostructured composite produced a plenty of active sites for ion migration reactions that facilitate the energy storage mechanism. As a proof of concept demonstration, the NiO@NMWCNT/PPy composite was explored as an electrode materials in supercapacitor and exhibited specific capacitance of 395 F g−1 and cyclic stability up to 5000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Enhanced performance of composite is attributed to the incorporation of polypyrrole in NiO@NMWCNT. The improved capacitance and cyclic stability demonstrated by the composite indicates the NiO@NMWCNT/PPy to be a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
