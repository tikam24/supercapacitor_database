High-quality binder-free electrodes are the core parts of film supercapacitors, and play an important role in the advancement of energy storage systems. In this work, we report advanced TiC@C composites by a facile chemical vapor deposition method. Interestingly, carbon shell is uniformly coated on the surface of highly conductive TiC core to form integrated binder-free electrodes. Integration design can ensure good mechanical stability, fast ion and electron transfer and large active area. The electrochemical performance of TiC@C composites is characterized as the electrodes of supercapacitors, and show enhanced capacitance and cycling life. The TiC@C composites deliver a capacitance of 120 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and keep good retention. Our research provides a new carbon-based electrode for supercapacitor application.
