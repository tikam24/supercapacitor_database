A hybrid nanocomposite (NCO-CNF) with 3D hierarchical porous nickel cobalt-oxide (NCO) nanosheets structure was successfully constructed on the surface of the N-doped carbon nanofiber (CNF) through the combination of electrospinning, hydrothermal and heat-treatment process, where the CNF as a structural scaffold and excellent conductor to improve the conduction of electrons and effectively prevent aggregation of NCO-CNF nanosheets. Thus, generating a synergistic electrochemical enhancement through maximize utilization of two components and strong coupling interaction between 1D CNF and 2D NCO nanosheets. The resultant NCO-CNF delivered outstanding specific capacitance as high as 343 F g−1 in three electrode system. Furthermore, the obtained NCO-CNF can as the positive electrode while the CNF serves as the negative electrode to assemble the solid asymmetric supercapacitor and the energy density of NCO-CNF//CNF is up to 44.8 Wh kg−1 (44.8 μWh cm−2). This work leaves more strategies for utilizing effectively 2D nanomaterials and carbon fiber.
