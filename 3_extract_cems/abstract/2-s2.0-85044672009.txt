Titanium dioxide-based nanocomposites were prepared by simple mixing titanium dioxide with activated ilmenite and leucoxene. Raw ilmenite and leucoxene ore were firstly activated by modified ball-milling process by sulfuric acid assist to obtain activated ilmenite and leucoxene. The mixture between activated ilmenite/leucoxene with commercial anatase titanium dioxide and followed by heat treatment samples demonstrate enhance electrochemical capacitor performance. Phase compositions of prepared samples were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The local structure changes were investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The particle size and morphology were studied by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The chemical states of the nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposites were conducted using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Results in this work introduce cost-effectiveness and simple route to prepare electroactive nanocomposite electrode materials from natural ore with enhanced electrochemical capability. The particle size, structure, morphology, heterojunction interface and surface characteristics show significant key to improve electron transfer activity regarding the modification of the specific active sites.
