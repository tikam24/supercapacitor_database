Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) has been used to study the electrochemical precipitation of Mn (OH) 2 on a Au crystal and its capacitance properties. From the EQCM data, it is inferred that NO 3- ions get adsorbed on the Au crystal and then undergo reduction, resulting in an increase in pH near the electrode surface. Precipitation of Mn2+ occurs as Mn (OH) 2, with an increase in mass of the Au crystal. Mn (OH) 2 undergoes oxidation to MnO2, which exhibits electrochemical supercapacitor behavior on subjecting to electrochemical cycling in a Na2 SO4 electrolyte. EQCM data indicate mass variations corresponding to surface insertion/extraction of Na+ ions during discharge/charge cycling. Â© 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
