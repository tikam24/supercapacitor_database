In recent years, as a flexible electrode material, melamine foam has attracted more and more attention from researchers in the field of wearable energy storage devices. In addition, certain components are loaded on it to improve electrochemical performance and further promote its advantages. Here, we first carbonized commercial melamine foam in N2 atmosphere to form in situ doping and then used a simple hydro-thermal reaction to uniformly load MnO2 nanosheet arrays on its three-dimensional framework. For the resulting electrode material, the specific capacitance was as high as 230.3 F/g under the current density of 1 A/g. With the voltage window of 0â€“2.2 V, the energy density of the assembled quasi-solid supercapacitor reached 29.73 Wh/kg with the power density of 1636.9 W/kg, showing great electrochemistry performance and application prospects.
