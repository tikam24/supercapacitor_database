Metal–oxygen batteries have been growing rapidly as an energy storage technology in light of their high specific energy density. However, waste metal–oxygen batteries will raise many environmental issues; therefore, the recycling and reusing of the spent metal–oxygen batteries has attracted great attention. Herein, we report the 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) as a redox mediator for manganese–oxygen battery (MOB). Trace amounts of PTIO result in the discharge capacity of MOB increase to 2588 mAh g−1 and enhance the formation of manganese dioxide (MnO2) with toroidal appearance and high crystallinity on the cathode. After being used, the dismantled MnO2/carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode can be reused as an electrode for supercapacitor via simple calcining at mild temperature. The recycled free-standing MnO2/CNT electrode demonstrates an exceptional specific capacitance (253.86 F g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, we prepare an asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated with the recycled MnO2/CNT electrode and activated carbon (AC), which exhibits excellent energy density (32.00 Wh kg−1 at 413.70 W kg−1) with 78.26% retention over 6000 cycles. This work provides a promising strategy to derive high-quality and high-value MnO2/CNT electrode materials from the spent MOBs. Graphical abstract: It’s the 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) as aredox mediator for manganese-oxygen battery (MOB). The recycled manganese dioxide (MnO2)/carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode can be reused as an electrode for supercapacitor via simple calcining at mild temperature. The recycled MnO2/CNT electrode shows the toroidal appearance and high crystallinity. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated with the MnO2/CNT free-standing electrode displays high specific capacitance, superior energy density, and good cyclic ability.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
