Nowadays, designing and fabricating efficient and cost-effective materials as electrodes for energy conversion and storage systems are highly desired. Various nanostructures with a high surface area and a large number of active sites are explored to enhance their electrochemical capacitance. Herein mesoporous molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanomaterials are synthesized using a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal approach. High electrochemical activity and excellent stability of MoSe2 NFs//MoSe2 NRs in a symmetrical configuration suggest their great potential in energy storage applications. The device exhibits a capacity of 133 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1, and maintains 92% of the primary capacitance after 2000 cycles. The maximum energy density of 36.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1.4 kW kg-1 and a power density of 6.48 kW kg-1 at an energy density of 18 Wh kg-1 are achieved at an operating voltage of 1.4 V. And it also displays prominent electrochemical performance after mechanical bending, indicating its great potential for flexible supercapacitors.
