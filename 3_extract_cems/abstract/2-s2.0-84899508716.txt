This Letter reports a preparation of Ni(OH)2/CNTs nanoflake composites for supercapacitor applications. The composites were synthesized using a facile and cost-effective chemical precipitation method. Compared with the pure nickel hydroxides, the Ni(OH)2/CNTs nanocomposite exhibits a much better electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 720 F/g at 1 A/g. The enhanced performance can be attributed to a synergetic effect of hydroxides and CNTs with better electrical conductivity and more porous structure to facilitate both ion and charge transport.
