Rationally constructing the electrode with the hierarchical structure, different components, and the flexibility is a promising approach to further improve the electrochemical properties and meet the demand for flexible electronic devices. In this paper, for the first time, hafnium carbide nanowires (HfCNWs) networks, with the metrics of large specific surface area, excellent conductivity, and chemical/physical stability, are served as nanoscale conductive skeletons on carbon cloth (CC) for supporting the porous NiCo2O4 nanosheets (NSs). Benefiting from the structural advantages, the as-formed free-standing core-shell NiCo2O4NSs@HfCNWs/CC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 2102 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good rate capability (85% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1) and outstanding cycling stability (98% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1). Additionally, assembled with the NiCo2O4NSs@HfCNWs/CC and activated carbon (AC)/CC, the flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 53 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and excellent performance stability with good flexibility. More impressively, our work could not only further widen the application of HfCNWs, but also put forward the new thinking of rational construction of high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
