We have fabricated nanocomposite electrode materials consisting of manganese-molybdenum mixed oxide and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for supercapacitor application. The process involves electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of multi-walled CNTs onto an ITO electrode, followed by anodic deposition of Mn-Mo oxide from an aqueous MnSO4 solution with MoO4 2- anions. The composite electrodes with a variety of combinations of Mn-Mo oxide and CNTs were evaluated systematically with the aim of maximizing the capacitive properties of the oxide. Optimization led to a high specific capacitance of 408 F g-1 (2 mV s-1) with an area-normalized capacitance of 31 mF cm-2. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
