Electrodes of rationally designed composite nanostructures can offer many opportunities for the enhanced performance in electrochemical energy storage. This paper attempts to illustrate the design and production of NiMoO4/polypyrrole core-shell nanostructures on nickel foam to be used in supercapacitor via a facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition process. It has been verified that this novel nanoscale morphology has outstanding capacitive performances. While employed as electrodes in supercapacitors, the composite nanostructures showed remarkable electrochemical performances with a great areal capacitance (3.2F/cm2 at a current density of 5mA/cm2), and a significant cycle stability (80% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). The above results reveal that the composite nanostructures may be a likely electrode material for high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
