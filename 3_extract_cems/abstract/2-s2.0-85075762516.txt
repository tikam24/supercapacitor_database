Functionalized porous carbons have received increased attention in both gas and supercapacitive energy storage. We report heteroatom-rich porous carbons derived from two conjugated microporous polyaminoanthraquinone networks via a straightforward pyrolysis pathway, showing high contents of nitrogen (N, max. 5.2 wt%) and oxygen (O, max. 8.3 wt%), uniform micropore (∼0.6 nm) and large surface area (1165 m2 g−1). In comparison to the polymer precursors, the resulting porous carbons exhibit much improved CO2 uptake capacity of 14.1 wt% at 1 bar maintaining an impressive reversible CO2 uptake after 50 times use. More importantly, they can be applied for efficient supercapacitors with high energy storage capacity (200 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), fast charge/discharge rate (charge to 158 F g−1 with only 25 s), and excellent stability (retain 98.5% capacity after 6000 cycles).
