Supercapacitors are considered to be one of the most promising development directions of energy storage systems because of their low cost, environmental protection and high energy density. The performance of supercapacitors is determined with the quality of electrode materials. Co3O4, a kind of electrode material for supercapacitor, has attracted more and more attention in recent years due to its advantages of high theoretical capacity, low cost and natural abundance. In this review, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of Co3O4-based electrode materials are discussed in detail. Finally, the research and development prospect of Co3O4-based electrode materials have been discussed.
