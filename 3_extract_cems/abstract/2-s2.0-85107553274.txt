In this paper, a well-designed process to fabricate bio-mass carbon with ultra-high specific surface area (UHSSA) and hierarchical porous (HP) structure is achieved. The process pre-Treating with ethanol and KOH cooperatively is first introduced to optimize the microstructure and porosity. The as-prepared carbons present an UHSSA of ca. 3521 m2 g-1, with large amounts of micro and mesopores. The assembled asymmetric flexible super-capacitor (SC) holds very high energy density of 49.9 Wh kg-1 at 90 W kg-1, and 10.3 Wh kg-1 at the higher power density of 9 kW kg-1, demonstrating that the device possesses long cyclic life and well stability. The exciting results reveal that our study provides an effective approach to biomass recycling by pre-Treatment of ethanol and KOH producing HP carbons possessing ultra-high SSA for high-energy storage applications.
