Flexible and attachable body fluid monitoring smart systems are considered to be one of the most important wearable electronic devices for personal health. In this work, we fabricated a wearable self-powered-like sweat monitoring system with integrated micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). The monitoring system composes of NiCo 2 O 4 /chitosan based glucose sensor, ion selective membrane based [Na + ] and [K + ] sensors, and NiCo 2 O 4 -based MSCs as the power source of the sensor arrays. As-fabricated NiCo 2 O 4 -based MSCs displayed excellent electrochemical performance with an energy density of 0.64 μW/cm 2 at the power density of 0.09 mW/cm 2 . The designed wearable sweat monitoring system showed high sensitivities of 0.5 μA/μM for glucose, 0.031 nF/mM for [Na + ] and 0.056 nF/mM for [K + ], respectively. By further integrating with signal transduction, conditioning and wireless transmission technology (WiFi), the smart system can easily and accurately realize the real-time monitoring of perspiration displayed on individual cellphone for assessment of personal physiological state. The designed wearable smart monitoring system presented potential applications in personalized diagnostic and physiological health.
