NiCo2O4-based materials are promising for high-performance energy storage materials. Here, we report the synthesis of urchin-like NiCo2O4 particles via the hydrothermal urea precipitation process, and studied the effect of urea concentrations on phase purity, microstructure, and electrochemical capacitor performance. NiCl2· 6H2O, CoCl2·6H2O and urea, were weighed as Ni:Co:urea = 1:2:[5, 10 or 15] in molar fraction, and they were dissolved in distilled water and hydrothermally heated at 140°C for 6 h. The three precursors were calcined at 350°C for 3 h in air atmosphere. The three products were mainly composed of 310 ¯m sized urchin-like particles. All the final samples had 520 nm sized mesopores and 35070 m2/g of specific surface area, but the distributions of Ni and Co in the urchin-like particles were affected by the starting urea concentration. The sample of single-phase NiCo2O4 from Ni:Co:urea = 1:2:15 showed the best electrochemical capacitor performance among the three urea concentrations.
