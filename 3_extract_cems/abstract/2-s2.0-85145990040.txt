Herein, photocatalytic activity of pure SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were investigated using degradation of Alizarin Red S (AR S), Brilliant Green (BG) and Methyl Orange (MO) dyes under direct sunlight irradiation. Additionally, electrochemical performance of SnO2 NPs were studied. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and tin (IV) chloride pentahydrate (SnCl4·5H2O) were used to synthesize SnO2 NPs through a hydrothermal process. The prepared samples were characterized by thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS), photoluminescence (PL) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). After 120 min of sunlight exposure the maximum degradation of AR S, BG and MO dyes had reached to 39, 74 and 59 % respectively. It was found that the BG dye exhibited better photocatalytic degradation. Cyclic voltammeter (CV), galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured to study the electrochemical performance of SnO2 NPs. The nanostructured SnO2 electrode revealed a favourable specific capacitance of 183 Fg−1 at a current density of 5 Ag−1. It had an excellent cycling stability of 79.69 % retention over 1000 charging and discharging cycles.
