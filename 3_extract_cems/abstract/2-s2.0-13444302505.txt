The characteristics of RuO2-SnO2 nanocrystalline- embedded amorphous electrode, grown by DC reactive sputtering, was investigated. X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and transmission electron diffraction (TED) examination results showed that Sn and Ru metal cosputtered electrode in O2/Ar ambient have RuO 2-SnO2 nanocrystallines in an amorphous oxide matrix. It is shown that the cyclic voltammorgram (CV) result of the RuO 2-SnO2 nanocrystalline-embedded amorphous film in 0.5 M H2SO4 liquid electrolyte is similar to a bulk-type supercapacitor behavior with a specific capacitance of 62.2 mF/cm2 μm. This suggests that the RuO2-SnO2 nanocrystalline-embedded amorphous film can be employed in hybrid all-solid state energy storage devises as an electrode of supercapacitor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
