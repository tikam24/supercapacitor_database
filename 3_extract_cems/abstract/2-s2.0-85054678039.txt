Current collector is an important component of supercapacitors to transport electrons from/to the electroactive materials. However, its role has not received the attention it deserves. In this work, we have put forward a facile electrochemical approach that treats graphite (GP) to obtain superficial expansion-treated graphite (Ex-GP), which is used as the current collector/substrate for electrodeposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). We have also examined and optimized the electrodeposition mode and parameter of PEDOT. Electrochemical measurements indicate that Ex-GP/PEDOT electrodes exhibit obviously enhanced electrochemical performances comparing to GP/PEDOT electrodes. This is attributed to the reduced constriction and spreading resistance for the former, due to increased area of contact spots at the current collector/electroactive material interface. Herein Ex-GP/PEDOT electrodes achieve a high specific capacitance of 135.4 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2. A highly flexible solid-state supercapacitor is further fabricated with Ex-GP/PEDOT electrodes. The supercapacitor device exhibits high rate capability (maintaining 73.8% of capacitance as current density increases for 20 times), superior energy/power characteristics (1.45 mW h cm−3 at power density of 49.6 mW cm−3), and remarkable cycle performance (maintaining 95.8% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles), which holds great promise for use in flexible electronics. The present study is expected to stimulate further research activities on optimizing current collector/active material interface for boosted supercapacitive properties.
