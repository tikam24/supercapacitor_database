The transition metal phosphides have drawn wide attention as positive material used in supercapacitors owing to the excellent conductivity and electrochemical activity. In this work, the novel composite Co(OH)F@CoP core-shell nanoarrays, used as electrode material for supercapacitors, was synthesized on conductive carbon cloth (CC) through the hydrothermal method and phosphating process. The specific capacitance of Co(OH)F@CoP/CC is 654mC cm−2 at 1 mA·cm−2, and maintains long-life cycling stability of 71.34 % retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 mA·cm−2 in a three electrode system. Furthermore, a two-electrode system assembled by Co(OH)F@CoP and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) exhibits performance with energy density of 17.933 Wh kg−1 at power density of 800 W kg−1. These results proved that the Co(OH)F@CoP composite is an advanced electrode material for the supercapacitors.
