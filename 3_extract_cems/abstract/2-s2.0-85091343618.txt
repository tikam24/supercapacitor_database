Wastes produced during food processing in day to day life can cause environmental pollution if not managed properly. One of the best methods to overcome such a problem is to convert this wastage into compost, which can strengthen our ecosystem. However, it may not be possible to convert it into compost every time and thus an alternate process is the need of time. In this regard, the present research work proposed a green synthesis pyrolysis method for ternary-doped layered graphene nanosheets (DGNS) from onion peel wastage. This synthesis process is economically feasible and easily scalable. Further, synthesized DGNS have been analyzed with various characterizations. Finally, electrochemical studies have been also performed to analyze DGNS for energy storage applications. The highest capacitance attained using synthesized materials is 450 A g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density with 2 M H2SO4 electrolytic solution. These results indicated that DGNS are suitable electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
