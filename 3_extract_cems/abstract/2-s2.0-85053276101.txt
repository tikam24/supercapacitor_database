Biomass-based nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning a mixture of polyacrylonitrile and acid-treated biomass from industrial hemp straw. The as-prepared biomass-based nanofibers were then carbonized and activated by high-temperature carbonization and KOH to obtain the activated biomass-based carbon nanofibers. The scanning electron microscopy images show that the precursors and carbon nanofibers are composed of fibers 179 nm in diameter, and the nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements indicate that the carbon nanofibers possess a high-specific surface area of 2348.73 m 2 ·g −1 . The carbon nanofibers exhibit excellent electrical performance. The specific capacitance is as high as 244.8 F·g −1 at a current density of 1 A·g −1 . The specific capacitance remains at 96% after 3000 cycles of charge and discharge at a current density of 2 A·g −1 , showing excellent cycle stability. This work provides new ideas for the future development of supercapacitors electrode materials and enhances the development of biomass energy.
