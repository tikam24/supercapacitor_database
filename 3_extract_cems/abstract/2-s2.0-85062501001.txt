The antimony doped tin oxide (Sb-SnO2, ATO) nanopowders have been synthesised via a facile co-precipitation method using absolute methanol as a solvent at room temperature and followed by a calcination process. The calcination process of fabricated ATO from precursor is investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The crystallite phase and morphological structure of ATO powder are examined by the X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. ATO material consisting of numerous sphere-like nanoparticles with the diameter of 40-60 nm were further measured by electrochemical workstation, exhibiting the ATO nanostructure is an highconductivity electrode material with highly reversible features, good specific capacitance and good capacitance retention. The specific capacitance of the ATO electrode material shows 158.2 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1, and specific capacitance retention remained 72% when the current density increases up to 10 A g-1, indicating the ATO nanostructures materials can be considered as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
