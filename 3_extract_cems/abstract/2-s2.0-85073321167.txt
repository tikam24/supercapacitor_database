The high capacitance and cyclability are usually incompatible when Ni(OH)2 behaves as the electrode material in pseudocapacitors. Herein, Ni(OH)2/CuO nanocomposites electrode materials were fabricated by simple water-boiling treatment, and the nanocomposite with an atomic ratio of 1 : 1 for Ni : Cu achieves extraordinary electrochemical performance (1248 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate property, and remarkable cyclability (revealing capacitance retention of 86 % after cycling at 2 A g−1 for 6000 times). Particularly, the asymmetric supercapacitor with the positive electrode of Ni(OH)2/CuO and negative electrode of fulvic acid-derived carbon demonstrates a capacitance of 125 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, an energy density of 19.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 781 W kg−1, together with capacitance retention of 98 % after 6000 cycles at 3.2 A g−1. The outstanding performance results from the high migration rate of both electron and ion associating with the component of CuO, the mutual dispersion of Ni(OH)2 and CuO for maintaining the high specific surface area of Ni(OH)2 nanowhiskers, as well as the lattice distortion induced by the mutual doping of Cu2+ in Ni(OH)2 and Ni2+ in CuO to provide more active sites for energy storage. The Ni(OH)2/CuO composite could be a practicable alternative as the electrode materials for advanced pseudocapacitors.
