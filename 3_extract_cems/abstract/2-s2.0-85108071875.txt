Carbon nanorods (CNRs) are significant one-dimensional carbon-based nanostructured materials. A new method to prepare direct growth fast-standing carbon nanorod as a promising electrode in symmetric supercapacitor applications has been explored. In this study, the CNRs are directly grown on SS plate in the three-zone horizontal chemical vapor deposition unit. The hydrogen free environment is used to grow the CNRs. The substrate position was studied by controlling the substrate temperature, time and precursor gas flow rate. Raman, Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) explored CNRs formation. The CNRs are well assembled in the substrate and showed excellent electrical contact with it. The biological SP-150 instrument measured electrochemical activity of CNR-developed electrodes. The symmetric device was fabricated with two same electrodes and the device energy and power density was studied. Symmetric supercapacitor devices expressed 22 W h/kg energy density at low 1 A/g. The 96.65% capacity is maintained for 10,000 charge discharge cycles in symmetrical supercapacitor device.
