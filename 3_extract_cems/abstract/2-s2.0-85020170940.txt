Three-dimensional (3D) Co2(OH)3Cl-MnO2 hybrid sphere was first obtained through a facile solvothermal microwave-assisted synthesis method. Because of the 3D sphere structure with a flowerlike morphology built up by nanosheets, this type of hybrid accelerated ion transfer as well as the charge and simultaneously maximized the electroactivity of Co2(OH)3Cl or MnO2 with a high capacitance of 942.2 F g-1, which was greater than that of the single Co2(OH)3Cl or MnO2. Meanwhile, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled with the hybrid and active carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, which yielded a specific capacitance of 49.26 F g-1 and a high energy density of 12.62 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 679.10 W kg-1. In addition, the capacitance of this device retained 83.77% after 5000 cycles, which showed a well-defined, long cycle life.
