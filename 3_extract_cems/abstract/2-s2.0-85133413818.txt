Supercapacitors are generally high-power devices, yet their energy is low in contrast to batteries. In the present study, the N-doped porous carbon optimized from brinjal bio-mass waste (solanum melongena) using KOH+ Urea activation confirms its ability as a supercapacitor electrode in presence of an aqueous (1 M H2SO4), ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium-tetrafluoroborate-EMIMBF4) and an improved redox additive (0.01 M Hydroquinone-HQ) electrolytes. The hierarchical porous nature of the activated brinjal bio-mass waste carbon with desired compositions and structure is analyzed using FE-SEM and HR-TEM analysis. In a two electrodes symmetric configuration, brinjal waste-derived activated carbon (BC-700) delivers a high specific capacitance of 460 F/g at 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. In ionic liquid, it delivers 133 F/g high specific capacitance with an energy of 41 Wh/kg. This outstanding electrochemical performance is due to the electrolyte-ion movement of heteroatoms into the carbon matrix resulting in high specific surface area (850 m2 gâˆ’1) and effective microporosity. The energy density of the supercapacitor device is further enriched using the novel redox additive 0.01 M Hydroquinone in H2SO4 electrolyte with a specific capacity of 888 C/g and a maximum energy density of 61 Wh/kg, which is very high compared to batteries. Outstanding cyclic stability of 77 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles is achieved in HQ-added aqueous electrolyte. Hence, the bio-mass waste-derived activated carbon performs as an excellent low-cost material for various electrochemical applications.
