The upward trend of employing renewable energy sources in today's power grid, the tendency to utilize energy storage systems in addition to these sources, and the benefits of using hybrid energy storage systems (including the transportation electrification sector) have put the multi-port converters (MPCs) under the spotlight. Fewer number of active and passive components, higher power density, and lower risk for cyber-attacks are among the reasons for MPCs' popularity. This paper proposes a novel three-port power converter for the hybrid energy storage and hybrid renewable and energy storage applications. This converter is designed to operate for loads up to 20kW and for voltages 400-24V which is suitable for HESSs in residential and electric vehicle auxiliary power units. The voltage levels of this TPC are suitable for the electric vehicles auxiliary power units and DC zonal microgrids. This paper discusses the development and control of this three-port converter and demonstrates the effectiveness of this converter by simulating it under various operating modes for a 2.5kW hybrid energy storage system This TPC achieved efficiencies between 90.7% to 94.5% in different modes with a switching frequency of 50kHz.
