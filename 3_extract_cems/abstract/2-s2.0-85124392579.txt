Three dimensional (3D) Co3S4 nanowires on Ni foam were fabricated by a facile two-step method, and exhibited the electrochemical performances for energy storage and conversation. As the electrode for supercapacitor, Co3S4 nanowires presented the discharge time of 1308.0 s, areal capacitance of 6540 mF cm−2 and long-term stability (∼92% areal capacitiy retained over 4000 cycles). The Co3S4 nanowires/NF//AC asymmetric supercapacitor displayed a potential window of 0–1.6 V. When Co3S4 nanowires used as the electrode for urea electrolysis, they showed the typical performances of urea oxidation reaction with a lower voltage of 1.54 V (vs Hg/HgO) at 50 mA cm−2 current density. Furthermore, the two-electrode electrolyzer only requires a low voltage of 1.51 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm−2.
