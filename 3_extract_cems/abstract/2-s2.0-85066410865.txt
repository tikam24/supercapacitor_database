Abstract: A method for depositing electroactive coatings based on conductive polymers on a graphite foil has been developed. The electrochemical behavior of these electrodes has been studied. It has been shown that an anodic pretreatment of the graphite foil significantly improves the adhesion of the coatings to the foil surface and provides the formation of electroactive polymer coatings by the electrochemical oxidation of the monomer or by solution casting using a chemically polymerized monomer solution. The use of the modified graphite foil leads to an increase in the electrochemical capacitance of the electrodes and the coating stability.
