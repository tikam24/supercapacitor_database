Recently carbon nanostructured materials are more attractive for the supercapacitor applications. Pure carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and double walled nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-DWCNTs) have been synthesized for electrode material for the Supercapacitor applications. The N-DWCNTs were synthesized by Thermal Chemical Vapor Depositions (T-CVD) and they are coil shaped. The synthesized N-DWCNTs were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The morphology of coil shaped N-DWCNTs were revealed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The Electrochemical performance of pure CNTs and N-DWCNTs was analyzed using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) with 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. It showed the good pseudocapacitance behavior for N-DWCNTs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured for N-DWCNTs and showed the smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct - 7.731 Ω) which is much smaller than that of CNTs (23.69 Ω). The specific capacitance was measured for pure CNTs (23.40 F/g) and N-DWCNTs (51.29 F/g) with current density 0.125 A/g.
