Two-dimensional (2-D) polymer has properties that are attractive for energy storage applications because of its combination of heteroatoms, porosities and layered structure, which provides redox chemistry and ion diffusion routes through the 2-D planes and 1-D channels. Here, conjugated aromatic polymers (CAPs) were synthesized in quantitative yield via solid-state polymerization of phenazine-based precursor crystals. By choosing flat molecules (2-TBTBP and 3-TBQP) with different positions of bromine substituents on a phenazine-derived scaffold, C-C cross coupling was induced following thermal debromination. CAP-2 is polymerized from monomers that have been prepacked into layered structure (3-TBQP). It can be mechanically exfoliated into micrometer-sized ultrathin sheets that show sharp Raman peaks which reflect conformational ordering. CAP-2 has a dominant pore size of âˆ¼0.8 nm; when applied as an asymmetric supercapacitor, it delivers a specific capacitance of 233 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1, and shows outstanding cycle performance.
