Fluorination process was carried out on carbon nanocages in the CFx range at 0<xâ‰¤0.3 in fluorine plasma. The evolution of the structural changes was determined by the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is shown that soft fluorination at x0.05 leads to an increase in the capacitance (more than 20%) and stability of the operation of supercapacitors due to pseudocapacity. Increase the processing time leads to blocking the specific surface of carbon nanocages and rapid decrease in the capacitance of supercapacitors.
