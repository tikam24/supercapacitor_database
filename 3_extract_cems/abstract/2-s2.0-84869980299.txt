A model for supercapacitor voltage equalization strategy is analyzed, and on this basis a supercapacitor voltage equalization method for Rubber Tyred Gantry Crane (RTG) energy saving system is proposed, namely active voltage equalization method based on Buck-Boost converter. The equalizing speed of the proposed method is fast. Firstly, the working principle and process of the voltage equalization circuit is analyzed in detail. In addition, design of active voltage equalization circuit parameters and control strategy are given. Finally, simulation analysis of the series connection of supercapacitors module is performed. Results show that this method for equalizing voltage can avoid over-voltage of each cell and possess practicable and high value for supercapacitor RTG energy saving system. Â© 2009 IEEE.
