A fuel-cell-vehicle has been provided with an electric-double-layer- capacitor system (capacitor) to act as a back-up power source. The fuel cells and the capacitor have different voltages when the system is started, and for this reason the system could not be reconnected by relays. A VCU (Voltage and current Control Unit) has been positioned in the path of electrical connection between the fuel cells and the capacitor as a method of dealing with this issue. The VCU enables the charging of the capacitor to be controlled in order to equalize the voltage of the two power sources and allow a connection. Copyright Â© 2004 SAE International.
