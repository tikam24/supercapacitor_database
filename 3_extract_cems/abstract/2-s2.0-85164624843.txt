Two-dimensional (2D) siloxene is attracting considerable research interest recently principally owing to its inherent compatibility with silicon-based semiconductor technology. -The synthesis of siloxene has been mostly limited to multilayered structures using traditional topochemical reaction procedures. Herein, we report high-yield synthesis of single to few-layer siloxene nanosheets by developing a two-step interlayer expansion and subsequent liquid phase exfoliation procedure. Our protocol enables high-yield production of few-layer siloxene nanosheets with a lateral dimension of up to 4 Î¼m and thickness ranging from 0.8 to 4.8 nm, corresponding to single to a few layers, well stabilized in water. The atomically flat nature of exfoliated siloxene can be exploited for the construction of 2D/2D heterostructure membranes via typical solution processing. We demonstrate highly ordered graphene/siloxene heterostructure films with synergistic mechanical and electrical properties, which deliver noticeably high device capacitance when assembled into a coin cell symmetric supercapacitor device structures. Additionally, we demonstrate that the mechanically flexible exfoliated siloxene-graphene heterostructure enables its direct use in flexible and wearable supercapacitor applications.
