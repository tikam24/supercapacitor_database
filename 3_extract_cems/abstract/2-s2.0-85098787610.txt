Ternary mixed metal sulfide is a potential pseudocapacitive material. In this work, ZnS nanowire and NiCo2S4 nanosheet were grown on nickel foam through hydrothermal method. As compared with NiCo2S4/NF and ZnS/NF, ZnS/NiCo2S4/NF has a significant supercapacitance. The surface capacitance is as high as 2604 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2, and still keep 1020 mF cm−2 with electric current density of 10 mA cm−2. The ZnS/NiCo2S4/NF nanostructures have large capacitance retention rate of 90% after 6000 laps in condition of 8 mA cm−2. The prepared ZnS/NiCo2S4/NF//ASC device displayed both high power density and energy density (725 W kg−1 at 39.88 Wh kg−1).
