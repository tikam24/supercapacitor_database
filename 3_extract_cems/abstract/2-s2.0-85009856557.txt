A versatile procedure is investigated for the synthesis of carbon microspheres from resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin and various catalysts, such as boric acid (H3BO3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3{dot operator}H2O), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Among the catalysts investigated in this work, ammonia is the most efficient for precisely controlling the size and morphology of the RF-resin microspheres. Furthermore, the carbon microspheres (CRF-6) derived from the RF-6 resin microspheres that were synthesized by using the ammonia catalyst result in a high surface area: SBET of 473m2g-1 and Vtotal of 0.287cm3g-1. As a supercapacitor electrode material, they present a low resistance value (R) of 0.5Î© in 6mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of the electrode measured by using cyclic voltammetry reaches 175.9Fg-1 at a scan rate of 1mVs-1 and 139.5Fg-1 at a current density of 1Ag-1 from galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The specific capacitance only decays 5.6% after 500cycles, which indicates that the sample possesses excellent cycle durability. The present study shows that the carbon microspheres synthesized using RF resin are electrically conductive materials with reduced mass-transport resistance and improved supercapacitor performance reliability.
