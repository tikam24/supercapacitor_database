As a burgeoning energy storage equipment, more attention has been paid to sodium ion hybrid supercapacitor (Na-HSC) with large energy/power density and long cycle life. Anode materials with high Na+ embedding rate are the key for its development. In this work, multi-chamber microspheres with Nb2O5 quantum dots (T-Nb2O5@YC) were prepared from yeast enriched with Nb5+ and by simple hydrothermal-carbonization. Na+ half-cell and Na-HSC have excellent electrochemical performance. To be specific, Na+ half battery with T-Nb2O5@YC delivers up to 195.7 mA h g−1 and maintains 84% discharge capacity after 2000 cycles. Moreover, Na-HSC assembled with T-Nb2O5@YC as anode has high energy density (62.5 Wh kg−1) and power density (1250 W kg−1).
