N-doped porous carbon (C2) was prepared by simple carbonization process with MgCO3 as template, synthesized polyaniline (PANI) as carbon source and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as binder. Meanwhile, PANI was directly carbonized to prepare (C1) for comparison. The morphology, structure and composition of the prepared porous carbon were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption, thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results show that specific surface area of C2 is 249.8 m2/g, far higher than that of C1 (19.8 m2/g). The N-contents of the two porous carbons were similar i.e. 5.48% (C1) and 4.8% (C2), respectively. Both of the high specific surface area and certain amount of N-doping endowed C2 with good electrochemical capacitive properties. The specific capacitance of C2 is 268 F/g by current density of 1 A/g. Besides, the N-doped porous carbon (C2) exhibited excellent stability after 8000 cycles of charge-discharge by current density of 4 A/g.
