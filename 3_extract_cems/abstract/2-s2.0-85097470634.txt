The MnMoO4@multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composite is prepared successfully by a hydrothermal method. The composite is subjected as an electrode material for supercapacitors, showing excellent electrochemical feature with a high specific capacitance of 1017 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The electrochemical behavior of the composite is compared with the MnMoO4 electrode material. Owing to high performance of composite, asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) composed of MnMoO4@MWCNT and activated carbon is fabricated with an aqueous electrolyte. The device delivers a high energy density of 18.1 W h kg−1 at the power density of 362.4 W kg−1. With good energy storage properties of electrode material, it could store sufficient charge to power the twelve red color light-emitting diodes. Furthermore, a motor fan is rotated by ASC device. A digital watch is also powered by ASCs. The obtained results suggest that the prepared MnMoO4@MWCNT composite material is promising for energy storage devices.
