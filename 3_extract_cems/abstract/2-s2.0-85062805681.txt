In this work, manganese was combined with ZIF-67 to form a multi-shell structure, and then the core-shell structure of Co 3 O 4 /MnCo 2 O 4.5 as an electrode material was obtained by optimizing the thermal treatment, which perfectly inherited the rhombic dodecahedral shape of the ZIF-67 templates. Benefiting from the composition of core-shell structure and the synergistic effect of bimetallic manganese-cobalt oxides on shell surface, the Co 3 O 4 /MnCo 2 O 4.5 reached a specific capacity of 636 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 . Owing to a cycle life of 86% after 5000 charge and discharge cycles, its electrochemical performance had been improved significantly, compared with the Co 3 O 4 acquired by pure ZIF-67 at a specific capacity of 320 F g −1 and a cycle life 79.9%. All of this confirmed the Co 3 O 4 /MnCo 2 O 4.5 was an excellent electrode material for the pseudopotential capacitor.
