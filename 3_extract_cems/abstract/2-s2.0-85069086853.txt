In this work lithium ion capacitors (LICs) built using a TiSb2 alloy as the negative electrode and activated carbon (AC) derived from recycled olive pits biomass as the positive electrode are reported. TiSb2 shows high capacity (360 mAh g−1 at 10 C) and excellent rate capability performance together with exceptional volumetric features, enabling its use as a promising candidate for high power requiring technologies. So far, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first Sb alloy-based LIC ever reported. In order to maximize the output performance, the influence of the mass ratio of the active materials (TiSb2 : AC) is studied. The best TiSb2-based LIC is able to deliver an energy density as high as 167 Wh kgAM −1 (78 Wh dm−3) at 115 W kgAM −1 (53 W dm−3), more than a 6-fold increase with respect to its EDLC counterpart. Under high power demanding situations, i. e., 11 kW kgAM −1 (6 kW dm−3), it retains up to 90 Wh kgAM −1 (48 Wh dm−3), which is among the best reported values for LICs. In addition, the device with the most appropriate mass ratio presents an encouraging 80 % retention of the initial capacitance after 10000 charge-discharge cycles at tdischarge=11 s.
