A simple one-step method was used for preparing the β-cyclodextrin/ polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nano-fibers deposited with silver nanoparticles by electrospinning and followed by the reduction of the Ag ions. The nano-composite fibers were stabilized at 280 °C in air and activated at 800°C for 1 h in steam/N 2. The structures of nano-composite fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). The electrochemical behaviors of the composite of carbon nano-fibers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge tests. © 2011 American Scientific Publishers.
