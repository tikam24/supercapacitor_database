An efficient evaporation-induced coating method combining microwave-assisted hydrothermal transformation and annealing is developed to fabricate an ideal electrode material from composites with a layer of hydrous RuO2 on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), for a high-performance supercapacitor. Total and RuO2-based specific capacitances are as high as 1125 and 2000 F g-1, respectively. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
