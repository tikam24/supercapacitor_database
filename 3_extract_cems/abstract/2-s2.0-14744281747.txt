Fourier transform infrared spectroelectrochemistry has been used to study the vibrational spectrum of a thin layer of the organic electrolyte in contact with a divided carbon supercapacitor electrode. Variations in the absorption of peaks characteristic of the solvent and of the support electrolyte during an anodic potential scan have been observed. The presence of adsorbed water was detected. The formation of a stable adduct of CH3CN and BF 3 under anodic potential was identified. Â© 2005 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.
