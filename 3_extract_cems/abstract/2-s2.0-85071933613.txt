The highly efficient hydrothermal chemical reaction was used to synthesis the manganese oxide@nitrogen doped graphene oxide/polypyrrole (MnO2@NGO/PPy) composites as a high capacitance electrode material for supercapacitors. The prepared composites structural and surface properties were confirmed by spectral and electron microscopic studies, respectively. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetric analysis carried out for MnO2@NGO and MnO2@NGO/PPy electrodes using potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The improved capacitance of 480»F.g-1 exhibited for MnO2@NGO/PPy hybrid electrode compared with 360»F.g-1 for MnO2@NGO electrode at 0.5 A.»g-1 current density. The better cycling and rate retention properties exposed for MnO2@NGO/PPy hybrid electrode. Hence, the observed results suggested that MnO2@NGO/PPy electrodes offer promising uses for the high-performance supercapacitor.
