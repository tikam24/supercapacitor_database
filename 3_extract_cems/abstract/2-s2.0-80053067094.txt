Series structure is used in crane hybrid power system because of multi-mechanism working simultaneously. The working status changes frenquently. In this paper, thermostat+power following control strategy is used in the wheeled crane hybrid power system based on supercapacitor. Based analysis on system working statuses division and its judgement, the paper proposed the control strategy of supercapacitor power to avoid frequent charge and discharge for supercapacitor life-saving. During starting process of engine, system power is supplied by supercapacitor to ensure fast response of system. Experiments show that the control strategy is feasible.
