Six isomorphous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with a 3D window-beam architecture have been synthesized from solvothermal reactions, and are named Zn, Cd, Ni, Co, Mn and Cu-MOF, respectively. The series of MOFs was utilized as precursors to synthesize MOF-derived carbon with different morphologies. Zn and Cd-MOFs lead to the derivation of porous carbons (PCs), which exhibit remarkable BET specific surface areas. For derivates of Ni, Co and Mn-MOFs, graphitized carbons (GCs) show some carbon graphitization, but their BET specific surface areas are relatively small. C-Cu has the smallest BET specific surface area, and there is no carbon graphitization. Therefore, the metal ion of the parent MOF exerts a crucial effect on the preparation of MOF-derived carbon, such as the pore-forming effect of Zn and Cd species, and catalytic graphitization of Ni, Co, and Mn species. The capacitances of MOF-derived carbon follow the sequence of PCs>GCs>C-Cu, which reveals that the specific surface area plays a dominant role in the capacitive performance of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs), and that the graphitization could improve the capacitance. Significantly, PC-Zn exhibits the best specific capacitance (138 F g−1 at 0.5 Ag−1), and excellent life cycle, which can be applied as an electrode material in supercapacitors.
