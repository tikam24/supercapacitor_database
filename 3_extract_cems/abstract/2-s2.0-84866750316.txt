In this paper, we present an identification algorithm based on a porous impedance model which allows to characterize an ultracapacitor. We simulate experiments which consist in applying a current sequence charging an ultracapacitor and measuring the induced voltage drop change across its terminals. The analysis of the porous part of the impedance shows that the charging process can be modeled with the help of a fractional model made of a classical integrator in parallel with a fractional integrator of order 1/2, whose action is blocked outside a limited spectral band. Numerical simulations show the ability of the fractional model, thanks to an output error identification technique, to obtain accurate estimation of the voltage drop change evolution as well as the impedance frequency response using time data series. Furthermore, the fractional parameter estimates allow to provide accurate values of the capacity and the high frequency internal equivalent series resistance. Â© 2011 IFAC.
