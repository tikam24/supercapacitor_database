High performance pseudocapacitive characteristics of potentiodynamically deposited NiO are reported here. Three-dimensional nanowhiskers of NiO were prepared by potentiodynamically depositing nickel hydroxide on stainless steel (SS) and heating the hydroxide in air at 300°C for 3 h. The scan rate used for the deposition was 200 mV s -1 and the electrolyte solution used was 100 mM NiCl 2·6H 2O at a pH 8.0. The NiO-covered SS electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M KOH electrolyte for the redox supercapacitor application. A maximum specific capacitance (SC) of 138 F g -1 was obtained from the CV at a scan rate of 100 mV s -1. A SC value of 82 F g -1 was obtained even at the very high CV scan rate of 500 mV s -1, demonstrating the high-power characteristics of NiO. Long cycle-life of the NiO nanowhiskers was also demonstrated. High specific capacitance, high power, high stability, and low cost of the electrode materials are favorable factors for commercial applications. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.
