In the present study, the functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) via 5-Aminopyridine-2-carboxylic acid Cr (ш) complex (FGO-Ap/Cr) was fulfilled using a one-pot hydrothermal method. Then, the synthesized FGO-Ap/Cr was evaluated through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical functionality of the given electrodes was then analyzed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). A high specific capacitance of 461.5 F g−1 is achieved at a current density of 1 A g−1 for the FGO-Ap/Cr in three electrodes electrochemical measurement. These electrodes show remarkable electrochemical behaviors for supercapacitors (SCs) with regard to incredible rate capacity, elevated specific capacitance, and superb cycle stability. A high energy and power density symmetric supercapacitor was also successfully designed using FGO-Ap/Cr and GO, as the anode and cathode electrodes in a neutral 3 M KNO3 electrolyte. Due to the desired poriferous construct, the elevated specific capacitance, the rated capacity, and the complemental potential of the three electrodes, the asymmetrical supercapacitor is capable of revolving in a full potential window of 0–1.7 V with an energy density of 523.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 98111.3 W kg−1 for FGO-Ap/Cr//GO. Besides, the symmetrical supercapacitor showed steady cycling functionality for FGO-Ap/Cr//GO capacitance retention at 8 A g−1 following 5000 cycles, with 96.2%. These encouraging results demonstrate a high potential for practical applications in the development of energy-storing equipment with elevated energy and power concentrations.
