Nanostructured hydrous ruthenium oxide (RuO 2·xH 2O) was directly deposited on tantalum (Ta) substrates by cyclic voltammetry (CV) technology in RuCl 3·xH 2O aqueous solutions. The growth mechanism, revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques, is that Ru 3+ ions are reduced to nanostructured ruthenium (Ru) particles during negative potential scanning, then are oxidized to RuO 2·xH 2O granules (also in nanometers) during the following positive scanning. The unique nanometer structure of RuO 2·xH 2O, rather than the conventional "mud-cracked" structure, enable itself a high specific capacitance of 730 F·g -1 at a scanning rate of 50 mV·s -1 and a very fast charging/discharging ability. The specific capacitance is still up to 700 F·g -1 when the oxide loading is up to 1.2 mg·cm -2. In addition, the capacitance retains about 100% after 100, 000 charging/discharging cycles. All of these indicate that the nanosized RuO 2·xH 2O is an excellent electrode material for energy storage and conversion devices, such as supercapacitors.
