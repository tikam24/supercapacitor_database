This work presented a nonlinear control for a reversible power buck-boost converter (BBC) in order to control energy storage in a supercapacitor (SC) used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). The aim was to control a power converter in order to satisfy the following two requirements: (i) perfect tracking of SC current to its reference signal and (ii) asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The two objectives were achieved using an integral sliding mode control. In order to validate the proposed approach, an experimental prototype was built. The controller was integrated into dSPACE prototyping systems using the DS1202 card. It was clearly shown, using formal analysis, simulation, and experimental results, that the designed controller metall the objectives, namely, the stability of the system and the control of the current at its reference.
