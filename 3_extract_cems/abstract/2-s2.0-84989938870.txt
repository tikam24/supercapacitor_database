Bipolar carboxyalkylphosphonic acid molecules were investigated for dispersion and charging of inorganic particles in ethanol and film formation by electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The analysis of deposition yield for different molecules and FTIR data provided an insight into the influence of interactions of the molecules with different surface metal atoms on adsorption of the molecules, particle dispersion and charge. The dispersant molecules showed strong adsorption on MnO2 and allowed for anodic EPD of MnO2 for electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors. In contrast, huntite particles showed preferred adsorption of protons and cathodic huntite films were obtained by EPD for applications based on flame retardant properties of this material.
