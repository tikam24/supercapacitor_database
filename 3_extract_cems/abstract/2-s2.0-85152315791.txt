Environmental protection and energy storage are gaining increasing attention. Carbon, whether in the form of complex compounds or in its elemental state, is one of the most common elements on the planet and performs an important function in both living beings and contemporary technological worlds. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have an open structure and a high degree of chirality, which allows them to improve the characteristics and performance of other materials when added to them. CNT design and quality have a big effect on the electrochemical performance of batteries and supercapacitors. CNTs have been employed in energy storage systems for energy as a component of the active anode or as an addition to increase the electrical conductivity of cathode materials depending on structural and morphological parameters. This chapter discusses the development of CNTs for use in various energy storage and conversion systems, as well as the effects of their structure and morphology on electrochemical performance and mechanisms of storage. The most promising research in the conversion and storage of energy using CNTs as the usage of CNTs hybrid for lithium-metal batteries, wearable energy storage, supercapacitor energy storage, and CNTs in presence of biochar for energy storage was discussed.
