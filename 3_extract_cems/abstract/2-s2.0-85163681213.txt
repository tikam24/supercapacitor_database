In this work, poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc)-based gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) from precursor solutions containing different volume ratios of vinyl acetate monomer and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMIMTFSI) at a fixed concentration of 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) were synthesized via ex-situ polymerization. The GPE with 35% (v/v) of BMIMTFSI exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of (1.90 ± 0.32) × 10–4 S cm−1 at ambient temperature, with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of -28.01 °C. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study confirms the complexation and interaction between the BMIMTFSI, LiTFSI, and PVAc. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis shows a reduction in degree of crystallinity of the polymer matrix upon addition of LiTFSI and BMIMTFSI. Addition of ionic liquid enhances the potential window of the GPEs as shown in linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) study. The specific capacitance of EDLC increases significantly upon addition of BMIMTFSI, along with relatively stable energy and power densities as proven in Galvanostatic Charge–Discharge (GCD) study.
