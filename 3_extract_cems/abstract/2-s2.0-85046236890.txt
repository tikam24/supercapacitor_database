The electronic structure and surface character of carbon nanotube can be adjusted by nitrogen doping. The nitrogen groups include pyridine, pyrrole, graphitic nitrogen, oxidized pyridine, -NO2 and -NH2, etc., which enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction, pseudo-capacitance, wettability and electron-donor property of carbon nanotubes. The preparation methods of nitrogen doped carbon nanotube, including synchronous in-situ doping, carbonization of nitrogen-containing materials and post-treatment are summarized. The application of nitrogen doped carbon nanotube in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), super-capacitor and supporting materials is reviewed, as well as the role of each nitrogen group in the above mentioned fields.
