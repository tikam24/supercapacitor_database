The study presents bismuth ferrite nanomaterial (BiFeO3) prepared by the green method using Moringa oleifera natural extract as an anode material for supercapacitor application. Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge discharge methods were employed to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the nanomaterial at the modified electrode relative to the unmodified electrode. The cyclic voltametric response revealed broad redox peaks and peak separations that clearly indicated the pseudo-capacitive characteristics derived from faradaic reactions. The EIS results indicated that the electrochemical reaction on the material electrode is kinetically and diffusionally controlled. The obtained GCE/BiFeO3 electrode has a specific capacitance of 105 F/g at 0,25 A gâˆ’1, an energy density of 90 Wh k/g, and a power density of 0,99 kW k/g. The electrochemical performance revealed an excellent electrochemical response, suggesting that BiFeO3 nanomaterial is an ideal electrode material for supercapacitance applications.
