An innovative form of 2D/0D g-C3N4/CeO2 nanostructure was synthesized using a simple precursor decomposition process. The 2D g-C3N4 directs the growth of 0D CeO2 quantum dots, while also promoting good dispersion of CeO2QDs. This 2D/0D nanostructure shows a capacitance of 202.5 F/g and notable rate capability and stability, outperforming the g-C3N4 electrode, reflecting the state-of-the-art g-C3N4 binary electrodes. The binary combination of materials also enables an asymmetric device (g-C3N4/CeO2QDs//AC) to deliver the highest energy density (9.25 Wh/kg) and power density (900 W/kg). The superior rate capacity and stability endorsed the quantum structural merits of CeO2QDs and layered g-C3N4, which offer more accessible sites for ion transport. These results suggest that the g-C3N4/CeO2QDs nanostructure is a promising electrode material for energy storage devices.
