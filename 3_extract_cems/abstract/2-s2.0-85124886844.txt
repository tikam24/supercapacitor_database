Metal-organic framework (MOF) has great potential in the field of supercapacitors as electrode material due to its high specific surface area and unique structure. Herein, a series of nickel MOFs (Ni-MOFs) were fabricated by one-pot solvothermal method at different experimental conditions. The electrochemical properties of the Ni-MOFs as electrode materials can be tuned by adjusting the experimental conditions to regulate the structures. The result indicates that a novel moss-like three-dimensional (3D) Ni-MOF had the maximum specific capacity of 638 ​C ​g-1 at a current density of 0.5 ​A ​g-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by using moss-like 3D Ni-MOF as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode exhibited a high energy density of 30.4 ​Wh kg-1 at power density of 407.4 ​W ​kg-1.
