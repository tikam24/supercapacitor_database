In the current research, the hydrothermal approach was used to synthesize BiPO4 nanostructures with various surfactants such as Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), urea, and Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB). The structures and morphologies of the synthesized samples were analyzed using the X-ray diffraction process and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) technique, respectively. Hexagonal and monoclinic phases of BiPO4 nanostructures deprived of any impure peak are shown in the XRD test. By using Debye Scherrer's formula, the average size of crystals is determined. The development of pure-phase and functional groups of synthesized materials was verified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) in a three-electrode system using 2 M KOH solution as an aqueous electrolyte were studied for the electrochemical efficiency of the processed samples. The specific capacity measured using GCD has been found to decrease from 1070 Cg1 to 339 Cg1, with an increase in current density from 1 A/g to 20 A/g. This study revealed that for energy storage applications, BPP (bismuth phosphate supported with PVP) sample should be used as a useful electrode material.
