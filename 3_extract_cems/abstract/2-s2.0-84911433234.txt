Batteries and ultracapacitors for hybrid and electric vehicles must satisfy very demanding working conditions that are not usual in other applications. In this sense, specific tests must be performed in order to draw accurate conclusions about their behaviour. To do so, new advanced test benches are needed. These platforms must allow the study of a wide variety of energy storage systems under conditions similar to the real ones. In this paper, a flexible, low-cost and highly customizable system is presented. This system allows batteries and ultracapacitors to be tested in many and varied ways, effectively emulating the working conditions that they face in an electric vehicle. The platform was specifically designed to study energy storage systems for electric and hybrid vehicles, meaning that it is suitable to test different systems in many different working conditions, including real driving cycles. This flexibility is achieved keeping the cost of the platform low, which makes the proposed test bench a feasible alternative for the industry. As an example of the functionality of the platform, a test consisting of a 17-minute ARTEMIS urban cycle with a NiMH battery pack is presented.
