Supercapacitors have drawn intensive attention in recent years due to their high specific power, long cycle life, and ability to fully fill the need for capacitors and batteries of hybrid energy applications. Electrodes of nanomaterials have shown superior electrochemical properties in performing high-performance supercapacitors. This feature article describes our recent progress in designing on different nanostructure of birnessite-type of manganese oxide-based materials for these applications. In order to fully understand the potential of manganese oxide-based electrode nanomaterials, sketchy appreciation of these morphology ranging from different dimensions and material properties are carried out critically, which may serve as a guidance for further development of fabricating supercapacitor electrode.
