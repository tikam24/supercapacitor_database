In Maximum Power Point (MPP) applications for photovoltaic generators, the DC-DC tracker converter is as important as the MPP tracking algorithm. The purpose of this work is to present the design methodology of a buck converter applied in maximum power point tracking. In this paper we also compare Hill-climbing and Fractional Voc MPPT efficiency. The MPPT algorithms were implemented with an autonomous DC/DC converter. It allows to determine their real advantages and disadvantages. Finally, our system will be used to charge supercapacitors. The most significant advantage supercapacitors have over batteries is their ability to be charged and discharged continuously without degradation and their low operating temperature (-40Â°C).
