In this article, the authors are describing possibility of supercapacitor usage for supplying emergency luminaires. Basic facts about modern supercapacitors and fundamental characteristics are provided initially. Analysis of usage of these supercapacitors in emergency lighting and suitable LED luminaires follow. For this purpose authors made capacity calculation and simulation of discharging characteristics. Then results of capacity and consumption are described. Finally pros and cons of supercapacitors usage are summarized, with prediction of the future growth.
