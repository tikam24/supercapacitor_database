A novel Ni 3 S 2 film, comprising interconnected nanoparticles, on Ni foam is synthesized by using a simple one-step hydrothermal approach. The Ni 3 S 2 film electrode exhibits excellent pseudocapacitor characteristics, 1) a huge specific capacitance up to 2230 F g −1 attained at a current density of 5 mA cm −2 , and 2) a nearly perfect retention rate of 91% at a current density of 10 mA cm −2 after 3000 cycles. These experimentally demonstrated that the special nanoparticle-interconnected structure in conjunction with the high-performance electrode characteristics, make the Ni 3 S 2 film electrode an attractive and competitive candidate for the development of advanced high-efficiency electrochemical energy storage devices.
