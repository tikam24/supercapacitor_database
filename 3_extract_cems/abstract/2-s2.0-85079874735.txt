In the present work, BiVO4/PANI composite was prepared by in-situ polymerization method. The formation of as-synthesized BiVO4/PANI composite was confirmed by several physico-chemical techniques. The electrochemical performance of BiVO4/PANI was investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitor application by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The specific capacitance of BiVO4/PANI composite was observed to be 701 Fg−1 at the current density of 1 Ag−1 by GCD studies, while it exhibited 95.4% retention of its initial capacitance even after 5000 GCD cycles at 1 Ag−1 current density. This study revealed that BiVO4/PANI is a potential electrode material for supercapacitor application.
