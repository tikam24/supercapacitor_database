We have utilized Euphorbia cognata Boiss as a source of reducing and stabilizing agents for the synthesis and the functionalization facile Co3O4:NiO nanomaterial following hydrothermal route. The phases (Co3O4 and NiO) of synthesized nanomaterial were identified by X-ray diffraction, while spherical nanostructures were scrutinized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study surface modification, which revealed the presence of organic O and organic C groups. Furthermore, Tauc plot exhibited a low bandgap of 2.58 eV proposing the improved electrochemical characteristics of synthesized nanomaterial. A reasonable capacitance of 188 and 74 F/g was revealed at 2 mV/s and at 1 A/g, respectively. While the extremely low internal resistance (Ri) of 0.8 Î© was determined in the current study, suggesting the good electrochemical conductivity of Co3O4:NiO. Therefore, the present study demonstrated the good electrochemical behavior of the fabricated electrode toward supercapacitor, which was attributed to the increased active sites due to bioactive compounds.
