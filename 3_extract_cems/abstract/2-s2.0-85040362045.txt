Uniform MoS2 nanosheets assembling three-dimensional nanospheres are prepared by using a facile hydrothermal procedure with SiO2 nanospheres as the template. The morphologies and structure of MoS2 nanospheres are thorough characterized and evaluated as electrode material for supercapacitors. Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements reveal that MoS2 nanospheres deliver a specific capacity of 683 F/g at 1 A/g, and the specific capacity retains about 85.1% after 10000 cycles. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated by employing MoS2 nanospheres and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The specific capacitance is 65.33 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. An energy density of 20.42 Wh/kg is obtained at power density of 750.31 kW/kg. The results show an attractive performance to take advantage of MoS2 nanosheets assembling three-dimensional nanospheres as electrode material for supercapacitors. Two cells in series can easily light the light-emitting diode lamp brightly, further demonstrates the high energy storage capability of the prepared MoS2 material.
