Covalent organic polymer (COPs) have emerged promising potentials for the fabrication of flexible supercapacitors. Numerous efforts are devoting to the promotion of processability of COPs and broaden their applications in practical devices. Herein we have developed a fully conjugated two-dimensional COP material (COPBTC-Mn) with nitrogen coordinated metal centers. The unique structures of COPBTC-Mn endow it with high solubility via an in-situ exfoliation pathway and the capability to adsorb onto carbon-based matrix by electrostatic force. COPBTC-Mn demonstrated superior processability, reliability, and repeatability for the fabrication of flexible electrodes of supercapacitors. Besides, superior to the electrodes based on traditional COPs, our as-prepared flexible electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 325 F g−1 with the current density of 0.2 A g−1 and excellent stability after charge/discharge cycles.
