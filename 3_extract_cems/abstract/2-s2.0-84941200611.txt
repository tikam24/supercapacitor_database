Bio-derived honeycomb-like ordered macroporous carbon with highly interconnected hexangular channels and excellent electronic conductivity is prepared by carbonizing the organic matrix of mollusc shells. The unique structure ensures fast electron transfer throughout the entire three-dimensional network and effective electrolyte penetration, which makes the mollusc shell derived carbon network (MSDCN) an ideal substrate for supercapacitor electrodes. Via a simple hydrothermal process, cubic Co3O4 was incorporated with the MSDCN, and the as-obtained Co3O4@MSDCN exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (1307 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), impressive rate performance (with a capacity retention of 61.0% at 20 A g-1) and long cycle life (84% of the initial capacitance remained after 3000 cycles at 5 A g-1).
