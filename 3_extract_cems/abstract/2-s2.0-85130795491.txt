When studying electrochemical systems, EIS practitioners face the challenge of choosing a relevant equivalent electrical circuit to analyze their measurement data and interpreting the role of its components. In this review, we take a closer look at the use of equivalent electrical circuits (EEC) across various application domains. We aim to aid EIS practitioners in determining and evaluating their EEC-based data analysis methodology in light of recent progress from all EIS application domains. We review EEC usage and its interpretation while additionally providing software to automatically search for equivalent electrical circuits from the relevant application domain literature that fit EIS measurements supplied by users. Finally, we make a comparison of the impedimetric behaviour and circuit modelling approaches of a range of different electrochemical systems and discuss some complementary EIS data analysis strategies.
