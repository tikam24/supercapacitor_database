Using coal-tar pitch as raw material, the mesophase pitches with carbonaceous crystallites were produced at different temperatures, and the ultra-high surface area activated carbons for supercapacitors were prepared by chemical activation. Coin type cells using the prepared activated carbons as electrode materials were assembled, and 6 mol/L KOH solution was selected as the electrolyte. The effects of modification process of the mesophase pitches on the structures and the electrochemical behaviors of activated carbons were investigated. The results indicate that the specific surface area of activated carbons increases while then decreases with increasing temperature, and the surface area of activated carbon modificated at 450°C is 3250 m2/g. The micropore sizes are ranged from 1nm to 4 nm, and the unformed structure modificated at 350°C is beneficial to pore-widening, so the activated carbons exhibits higher mesopore volume. When the temperature increases, the mesopore volume decreases. The capacitance of the activated carbon increases while then decreases with increasing temperature, and the maximum specific capacitance is 215 F/g, which is acquired from the carbon modificated at 450°C.
