A "chain-lock" strategy was used to build a conjugated polymer network by a facile electrochemical copolymerization method. A classical donor-acceptor monomer, 4,7-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole (DEBT), was selected as the "chain" and a three-branch monomer, tris(4-(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)phenyl) amine (TETPA), as the "lock". The copolymer shows a hierarchical porous structure, considerable capacitance and excellent stability. This probably contributes to the good electrical conductivity of the Ï€-conjugated skeleton, improved ionic conductivity and structural stability of the porous network. This "chain-lock" polymer with various monomer selections and adjustable molecular structure shows great promise in the energy storage field. This strategy also provides a universal solution for conjugated porous polymer design, which has promising applications in many fields.
