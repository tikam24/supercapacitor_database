In the present study, ruthenium oxide (RuO2) thin films were deposited on the stainless steel (s.s.) substrates by anodic deposition. The nucleation and growth mechanism of electrodeposited RuO2 film has been studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA). The deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive analysis by X-rays (EDAX) for structural, morphological, and compositional studies. The electrochemical supercapacitor study of ruthenium oxide thin films have been carried out for different film thicknesses in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance was found to be 1190 F/g for 0.376 mg/cm2 film thickness. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
