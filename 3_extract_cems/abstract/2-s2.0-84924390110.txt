One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures aligned on a conductive substrate are advantageous for various energy applications. In this work, we report the synthesis of hierarchically nanostructured NiO nanotube arrays supported on carbon fiber paper (CFP) via a simple ZnO-template method and evaluated the arrays as supercapacitor electrodes. We demonstrate that subtle changes in the annealing temperature during the preparation of NiO affect the porous structures of both NiO and CFP, which synergically enhance the pseudocapacitive performance of NiO according to in-depth electrochemical analyses.
