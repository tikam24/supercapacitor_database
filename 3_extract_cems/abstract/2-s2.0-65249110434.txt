The write performance of NAND flash solid-state drives (SSDs) can be enhanced using protected cache memory - in particular SDRAM - with backup power supplied by a supercapacitor. NAND flash SSDs can only be erased and written a finite number of times, which is known as the endurance of the flash memory. The endurance limit indicates that write operations need to spread evenly across the NAND flash blocks to prevent part of the memory from aging prematurely. This wear-leveling process is controlled by an SSD controller, which ensures that files are written to least-used memory blocks and no static data in underutilized locations. SSD designs with a high-speed SDRAM cache can provide a read/write buffer on the data bus and a suitable location to store changing metadata generated by the controller. SDRAM with on-board power backup is a cost-effective solution for protecting cache.
