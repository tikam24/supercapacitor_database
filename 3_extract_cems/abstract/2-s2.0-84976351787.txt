We fabricate a SnO2/CNT supercapacitor using a dc pulse atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ). SnO2 nanoparticles are mixed with CNTs, ethyl cellulose, and terpineol to form a paste that is then screen-printed onto a carbon cloth followed by APPJ sintering. The APPJ-sintered nanoporous SnO2/CNT reveals excellent wettability, facilitating the penetration of electrolytes into the nanoporous structure. The best specific capacitance achieved is 188.42 F/g evaluated using a cyclic voltammetry measurement under a potential scan rate of 2 mV/s.
