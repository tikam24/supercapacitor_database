Although metal-organic frameworks (MOF) derived porous carbon has been widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitor, its limited ion diffusion/transportation as well as relatively low conductivity have hampered high capacitance achieved. To address this issue, an interconnected hierarchical nitrogen doped nanoporous carbon structure (N-NPC) from nanosized MOF crystals is proposed, which presents high ion-accessible surface area and ion diffusion/transportation rate as well as enhanced electric conductivity. Benefiting from the interconnected structure, the N-NPC exhibits an ultrahigh capacitance of 479 F g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte and 391 F g−1 in an organic electrolyte. More importantly, the energy densities are 22.9 Wh kg−1 and 100.6 Wh kg−1 in the aqueous and organic electrolytes, and excellent long-term cycle stability are achieved, respectively.
