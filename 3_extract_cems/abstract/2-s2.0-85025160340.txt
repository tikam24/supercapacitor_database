This study presents an approach of the voltage regulation of DC bus for the photovoltaic energy storage by using a combination of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). The batteries are used to meet the energy requirements for a relatively long duration, whereas the SCs are used to meet the instantaneous power demand. The energy management strategy is developed to manage the power flows between the storage devices by choosing the optimal operating mode, thereby to ensuring the continuous supply of the load by maintaining the state-of-charge (SoC) of SCs (SoCsc) and the SoC of the batteries (SoCbat) at acceptable levels. This energy management strategy is performed by using the fuzzy logic supervisor. The validation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
