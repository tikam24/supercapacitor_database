In this topic, we first discussed the requirement and performance of supercapacitors using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the electrode, including specific surface area, purity and cost. Then we reviewed the preparation technique of single walled CNTs (SWNTs) in relatively large scale by chemical vapor deposition method. Its catalysis on the decomposition of methane and other carbon source, the reactor type and the process control strategies were discussed. Special focus was concentrated on how to increase the yield, selectivity, and purity of SWNTs and how to inhibit the formation of impurities, including amorphous carbon, multiwalled CNTs and the carbon encapsulated metal particles, since these impurities seriously influenced the performance of SWNTs in supercapacitors. Wish it be helpful to further decrease its product cost and for the commercial use in supercapacitors. Â© 2012 CAS/DICP.
