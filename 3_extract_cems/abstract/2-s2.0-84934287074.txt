In order to ensure superiority of fuel and improve start and stop performance of hybrid electric vehicle, battery is used in the system. Limited by vehicleâ€™s size, traditional hybrid electric vehicles can only carry a limited number of batteries, results in a relatively short running distance in one battery charge cycle. To improve energy using efficiency and increase vehicle safety, composite power based on lithium ion battery and super capacitor was proposed. Super capacitor parameter was designed according to hybrid electric vehicle regenerative braking model based on matlab simulation. Experiment also was realized based on composite power, results show that both motor and power can work well, and super capacitor can absorb the regenerative braking energy of hybrid electric vehicle greatly.
