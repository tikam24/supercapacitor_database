In this work, N-doped biomass-char (N-BC) was adopted to fill and coat the commercial nickel foam (NF) achieved by the calcination of gelatin in air atmosphere. Subsequently, the Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4 nanosheet arrays were hydrothermally in-site grown on the N-BC-filled/coated NF (denoted as Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF@N-BC). Served directly as a self-supporting electrode for supercapacitors, Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF@N-BC holds an areal specific capacitance of 1162.5 mF cm−2 at a corresponding 1 mA cm−2 current density, much higher than that of Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF (748.8mF cm−2) without the introduction of N-BC. Moreover, Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF@N-BC shows excellent rate capability and durability. Additionally, the assembled two-electrode (Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF@N-BC vs. active carbon (AC)@NF) all-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor is capable of reaching an energy density of 33.7 Wh kg−1 at 347.8 W kg−1. The significantly enhanced supercapacitive performance of Ni0.33Co0.67MoO4/NF with N-BC filling and coating emanates from the reduction of void space for NF and the improvement of electroconductivity.
