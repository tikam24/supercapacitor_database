In this study, pure and Fe-doped CdSe (Fe@CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) in various concentrations have been prepared via the chemical co-precipitation method. The PXRD, FT-IR, UV–vis spectroscopy, and HR-TEM micrographs have been utilized to confirm the structural, optical, and morphological features of as-synthesized QDs. The optical bandgap values of pure and Fe@CdSe QDs have been found to vary from 2.12 eV to 1.82 eV, as determined by the Tauc relation, and the absorption spectrum of pure and Fe@CdSe QDs exhibits a blue shift compared to the bulk CdSe. Moreover, three-electrode configuration systems have been employed to characterize the electrochemical properties of pure and Fe@CdSe QDs. Notably, the areal capacitance of pure CdSe is 47 mFcm−2, which considerably increases to ∼73 mFcm−2 for 6 mol.% Fe@CdSe QDs QDs at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1.
