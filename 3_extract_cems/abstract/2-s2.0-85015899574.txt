Different morphologies of Co3O4 grown on nickel foam and carbon fiber substrate were synthesized by hydrothermal method with different filling volume. The structure and morphology of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the cobalt oxide products with the same phase and different morphologies could be prepared by changing the filling volume in the hydrothermal reaction system. Electrochemical properties of Co3O4 grown on nickel foam electrode were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance measurements method. The results indicated that the reaction system with 70% filling volume prepared uniform Co3O4 nanocluster arrays, which exhibited better pseudocapacitive performance with a high capacitance of 961 F/g at 1 A/g in 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte, and 76% was maintained when the current density increased to 20 A/g.
