Graphene-like activated and non-activated carbon nanostructures were synthesized from various natural sources like sugar, rice husk and jute. These carbon nanostructures were characterized using SEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, surface area and thermogravimetric analysis. The electrochemical studies of these carbon materials confirm their promising characteristics for supercapacitor applications. Activated carbon nanostructures exhibit higher specific capacitance compared to that of non-activated carbons (non-Ac sugar). The activated carbon (Ac-jute) exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 476 F/g at an applied current density of 0.2 A/g which is much higher than that of graphene oxide (GO).
