As an ideal energy storage device, supercapacitor has attracted extensive attention of researchers. Electrochemical properties of supercapacitors are mainly determined by electrode materials, among which two-dimensional graphene-based material, as an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors, exists the problems of low specific capacity and easy agglomeration. In order to solve the problems, the method compositing graphene-based material with other materials is adopted to improve the electrochemical performance of materials. The electrode materials prepared by compositing graphene-based materials with metal oxides, MXenes and MOFs, respectively are reviewed, and their electrochemical properties are analyzed. Future development direction for graphene-based composites is prospected.
