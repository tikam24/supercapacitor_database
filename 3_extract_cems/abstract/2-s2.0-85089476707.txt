The design or dimension of micro-supercapacitor electrodes is an important factor that determines their performance. In this study, a microsupercapacitor was precisely fabricated on a silicon substrate by irradiating an imprinted furan micropattern with a CO2 laser beam under ambient conditions. Since furan is a carbon-abundant polymer, electrically conductive and porous carbon structures were produced by laser-induced pyrolysis. While the pyrolysis of a furan film in a general electric furnace resulted in severe cracks and delamination, the laser pyrolysis method proposed herein yielded porous carbon films without cracks or delamination. Moreover, as the imprinting process already designated the furan area for laser pyrolysis, high-precision patterning was achieved in the subsequent laser pyrolysis step. This two-step process exploited the superior resolution of imprinting for the fabrication of a laser-pyrolyzed carbon micropattern. As a result, the technical limitations of conventional laser direct writing could be overcome. The laser-pyrolyzed carbon structure was employed for microsupercapacitor electrodes. The microsupercapacitor showed a specific capacitance of 0.92 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 with a PVA-H2SO4 gel electrolyte, and retained an up to 88% capacitance after 10,000 charging/discharging cycles.
