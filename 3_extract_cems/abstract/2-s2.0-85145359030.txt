Ternary transition metal sulfides have attracted much attention due to their superior electrochemical properties. Nevertheless, it is difficult to commercialize sulfides due to their intrinsic properties such as dull reaction kinetics and an insufficient number of active sites. Herein, a self-supporting porous NiCoMnS sulfide (NiCoMnS/NF) arrayed on nickel foam (NF) with 3D honeycomb-like structure was designed and prepared via a hydrothermal and post-sulfidation process. It was found that the 3D hierarchically network architecture, constructed by nanosheets with abundant cavities, endowed NiCoMnS/NF with a high specific area and rich ion/electron-transport channels, which facilitated ion/electron transfer and Faradaic reaction kinetic. The optimal NiCoMnS/NF exhibited a markedly improved electrochemical performance due to the merits of complementary multi-composition and unique 3D network structure with multi-level “superhighways”. Furthermore, the NiCoMnS//AC device fabricated with NiCoMnS/NF cathode and activated carbon (AC) anode delivered an excellent specific charge and exceptional energy density. This work offers a reference for designing the structure of electrode materials.
