Both Î±-Co(OH)2 and Co3O4 porous microspheres have been synthesized by the simple solvothermal process as well as subsequent treatment. The morphologies and structures of the as-synthesized products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Both samples have spherical structures consisting of nanosheets, with similar crystallinity. The electrochemical properties of both samples were further investigated. Both samples show excellent electrochemical performances including high specific capacity, good cycling stability and rate capability. All results show that these microspheres exhibit potential applications in energy storage field.
