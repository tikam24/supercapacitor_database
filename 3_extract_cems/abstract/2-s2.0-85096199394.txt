Prototype solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSS) device has been designed by using two MWCNT/Fe2O3 electrodes assembled through polyvinyl alcohol-lithium chloride gel electrolyte as mediator onto flexible stainless steel substrate. Through electrochemical investigation as-fabricated device demonstrated 70.16 F g−1 of specific capacitance with remarkable 9.74 W h kg−1 specific energy and 487 W kg−1 specific power at current density of 0.57 A g−1. Assembled device delivers an outstanding volumetric energy of 24.36 mW h cm−3 compensating volumetric power of 1218 mW cm−3 at a current density of 1.42 mA cm−3. The cycle repeatability test of MWCNTs/Fe2O3 SSS device exhibited capacitance retention of 75% for 1500 cycles.
