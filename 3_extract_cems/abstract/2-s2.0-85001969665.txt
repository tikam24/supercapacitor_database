A traction elevator system is analytically simulated in this paper, driven by an induction motor, in order to study possible energy saving modes of operation in terms of returning energy to the DC link of the drive system during regenerating braking with two possible methods, i.e. with supercapacitors or with a Flywheel driven by a permanent magnet motor. The efficiency of the two proposed methods is investigated and useful conclusions are extracted.
