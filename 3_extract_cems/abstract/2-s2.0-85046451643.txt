As a kind of low-cost transparent conductive material with good film-forming properties, high thermal stability and tunable conductivity, poly(3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT) has exhibited attractive applications in various energy conversion and storage devices. However, the performances of these devices are restricted by some drawbacks of PEDOT, mainly its low conductivity. In this review, firstly the basic properties, commonly adopted chemical and physical approaches for synthesizing PEDOT films and several ways to improve their conductivity are briefly introduced. Then the latest research progresses of devices including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, electrochromic devices and supercapacitors assembled by PEDOT and PEDOT-based composited materials are reviewed. In addition to elucidating the roles of PEDOT-based materials played in the aforementioned devices, the design ideas of PEDOT-based materials proposed by researchers for fulfilling the requirements of different devices are introduced in detail. The ideas include designing PEDOT films with specific microstructures, modulating the conductivity, work function, optical transparency and other properties of PEDOT, and coupling PEDOT with other active materials such as carbon materials, metal nanoparticles and metal oxides. Finally, the challenges nowadays in the studying of PEDOT-based electrode materials are pointed out, and the prospect of these materials is proposed.
