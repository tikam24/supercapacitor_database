In this work, nitrogen-doped carbon microfiber (NCMF) is fabricated via a facile co-assembly of natural silk and graphene oxide (GO) and the following thermal treatment. The amphiphilic nature of GO endows NCMF a crumpled surface with a high surface area of 115 m2 g-1. As the binder-free electrode in electrical double-layer capacitors, NCMF shows an excellent capacitance of 196 F g-1 at scan rate of 5 mV s-1, which is almost four times higher than that of the pristine CMF from silk (55 F g-1). Additionally, the capacitance of NCMF can be kept around 92 F g-1 at a high scan rate of 300 mV s-1 even after 10000 cycles. More importantly, a high energy density (≈ 22.7 μW h cm-2) and power density (≈ 10.26 mW cm-2) are achieved by the all-solid-state supercapacitor based on NCMF.
