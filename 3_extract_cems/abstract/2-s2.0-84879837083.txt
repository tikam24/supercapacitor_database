KOH-activated nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (aNG) have been synthesized using thermal annealing method and applied in supercapacitor. The samples are characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. Electrochemical results show that a capacitance of 132.4 F g-1 at a charge/discharge current density of 0.1 A g -1 is obtained for KOH-activated nitrogen-doped graphene which is nearly five times larger than that without KOH treatment. The present work demonstrates that KOH activation of thermally annealed nitrogen-doped graphene is a promising method for enhancing its application in energy storage system.
