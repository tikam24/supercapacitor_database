The conductive two-dimensional metal-organic framework (Ni-CAT) nanocones were decorated on the flower petals surface of layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) based nanoflowers, just like the surface microstructure of lotus leaves. This interesting composite structure displays excellent specific capacitance of 882 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, resulting from the synergistic between Ni-CAT and NiCo-LDH. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using NiCo-LDH@Ni-CAT as positive electrode, which also diaplays high energy density of 23.5 Wh kg−1 at power density of 394.6 W kg−1 and long-term cycling stability up to 82% after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, this work demonstrates an excellent method of the designing and fabricating hybrid electrode materials based on conductive two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks and layered double hydroxides to apply in supercapacitors.
