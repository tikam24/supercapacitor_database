Various novel carbonaceous materials including carbon nanotubes, nano-onions, carbon microspheres, graphene nanosheets, and carbon microfibers with unique properties, such as tunable surface area and pore size, high chemical stability, cost-effective and facile preparation, have attracted enormous interest for many applications. Also essential, the activation processes play a critical role to achieve these valuable properties. In this review, we provide a thorough analysis of the emerging nano- and microscopic carbon species with special morphology/textures and currently available types of chemical activation agents, and novel activation strategy to enhance electrochemical performance of activated carbon material in electrical energy storage devices including supercapacitor and alkaline ions batteries. A particular emphasis is set on recent advance in activated carbon materials with special morphology/textures for supercapacitors and sodium ion batteries.
