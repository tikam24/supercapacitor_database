Due to the enlarged interlayer spacing of anion-inserted hydroxides and their increased surface area, the unique structure of double-layered hydroxides is often beneficial for electrochemical energy storage. This work demonstrates that Ce3+-regulated CoNi-layered double hydroxides (CoNi-LDHs) significantly enhance the kinetics of electron transfer and ion motion with increased layer positive charges and weakened O-H bonds. The Ce3+ addition enabled a high rate capacitance of 1000 F g−1 at an ultrahigh charge rate of 50 A g−1 compared with 1322 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Served as Lewis acid sites, the substituting trivalent Ce3+ for Co2+ decreases the energy barrier of proton diffusion and promotes the fast charge storage kinetics by increasing the hole carrier concentration (6.74 × 1024 cm−3). The fabricated supercapacitor device achieves a high energy density of 30 W h kg−1 at a power density of 10 kW kg−1 (40 A g−1) based on the total mass of active materials. This work simultaneously enhanced intrinsic electronic conductivity and ion diffusion in an electrode by Ce3+ addition.
