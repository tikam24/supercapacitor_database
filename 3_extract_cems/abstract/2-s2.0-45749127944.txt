A novel resistive-capacitive-inductive transmission-line equivalent circuit was used to model direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). This fuel cell model inherited and improved existing impedance fuel cell model and transmission-line fuel cell model in many aspects. The transmission line model can properly describe the inductive and capacitive behaviors of DMFC operating in both low and high frequency regions. The advantages of this transmission line fuel cell model have been discussed based on well-known experimental impedance spectrum of DMFC. Finally, the model has been used to simulate the capacitance efficiency of DMFC. The numerical simulation proved that increasing double-layer capacitance of DMFC can provide good dynamic performance similar to a DMFC and supercapacitor hybrid power component.
