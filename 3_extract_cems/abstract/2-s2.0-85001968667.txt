Nanocomposites of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets and polypyrrole nanotubes (PPyNTs) have been synthesized by in-situ reduction of graphene oxide in presence of PPyNTs as spacers. The morphology and structure of the samples were investigated by High resolution transmission electron microscope, Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and Micro-Raman spectroscopy. Electrical and electrochemical properties of the samples were characterized by current-voltage characteristics, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. The nanocomposites exhibit high specific capacitance and good electrochemical stability as electrode material for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance gradually increases to 281 F g−1 with the increase in feeding of RGO and the capacitive retention is about 77.28% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. A maximum energy density of 39 W h kg−1 and power density of 3105 W kg−1 are achieved by utilizing the surface area of RGO nanosheets with the help of PPyNTs as spacers. These results demonstrate the synergistic effect of 1D PPyNTs and 2D RGO nanosheets for their possible applications as high performance energy storage devices.
