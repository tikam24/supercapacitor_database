In this paper, we report a nanostructured CMK-3/NiCo2S4 electrode material for supercapacitors. Owing to the introduction of CMK-3, the CMK-3/NiCo2S4 electrode exhibits a novel nanostructure of nanorods, and has a great improvement in conductivity. The CMK-3/NiCo2S4 electrode demonstrates a high specific capacitance (1843.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, 3.89 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (94.2% over 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is assembled with CMK-3/NiCo2S4 and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrode, respectively, to characterize the electrodes’ electrochemical performance. The ASC device achieves a high energy density (34.9 Wh/kg at 357 W/kg) and a high power density (7300 W/kg at 15.3 Wh/kg), suggesting that the composite is a superior electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
