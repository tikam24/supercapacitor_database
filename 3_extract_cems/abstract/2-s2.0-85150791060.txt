Electrode surface roughness significantly impacts the structure of electric double layer on a molecular scale. We derive analytical solutions for differential capacitance (DC) of electric double layer near rough electrode surface, comparing them with a range of experimental and numerical studies. Two causes of ions separation are considered: ion size asymmetry and electrode surface roughness. By ions separation we mean rearrangement of ions with different sizes due to steric interactions with electrode surface. The model has three scale parameters determining DC properties: the Debye length, difference of ion penetration depths, and surface roughness parameter. For the first time, DC profile with more than two peaks was obtained analytically due to account for ions reorientation effect. The model predicts DC curve transform from bell to camel shape and inverse induced by electrode surface roughness. The behavior of DC-potential relation with temperature and ion size ratio diverges depending on the type of ions separation. Additionally, we provide analytical solutions for zero charge potential and demonstrate roughness effect on its value. Based on the results, we give recommendations for properties required to design effective electric double layer capacitors.
