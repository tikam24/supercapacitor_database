The Graphene oxide/Cobalt oxide (GO/Co3O4) nanocomposite was synthesized by varying weight ratio of Co3O4 through a simple hydrothermal method and derived nanocomposite have emerged as promising candidates for applications in renewable energy storage/conversion device. They are known to exhibit large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, high mechanical strength and flexibility, when performing structural, morphological, chemical compositional and surface area/pore-size distribution analysis. Fabricated GO/Co3O4 nanocomposite electrode was performed with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte as separator and examined the supercapacitor performance. As an outcome, the maximum specific capacitance (Csp) achieved by the GO/Co3O4-5 electrode is of 1012 Fg−1 at current density (CD) of 2 Ag−1. The assembled GO/Co3O4-5 electrode supercapacitor device retains the energy density of 18.9 Whkg−1 with a high-power density of 1364.8 Wkg−1. It observed the coulombic efficiency is 96.9% and capacitance retention is 70.3% even after 4000 cycles. These results demonstrate that GO/Co3O4 nanocomposite material is highly prominent material for supercapacitor application.
