In this report, we successfully prepared nitrogen-doped porous carbon (N-PC)/manganese dioxide (MnO2) composite for a high-performance supercapacitor. X-ray diffraction data revealed the α-MnO2 phase. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the nanostructured α-MnO2 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of N-PC. The N-PC/α-MnO2 composite delivered a capacitance of 525.7 F g−1 at the charging current of 1.0 A g−1. The higher capacitance of the composite could be owing to the synergy of MnO2 and N-PC. Besides, the electrode exhibited a 14.7% capacitance loss after 6000 charge–discharge cycles at 10 A g−1 indicating good electrochemical stability.
