Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) have been regarded as one of the promising energy devices thanks to its low cost and compromise between energy density and power density, yet remain a challenge towards practical levels of mass loading (>10 mg cm−2). Herein, the fabrication of a 1D core–shell structure is reported with N-doped porous carbon encapsulating ZnV2O4 nanofibers (ZnV2O4NFs@N-PC), which features an open framework and favorable properties for facilitating ion diffusion, mass transportation, and electron transfer, enabling it to perform impressively for sodium ions storage. A 3D printed SIHC is conceptually proposed by coupling the 3D printed ZnV2O4NFs@N-PC anode with a 3D printed active carbon cathode, which can deliver a high energy/power density of 145.07 Wh kg−1/3677.1 W kg−1 with a durable cycling lifespan. It is demonstrated that the 3D printed SIHC, even at a high mass loading of up to 16.25 mg cm−2, can release a high areal energy/power density of 1.67 mWh cm−2/38.96 mW cm−2, outperforming most of the SIHCs developed so far. The present work sheds light on the role of the design of electrode materials and verifies the promise of 3D-printed technology for next-generation electrochemical energy devices.
