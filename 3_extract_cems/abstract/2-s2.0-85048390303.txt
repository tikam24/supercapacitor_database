In this paper we demonstrate the synthesis of a BiVO4/rGO hybrid nanostructure by a simple hydrothermal method. A symmetric cell based on this hybrid nanostructure was fabricated and its electrochemical properties tested in both PVA/H2SO4 gel and aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. The BiVO4/rGO hybrid-based symmetric supercapacitor exhibited better performance in the solid electrolyte with a high specific capacitance of 400 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and excellent energy density of 35.37 W h kg-1. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor shows excellent stability, retaining 98% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles.
