Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with orderly porous structure, large surface area, high electrochemical response and chemical tunability have been widely studied for energy conversion and storage. However, most reported MOFs still suffer from poor stability, insufficient conductivity, and low utilization of active sites. One strategy to circumvent these issues is to optimize MOFs via designing composites. Here, the design principle from the viewpoint of the intrinsic relationships among various components will be illuminated to acquire the synergistic effects, including two working modes: (1) MOFs with assistant components, (2) MOFs with other function components. This review introduces recent research progress of MOF-based composites with their typical applications in energy conversion (catalysis) and storage (supercapacitor and ion battery). Finally, the challenges and future prospects of MOF-based composites will be discussed in terms of maximizing composite properties.
