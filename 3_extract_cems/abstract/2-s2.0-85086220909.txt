Wave energy is a renewable energy with a high density. There are different types of wave power generation systems (WPGSs), including Archimedes wave swing (AWS) coupled to a linear permanent magnet synchronous generator. This study proposes a model predictive control (MPC) for AWS-based WPGS. The predictive current controller is implemented in a generator-side converter as a substation for proportional integral (PI) controllers with pulse-width modulation (PWM). Also, a supercapacitor energy storage system with bidirectional DC/DC converter is proposed to maintain DC link voltage stability. A DC/DC converter is used to keep DC microgrid bus voltage at the desired value. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC method is tested at various operating conditions and compared with conventional PI controllers with PWM in the MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.
