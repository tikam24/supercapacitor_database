In this rapid growing world, the demand of alternate or non-conventional energy sources with high density and power has been tremendously increased. Supercapacitor is one of the promising energy storage devices which possess high specific capacitance, high power density and long life cycle. The performance of supercapacitors is evaluated by its electrode materials. Among the various supercapacitor electrode materials, recent research focused on synthesis of transition metal oxides/ hydroxides, carbon metals and polymers. Transition metal oxides such as manganese oxide (MnO2), ruthenium oxide (RuO2), cobalt oxide (Co3O4), nickel oxides (NiO) etc. have been widely used as supercapacitor electrode materials for storing the potential energy. In this paper, we explored the details of metal oxide material based supercapacitor electrodes and their composition via electrochemical deposition technique. We also discussed the basic parameters involved in supercapacitor studies and advantages of electrochemical deposition technique through analysis of the literature.
