The proceedings contain 92 papers. The topics discussed include: effect of divalent cations in Langmuir-Blodgett Films on the protection of copper against corrosion; hydrogen in the plastic deformed steel; the effect of the compression on the mechanical properties of wood material; fatigue properties of welded joints of high-carbon steels; relationship between bending modulus and test sizes of laminated glass/polyester composites; carbon nanotube as ceramic matrix reinforcements; high-performance self-reinforced polypropylene composites; development of composite structures for ballistic protection; supercapacitor electrodes made from mixture of amorphous carbon nanoparticles and carbon black; damage analysis of heat resistant steels; the sodium transport in polycrystalline alumina; development of a novel vibrating sample magnetometer; mechanical testing of tendon; and micro structural aspects of unstable crack propagation in ferritic steels.
