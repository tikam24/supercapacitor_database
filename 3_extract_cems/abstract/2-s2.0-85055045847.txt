TiO2/C composite have been widely used in photoelectrochemistry and electrochemistry. Herein, we report a simple and ultrafast approach to produce TiO2/C nanocomposite. Multilayered Ti3C2Tx, i. e. MXenes material, was oxidized into TiO2/C nanocomposite under microwave irradiation in 20 seconds. The resulting TiO2/C nanocomposite have a multilayer carbon structure and the TiO2 crystals are embedded in the carbon layer. The interlayered TiO2 could effectively prevent the restacking of carbon flakes. As an electrode material, the special structure of TiO2/C can increase the diffusion channel of ions and improve the transmission of electrons. Therefore, the TiO2/C nanocomposite exhibit good cycle stability. The TiO2/C nanocomposite are expected to be used for other electrode materials, such as lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries and photoelectrocatalysis devices.
