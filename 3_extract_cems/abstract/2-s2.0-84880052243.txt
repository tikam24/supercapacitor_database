We report a facile, cost-effective and one-step carbonization and activation of cattail biomass to prepare porous carbon foam. Due to its high specific surface area (1951 m2 g-1) and cross-linked foam structure, carbon foam material demonstrates is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor with high specific capacitance of 336 F g-1, good rate performance and cycle stability.
