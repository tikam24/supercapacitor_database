In this study, a facile, cost-effective, and green solvent exfoliation route with bio extract was derived from Cissus quadrangularis (MP) and it was used to exfoliate to get the few layers of MoS2. Compared to conventional chemical exfoliation, the green solvent exfoliation method showed quick delamination from the bulk MoS2. To compare the effectiveness of the exfoliation in green solvents, the exfoliation analysis of the bulk MoS2 was conducted in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone and another bio-extract with low Hansen properties was derived from Mussa acuminate. The MP-derived green extract showed excellent delamination of the few layers of MoS2 nanosheets with a minimal processing time of 2 h. It was confirmed that the layered structure with a lateral size of 150 nm and a d-spacing was 0.63 nm by HRTEM, and also Raman spectrum revealed the minimum frequency difference (24.6 cm−1) for MP, which confirmed the presence of the few-layer MoS2. The obtained few-layered MoS2 nanosheets were further examined as an electrode material for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and supercapacitor applications. The fabricated DSSC with MP-electrode showed increased Voc with a photo conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.14 %. As a supercapacitor electrode, it exhibited a significant potential window expansion of 0.1 V with a specific capacitance of 183 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1. This work opens up a simple, inexpensive, and eco-friendly green solvent exfoliation methodology to obtain the layers of 2D materials.
