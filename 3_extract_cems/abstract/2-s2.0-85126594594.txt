Carbon fibers were fluorinated/fluoroalkylated by heating in 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane at 300 °C, 400 °C, and 550 °C. The increase in the fluorination temperature leads to a decrease in the total electric resistance of carbon fibers. The use of fluorinated/fluoroalkylated carbon fibers caused an increase in the capacitance of the electric circuit up to 3.8 times. Herein, we demonstrate that the fluorination of carbons, on the example of carbon fibers, is a simple way to improve the electrical performance of carbon materials for supercapacitors.
