ZnCo2O4 as an electrode material for supercapacitors has been extensively investigated owing to its unique structural characteristics and high capacitance. However, the conductivity still cannot reach the level of the industrialization. In order to solve this problem, it is an efficient strategy to develop composed electrode materials. Here, we prepare ZnCo2O4-based electrode materials through a facile hydrothermal route. The ZnCo2O4/CoMoO4 sample possesses a specific capacitance of 903 C at 1 A g-1. An assembled asymmetric capacitor presents an energy density of 135.6 Wh kg-1 at 2704.1 W kg-1 and capacity of 95.1% after 8000 cycles.
