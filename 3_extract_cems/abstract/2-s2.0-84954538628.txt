Graphene-based electrode materials have been widely explored for supercapacitor applications due to their unique two-dimensional structure and properties. In particular, Three-dimensional (3D) graphene materials are of great importance for preparing electrode materials because they can provide large surface area, efficient and rapid electron and ion transfer, and mechanical stability. Recently, a number of 3D hybrid architecture of graphene/metal oxides have been developed to increase simultaneously energy and power densities of supercapacitors. This review presents the recent progress of 3D nanocomposites based on graphene and metal oxides. Preparation methods and structures of these 3D nanocomposites and their great potential in supercapacitor applications have been summarized.
