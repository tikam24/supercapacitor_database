In this study, the organic synthesis, electrochemical polymerization and electrochemical characterization of a novel 2-(thiophen-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one, 3, monomer have been reported for supercapacitor applications. Electrode active material was formed electrochemically coating of poly(2-(thiophen-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4H)-one) (PTTMO) on pencil graphite electrode (PGE). Electrochemical polymerization was carried out by chronoamperometric (CA) technique in an acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 0.01 M monomer and 0.10 M tetrabuthylammonium perchlorate (TBAP). The prepared PGE/PTTMO electrode has been monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical properties of the electrode have been investigated by CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge and repeating chronopotentiometry (RCP) techniques with two or three electrode systems. PGE/PTTMO has exhibited a capacitive performance with highest specific capacitances of 193.00 F g- 1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s- 1. On the other hand, the electrode has shown good charge-discharge cycling stability with the retained ratio about 90.83%.
