A homogeneous Ni(OH)2/ carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanocomposite with excellent supercapacitive performance has been synthesized via a facile chemical precipitation. The microstructure and morphology of Ni(OH)2/CNTs nanocomposite were investigated by XRD, SEM and TEM. It presented an ideal morphology with the nano-sized Ni(OH)2 particles homogeneously growing on the CNTs. The electrochemical performance of the Ni(OH)2/CNTs nanocomposite was test by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The synthesized Ni(OH)2/CNTs nanocomposite shows superior electrochemical performance, including high capacitance, excellent rate capability and good cycle life. The homogeneous Ni(OH)2/ CNTs nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1741 F g-1 at a current density of 1A g-1 and maintained a good stability after 5000 cycles at 10A g-1,, suggesting that it can be a promising candidate for supercapacitor.
