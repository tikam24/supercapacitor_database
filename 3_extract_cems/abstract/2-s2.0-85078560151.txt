The morphology and size of nanostructures have been considered to be directly related to capacitive performance. Additionally, hydrothermal synthesis is a common method to control nanostructures. In practice, researchers paid more attention to the direct effect of “useful ions” on morphology or size of nanostructures, e.g. the combination and decomposition processes of H+ and WO42− to form WO3. Unfortunately, the effects of other incidental residual ions on the nanostructures have been often neglected. Herein, we add an extra procedure (cleaning the precursor) in the as-optimized hydrothermal synthesis routine to remove residual ions in the solution around tungstic acid colloids. A comparative study shows such an extra procedure would result in a further considerable reduction of WO3 nanoplates in the thickness by 50% and in a prominent enhancement of the specific capacitance from 203.5 F g−1 to 334.0 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The thin WO3 nanoplates also show outstanding cycle stability for 5000 cycles. Interestingly, when we refilled the precursors solution with the Na+ and Cl− ions again, the thickness of WO3 nanoplates gradually thickens as the increase of NaCl content. In this way, the effect of residual ions on the thickness of nanoplates has been experimentally demonstrated. Otherwise, this facile method can be helpful to establish a bridge between the physical deposition method, which is suitable for the complete fabrications of single thin layer materials with less active sites and the common hydrothermal synthesis method, which tends to produce thicker fragmental nanoplates but more abundant reaction sites. Also, this simple and efficient method can be extended to the preparation of thin nanoplates of other transition metal oxides and better electrochemical performance can be expected.
