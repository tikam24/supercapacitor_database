In the process of creating a self-dependent and reliable renewable solar-powered energy system, an active management strategy is offered that integrates multiple hybrid energy storage options. This study presents a microgrid stand-alone power system arrangement with the traditional proportional-integral (PI) control approach as a power management strategy. All four of energy storage and generation technologies - photovoltaics (PVs), fuel cells (FCs), supercapacitors, and batteries - are integrated into the proposed system. The system's demand power is used to provide a dump load. To get the most out of the electricity generated by the PV array, the system utilizes a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) circuit as well as a DC/DC and DC/AC converter. There is a clear illustration of how the system's benefits may be leveraged to deal with the drawbacks of the individual sources and reduce the wasteful usage of hydrogen. Primary system characteristics, such as FC current and battery and SC states of charge (SOC), are regulated using the time-tested PI control approach. The system was built in MATLAB/Simulink for the purposes of analysis and monitoring.
