Carbon represents one of the most prominent materials for energy applications. It is always desirable to achieve high value-added carbon materials from biomass wastes. Herein, the advanced carbon materials with multi-heteroatom-doping, high surface area and hierarchical porosity are prepared by hydrothermal conversion and post-activation of silkworm excrement, an agricultural waste. Owing to their unique composition and porosity, the carbon networks show a specific capacitance as high as 412 F g−1 in 6M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. The symmetric supercapacitor device can deliver a high energy density up to 28.78 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 300 W kg−1 with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. It also exhibits superb cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92.9% for 10000 cycles. This work demonstrates a facile and eco-friendly strategy to transform biomass wastes into superior carbon electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
