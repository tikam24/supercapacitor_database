Graphene (GR) has excellent physical and chemical properties, making it promising for application in supercapacitors. In this study, we report the synthesis of spherical GR (SGR) composed of tens of GR sheets and its application in supercapacitors. Graphene oxide (GO) was first reduced in the liquid phase by using L-ascorbic acid (L-AA), an environmentally friendly reducing agent, and then SGR was prepared using the reduced GO colloid by aerosol spray drying. The reduction of GO in the liquid phase was completed in 1 h. The SGR fabricated by the aerosol process ranged from 2 to 4 Î¼m in diameter. The as-prepared SGR fabricated from GO at pH 2 showed a densely packed spherical morphology and porous structure with a specific surface area of 150 m2/g. The SGR fabricated from the GO colloid at pH 10 showed an improved specific surface area (216 m2/g) and a higher specific capacitance (182 F/g) than the SGR fabricated at pH 2. Considering the environmentally friendly process, the as-prepared SGR is a highly promising material for supercapacitors.
