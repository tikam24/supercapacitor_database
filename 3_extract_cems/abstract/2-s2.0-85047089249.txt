Although challenging, fabrication of porous conducting polymeric materials with excellent electronic properties is crucial for many applications. We developed a fast in situ polymerization approach to pure polyaniline (PANI) hydrogels, with vanadium pentoxide hydrate nanowires as both the oxidant and sacrifice template. A network comprised of ultrathin PANI nanofibers was generated during the in situ polymerization, and the large aspect ratio of these PANI nanofibers allowed the formation of hydrogels at a low solid content of 1.03 wt %. Owing to the ultrathin fibril structure, PANI hydrogels functioning as a supercapacitor electrode display a high specific capacitance of 636 F g-1, a rate capability, and good cycling stability (âˆ¼83% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles). This method was also extended to the preparation of polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) hydrogels. This template polymerization method represents a rational strategy for design of conducing polymer networks, which can be readily integrated in high-performance devices or a further platform for functional composites.
