Nowadays, the design and fabrication of high-performance and low-cost electrode materials for energy storage and conversion systems are highly desired. The nanostructured materials are interesting for energy-related applications due to the large surface area, enormous active sites which ensure the complete utilization of active material. In this paper, we report a three-dimensional (3D) MnO2 nanorod forest network on carbon textile (MnO2–NRF@CT) with the hierarchical porous structure as a binder-free electrode material for supercapacitor. MnO2–NRF is directly grown on carbon textile surface by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The carbon textile greatly improved the graphitization degree in MnO2–NRF composite. Typically, MnO2–NRF@CT sample indicates a partially graphitic structure having a low-intensity ratio of Raman D to G band (ID/IG = 0.68), which significantly increases the electrical conductivity and enhanced the performance of the supercapacitor. Consequently, the MnO2–NRF@CT porous architecture as supercapacitor electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance (961 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte). The MnO2–NRF@CT shows good capacitance retention by achieving 92% of its initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. The long life and good stability highlighted its great potential for future supercapacitor applications.
