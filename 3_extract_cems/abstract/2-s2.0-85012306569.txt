Three-dimensional porous nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels (NGAs) were synthesized by using graphene oxide (GO) and chitosan via a self-assembly process by a rapid method. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared aerogels were characterized. The results showed that NGAs possesed the hierarchical pores with the wide size distribution ranging from mesopores to macropores. The NGAs carbonized at different temperature all showed excellent electrochemical performance in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte and the electrochemical performance of the NGA-900 was the best. When working as a supercapacitor electrode, NGA-900 exhibited a high specific capacitance (244.4 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g), superior rate capability (51.0% capacity retention) and excellent cycling life (96.2% capacitance retained after 5000 cycles).
