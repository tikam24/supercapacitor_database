Nanoporous carbon materials with a controlled pore size and surface area were prepared using grafting method. The use of 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane (MPTMS) as a grafting material played an important role in producing a porous structure by linking the silica to the polymer, with the subsequent formation of a silica-polymer composite. Importantly, the use of an organic solvent, compared to an aqueous solvent, has a positive effect in forming uniform and well-developed carbon structures, due to the high degree of dispersion with well-mixing of the carbon and silica precursors. The amounts of MPTMS and carbon precursor used determined the pore size and surface area of resulting carbon materials. The optimum ratio of MPTMS and carbon precursor for achieving a high surface area in excess of 2000 m 2/g was determined. The use of a large amount of carbon precursor resulted in carbons with a relatively small surface area and an increase in MPTMS content led to an increase in the microporous structures. The capacitance value of the porous carbon prepared using the optimum ratio was determined to be 150 F/g. Copyright Â© 2011 American Scientific Publishers.
