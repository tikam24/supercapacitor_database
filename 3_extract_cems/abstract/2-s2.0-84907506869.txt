In this paper, we review the preparation methods of carbon nanotube (CNT) / graphene composite materials for the electrode of supercapacitors, and introduce the developments of CNT / graphene / pseudo-capacitive material ternary composite materials with highly electrochemical performance. The rational designed CNT / graphene composite nanostructures could largely utilize the characteristics of carbon nanomaterials for electrochemical double-large supercapacitors, such as large specific area, high conductivity and befitting porous structure, and also achieve large mass loading of pseudo-capacitive materials with high dispersion for pseudo-capacitors. As a result, these composite materials are promising candidates for the electrode materials of high-performance supercapacitors with high capacitance, excellent rate performance and long lifetime.
