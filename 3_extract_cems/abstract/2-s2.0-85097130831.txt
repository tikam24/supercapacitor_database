In a large-scale wind power generation system, active power fluctuation caused by random wind speed will have a serious impact on the power grid. In order to limit the power fluctuation that wind farm transmits to the power grid and protect the energy storage battery, this paper has proposed a model predictive control method of hybrid energy storage by optimizing the objective function and constraint conditions. Firstly, the mathematical model of predictive control method has been established in a wind power system with hybrid energy storage. Then, with the goal of minimum energy storage output and maximum charging-discharging capacity of the super-capacitor, the predictive control process has been optimized. Meanwhile, the constraint on the output power of the battery has been dynamically changed to reduce its charging-discharging switching frequency, and the model predictive control strategy of the hybrid energy storage has been formed. Finally, compared with the model prediction control method of single energy storage, based on a wind farm data, the simulation results show that the proposed method can smooth wind power fluctuation, reduce the time that the power does not satisfy the fluctuation requirements, ensure the capability of the super-capacitor, and reduce the charging-discharging switching frequency of the energy storage battery.
