This critical review focuses on the property analysis of graphene and graphene nanocomposites (GNCs) and their demonstrated superior performances in energy storage and conversion, electrochemical- and bio-sensing, environmental remediation and flame retardant application and atomic thickness membrane separation. The performances of graphene and GNCs are strongly dependent on their chemical component, synthetic method, nanoscale morphology, and assembling structure of the hybrids. The current progress in supercapacitor energy storage density, solar cell power conversion efficiency, thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency, electrochemical sensing capability, biosensor sensitivity, heavy metal adsorption capacity and efficiency, photocatalytic degradation rate of organic dye, flame retardant polymer nanocomposites, graphene and porous graphene membranes is discussed with detailed examples through extensive analysis of the literature.
