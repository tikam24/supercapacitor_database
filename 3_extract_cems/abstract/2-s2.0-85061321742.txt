Using potassium humate as carbon resource, activated carbons with tunable pore structures were prepared with three different activating agents (CH 3 COOK, KOH, CaCO 3 ) at 800 Â°C for 1 h in N 2 atmosphere. Their pore structure, surface morphology, and capacitive performance were systematically characterized by N 2 adsorption/desorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) tests. It is found that the ultramicro-pores (diameter<1 nm) have a significant effect on boosting the specific capacitance of the activated carbons. In these three activated carbons, the activated carbon prepared with CH 3 COOK exhibits the highest ultrammicro-porosity and the best electrochemical performance. More precisely, the specific surface area of this actived carbon is 1160 m 2 /g, with most of the pore distributing in 0.4-0.6 nm. This sample demonstrates a specific capacitance of 270 F/g at 0.1 A/g in 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte, with 87% of the initial capacitance remained after 3000 cycles.
