Mesoporous nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) nanosheets are synthesized using a cost effective, ultra fast and environmentally friendly microwave assisted heating method followed by a post-calcination process of the as-prepared precursors. XRD, XPS, BET, SEM, TEM and HRTEM methods are used to characterize the nanosheets. The as-prepared nanosheets with a thickness of around 2 nm possess many interparticle mesopores. The nanosheets have a mesoporous structure, high specific surface area (111.15 m2 g-1), large pore volume (0.3033 cm3 g-1) and narrow pore size distribution (2.25-10 nm). A flexible supercapacitor working electrode of the mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets is prepared on carbon cloth. Cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy measurements are used to investigate the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheet/carbon cloth electrode. The mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets exhibit specific capacitances of 292.5 and 200 F g-1 in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at current densities of 1 and 8 A g-1 respectively. The cyclic performance indicates excellent capacitance retention of 94.5% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 3 A g-1. The excellent cyclic stability can be attributed to the mesoporous nature, high specific surface area, large pore volume and narrow pore distribution of the nanosheets. The synthesized mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanosheets using a microwave method are proved to be excellent electrode material for advanced flexible supercapacitors.
