Abstract: Supercapacitors with high power density and excellent cycle life are considered to be a promising energy storage system for electric vehicle application. Because of low cost and high abundant, the preparation of iron oxides-based supercapacitors has become significant. Here, we reported the preparation of magnetite supercapacitors by using a facile one-step solvothermal method, where Mn2+ has been used as the doping element to modify the electrochemical properties of Fe3O4. The simply prepared supercapacitor showed a much higher electrochemical capacitance in contrast to reported Fe3O4-based electrochemical capacitors. The electrochemical capacitance at this supercapacitor can be as high as 268.4 F g−1 when the Mn2+ doped reached 1.5 mmol. There was not significant decrease in the capacitance after recycling 600 at 2 A g−1 in KOH aqueous solution. The excellent properties in the supercapacitor share a promising prospect with the development of a next generation of high- performance energy storage devices.
