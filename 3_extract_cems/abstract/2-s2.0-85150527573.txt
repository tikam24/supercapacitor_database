Biomass-based activated carbon (AC) has been widely used as a supercapacitor electrode. Although there have been many studies that explain the potential of biomass as a material to produce AC as supercapacitor electrodes in performance through specific capacitance values and energy values, there have been no studies that discuss their potential from an economic point of view. Therefore, this study aims to use mission grass as a supercapacitor electrode to produce AC based on techno-economic aspects. There are several calculations, including the cost of production, break-even point (BEP), payback period (PP), net present value (NPV), and sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, it is necessary to include an estimate of cost component data to calculate the small-scale production target of 5,472 units/year. The results showed that cost of production of USD 1.83/unit with a selling price of USD 2.37, BEP at 3,538 units earned a gross profit, PP, and a positive NPV of USD 8,380, 5 years, and USD 8,768, respectively. According to sensitivity analysis, changes in selling price to BEP are considered the most sensitive. These implies that using mission grass as a supercapacitor electrode is beneficial.
