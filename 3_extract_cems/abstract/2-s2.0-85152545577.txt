Urbanism means creating a community with responsible architecture and a high quality of life that is centered on people and the environment. Among them, electric energy, as one of the most commonly used energy sources, faces the problem of inconsistent load and power generation. Therefore, the storage of excess electric energy in the power grid is particularly important. As a single energy storage device is not able to meet the demand of the load, a background study on different energy storage components and structures is done, and a hybrid energy storage system based on battery and supercapacitor is proposed and analyzed. It contains a distribution transformer that can adjust the AC voltage precisely, a harmonic filter that can filter out the unwanted harmonic wave, AC/DC converter that can convert the alternating current into direct current, half-bridge DC/DC converter that can intelligently control the energy flow in the system. Using a battery and supercapacitor as energy storage components, the proposed system can store energy flexibly with multiple working modes. Compared with other energy storage systems, the proposed system not only can cope with the abrupt change of power supply and meet the different power requirements of the load, but also achieves the request of urbanism: environmentally friendly and sustainable.
