Binder-free mesoporous NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 nanowire arrays were grown using a facile hydrothermal technique. The Co 2 (CO 3 )(OH) 2 in NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 nanowire arrays was well-decorated as nano-dot scale (a few nanometer). In addition, increasing cobalt content in nickel compound matrix, NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 nanowire arrays were separately uniformly grown without agglomeration on Ni foam, providing a high specific surface area to help electrolyte access and ion transfer. The enticing composition and morphology of the NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 nanowire exhibit a superior specific capacity of 1288.2 mAh g −1 at a current density of 3 A g −1 and excellent cycling stability with the capacity retention of 80.7% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor composed of the NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 composite as a positive electrode and the graphene as a negative electrode presented a high energy density of 35.5 W h kg −1 at a power density of 2555.6 W kg −1 and satisfactory cycling stability with 71.3% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. The great combination of the active nano-dot Co 2 (CO 3 )(OH) 2 and the individually grown NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 nanowires made it a promising electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors. A well-developed nanoarchitecture of the nano-dot Co 2 (CO 3 )(OH) 2 decorated NiCo(CO 3 )(OH) 2 composite could pave the way for an excellent electrode design for high-performance supercapacitors.
