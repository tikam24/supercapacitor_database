The paper present a buck dc-dc converter used for supercapacitor charging. A description of circuit with the differential equation system is done and a mathematical model is created with the development environment MATLAB/Simulink. Simulations are carried on with given initial conditions. The results show that the converter is working stable with different distorting influences. A hardware realization is evaluated with a experimental board.
