Given the advantages of linear regulator techniques, low dropout regulator ICs are frequently used in portable consumer electronics. Only disadvantage in linear regulators, low efficiency, can be overcome by a very low frequency supercapacitor energy recovery technique to achieve efficiencies similar to common switching regulator techniques. This technique was successfully applied in a 12V to 5V regulator. The article provides some generalized theoretical background and different supercapacitor circulating options which can be applied to different cases of linear regulators. Â© 2010 IEEE.
