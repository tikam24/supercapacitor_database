Supercapacitor-based DC-DC converters can be built with end-to-end efficiencies of more than 80% and have eliminated EMI/RFI issues with operating frequencies ranging from tens of hertz down to a few millihertz. Multistage topologies can improve temporary energy storage capability by buffering against short-term failures of the power supply. This paper presents an analysis of a supercapacitor-based DC converter applicable to light-emitting diode (LED) lighting systems in a DC-microgrid environment. Further, it describes (i) supercapacitor-based converter topologies, (ii) a theoretical analysis of two-stage converter for LED lighting applications, and (iii) overall implementation details. Proof-of-concept prototype results are compared with theoretical predictions.
