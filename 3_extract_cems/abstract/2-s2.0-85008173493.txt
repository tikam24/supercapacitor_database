We have synthesized highly crystalline MnO 2 nanowires by wet chemical biphasic method. Further, the gold nanoparticles were decorated on MnO 2 nanowires. The MnO 2 nanowire and gold nanoparticle decorated MnO 2 nanowire samples were well characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy etc. The supercapacitor performance for both the samples was tested under the identical conditions. The gold nanoparticles decorated on MnO 2 nanowire exhibits cyclic stability cycles with only 3% capacity loss and maximum energy density of 37.08 Wh/kg. It has been observed that the gold decorated MnO 2 nanowire shows superior performance towards supercapacitor application due to the increased defects, surface area and increase in the capacity towards charge storage. Our results can open up new avenue towards utilization of MnO 2 nanowires and other metal oxide nanomaterials with controlled functionalization/decoration of metal nanoparticles for superior charge storage devices.
