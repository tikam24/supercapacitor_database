Activated carbon cloth is used as an electrode, achieving an excellent areal capacitance of 88 mF/cm2 (8.8 mF/g) without the use of any other capacitive materials. Significantly, when it is incorporated as part of a symmetric solid-state supercapacitor device, a remarkable charge/discharge rate capability is observed; 50% of the capacitance is retained when the charging rate increases from 10 to 10 000 mV/s.
