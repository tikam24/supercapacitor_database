Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are an ideal platform to construct electroactive materials for electrochemical energy storage due to their unique structure and excellent porosity. However, it is still a challenge to make full use of their structural advantages to rationally design multi-component electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, carbon-coated spherical sulfide nanoparticles are reported by simultaneous carbonization and sulfurization using bimetal/monometal-based MOFs as the precursors. The NiCo2S4@C and NiS@C composite nanoparticles have excellent electronic conductivity, large porosity and high electrochemical reaction activity. In particular, the bimetallic NiCo2S4@C-based electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 948.9 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled with NiCo2S4@C as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode achieves a high energy density of 43.8 Wh kg−1 with power density at 799.1 W kg−1, and a capacitance retention rate of 81.9% after being subjected to 5000 cycles of charge and discharge. The results suggests using MOFs as precursors is a feasible strategy to synthesize advanced sulfide-based multi-component materials for electrochemical energy storage.
