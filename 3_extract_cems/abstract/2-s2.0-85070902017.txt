Supercapacitors have attracted people's interest because of their ultra-high power density and excellent environmental performance. The manganese dioxide is an excellent electrode material. Due to it has the advantages of rich natural content, environmental protection, high specific capacity and crystal structure diversity. However, the MnO2 has low conductivity and the structural instability during the working process seriously affects the electrochemical performance. This paper summarizes the research of the study group and scholars at home and abroad for metal doping, complex sulfide, carbon material and conductive polymer composite, microstructure modification and core-shell structure recent years, and looks forward to the future research work direction and focus.
