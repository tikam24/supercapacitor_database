In order to improve the performances of electrode materials for super-capacitors, multi-element composite electrodes were prepared using RuO2 and MnO2 as active materials, and active carbon as basic materials. Good electrochemical performances of the composite electrodes were confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, galvano static charge/discharge and ac impedance measurements. When the content of MnO2 is 20wt% in composite electrode materials, the specific capacitance of MnO2/AC composite electrodes can reach 128 F/g with a resistance of 2.62 Ω. When the contents of RuO2 and MnO2 are separately 20wt% in composite electrode materials, the specific capacitance of RuO2/MnO2/AC composite electrodes can reach 266 F/g with a resistance of 0.86 Ω almost without any change of capacitance during 1500 cycles of charge/discharge. It is indicated that the multi-factor composite electrodes with RuO2/MnO2/AC are ideal electrode materials for super-capacitors. © 2009, Northwest Institute for Nonferrous Metal Research.
