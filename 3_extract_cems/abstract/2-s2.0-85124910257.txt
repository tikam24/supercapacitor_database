Supercapacitors with outstanding merits including extraordinary cycle stability, safety and high power density are complementary energy storage devices to batteries. The construction of one-dimensional hierarchical ternary composites is conducive to the synergy between different materials, and can be used to assemble high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. To this end, coaxial polyphosphazene (PZS)-coated MoO3 nanowires are used as the substrate, and CoFe layered double hydroxide (CoFe-LDH) or Ni(OH)2 is grown in-situ on the nanowires followed by high-heat treatment to form MoO3 NWs @ PZSC / CoFe2O4 and MoO3 NWs @ PZSC / NiO as the negative and positive electrodes, respectively, as confirmed by a series of spectroscopic measurements. Electrochemical characterizations confirm the excellent electrochemical performance of both electrode materials. The supercapacitors exhibit a potential window of 1.7 V in KOH aqueous electrolyte, with the maximum specific capacity of 48.55 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and the energy density of 41.27 Wh kg−1 at 1707.72 W kg−1. This work provides an applicable approach to utilize the synergistic effect between PZSC and transition metal oxides in order to enhance the performance of supercapacitors.
