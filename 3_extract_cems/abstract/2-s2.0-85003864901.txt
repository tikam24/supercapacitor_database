The increasing demand for portable, wearable, miniaturized and flexible consumer electronic devices requests the development of flexible and renewable energy storage devices. This paper reports a flexible and renewable electrode material for supercapacitor. The electrode material is made by preparing a porous structured cellulose/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite. The morphology of the nanocomposite is shown to be porous structure with a pore size about 10 Î¼m. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the nanocomposites exhibits that the cellulose and GOs are successfully grafted by a grafting agent, which results in uniform dispersion of GOs in the cellulose matrix. The electrical performance of the nanocomposite is evaluated by measuring cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic charge-discharge curves. Low cost and sustainability of the cellulose and graphene oxide nanocomposite encourage its possible use for electrode material of flexible energy storage devices.
