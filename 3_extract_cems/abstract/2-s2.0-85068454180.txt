Seeking for suitable electrode materials and designing rational porous structures are great challenges for developing high performance supercapacitors. Herein, needle-like porous CoNi2S4-MnOOH (denoted as NCS-MO) were prepared via a simple two steps solvothermal method and used as battery-type electrode of supercapacitor for the first time. Owing to the multiple oxidation states of needle-like porous NCS-MO and the inherent porous structure, the electrode delivers outstanding electrochemical capacitive properties with a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 1267.7 F g−1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1. To further assess the practical electrochemical performances, we assembled a hybrid supercapacitor using the as-synthesized porous NCS-MO as cathode and active carbon as anode. The device exhibits excellent performance with a high energy density of 47.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 998 W kg−1 in an extended voltage range of 1.6 V and outstanding cycling stability. These results demonstrate that the needle-like porous NCS-MO could be promising potential electrode material for high performance supercapacitor.
