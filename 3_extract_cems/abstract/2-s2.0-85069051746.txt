Homogeneously ultrathin nanocubes of PbMoO4/CdMoO4 nanocomposites, which are useful for energy storage applications, were prepared on nickel foam using a one-step chemical bath deposition method. The capacitive performance of the synthesized PbMoO4/CdMoO4 electrode material was examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a three-electrode configuration. This unique structure can provide more electroactive sites and a larger surface area, which can enhance the electrochemical performance. The PbMoO4/CdMoO4 redox-active material achieved a high specific capacitance of 1840.32 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in a 3 M KOH solution. This electrode exhibited excellent long cycle life stability with âˆ¼81.4% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g-1, which is superior to that of individual PbMoO4 and CdMoO4 nanosheets. The prepared PbMoO4/CdMoO4 composite electrode displayed excellent electrocapacitive properties, which can be attributed to the synergetic effects of PbMoO4 and CdMoO4. These results suggest that the PbMoO4/CdMoO4 nanocube arrays have the potential to meet the requirements of practical electrochemical energy storage applications.
