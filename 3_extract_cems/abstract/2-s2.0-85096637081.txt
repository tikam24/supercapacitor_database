Enabling green fabrication processes for energy storage devices is becoming a key aspect in order to achieve a sustainable fabrication cycle. Here, the focus was on the exploitation of the tragacanth gum, an exudated gum like arabic and karaya gums, as green binder for the preparation of carbon-based materials for electrochemical capacitors. The electrochemical performance of tragacanth (TRGC)-based electrodes was thoroughly investigated and compared with another water-soluble binder largely used in this field, sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Apart from the higher sustainability both in production and processing, TRGC exhibited a lower impact on the obstruction of pores in the final active material film with respect to CMC, allowing for more available surface area. This directly impacted the electrochemical performance, resulting in a higher specific capacitance and better rate capability. Moreover, the TRGC-based supercapacitor showed a superior thermal stability compared with CMC, with a capacity retention of about 80 % after 10000 cycles at 70 Â°C.
