A freestanding binder-free novel electrode material, a Ni3S2@Co3S4/Mn3O4-RGO (CSMRGN) composite, was synthesized for flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (FSSASCs) through a multistep hydrothermal route. The more electronegative sulfur atoms were arranged regularly to form the land-lotus flower-like structure that enhanced the electrical conductivity and reacted with a nickel foam substrate to form Ni3S2. After the interrogation of Mn3O4, the crystallinity of the Co3S4 particles increased with decreasing band gap, which resulted in the improvement of electrochemical properties. The flexible CSMRGN electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of μ3140 F g-1 at 2 A g-1. The (TRGO//CSMRGN) FSSASC device demonstrated a high energy density of μ51.6 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1400 W kg-1. The asymmetric device retained μ43.5 Wh kg-1 (μ84.5%) energy density even at a high power density of 7 kW kg-1. The capacitive properties and charge transfer resistance of the FSSASC device were calculated at different bending angles. In comparison to the kinetic controlled process, the diffusion-controlled specific capacitance decreased significantly when the bending angle of the device increased. The device retained μ96 and 83% of initial capacitance after 1000 GCD cycles under normal and 90° bending conditions, respectively.
