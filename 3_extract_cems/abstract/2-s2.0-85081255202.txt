Hollow Co3O4 nanoboxes constructed by numerous nanoparticles were prepared by using a facile method consisting of precipitation, solvothermal and annealing reactions. The desirable hollow structure as well as a highly porous morphology led to synergistically determined and enhanced supercapacitor performances. In particular, the hollow C03O4 nanoboxes were comprehensively investigated to achieve further optimization by tuning the sizes of the nanoboxes, which were well controlled by initial precipitation reaction. The systematical electrochemical measurements show that the optimized C03O4 electrode delivers large specific capacitances of 1832.7 and 1324.5 F/g at current densities of 1 and 20 A/g, and only 14.1% capacitance decay after 5000 cycles. The tunable synthesis paves a new pathway to get the utmost out of C03O4 with a hollow architecture for supercapacitors application.
