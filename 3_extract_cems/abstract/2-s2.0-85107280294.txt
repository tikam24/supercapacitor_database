Multi-dimensional metal oxides have become a promising alternative electrode material for supercapacitors due to their inherent large surface area. Herein, P-doped NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 multi-dimensional nanostructures are synthesized on carbon clothes (CC) with a continuous multistep strategy. Especially, P has the best synergistic effect with transition metals, such as optimal deprotonation energy and OH– adsorption energy, which can further enhance electrochemical reaction activity. For the above reasons, the P-NiCo2O4/NiMoO4@CC electrode exhibits an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2334.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. After 1500 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, its specific capacity still maintains 93.7%. Besides, a P-NiCo2O4/NiMoO4@CC//activated carbon device (hybrid supercapacitor or device) was also prepared with a maximum energy density of 45.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. In particular, the capacity retention rate is still 89.97% after 8000 cycles due to its excellent structural stability. Our work demonstrates the vast potential of multi-dimensional metal oxides in energy storage.
