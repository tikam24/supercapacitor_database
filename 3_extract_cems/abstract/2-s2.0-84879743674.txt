A rationally designed graphene-hollow polypyrrole (PPy) nanoarchitecture in which hollow PPy spheres were inserted between graphene layers was constructed by mixing graphene oxide and polystyrene (PS)@PPy core-shell sphere, followed by reduction of graphene oxide and etching of PS. The as-prepared graphene-hollow PPy nanoarchitecture was explored as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance may gradually rise to as high as 500 F g-1 with a charging/discharging current density of 5 A g -1, and remains stable even after 10 000 cycles. Analysis indicates that the tailored nanoarchitecture enhances specific area of the electrode and promotes synergetic effect between RGO and PPy, thus leading to a significantly enhanced electrochemical performance.
