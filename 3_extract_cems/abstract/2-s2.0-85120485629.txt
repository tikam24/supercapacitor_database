Smart supercapacitors are a promising energy storage solution due to their high power density, long cycle life, and low-maintenance requirements. Functional polymers (FPs) and inorganic nanomaterials are used in smart supercapacitors because of the favorable mechanical properties (flexibility and stretchability) of FPs and the energy storage properties of inorganic materials. The complementary properties of these materials facilitate commercial applications of smart supercapacitors in flexible smart wearables, displays, and self-generation, as well as energy storage. Here, an overview of strategies for the development of suitable materials for smart supercapacitors is presented, based on recent literature reports. A range of synthetic techniques are discussed and it is concluded that a combination of organic and inorganic hybrid materials is the best option for realizing smart supercapacitors. This perspective facilitates new strategies for the synthesis of hybrid materials, and the development of material technologies for smart energy storage applications.
