This paper proposes an improved high ratio bidirectional hybrid DC-DC converter that incorporates a switched inductor cell which helps achieve wider conversion ratios, reduced components size, and reduced semiconductor stress. The improvements for this topology, when compared to other bidirectional hybrid switched capacitor converters, consist of the elimination of inductor voltage oscillations, reduction of maximum voltage stress on transistors, minimization of parasitic switching inductances and elimination of high frequency common mode voltage. The topology is realized with two conventional half bridges, which help achieve a faster implementation, and provides the topology with the benefit of utilizing the research realized on these structures.
