Cost efficient and facile synthesis of functional materials that enable low voltage operations is highly demanded for the future growth of plastic electronic sector. In this article we report a fast, solvent-free and roll-to-roll compatible method of fabricating novel solid ion-gel membranes from 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide ([EMIM][TFSI]) and acrylate monomer blends of trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA) and tetra(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (TEDGA) via electron beam curing. The manufactured free standing and solid ion-gel membranes were successfully utilized in various electronic devices such as ion-modulated organic thin film transistors (IMTs), supercapacitors (SC) and electrochromic (EC) displays. The tailor-made ion-gel membrane, with an optimized composition, exhibited high specific capacitance and good mechanical properties. The prepared IMTs operated at remarkable low voltages of less than 1.5 V with on-currents on the order of milliamps and ON/OFF ratios greater than ∼104. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.
