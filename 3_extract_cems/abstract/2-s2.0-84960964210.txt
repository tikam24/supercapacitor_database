Graphene can be used as the ideal electrode material for supercapacitors in double-layer capacitors because it has unique two-dimensional network structure and excellent electrical properties, mechanical properties and large specific surface area. There was a problem that graphene usually occurring the irreversible agglomeration result in reducing dramatically the available active surface of graphene and decreasing the conductivity and capacitance. In recent years, the problem was studied through graphene doped with the heteroatom of N/B/P and combinied with nanotube as well as formed complmentary composite electrode materials with Faraday Pseudocapacitance, and these solution have good effects. This paper reviews the progresss about the problem and solution. Meanwhile, the further research and the direction was prospected.
