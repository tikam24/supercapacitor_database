Atomic layer deposition (ALD)is a method of choice for the growth of highly conformal thin films with accurately controlled thickness on planar and nanostructured surfaces. These advantages make it pivotal for emerging nanotechnology applications. This review sheds light on the current developments on the ALD of vanadium oxide, which, with proper postdeposition treatment yields a variety of functional and smart oxide phases. The application of vanadium oxide coatings in electrochemical energy storage, microelectronics and smart windows are emphasized.
