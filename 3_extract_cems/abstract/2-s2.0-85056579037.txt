Al2O3/Activated carbon(AC) and Poly Aniline (PANI) based Multilayer coated electrode material have been prepared experimentally on stainless steel substrate for super capacitor application. Nano structured aluminium oxide (Al2O3) thin film of 500nm were coated on stainless steel substrate using DC magnetron sputtering process in argon atmosphere. The nano composite of Activated carbon 10wt% with synthesized Polyaniline (AC-PANI) is deposited on Al2O3 thin film using doctor blade technique. The electrochemical analysis is done by using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) Measurement and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. CV results reveals that the specific capacitance for Al2O3 thin film is 80F/g where as for multi layered coated electrode material is 300F/g at 10mV scan rate in 1M KOH electrolyte solution. The resistive components of the electrode material are measured using EIS. Suggesting a good electrode material for super capacitor.
