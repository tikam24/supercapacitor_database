Flexible polyaniline/carbon fibres (PANI/CFs) nanocomposites with comb-shaped polyaniline (PANI) nanorods were fabricated by using a one-step pulse current approach. The morphology, chemical structure, crystalline structure and electrochemical performances of well-controlled PANI/CFs composites were characterised and evaluated by FE-SEM, FT-IR, Raman spectra, XRD and electrochemical working station. The electrochemical performance of comb-shaped PANI/CFs nanocomposites as supercapacitor electrodes was obtained by controlling the polymerisation time and types of current. The optimised polyaniline/carbon fibres from preparation with pulse current for 7 min (PANI/CFs-PC-7) composite showed good electrochemical performance with maximum specific capacitance of 323 F g−1 of sample mass at a current density loading of 1 A g−1, together with better rate capability, bendability and good cycling stability, which are essential in high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. In addition, the highly efficient and convenient approach paves the way to large-scale commercial applications of the flexible ordered nanocomposites.
