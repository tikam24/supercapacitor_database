An injectable high-content gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) was designed so that highly-entangled polymer matrix was situated in bulk electrolyte of supercapacitors (SCs) and SBP + /BF 4 − ions were more concentrated in pores of activated carbon (AC) particles, thereby facilitating ion transport. Compared with the SCs containing the liquid electrolyte (1 M SBPBF 4 /AN), the SCs containing the injectable GPE showed 5% higher capacitance (12% reduced Warburg resistance) at 20 ℃ and 52% higher capacitance (95% retention) after 16-h storage at 80 ℃ (boiling point of AN). This study provides insight into the developments of novel GPE processes for high-energy AC electrode SCs.
