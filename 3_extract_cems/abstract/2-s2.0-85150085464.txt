With the increase in the proportion of photovoltaic (PV) generation capacity in power systems, the balance and stability of scheduled power become complicated. Therefore it becomes hard to maintain the safe and stable operation of power systems. This chapter applies the energy storage technology to large-scale grid-connected PV generation and designs energy storage configurations. The control strategy for frequency/voltage regulation with energy storage devices is presented. Furthermore, solar cell-supercapacitor devices (SCSD) are introduced as a series array to solve the problem that the solar cell cannot work on the maximum power point (MPP) under partial shading conditions. A current compensation method for the SCSD array is proposed, which maximizes the output power of the solar cell by controlling the charging/discharging power of the supercapacitor. The simulation results show that the proposed current compensation method under partial shadow can make each solar cell in the array work at the MPP, thus achieving the coordinated control of “generation-storage” between solar cells and supercapacitor.
