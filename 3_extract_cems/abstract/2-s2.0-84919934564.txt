This paper presents a hybrid power and energy source supplied by a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as the main power source in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) system. To prevent the PEMFC from fuel starvation and degradation and realize their seamless linking in the hybrid UPS system, the power and energy are balanced by the battery and/or supercapacitor (SC) as two alternative auxiliary power sources. Based on the modeling and sizing of hybrid power and energy components, the power and energy management strategies and efficiency measurements of four operating modes in UPS system are proposed. To evaluate the proposed strategies, an experimental setup is implemented by a data acquisition system, a PEMFC generating system, and a UPS system including AC/DC rectifier, DC/AC inverter, DC/DC converter, AC/DC recharger and its intelligent control unit. Experimental results with the characteristics of a 300 W self-humidified air-breathing of PEMFC, 3-cell 12 V/5 Ah of batteries, and two 16-cell 120 F/2.7 V of SCs in parallel corroborate the excellent management strategies in the four operating modes of UPS system, which provides the basis for the optimal design of the UPS system with hybrid PEMFC/battery/SC power sources.
