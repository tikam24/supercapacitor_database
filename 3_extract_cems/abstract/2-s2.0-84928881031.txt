A facile one-step mechanochemical process from CuCl2·2H2O and thiourea (tu) to fabricate novel [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O nanobelts has been observed for the first time, and the nanobelts were used as an electrode material for a supercapacitor. The [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O nanobelts with staggered arrangement have lengths longer than 10 μm, and exactly straight nanobelts are 300 nm in width, and the extreme ends of nanobelts are around 30-50 nm in width. The specific capacitance of the [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O nanobelts was up to 1145 F g-1 at scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and 922 F g-1 at current density of 10 A g-1 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. Simultaneously, the retention was maintained at 72.4% after 500 cycles at 10 A g-1. The corresponding equivalent circuit for the [Cu(tu)]Cl·1/2H2O was also discussed. This study provides a facile, green, and large-scale method to fabricate novel nano-complexes with high supercapacitor activity.
