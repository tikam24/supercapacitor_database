Hybrid converter is designed for energy management between different types of source, Grid and energy storage systems. The number of ports is varied based on number of sources, storage systems and Grid. The proposed isolated converter is accepting limitless, different types of sources and storage systems. Its operating mode is classified into different operating states. One ferrite core transformer with serial coupling capacitor is used to perform step up operation with reduced power switch. Proposed converter is designed for energy management between Photovoltaic (PV) array, Fuel Cell(FC), Supercapacitor (SCAP) and load. PV array and Fuel Cell are connected in unidirectional port, Supercapacitor is connected in bi-directional ports. Supercapacitors are designed for transient load and Photovoltaic array, Fuel Cell designed for steady state load. Grid is connected to the converter throng 1:N ferrite core transformer and Three Phase Voltage Source Inverter. Energy transferred toGridis based on the charging state of coupling capacitor. Charge parameter based neuro fuzzy controller is proposed for energy management between different ports with different load conditions. MATLAB simulation is done with different modes, the results shows supercapacitor is discharging and charging in transient load conditions and mode of operations are performed based on charge states of coupling capacitor. The transient and steady state response is analysed using different load conditions.
