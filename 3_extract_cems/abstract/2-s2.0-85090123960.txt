On account of complementary control, reduced size, and energy saving, the switched-capacitor (SC) based equalizer becomes promising for the energy management of energy storage system. Traditionally, the number of the bypass capacitor in the SC based equalizer equals to the number of the battery module in series or parallel connections. The amount of bypass capacitors is enormous, thus costly and bulky for electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, the integrated energy storage is proposed to reduce cost and save space, meanwhile, the equalizations between the batteries and the ultracapacitors (UCs) are achieved by the reutilization of SC network. UCs not only perform as energy storage units, but also work as energy exchange units. Thus, the number of balanced elements can be reduced significantly. The operational principles of the storage system and the analyses of the balancing process are examined in detail. The system simulation is performed for functionality evaluations. Meanwhile, an experimental prototype is also implemented for six cells to demonstrate the balancing process. The accordance of experiment and simulation can further testify the feasibility and effectiveness.
