Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are assembled with a battery-type anode and a capacitor-type cathode, so they combine high energy density of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and excellent rate and cycling performance of supercapacitors (SCs). However, the current level still cannot satisfy the target. And the leading problem is LICs cannot offer enough capacity under high power density and long cycling life due to the storage mechanism of anodes. This paper gives the present attempts on electrodes, solidâ€“electrolyte interface (SEI) and operation conditions. And after discussion, the paper holds that the discharge voltage plateau of anodes should be well-chosen, and the anode structure like an ordered mesoporous structure can provide fast and versatile transport pathways for charge transfer and provide free space to accommodate the volume change upon Li-ions insertion/extraction. In addition, the multilayer SEI with the synergism like LiF and Li2CO3 can provide better electronic insulation and ion conductivity. Furthermore, appropriate working potential is also an effective mean to improve performance of LICs.
