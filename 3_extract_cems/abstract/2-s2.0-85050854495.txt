Manganese oxide (MnO2) nanosplotches (NSs) are deposited on N- and S-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N,S-CMK-3) essentially blocking microporosity. The obtained N,S-CMK-3/MnO2 composite materials are assembled into ionic liquid (IL)-based symmetric supercapacitors, which exhibit a high specific capacitance of 200 F g−1 (0–3.5 V) at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, and good rate stability with 55.5% capacitance retention at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The device can operate in a wide temperature range (−20 to 60 °C), and high cycling stability of N,S-CMK-3/MnO2 composite electrode is demonstrated. Lower energy of −3.56 eV can be achieved for the adsorption of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium+ (EMIM+) cation on the edge between MnO2 NSs and N,S-CMK-3 than on the plane of MnO2 NS (−3.04 eV), both being more preferred than the surface of pristine N,S-CMK-3 (−1.52 eV). This strengthening of the ion adsorption at the three-phase boundary between N,S-CMK-3, MnO2, and IL leads to enhancement of the specific capacity as compared to nondoped or MnO2-free reference materials. Supercapacitors based on such composite electrodes show significantly enhanced areal capacity pointing to energy storage in the mesopores rather than in the electrochemical surface layer, demonstrating a new energy storage mechanism in ILs.
