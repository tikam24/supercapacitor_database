Maximizing power and energy densities of ultracapacitors requires configuring redox-active materials in specific architectures that: 1) maximize electrolyte-electrode contact area, 2) minimize transport distances for both electrons and charge compensating species, and 3) minimize transport barriers. We have developed a simple solution-based method, using an organic template, that enables us to introduce hierarchical porosity in ruthenium oxide down to the nano-scale by controlling the oxidative crystal growth of RuO2. The high capacitances of the resulting nanostructured electrodes were found to be comparable to hydrous ruthenium oxide formed under dramatically different conditions. Materials characterization reveals that the organic template directs structure formation and promotes hydroxyl retention.
