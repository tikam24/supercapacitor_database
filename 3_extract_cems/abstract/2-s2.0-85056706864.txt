Herein, we design and construct the hierarchical NiCo2O4@Ni0.85Se core-shell architecture directly growing on Ni foam as advanced materials for supercapacitor. The composite materials deliver excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1454 F/g and superior cycle life with 88.5% retention after 10000 cycles, which ascribed to the synergistic effect of pure NiCo2O4 and Ni0.85Se. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4@Ni0.85Se//AC asymmetric supercapacitor were fabricated with a highest energy density of 29.3 W h kg−1 at power density of 799 W kg−1. It is expected that the NiCo2O4@Ni0.85Se will be a kind of promising electrode materials for supercapacitor.
