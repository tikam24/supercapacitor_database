Pore structure in activated carbons (ACs) is critical for supercapacitors with both high capacitance and rate performance. To obtain ACs with suitable pore structures, many efforts in the exploration of technology have been made. In this work, we found that it is easier to form a developed pore structure when precursor carbon is composed of disordered graphite-like micro-crystals. The gas produced during the activation process could provide the force to separate the neighboring graphite layers. Based on this, we propose a controllable adjustment of the pore structure strategy. A sub-micron scale carbon sphere composed of randomly arranged graphite micro-crystals is chosen as the precursor carbon. After CO2 activation, a high specific surface area (SSA, ∼3300 m2 g−1) AC dominated by micropores is obtained. For KOH activation, a hierarchical porous AC possessing ultra-high SSA (∼3400 m2 g−1) is achieved. Benefited from the cross-linked mesopores with the size range of 3 to 5 nm, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitors exhibit high specific capacitances in organic electrolyte (192 F g−1 at 0.01 V s−1) and excellent rate performance (110 F g−1 at 30 V s−1) that is comparable with the CNTs electrode with the similar areal capacitance (∼25 mF cm−2). This provides a route to fabricate ACs with both high specific capacitance and rate performance.
