A flexible all-solid-state asymmetric micro-supercapacitor based on lamellar (K2Co3(P2O7)2·2H2O) nanocrystal whiskers and graphene nanosheets was successfully fabricated by inkjet printing in a simple and cost-effective way. A facile method to synthesize lamellar K2Co3(P2O7)2·2H2O nanocrystal whiskers under a mild hydrothermal condition was also established. The assembled micro-device exhibited a high specific capacitance (6.0Fcm-3), good rate/mechanical stability and a long cycling stability (5000 cycles) with a maximun energy density of 0.96mWhcm-3, demonstrating great promise for applications in flexible all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors.
