In order to achieve pesudocapacitive performance of single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) electrodes, a high-efficient and reversible redox strategy utilizing a redox-mediated electrolyte for SWCNT-based supercapacitors is reported. In this novel redox-mediated electrolyte, the single-electrode specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is heightened four times, reaching C=162.66 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The quick charge-discharge ability of the supercapacitor is also enhanced, and the relaxation time is as low as 0.58 s. Furthermore, the supercapacitor shows an excellent cycling performance of 96.51 % retention after 4000 cycles. The remarkable results presented here illustrate that the redox strategy is a facile and straightforward approach to improve the performances of SWCNT electrodes. Redox asset: A novel electrolytical system for single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is established, wherein they exhibit pesudocapacitive performance due to the reversible redox process of the redox mediator used. Consequently, supercapacitors based on SWCNT electrodes in this new electrolyte show better electrochemical properties. Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
