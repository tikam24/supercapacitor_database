Nowadays, binary transition metal oxides have attracted wide attention as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. In this respect, we report a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal route for the synthesis of ZnFe2O4 nanostructures on nickel foam using a binder-free approach. The as-synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanostructures were characterised to study the structural, morphological and electrochemical properties. When utilized as an electrode for supercapacitor, ZnFe2O4 delivered superior specific capacitance of 552 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s with a long term cyclic stability for 1000 cycles. This excellent electrochemical performance ZnFe2O4 electrode material suggests its potential use for next-generation supercapacitors.
