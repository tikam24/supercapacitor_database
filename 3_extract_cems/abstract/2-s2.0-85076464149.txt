During the use of a series-connected supercapacitor stack, the voltage between supercapacitors is inconsistent. Therefore, a circuit was presented for equalizing series-connected supercapacitor stack, which combines flyback converter with synchronous rectifier, blocking capacitor and bridge rectifier. The voltage equalization circuit draws energy from the supercapacitor stack and stores it in the coupling transformer, and then distributes the energy stored in the transformer to the supercapacitors with lower voltage, so that the voltages of supercapacitors are the same to achieve the purpose of voltage equalization. The proposed circuit needs less components and switches, and can automatically realize voltage equalization, thus it is not only easy to control but also has a simple topology. Additionally, switches realization of zero voltage switching turn-on to improve the efficiency of the converter. The operating principle of the circuit was described, and important parameters was designed. The voltage equalization experiment was performed using the proposed circuit, and the experimental results verify correctness of the theoretical analysis.
