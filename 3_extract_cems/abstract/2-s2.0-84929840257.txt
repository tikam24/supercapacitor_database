Floss-like Ni–Co binary hydroxides (FL-NCOH), assembled by whisker-like nanowires, are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal process with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as the soft template. The forming process of FL-NCOH is clarified by tuning the hydrothermal reaction time. The result indicates that floccule-like nickel–cobalt hydroxide nanoclusters gradually become longer and slenderer nanowires to form FL-NCOH with the increase of reaction time. The dissolution–recrystallization of hydroxide plays an important role in the morphology control of nickel–cobalt hydroxide. The high specific surface area (106.5 m2 g−1) and the suitable 3D structure endow the as-prepared FL-NCOH material high specific capacitance (up to 918.9 F g−1 at the current density of 0.2 A g−1), good high-rate performance (594.2 F g−1 even at 10.0 A g−1), and long cycle life (98.7 % capacitance retention after 3000 charge–discharge cycles at 2.0 A g−1).
