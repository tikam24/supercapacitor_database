Nano-sized Fe3O4 powder was prepared through an oxygenation-hydrothermal method. The structure and morphology of the product were characterized by IR, XRD and SEM. Results show that the as-prepared powder has regularly spherical morphology, and the average size of product is about 25 nm. Electrochemical properties of Fe3O4 electrode were performed by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammeter (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS). The results indicate that the Fe3O4 electrode shows good capacitive behaviour and cycling stability in 1 mol·L-1 Na2SO3 electrolyte with the potential range of -1.2-0.2 V (vs SCE). The specific capacitance of the material as a single electrode is 113.01 F·g -1 at the current density of 100 mA·g-1, and 72.9% discharge specific capacitance is maintained after 1000 cycles.
