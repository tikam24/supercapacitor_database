The most realistic example of energy efficiency is being seen in the latest generation of energy storage devices, in which the turbo boost capability enables the computing power to be enhanced several times more efficient than their predecessors under the same level of power supply. The energy-efficient functionality is made possible by an electronic device known as supercapacitor, which is conventionally composed of carbonaceous material like activated carbon and metal oxide such as ruthenium oxide as the main components in order to store and provide energy. However, being a rare metal, the introduction of ruthenium oxide has greatly increased the production cost of the end products. Therefore, research in this field has been focused in modifying the active components and improving the capacitive performance of existing supercapacitors. Thus, introduction of nanohybrids and nanocomposites of activated carbons has received tremendous attention by worldwide researchers.
