Carbon-based materials exhibit numerous advantages over other materials due to their properties like high electrical conductivity, low cost, and high surface area. Developing carbon-based materials in the future is an alternating, safe, low-cost, and efficient method in energy storage/generation applications. Carbon can be categorized into different structures like carbon nanotube, fullerene, graphene, etc., and has a wide range of applications. We discussed here the applications of carbon-based nanomaterials devices like supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and photovoltaics in energy storage/generation applications.
