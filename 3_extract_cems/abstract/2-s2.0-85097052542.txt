Asphalt is one of the most difficult byproducts to deal with in the petroleum processing process, and how to carry out economic and efficient directional transformation is an important research topic with high market value and great strategic significance. The composition and structure of petroleum asphalt are extraordinary complex, which have low hydrogen/carbon ratio and rich polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons features. In view of the application of petroleum asphalt in the field of electrochemical energy storage, this review focuses on the research progress of the preparation and modification of petroleum asphalt-based nano carbon materials and their applications in the electrode materials of secondary battery and supercapacitor. This review may provide new technical approach and research ideas for the high value-added use of petroleum asphalt.
