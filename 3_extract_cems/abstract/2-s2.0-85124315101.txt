A novel three mixed metalâ€“organic framework (TM-MOF) containing lanthanum, gadolinium and thulium metals is prepared through a simple cathodic electrodeposition strategy onto nickel foam substrate. Various techniques are used to full characterization of the as-prepared TM-MOF product. The microscopic results revealed formation of the TM-MOF nanosheets uniformly grown onto porous Ni-foam. The synergistic effects of the La/Gd/Tm-lanthanide elements within the composition of TM-MOF electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 412 C/g at a current density of 1 A/g, high-rate capability of 52.9% (at 15 A/g), and an outstanding cycling stability of 94.2% after 6000 cycles. Based on the electrochemical findings, the hierarchical sheet-like morphology of the TM-MOF was rich in active redox sites and electrolyte ions diffusion pathways. All of these characters suggested that TM-MOF electrode could be promising candidate for supercapacitors.
