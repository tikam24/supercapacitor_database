In the era of modern technology, electronic portable devices have become a strong need today. Conventional energy storage devices, that is, batteries and capacitors are inadequate to fulfill the high demand of energy supply. Hence, supercapacitor comes into the picture as a fast emerging energy storage device due to its high power density, high energy density, fast charging, and good cyclic stability. A supercapacitor consists of two electrodes separated with an electrolyte. This implies that the electrode material and electrolyte play a key role in the efficiency of a supercapacitor. This book chapter explains the utility of nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) as a working electrode material in a pseudocapacitor. A redox reaction mechanism to explain the charge transfer in chargingâ€“discharging is also highlighted in this chapter. The method of synthesis of electrode material is another important factor that greatly affects the specific capacitance of the material. Hence, some important methods are also discussed briefly.
