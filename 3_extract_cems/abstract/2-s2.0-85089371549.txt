Sodium-ion-based energy storage devices in which the electrochemical properties are influenced by excess Na ions are very important as an alternative energy storage system. In this study, O3-type multi-metal-oxide layers of Na3Ni2BiO6 were synthesized via a simple solid-state method. Their electrochemical properties were examined while employing them as a supercapacitor electrode material with four different electrolytes: H2SO4, Na2SO4, KOH, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIMBF4). Among these, BMIMBF4 ionic liquid electrolyte in a symmetric Na3Ni2BiO6 supercapacitor demonstrated the highest specific capacitance performance of 780.49 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with 95.2% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, a maximum energy density of 67.16 Wh·kg−1 was recorded at 349.87 W·kg−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance is a result of the reinforced fast intercalation/deintercalation of Na+ ions in the Na3Ni2BiO6 crystal structure due to high solvation and association mechanism of Na3Ni2BiO6 in BMIMBF4 ionic liquid media. These results indicate that the developed Na3Ni2BiO6-based supercapacitor with BMIMBF4 ionic liquid electrolyte could be used in the high-performance energy storage devices for smart electrical and electronic units.
