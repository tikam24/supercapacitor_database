Chitosan (CS) rich in âˆ¼ 7 wt% nitrogen is the renewable nontoxic biomass material derived from seafood waste. Chitosan is a suitable precursor to obtain N-doped materials due to the nitrogen in acetamide and amine of chitosan. In this work, the new type of N-doped MXene nanomaterials is prepared from non-toxic biological chitosan and MXene using a simple, environment-friendly method as a potential electrode for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of 1MXene-1N reaches up to 286.28 F/g (154.59 C/g). After 10,000 charge and discharge cycles, the efficiency is always above 98%. The N-doped MXene turned out to be high electrochemistry and excellent stability due to the lone pair of electrons of the N atom and increased interlayer distance.
