Synthesis of poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/V2O5 (PEDOT/V2O5) by in-situ oxidation of monomer (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene) into crystalline nanostrip V2O5 using microwave hydrothermal technique is reported. The synthesized compounds are characterized by powder XRD, IR spectra, four probe conductivity and thermal analysis (TGA/DTA).The interlayer spacing of V2O5 upon intercalation of the polymer expands from 4.3 to 14 Å as observed in powder X-ray diffraction by exfoliation and restacking of the layers. The morphological changes of the compounds are further investigated using FE-SEM. The electrochemical properties are studied by CV and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. The initial SC of PEDOT/V2O5 (237 F g-1) is higher than that of either pristine V 2O5 or PEDOT indicating the synergic effect of the nanocomposites. © 2011 SPIE.
