An extensive range of nanocarbon, such as OD fullerene, 1D carbon nanotube, 2D graphene, and 3D carbon aerogels, has attracted significant attention. Graphene, being an outstanding electrode material has already been evidenced in its performance for fabricating supercapacitors. Direct laser writing was reported to be an innovative methodology that enabled patterning graphene electrodes within a single-step. Laser scribed graphene (LSG) is produced on polyimide (PI) substrate, which is not stretchable. Most researchers report transferring LSG from PI onto the stretchable substrate to fabricate stretchable LSG sensors and supercapacitors. Transfer printing is a critical procedure for LSG embedding on a stretchable substrate. But no one has indeed investigated the transfer printing of LSG. In this work, we report a laser-assisted method to improve the success rate of transfer printing. The resulting LSG/PDMS is utilized in fabricating the in-plane stretchable supercapacitor. Its current density was improved from 0.02 to 0.6 m.A/cm with the rising scan rate from 10 to 200 mV/s. The highest capacitance was calculated as 18 mF/cm at the consistent current density of 0.02 ma/cm, Also, the LSG supercapacitor showed excellent cycling stability after 1000 cycles. The laser-assisted strategy has permitted the successful promises for developing LSG stretchable wearable electronics.
