Composites of graphene variants are synthesised and their efficacy on electrochemical performance for supercapacitor is analysed systematically using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of physical properties on electrochemical performance is analysed and the results revealed that microstructures played an important role in electrochemical performance. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and its nanocomposites with carbon nanofiber (rGO/CNF) and carbon nanotube (rGO/CNT) are subjected to electrochemical studies. Further, nitrogen doped counterparts (NrGO, NrGO/CNF, NrGO/CNT) of the aforementioned nanocomposites are analysed and enhancement in conductivity and capacitive behaviour is observed. NrGO/CNT electrode material showed enhanced coulombic efficiency and capacity retention of 99% even after 10,000 cycles denoting good cyclability, which can be attributed to the balanced microporosity and mesoporosity of the electrode material.
