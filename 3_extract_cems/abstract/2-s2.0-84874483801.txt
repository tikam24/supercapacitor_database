In view of the technical characteristics of different energy storage technologies, a system structure and control mode of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for AC application suitable for large-scale application is adopted. The high-pass filter is used for HESS to rationally distribute power instructions between two energy storages. To optimize the system integral adjustment ability, a strategy of supercapacitor condition adjustment is proposed based on the charging/discharging status of lithium-ion battery. The coordination control of over-charge protection, over-discharge protection and maximum power limit protection between two energy storages are discussed in detail. The results of PSCAD simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Â© 2013 State Grid Electric Power Research Institute Press.
