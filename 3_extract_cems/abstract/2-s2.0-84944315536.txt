Our increasing energy demands have spurred a rigorous search for renewable energy sources to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. However, efficient use of renewable energy is possible only with advances in both energy generation and storage. Today's batteries and capacitors, which are the main energy storage devices, cannot meet the world's demand for combined power and energy densities. To enhance the viability of such energy storing devices, the Clemson Nanomaterials Center (CNC) has developed a mix of scalable processes for carbon nanotube-based hybrid electrodes that show promise as a cost-effective alternative to standard activated carbon-based electrodes. Working together with industrial partners, CNC has fabricated supercapacitors with energy and power densities in the range of ∼11-35 Wh/kg and ∼1.2-9 W/kg, respectively. Although this research development is transformative, further studies to optimize the separator and electrolyte technologies are needed to maximize both the energy and power density in a single device.
