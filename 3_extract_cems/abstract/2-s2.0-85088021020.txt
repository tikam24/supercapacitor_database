The application prospects of cellulose based materials in the field of supercapacitors were forecasted. In this paper, the preparations of fiber/carbon material based supercapacitor, cellulose/conductive polymer materials based super capacitor and cellulose carbon material based supercapacitor were reviewed. The main properties (mechanical flexibility, electrochemical performance, cycle stability, recyclability and biodegradability) to be considered in the preparation process of cellulose and its composite-based supercapacitors were analyzed in detail. Finally, the problems of developing supercapacitors with cellulose in the future were summarized.
