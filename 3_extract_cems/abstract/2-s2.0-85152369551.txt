Two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes) are widely used in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their unique properties, but the efficient use of multilayer MXenes (m-MXenes) to prepare flexible electrodes remains a challenge. Herein, large-size graphene oxide (GO) is used as a conductive adhesive to bridge the multilayer Ti3C2Tx (m-Ti3C2Tx) to form a Ti–O-C bond to form the flexible Ti3C2Tx/GO (MG) film which was subsequently implanted by nitrogen ions to dope nitrogen in its surface layers (N-Ti3C2Tx/GO, NMG). The NMG was annealed at 400 ℃ to obtain the N-Ti3C2Tx/reduced GO (N-Ti3C2Tx/rGO, NMRG) electrode for supercapacitor. Compared with the Ti3C2Tx/rGO (MRG), the specific capacitance of NMRG-1 (nitrogen ion implantation dose is 1 × 1017) reaches 115 F g−1 (248. 7 F cm−3) at 0.2A g−1, while it is 95 F g−1 (167.8 F cm−3) of MRG. The rate performance of NMRG-1 is increased from 31.5 (MRG) to 76.1%. In addition, NMRG-1 electrode can maintain 73% capacitance retention and 85% Coulomb efficiency after 10,000 cycles at 2A g−1. And it exhibits energy density of 8.6 Wh L−1 at power density of 122.4W L−1. The results show that ion implantation provides a selective method for nitrogen doping in multilayer MXene, making it more competitive in practical applications.
