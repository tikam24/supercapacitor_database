Nanocellulose is a kind of nanomaterial with high specific surface area，high mechanical strength，excellent thermal stability and biodegradability. According to their origin，properties and preparation methods，they can be roughly divided into cellulose nanofibrils (CNF)，cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)and bacterial cellulose (BC)，which have different physical and microscopic morphology. Nanocellulose has been an ideal candidate for electrode materials for flexible energy storage devices due to its excellent mechanical flexibility. However，the poor conductivity of nanocellulose limited its scale-up application in flexible energy storage devices. Hence，it is necessary to combine with conductive materials to enhance the conductivity. This review focuses on the research progress of nanocellulose-based conductive composite materials over the past few years，including composites formed by nanocellulose and conductive polymers，conductive carbon materials and metal-based compounds. Plenty of the obtained nanocellulose-based conductive composite materials show excellent electrochemical properties and mechanical flexibilities，which are quite desirable for constructing flexible LIBs and flexible SCs. Herein，we will review the preparation methods，characterization techniques and electrochemical property measurements of nanocellulose-based conductive composite materials，and then the overview of the application of nanocellulose-based conductive materials in flexible LIBs and flexible SCs energy storage devices are followed. Finally，we summarize and analyze the problems encountered in practical applications of nanocellulose-based conductive composite materials，and outlook the research direction in future.
