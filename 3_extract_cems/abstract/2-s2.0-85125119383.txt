MXenes, a new class of two-dimensional advanced functional nanomaterials, have been widely researched in the past decade for applications in diverse fields including clean energy and fuels production. The unique layered structures of MXenes simultaneously enhance electrolyte ion transport and provide transition metal active redox sites on the surface. These features make MXenes particularly promising for applications as high-performance electrodes for electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors). This paper critically reviews the latest advancements in the utilization of MXenes in supercapacitor electrodes. The key structural features and other properties of MXenes that make them ideal for supercapacitor electrodes, including strategies for fabrication, performance improvement, and scalable manufacture of industry-relevant MXene films, are elaborated. Future research needs, challenges, and opportunities in this rapidly emerging area are discussed as well.
