Multilayer super-short carbon nanotubes (SSCNTs) could be synthesized by tailoring the raw multiwalled carbon nanotubes with a simple ultrasonic oxidation-cut method. Nanostructured layered nickel hydroxide and SSCNTs have been successfully assembled to form Ni(OH)2/SSCNTs composite by electrostatic force. Compared with pure Ni(OH)2 (665 F g−1), the Ni(OH)2/SSCNTs composite exhibits the much better electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 1887 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and demonstrates a good rate capability and excellent long-term cyclic stability (92 % capacity retention after 3000 cycles). It is the reason that the SSCNTs can form a conductive network onto the surface of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes, and their excellent electric conductivity is advantaged to the charge transport on the electrode in discharge process and charge process. Therefore, the greatly enhanced capacitive performance of Ni(OH)2/SSCNTs can be attributed to a synergetic effect of Ni(OH)2 and SSCNTs.
