Herein, oxygen- and nitrogen-doped porous carbon material using tamarind leaves via simple chemical activation and carbonization process are presented. Subsequently, the as-obtained material has not only exhibited a 3D hierarchical honeycomb-like framework but equally reveals a high specific surface area of 1212 m2 g−1. In favor of the synergistic relationship between the tailored pore architecture and surface enriched heteroatoms, the electrochemical performances are evaluated in a three-electrode system and by constructing a symmetric solid-state device. A specific capacitance of 370, 293, and 193 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 is achieved in a three-electrode system using H2SO4, Na2SO4, and KOH electrolytes, respectively, with electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitive contributions. Moreover, a high energy density of 36.96 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1 and a high power density of 4.49 kW kg−1 at 10 A g−1 are obtained from the assembled solid-state device along with excellent capacitive retention of 93% after 5000 cycles.
