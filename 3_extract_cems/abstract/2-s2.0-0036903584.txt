We prepared polyaniline powder doped with LiPF6 and utilized it as an electrode material in a polymer redox supercapacitor. The electrode sheet was fabricated by coating the slurry directly on a charge collector. We also compared the performance of porous polyolefin separator as supplied and the polymer electrolyte as prepared. The redox supercapacitor using the polyolefin separator exhibits ∼ 100 F/g specific capacitance at the initial discharge and retains ∼ 70 F/g after 5000 cycles, while the initial specific capacitance using the polymer electrolyte is ∼ 80 F/g and retains ∼ 60 F/g after 5000 cycles. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
