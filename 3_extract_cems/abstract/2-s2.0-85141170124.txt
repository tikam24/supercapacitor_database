E-bikes are fetching immense admiration in current market, because of miniature size, simplicity of charging at home and cost-effectiveness substitute in the segment of electric vehicles (EV). For charging the batteries of e-bikes, an ameliorate converter is suggested and is presented in this paper. Proposed converter has two stages. Each stage has a separate boost converter for achieving near UPF, low THD and low ripple in output voltage. First stage boost converter is to provide continuous power to e-bike battery and thereby maintaining near UPF and second stage boost converter is meant for ripple reduction in output voltage. To meet this standard criterion, only a minimal capacitance is required. First stage boost converter steers maximum amount of power through e-bike battery, whereas the second stage boost converter just steers a fraction of power through e-bike battery. In comparison to conventional converters, this proposed parallel architecture of boost converters ensures higher efficiency. A lithium-ion battery pack with 4500 mAh capacity, 100V fully charged voltage of battery pack, 86.12V nominal voltage of battery pack and 66V cut-off voltage of battery pack is utilized.
