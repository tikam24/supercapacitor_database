We report a significant advance toward the rational design and fabrication of stretchable and robust flexible electrodes with favorable hierarchical architectures constructed by homogeneously distributed α-Fe2O3 nanobelt arrays rooted in the surface layer of nanoporous carbon tube textile (NPCTT). New insight into alkali activation assisted surface etching of carbon and in-situ catalytic anisotropic growth is proposed, and is experimentally demonstrated by the synthesis of the Fe2O3 nanobelt arrays/NPCTT. The Fe2O3/NPCTT electrode shows excellent flexibility and great stretchability, especially has a high specific areal capacitance of 1846 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and cycling stability with only 4.8% capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2. A symmetric solid-state supercapacitor with the Fe2O3/NPCTT achieves an operating voltage of 1.75 V and a ultrahigh areal energy density of 176 µWh cm−2 (at power density of 748 µW cm−2), remarkable cycling stability, and outstanding reliability with no capacity degradation under repeated large-angle twisting. Such unique architecture improves both mechanical robustness and electrical conductivity, and allows a strong synergistic attribution of Fe2O3 and NPCTT. The synthetic method can be extended to other composites such as MnO nanosheet arrays/NPCTT and Co3O4 nanowire arrays/NPCTT. This work opens up a new pathway to the design of high-performance devices for wearable electronics.
