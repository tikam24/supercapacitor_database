Recently, spinel ferrites have attracted much attention due to their various redox states, great electrochemical stability, and pseudocapacitive behavior. Herein, NiFe2O4/MoS2 composite material with excellent electrochemical properties was smart-designed and successfully synthesized via a facile solution reaction and freeze-dried process for the first time. The composite combines the advantages of both MoS2 nanosheets and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, showing enhanced capacitive performance than MoS2 nanosheets and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles and surpassed some of the previously reported materials. A maximum specific capacitance (506 F/g at 1 A/g) of NiFe2O4/MoS2 composite was obtained, and the electrode can kept over 90.7% (at 5 A/g) of capacitance after 3000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of MoS2 nanosheets and NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. Moreover, this complex material could be used in other advanced energy storage and conversion systems, such as Li-ion batteries, Li-air batteries, Na-ion hybrid capacitors, hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts, etc.
