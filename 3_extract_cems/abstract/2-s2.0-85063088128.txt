Graphene composite with carbon nanotube is one of promising active materials for energy storage applications. Herein, the Ndoped reduced graphene oxide/reduced multi-walled carbon nanotube oxide (N-rGOae/r-MWCNTO) composite was inspirationally introduced as the negative electrode material for the lithium hybrid capacitors (LICs). The negative electrodes of the N-rGOae/r-MWCNTO composites with respective to Li/Li+ initially deliver ca. 1500-2900 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 for which the electrode consisting of 50:50 wt% of N-rGOae: R-MWCNTO finely tuned provides the maximum specific capacity with a cycling stability over 500 cycles with 100% coulombic efficiency. In addition, the full cell of 50:50 wt% N-rGOae/r-MWCNTO//activated carbon (negative electrode//positive electrode) provides a voltage window of 2.0-4.0 V, an impressively maximum energy density of 189.90 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 24105 W kg-1 based on the active materials from both electrodes. As a result, this device may be useful for high energy and power applications.
