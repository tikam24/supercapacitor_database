To meet the demand of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors, it is highly desirable to design and develop a new class of electrode materials with superior electrochemical performance. Here, we used a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize NiCo2S4-anchored graphene nanosheets (NiCo2S4/GNS) for high-performance supercapacitors. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of graphene and NiCo2S4, the as-prepared composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances, such as high specific capacitance (1063 F g−1 at current density of 2 A g−1) and excellent cycling performance while maintaining 82 % of the initial value after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated using NiCo2S4/GNS as positive electrode and nitrogen-doped graphene as negative electrode. The fabricated ASC delivers a remarkable energy density of 54.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 350.8 W kg−1. The outstanding performances render such composite a promising candidate for application of high-energy-density supercapacitors.
