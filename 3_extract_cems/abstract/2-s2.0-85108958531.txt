The micro- and/or nanostructures of electrode materials play an essential role in their electrochemical performance, and the further understanding of their electrochemical behavior is vitally important for the rational design of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). Herein, four types of NiCo2S4 hierarchical microstructures (HMSs; i.e., sphere-, hat-, brush-, and flowerlike HMSs) assembled from similar hollow nanoneedle building blocks are specially synthesized via a multistep strategy. A series of electrochemical analyses are performed to investigate the structure-activity relationship of these NiCo2S4 electrodes. The four NiCo2S4 electrodes all exhibit hybrid electrochemical characteristics combined with the adsorption and diffusion-controlled process of Faradaic redox reaction kinetics. Notably, the brushlike NiCo2S4 electrode displays the best specific capacitance (capacity) of 1684 F g-1 (234 mAh g-1) at 1 A g-1, and retains 91% of its initial performance after 10 000 cycles, which is mainly due to its well-ordered three-dimensional microstructure with sufficient surface reaction sites, fast charge transport, and efficient ion diffusion properties. The resulting hybrid supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 2667 mWh kg-1 with a power density of 240 W kg-1 and is able to light up light-emitting diodes. Furthermore, the comparative electrochemical analysis of dynamic responses in different electrodes is helpful to further understand their charge-discharge mechanism and provide basic guidance to fabricate efficient electrodes for EESDs.
