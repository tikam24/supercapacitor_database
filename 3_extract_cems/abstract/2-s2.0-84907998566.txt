In the present study, cost-intensive Ni electrode is replaced by high surface-area activated carbon (AC) cathode and the possibility of the Fe anode, used in Ni-Fe battery, to function as Fe-C hybrid capacitor has been examined. The electrochemical properties of Fe-C hybrid capacitor assembly are studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge - discharge cycles. Over 100 galvanostatic charge - discharge cycles for Fe-C hybrid capacitor are carried out and a maximum capacitance of 24 F g-1 is observed.
