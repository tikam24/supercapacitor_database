There is a growing interest in the synthesis of electrically conductive cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) for advanced applications, such as supercapacitor, batteries, sensor, and printed electronics. CNC is recognized as an attractive template for the fabrication of functional nanomaterials. Since CNC possesses many attractive properties, it is a sustainable template to prepare conductive nanomaterials, by either coating it with a conductive material or transforming it into carbon nanorods. This review summarizes the utilization of a sustainable and low-cost CNC to produce conductive nanocomposites via an environmentally friendly process. Electroconductive CNCs with enhanced electrical properties, lower electrical percolation threshold, and better mechanical properties can be produced and are attractive systems for many new applications.
