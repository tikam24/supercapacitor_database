Voltage, temperature, and humidity significantly influence the lifetime of a supercapacitor (SC). Accelerated aging tests are applied to reduce the time required to analyze the influences of these factors. However, accelerated aging has a weakness in that it does not consider the conditions to which the SC is actually exposed when it is installed in a device. This article describes the development of an improved reliability model that simulates the voltage, temperature, and humidity levels that the SC is exposed to during operation in real working conditions. The model has been validated and provides a better lifetime estimation for an SC in a device.
