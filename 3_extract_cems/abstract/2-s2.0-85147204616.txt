Dopamine (DA) is a small biological molecule that causes a variety of diseases when its concentration is abnormal. Therefore, highly sensitive detection of DA is very important for the development of biomedicine and monitoring of human health. Herein, we prepared a carbon cloth (CC)/Ti3C2Tx/NiCoP composite as a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor for DA detection. Porous NiCoP was grown on the surface of CC and Ti3C2Tx by hydrothermal and phosphating treatments. The composite integrated the advantages of large specific surface area of zero-dimensional NiCoP quantum dots, rich electrochemical active sites of one-dimensional porous NiCoP nanowires, hydrophilicity of two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, and high conductivity of three-dimensional CC substrates. The sensor has high sensitivity (31.4101 μA μM-1 cm-2), wide detection range (0.17-784.55 μM), low detection limit (0.18 nM), elevated stability, and anti-interference ability. By analyzing the conductivity, hydrophilicity, and electrochemically active surface area of the CC/Ti3C2Tx/NiCoP composite, the reasons for its excellent performances are revealed for DA detection. At present, the research on NiCoP mainly focuses on hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and supercapacitor. This research provides a regulatory strategy for the application of phosphide materials in sensors.
