Aligned CoF2 nanochannel layers have been formed by self-ordering electrochemical anodization. In voltammograms these layers provide multiple oxidation states, an almost ideal rectangular pseudocapacitive behavior, a high specific capacitance and good capacitance retention. These layers may thus be promising for supercapacitor applications. Â© The Partner Organisations 2014.
