Carbonization of biomasses is an effective and important approach to recycle biomass waste. The tissue papers are one of the most common household trash and waste lots of natural resources and energies. Herein, the one-step carbonization and activation treatment was applied on two kinds of tissue papers to transform them into porous carbons. It was found the precursor structure and composition as well as the calcination temperatures play key roles to control the pore structures. As the active materials of supercapacitor electrodes, the resultant porous carbons obtained from different paper precursors and calcination temperatures (700–900 °C) presented different electrochemical performances. The microporous carbons derived from the 700 °C calcination of the tissue paper using the wood pulp as the raw material showed high capacitance up to ~ 200 F/g, providing a simple but effective way to recycle biomasses.
