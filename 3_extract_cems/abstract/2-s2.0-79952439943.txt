Porous NiO nanowall arrays (NWAs) grown on flexible FeCoNi alloy have been successfully synthesized by using nullaginite (Ni2(OH) 2CO3) as precursor and investigated as supercapacitor electrodes. In details, we adopted a simple hydrothermal method to realize Ni2(OH)2CO3 NWAs and examined their robust mechanical adhesion to substrate via a long-time ultrasonication test. Porous NiO NWAs were then obtained by a post-calcination towards precursors at 500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. Electrochemical properties of as-synthesized NiO NWAs were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge; porous NiO NWAs electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 270 F/g (0.67 A/g); even at high current densities, the electrode could still deliver a high capacitance up to 236 F/g (13.35 A/g). Meanwhile, it exhibited excellent cycle lifetime with ∼93% specific capacitance kept after 4000 cycles. These results suggest that as-made porous NiO NWAs electrode is a promising candidate for future thin-film supercapacitors and other microelectronic systems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
