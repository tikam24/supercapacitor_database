Using Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS- battery and super capacitor) to extend the lifespan of batteries and travelled distances has been selected by many research laboratories in the world. This is particularly due to the fact that batteries have high energy density but its lifespan is reduced when operating with electric currents with high harmonics. In this paper, we use Fast Fourier transform Analyzer of the traction current as the basis to transfer the suitable current to battery and super capacitor. The algorithm has been simulated in Matlab then implemented in DSP card to control the subject that is emulated in signal Hardware in the loop (S-HIL) HIL402 of Typhoon. Results show that HESS can increase the batteriesâ™ lifetime as well as extend the running distance per charge compared to using only battery.The S-HIL system should be a good and effective tool for further researches on energy management of EVs.
