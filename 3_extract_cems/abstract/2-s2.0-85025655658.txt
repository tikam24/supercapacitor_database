An eco-friendly and effective reducing agent to convert Graphene Oxide (GO) to reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) is reported. The oxygen scavenging property of Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. (AV) extract is successfully utilized to remove oxygen functionalities on GO. The synthesized reduced Graphene oxide (ARGO) is analyzed using UVâ€“Visible spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and FT-IR analysis. Complete GO reduction is achieved within 3 h with 30 mM AV extract and is confirmed by the XRD results. The high resolution transmission electron microscopy images provide clear evidence for the formation of single layer of graphene (rGO). The mechanism of reduction of GO by the AV extract is proposed. The rGO shows good charge storage properties with stable cycling up to 1000 cycles, demonstrated by the electrochemical method. The findings suggest that the Aloe vera (L.) Burm.f. (AV) extract reduced graphene oxide was found to be suitable for supercapacitor applications.
