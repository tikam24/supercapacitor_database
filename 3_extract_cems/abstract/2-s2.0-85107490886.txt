The proceedings contain 129 papers. The topics discussed include: gray-box loss model for induction motor drives; constant voltage control of a double sided LCC compensated IPT converter based on pulse density modulation; active damping in series connected power converters with continuous output voltage; a bipolar smart power synchronous rectifier; topology morphing control of low-cost PV microconverters; impacts of different charging strategies on the electric vehicle battery charger circuit using phase-shift full-bridge converter; a novel single switch step down converter; a reconfigurable battery supercapacitor hybrid energy system with active balancing for vehicle applications; and development of a teaching methodology of complex electromechatronic and robotic systems.
