We describe a simple and scalable method to grow threedimensional (3D) graphene/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) hybrid nanostructure on nickel foam via a one-step ambient pressure chemical vapor deposition. The as-grown graphene/MWNTs carbon nanostructure foam demonstrates a homogeneous and densely packed hierarchical nanostructure and possesses a high surface area, which can be potentially used for the electrodes of energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and battery. Symmetrical electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) of graphene/MWNTs nanostructures shows a high specific capacitance of 286 F g-1 which leads to an energy density of 39.72 Wh kg-1 and a superior power density of up to 154.67 kW kg-1. Moreover, the capacitance retention of ~100% after 11000 charge-discharge cycles demonstrates the high stability of the material as an electrode for use in a supercapacitor.
