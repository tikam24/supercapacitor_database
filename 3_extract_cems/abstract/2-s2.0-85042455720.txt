Graphene oxide (GO)-based all-solid-state supercapacitors (GO-A3Ss) are superior over liquid electrolyte-based supercapacitors and capable of being integrated on a single chip in various geometry shapes for the use of future smart wearable electronics field as a fast energy storage device, but their capacitance need to be improved. Here, a new approach has been developed for enhancing the capacitive capability of the supercapacitors through molecular dynamics simulations with the first-principle input. A theoretical model of charge storage is developed to understand the unique capacitive enhancement mechanism and to predict the capacitance of the GO-A3Ss, which agrees well with the experimental observations. A novel supercapacitor with GO and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) alternatively layered structures is designed based on the model, and its energy density is the highest among conventional supercapacitors using liquid electrolytes and all-solid-state supercapacitors using aerogels or hydrogels as the solid-state electrolyte. Based on the predictions, two new types of high-performance GO/rGO multilayered capacitors are proposed to meet different practical applications. The results of this work provide an approach for the design of high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors based on GO and rGO materials.
