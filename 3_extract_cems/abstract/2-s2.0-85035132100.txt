In this study, kassite was synthesized by employing a simple, green hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were carried out to study its crystal phases, morphologies and electrochemical performance. With the extension of reaction time, the crystallinity of the samples became higher and the specific capacitance increased correspondingly. The result shows that kassite has a promising application in electrode material for capacitors. To improve the electrical conductivity of kassite and the accessibility of the surface area, graphene nanosheet (GNS) was introduced to form composites with kassite. The capacitive performance improved with increasing weight percentage of GNS and reached an optimum with the specific capacitance of 129.8 F/g at weight percentage of 10%, then decreased with further increasing GNS, showing a synergistic effect of kassite and the GNS.
