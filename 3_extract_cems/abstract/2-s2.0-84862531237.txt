Zn-doped α-nickel hydroxide materials with flower-like nanostructures are synthesized by electrochemical deposition method. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemical measurements. XRD spectra indicate nickel hydroxide doped with Zn is α-Ni(OH) 2 with excellent crystallization. The SEM observation shows that the formation of Zn-doped Ni(OH) 2 includes two steps: a honeycomb-like film forms on the substrate first, then flower-like particles forms on the films. The nickel hydroxide doped with 5% Zn can maintain a maximum specific capacitance of 860 F g -1 , suggesting its potential application in electrochemical capacitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
