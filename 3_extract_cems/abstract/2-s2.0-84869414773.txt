Cell voltage equalizers are necessary to ensure years of operation for series-connected supercapacitors (SCs) by eliminating cell voltage imbalance. Conventional equalizers require numerous switches and/or magnetic components; hence, the circuit complexity and size tend to increase. In this paper, a double-switch single-transformer equalizer, which is based on the combination of a half-bridge inverter and a voltage multiplier, is proposed. The operation of the proposed equalizer is analyzed in detail, and a dc equivalent circuit is mathematically derived. Experimental equalization tests were performed for eight SCs connected in series under a voltage-imbalanced condition. The energy of the series-connected SCs was preferentially redistributed to SCs with low voltages, and eventually, the voltage imbalance was eliminated, demonstrating the equalization performance. Simulation-based equalizations using the derived dc equivalent circuit were also performed under the same condition as the experiments. The experimental and simulation results were in good agreement, indicating that the derived dc equivalent circuit can adequately express real equalization profiles. Â© 1967-2012 IEEE.
