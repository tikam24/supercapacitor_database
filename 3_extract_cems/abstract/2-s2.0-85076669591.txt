Graphene-based conductive organic composites are a class of electrode materials with great potential for next-generation energy storage devices due to their good flexibility, high conductivity and abundant redox sites. Herein, a series of novel 7-aminoindole/rGO composites are successfully synthesized by a universal solvothermal method. With rGO as supporting framework, the morphology, structure and conductivity of the composites are optimized by the synergistic effect of 7-aminoindole and rGO to comprehensively enhance the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The obtained optimal electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 391.88 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Simultaneously, the assembled symmetric device also exhibits an energy density of 11.97 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 325 W kg−1 and a super-long cycling stability (97.62%) after 25,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. Such measurement results strongly demonstrate that the synthesized novel composite electrodes have a great potential for application in new energy storage devices such as flexible electronics and wearable devices.
