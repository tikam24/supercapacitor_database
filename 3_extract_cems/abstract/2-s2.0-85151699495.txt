Loofah sponge with three-dimensional bundled micro-structure has unique advantages in the preparation of biomass-based 3D porous carbon materials. Using loofah sponge as raw material and ammonium polyphosphate as activator,morphology protector and nitrogen doping source,the optimal process conditions for the preparation of luffa-based 3D porous carbon materials were established. The results showed that the specific surface area and total pore volume of the CAC-1-550 sample prepared with pre-carbonization treatment were 738 m2 / g and 0. 43 cm3 / g,respectively,which were significantly higher than those of AC-1-550. The electrochemical test results showed that the specific capacitance of CAC-1-550 could reach 260 F / g at 0. 5 A / g,and the capacitance retention rate was 116% after 6 000 cycles of charge and discharge. When the power density was 1 674 W / kg,the maximum energy density could reach 37. 2 Wh / kg,which was better than that of most carbon electrode materials of supercapacitor widely reported in literatures. When the power density drastically increased to 33. 5 kW / kg,the energy density was still up to 9. 3 Wh / kg,CAC-1-550 showed appealing electrochemical performance and indicated great potential as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
