Flexible in-plane architecture micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are competitive candidates for on-chip miniature energy storage applications owing to their light weight, small size, high flexibility, as well as the advantages of short charging time, high power density, and long cycle life. However, tedious and time-consuming processes are required for the manufacturing of high-resolution interdigital electrodes using conventional approaches. In contrast, the laser processing technique enables high-efficiency high-precision patterning and advanced manufacturing of nanostructured electrodes. In this review, the recent advances in laser manufacturing and patterning of nanostructured electrodes for applications in flexible in-plane MSCs are comprehensively summarized. Various laser processing techniques for the synthesis, modification, and processing of interdigital electrode materials, including laser pyrolysis, reduction, oxidation, growth, activation, sintering, doping, and ablation, are discussed. In particular, some special features and merits of laser processing techniques are highlighted, including the impacts of laser types and parameters on manufacturing electrodes with desired morphologies/structures and their applications on the formation of high-quality nanoshaped graphene, the selective deposition of nanostructured materials, the controllable nanopore etching and heteroatom doping, and the efficient sintering of nanometal products. Finally, the current challenges and prospects associated with the laser processing of in-plane MSCs are also discussed. This review will provide a useful guidance for the advanced manufacturing of nanostructured electrodes in flexible in-plane energy storage devices and beyond.
