A three-dimensional (3D) graphene/Ni3S2 nanostructure grown on nickel foam using a one-step chemical vapor deposition process is an excellent template for the synthesis of graphene-based composite electrodes for use in supercapacitors. The as-grown graphene/Ni3S2 nano-structures have high crystalline quality and surface area. Electrochemical characterization shows that the 3D porous graphene/Ni3S2 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 741 F/g at 1 mV/s, with 92.3% of the specific capacitance retained after 5000 charging-discharging cycles. Such high performance of a 3D graphene electrode can enrich the prospects for future practical applications in energy storage.
