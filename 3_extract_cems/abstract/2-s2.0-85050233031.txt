Fiber-shaped supercapacitors with improved specific capacitance and high rate capability are a promising candidate as power supply for smart textiles. However, the synergistic interaction between conductive filaments and active nanomaterials remains a crucial challenge, especially when hydrothermal or electrochemical deposition is used to produce a core (fiber)–shell (active materials) fibrous structure. On the other hand, although 2D pseudocapacitive materials, e.g., Ti3C2T x (MXene), have demonstrated high volumetric capacitance, high electrical conductivity, and hydrophilic characteristics, MXene-based electrodes normally suffer from poor rate capability owing to the sheet restacking especially when the loading level is high and solid-state gel is used as electrolyte. Herein, by hosting MXene nanosheets (Ti3C2T x) in the corridor of a scrolled carbon nanotube (CNT) scaffold, a MXene/CNT fiber with helical structure is successfully fabricated. These features offer open spaces for rapid ion diffusion and guarantee fast electron transport. The solid-state supercapacitor based on such hybrid fibers with gel electrolyte coating exhibits a volumetric capacitance of 22.7 F cm−3 at 0.1 A cm−3 with capacitance retention of 84% at current density of 1.0 A cm−3 (19.1 F cm−3), improved volumetric energy density of 2.55 mWh cm−3 at the power density of 45.9 mW cm−3, and excellent mechanical robustness.
