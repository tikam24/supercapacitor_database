Nanomaterials for energy storage and transfer devices like supercapacitors and batteries have been widely researched on the purpose of obtaining desirable performances. A novel hybrid nanocomposite based on tubular MnO2, polyindole and reduced graphene oxides was synthesized by a simple method and the optimal mass ratio of each raw material was researched in this work. This sandwich-like structure caused by RGO sheets and coaxial MnO2/polyindole nanotubes results in fast electron and ions transfer and high contacting area. This ternary composite exhibits a satisfactory electrochemical performance with large specific capacitance of 522.5 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and outstanding cycling stability of 97.65% capacitive retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. Therefore, MnO2/PIn/RGO composite owns promising applications in high-performance supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
