With the aim of addressing the global warming issue and fossil energy shortage, eco-friendly and sustainable renewable energy technologies are urgently needed. In comparison to energy conversion, studies on energy storage fall behind and remain largely to be explored. By storing energy from electrochemical processes at the electrode surface, supercapacitors (SCs) bridge the performance gap between electrostatic double-layer capacitors and batteries. Organic electrode materials have drawn extensive attention because of their special power density, good round trip efficiency and excellent cycle stability. Porous organic polymers (POPs) have drawn extensive attention as attractive electrode materials in SCs. In this review, we present and discuss recent advancements and design principles of POPs as efficient electrode materials for SCs from the perspectives of synthetic strategies and the structure-performance relationships of POPs. Finally, we put forward the outlook and prospects of POPs for SCs.
