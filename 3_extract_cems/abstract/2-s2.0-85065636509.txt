We performed a study to obtain the effect of duration of light irradiation on the performance of photo supercapacitor system based on TiO2-ZnO and TiO2/BaTiO3/PVDF materials. Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) based on the TiO2 material are potential because of several advantages such as high photostability, high thermal stability and are very effective for dye absorption. However, TiO2 has limitations regarding electron mobility. It needs to be composited with other materials for electron mobility. The material preferred is ZnO. ZnO also has similar band gap range as TiO2. In this process, TiO2-ZnO composite system becomes more potential used as DSSC electrodes. In the Photo-Supercapacitor with the presence of a high electrical energy source from the DSSC, a supercapacitor unit with sufficient capacitance is needed. In this case, selection of capacitor electrodes is a crucial exercise. In this study, electrodes based on PVDF/BaTiO3 composite systems were used. PVDF polymer-based electrodes have advantages regarding their flexible nature, high thermal stability, and easy in synthesis. However, the polymer material-based supercapacitor electrodes have limitations such as low dielectric constant. This problem is to overcome with ceramic-polymer composite systems. Among ceramic materials, the BaTiO3 is the best choice because it has the highest dielectric constant compared to other ceramic materials. Thus, PVDF-BaTiO3 composite system can function well because of dielectric constants and excellent mechanical properties. As a result, this composite system has the potential to be used as a supercapacitor electrode.
