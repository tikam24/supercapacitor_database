Nanostructured cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) has been synthesized by a two-step process, a facile ultrasonic-assisted solvothermal technique for Fe2Co-MOF preparation and subsequent calcination. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns confirm the formation of MIL-88A(Fe) structure of Fe2Co-MOF and the cubic spinel structure of CoFe2O4. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images reveal that calcination process converts the spindle-like morphology of Fe2Co-MOF to yolk-shell CoFe2O4 microspheres. From Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, the specific surface areas of 36.0 and 29.2 m2 g−1 are measured for Fe2Co-MOF and CoFe2O4, respectively. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis of CoFe2O4 displays high coercivity of 2500 Oe due to surface anisotropy. Conversion of Fe2Co-MOF to CoFe2O4 reduces the optical band gap from 1.92 to 1.77 eV. Electrochemical performance of Fe2Co-MOF and CoFe2O4 deposited on Ni foams (NFs) is examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests. Specific capacitances of 489.9 and 192.6 F g−1 have been achieved from GCD curves at a current density of 1 A g−1 for Fe2Co-MOF/NF and CoFe2O4/NF electrodes, respectively. Fe2Co-MOF/NF electrode exhibits more cyclic stability than CoFe2O4/NF electrode after 3000 cycles.
