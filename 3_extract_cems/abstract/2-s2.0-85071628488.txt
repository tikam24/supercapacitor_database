In order to reduce the fluctuation in the power grid generated by renewable energies, a grid connected hybrid energy storage system is used, combining lithium-ion batteries and ultra-capacitors. In this paper, a new high-efficiency control method for the power division as well as for the stored energy balance is proposed. The battery bank, ultra-capacitor bank and power converters are individually analyzed. The control method is based on the Optimum Voltage Range, which is a new method of determining the highest efficiency work-point of the energy storage systems. The validity of the proposed system is verified by a 1 kW simulation. A 1kW experimental setup is used in order to obtain the preliminary experimental results of the proposed system.
