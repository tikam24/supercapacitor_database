The formation of a supramolecular electropolymerized film of a polymeric palladium phthalocyanine on a glassy carbon electrode is reported here. The film was obtained by cycling monomeric palladium tetraaminephthalocyanine in dimethyl sulfoxide in the potential range -0.5 to +1.0 V. The functionalized polymerized film on the electrode was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. A polymeric phthalocyanine film was shown to form by the oxidation of peripheral amino groups. It uniformly and completely covered the electrode surface. The modified electrode surface slightly blocked the reversible redox behavior of a redox probe owing to the thick polymeric film on its surface. The modified electrode showed a redox capacitance of 146 F g-1 at 0.27 V in 0.5 M sulfuric acid. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
