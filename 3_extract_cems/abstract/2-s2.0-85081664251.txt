A facile one pot template free strategy is developed for the fabrication of Co(OH)2 - Co3O4 nanoarchitecture. Preparation is performed under mild sonication using ammonia as a precipitating agent and the material characterization revealed the structure and flake like morphology of the hybrid material. The mesopores in the material lead to the easy diffusion of the electrolyte ions and provided excellent supercapacitor properties to the Co(OH)2-Co3O4 electrode. A high specific capacitance of 308 F/g is displayed by the nanocompoiste at a scan rate of 2 mV/s in 2 M KOH electrolyte.
