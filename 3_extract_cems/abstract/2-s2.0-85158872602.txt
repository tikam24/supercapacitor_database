Layed δ-MnO2 nanocrystals are fabricated through a facile precipitation reaction at ambient conditions with Na2SO3 as reductant. The high content of co-preinserted K+ and Na+ and water content in δ-MnO2 are responsible for the enhanced electrochemical performance. Specifically, δ-MnO2 delivers a high specific capacitance of 303.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, together with steady cycle property. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated with δ-MnO2 as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as the negative electrode. The device displays a large energy density of 53.2 Wh kg−1 at 250 W kg−1 with a potential window of 0–2.0 V in aqueous electrolyte, and 91.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. These results can well demonstrate the potential application of layed δ-MnO2 nanocrystals as the active electrode material in energy storage systems.
