This work aims towards the optimization of porous carbon saturated nanofibres composition for electrical-double layer (EDL) electrode's preparation. The properties of microporous carbide-derived carbon (CDC) based electrospun electrodes are discussed. The variable electrode composition and their mechanical properties were observed to obtain the highest EDL capacitance. Effect of densification pressure and -temperature of electrospun electrodes are discussed. Thin electrode layer enables faster charge-discharge capability and perform higher power with same consumption of electrode materials. The EDL capacitance of 114 Fg-1, determined by cyclic voltammetry method within the voltage range of 0â€“2.7 V, was achieved.
