Arrays of NiCo2S4 nanotubes on nickel foam were prepared by means of a two-step method, and were directly applied as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode. Such a binder-free method enables intimate contact between the current collector and the active materials, and can effectively improve ion and charge transportation. As a result, the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors can be improved. The as-prepared NiCo2S4 nanotubes/Ni foam electrode shows a high specific capacitance (738 F g-1 at 4 A g-1), excellent rate capability (78 % capacitance retention at 32 A g-1), and good cycling stability (retention capacity of 93.4 % after 4000 cycles), which suggests its promising application for electrochemical capacitors. Solid becomes hollow: Uniform NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays on conductive 3D nickel foam were obtained through use of a two-step hydrothermal method (see figure) and were directly applied as the binder-free electrode for electrochemical capacitors. The electrode of NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays exhibits enhanced specific capacitance and a superior stability. Copyright Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
