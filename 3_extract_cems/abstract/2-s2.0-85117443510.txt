The high pseudocapacitance of metal oxides makes them a very promising electrode material for supercapacitors. In this work, we report a MoO3-ZnO composite as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors. The MoO3-ZnO composite materials were synthesized by the facile solid-state impregnation-calcination method at 350 Â°C. The MoO3-ZnO composite shows a specific capacitance of 280 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 current density in the potential range between 0 and -1.3 V in 1 M Na2SO4. The composite material shows a power density of 650 W kg-1 at an energy density of 65 Wh kg-1 and is stable over 10 000 cycles at 5 A g-1 with 98% capacitance retention. The improved capacitive behavior of the MoO3-ZnO composite electrode is due to the redox behavior of MoO3, and the porous nature of ZnO, which facilitates the electrolyte ions interaction into the composite frameworks. The improved anodic potential charge storage nature and overall electrochemical performance depict that the MoO3-ZnO composite is a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors.
