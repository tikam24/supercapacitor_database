In this work, self-supported NiTe nanosheets were prepared via one-step microwave method. XRD and XPS spectroscopy showed the successful synthesis of NiTe material in the hexagonal crystal system. SEM and EDS were used to identify the microscopic morphology and composition of NiTe on nickel foam (NF). The electrode demonstrated specific capacitance (Cs) of 808.9 F g−1 and ultra-long cycle life of 60,000 cycles. In addition, a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor consisted of NiTe@NF electrode as cathode material and demonstrated the largest energy density and power density of 94.4 μWh cm−2 and 7801.8 μW cm−2, respectively, and the specific capacitance remained 83.3% after 20,000 cycles. Moreover, the as-obtained NiTe@NF catalyst also displayed an excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which achieved an ultra-low overpotential of 199.5 mV at 10 mA cm−2.
