Air pollution caused by exhaust gas, increasing carbon dioxide by burning fossil fuels, and the risk of drain on fossil fuels are the major problems of fossil fuels. In addition, low self-sufficiency rate of fossil fuels is also a large problem in Japan. 84.6% of electricity is generated by fossil fuels in Japan, so electrification such as electric vehicle does not mean breakaway from fossil fuels. Electricity should be generated by clean energy such as renewable energy in order to settle the problems of fossil fuels. A light rail system which runs on 100% renewable energy named the "Solar Light Rail" is proposed by authors. Experiments using a prototype model are carried out to demonstrate availability of the rechargeable power supply method using electric double layer capacitors. Two types of experiments are reported in this paper. From the experiment combination of PV and biomass, it was confirmed that clean stable energy is effective for this system under the bad condition for PV. In the experiments using PV, experimental condition is changed from passed experiments and energy consumption per run is decreased. Low energy consumption brings about running for longer time after sunset. The handmade equipment can be more efficient, and better result is expected by improvement.
