The aim of this work is to fabricate supercapacitor electrode based on poly (3-hexyl-thiophene-2, 5-diyl) (P3HT) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) nanocomposites with different ratios onto a graphite sheet as a substrate with a wide voltage window in nonaqueous electrolyte. Structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the prepared nanocomposites of P3HT/SWCNTs were studied and discussed. The electrochemical properties included cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were investigated. The obtained results indicated that P3HT/SWCNTs nanocomposite possesses higher specific capacitance than that present in its individual component. The high electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite was due to formation of microporous structure which facilitates ions diffusion and electrolyte penetration in these pores. The morphological micrographs of the purified SWCNTs had buckypaper structure while the photomicrographs of P3HT/SWCNTs showed that SWCNTs appear behind and front of the P3HT nanospheres. The specific capacitance of 50% SWCNTs at 0.5 Ag−1 was found to be 245.8 Fg−1 compared with that of pure P3HT of 160.5 Fg−1.
