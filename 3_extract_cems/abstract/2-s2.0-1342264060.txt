Carbon nanotubes prepared by catalytic pyrolysis method have been considered as active electrode materials for the storage of energy in supercapacitors. Due to their unique mesoporosity, this material has a high ability for the accumulation of charges in the electrode/electrolyte interface. Electrochemical capacitors based on carbon nanotube electrodes have been developed in this paper. The value of capacitance obtained from nanotubes reaches 42 F/g. The new technique for getting high working voltage was discussed in detail. The working voltage over 20 V and resistance less than 360 mÎ© was obtained. Characteristics of capacitance and resistance for this type super capacitor were described.
