In recent years, multi-heteroatom-doped hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) derived from natural potential precursors and synthesized in a simple, efficient and environmentally friendly manner have received extensive attention in many critical technology applications. Herein, bean worms (BWs), a pest in bean fields, were innovatively employed as a precursor via a one-step method to prepare N-O-P-S co-doped porous carbon materials. The pore structure and surface elemental composition of carbon can be modified by adjusting KOH dosage, exhibiting a high surface area (SBET) of 1967.1 m2 g-1 together with many surface functional groups. The BW-based electrodes for supercapacitors were shown to have a good capacitance of up to 371.8 F g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte at 0.1 A g-1, and good rate properties with 190 F g-1 at a high current density of 10 A g-1. Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor based on the optimal carbon material (BWPC1/3) was also assembled with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V, demonstrating satisfactory energy density (27.5 W h kg-1 at 200 W kg-1) and electrochemical cycling stability (97.1% retention at 10 A g-1 over 10 000 charge/discharge cycles). The facile strategy proposed in this work provides an attractive way to achieve high-efficiency and scalable production of biomass-derived HPCs for energy storage.
