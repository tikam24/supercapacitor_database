In professional and in non-elite sport activities, people today are using various electronic monitoring tools quite commonly. Sportspersons often are embedded into a personal body sensor network, which traces different parameters of their physiological activity. Especially heart rate sensors are used broadly, but often all kinds of meters, e.g., for counting foot steps and pedal turning, are also utilized in parallel. As technical construction, it has commonly established that these sensor devices are autonomously operated as very tiny computer systems from built-in lithium battery cells. Replacing such sensor batteries from time to time is expensive, the mechanical handling of this process is not very easy due to the small sensor housings, and it has to be reminded that use of throwaway batteries represents a waste of resources. In this work, an alternative power supply for sports sensors is investigated, which bases on the use of so-called supercapacitors. Construction concepts, advantages of the approach related to handling and manufacturing, and the possible application ranges are thoroughly discussed, while the study is complemented with practical experiments from endurance running sports.
