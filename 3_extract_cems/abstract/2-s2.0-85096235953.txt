{AsW12O40} clusters were grafted onto Ag-MOF to yield two 3D polyoxometallate-based metal organic frameworks (POMOFs), (imi)2[{Ag3(tpb)2}2(H2O){AsW12O40}2]·6H2O (1) and [(Ag7bpy7Cl2){AsWV2WVI10O40}]·H2O (2) (imi = imidazole; tpb = 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)benzene; bpy = 4,4′-bipyridyl). These compounds are complicated 3D networks with intersecting channels and novel topologies. They exhibit larger capacitances (929.7 and 986.1 F g-1 at a current density of 3 A g-1), superior rate capabilities, higher capacity retention rates, boosting conductivities and electrocatalytic activities compared to those of their maternal POM, and this can be ascribed to the introduction of Ag-MOF, interpenetrating channels, and the unique stability of the POMOF. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor equipment, assembled with 2-CPE, displays remarkable energy density (16.1 W h kg-1) with a power density of 1748.9 W kg-1 and durable cyclic stability. The practical application capability as a power supply device can be confirmed by lighting a red light-emitting diode. Moreover, 2-GCE as a H2O2 biosensor reveals a lower detecting limit (0.48 μM), a wider linear range (1.43 μM to 1.89 mM), high selectivity and high reproducibility, and this was further demonstrated by detecting H2O2 in real blood serum samples.
