Developing supercapacitive materials via cost‐effective and scalable methods to synergistically achieve high specific capacitance and specific energy/density remains a grandiose challenge. Here a low‐cost and scaled‐up controlled microwave synthesis method is developed for engineering 3D pyramidal faceted Chalcostibite (CuSbS2) architectures towards supercapacitive application. The phase purity, surface morphologies and composition of the as-synthesized materials was confirmed through various physicochemical techniques namely XRD, Raman, electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. As electrode materials, the CuSbS2 pyramids display a higher specific capacitance of 172.28 Fg−1 at 0.6 Ag−1 as compared to other reports of similar ternary sulphides. Moreover, the capacity retains 92.9% of its initial value even after 5000 cycles at high current of 5 Ag−1. The admirable electrochemical performance could be attributed to the faceted structures facilitating large ion interaction and improved ion transfer along the facets for enhanced pseudocapacitive storage.
