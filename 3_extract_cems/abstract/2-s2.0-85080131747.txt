Metal-organic frameworks, colloquially called MOFs, have attracted worldwide attention in the field of supercapacitors (SCs) owing to their high surface areas, tailorable pore sizes and shapes, and various framework architectures. In this regard, herein, we comprehensively summarize the recent progress in pristine MOFs and MOF composites for SC applications from the aspect of different spatial dimensions (not involved in metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived inorganic materials), such as 2D MOFs containing 2D conductive MOFs and 2D MOF nanosheets (MONs), and 3D MOFs, including single metallic MOFs and multiple-metallic MOFs. The advantages and disadvantages of MOFs with different dimensions, especially for their subsections, are systematically analyzed and introduced. Furthermore, future perspectives on MOF-based SC materials have also been included and discussed.
