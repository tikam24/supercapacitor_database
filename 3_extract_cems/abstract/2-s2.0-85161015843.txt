With the continuous utilization of green energy resource, energy storage devices are becoming one of the main issues in the field of energy. Supercapacitors have achieved great popularity owing to their several advantages in energy storage. For determining the efficiency of the supercapacitor, the electrode material is considered as the core element. Herein, mesoporous nanostructure of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) immobilized on boron, nitrogen and fluorine tri-doped CeO2 (NFTDNC) was prepared and scrutinized as supercapacitor material. The structural and compositional study of the synthesized material was done using characterizations, such as SEM, XRD, TEM, XPS and FTIR. The synthesized NFTDNC electrode demonstrates good electrochemical performance and shows 81.81% capacitance retention after 3000 GCD cycles. The achieved results verify the capability of the prepared NFTDNC electrode to be efficiently employed as cathode in the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors. Moreover, the proposed material offers new opportunities in the domain of energy storage.
