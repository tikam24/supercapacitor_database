Maximizing the effective surface area with high reactivity is vital but still a challenge to electrode materials for high-energy supercapacitors. Herein, we demonstrate a fluorine-driving reconstruction strategy to synthesize ultrathin nanosheets on the CoNi nanoparticles with abundant M−F bonds by a simple molten-salt method. Ex-situ surface characterizations reveal that M−F bonds can trigger the surface transformation to generate abundant M−OH groups during electrochemical activation, endowing with greatly enhanced surface reactivity. The resultant activated sample (F-CoNi-A) can deliver an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2476 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 86.8% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which is almost the best results for the pesudocapacitance-dominated electrode materials to date. After assembling into an asymmetric supercapacitor with active carbon, an energy density of up to 75.2 Wh kg−1 is achieved at a power density of 0.8 kW kg−1.
