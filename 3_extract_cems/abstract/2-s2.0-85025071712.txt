Anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays are one of the key electrode materials for supercapacitors, because of their easy synthesis, controllable morphology, and environmentally friendly characteristics. In this paper, the multi-modification of TiO2 nanotube arrays is presented. These modification sinclude the introduction of oxygen vacancies, and the modification of the arrays by metals, nonmetals, metal oxides and conductive polymers; these modifications provide scope to increase the electrochemical performance of the TiO2 nanotube arrays. Recent advances of anodized TiO2 nanotube arrays in supercapacitors are systematically summarized, providing guidance for the practical application of these arrays.
