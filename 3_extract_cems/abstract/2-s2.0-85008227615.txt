A vertically porous Ni(OH)2/Ni film grown on carbon cloth was fabricated as the electrode of supercapacitors. Dense Ni film was first deposited on carbon cloth by magnetic sputtering, following by etching treatment and electrochemical oxidation to form vertically porous Ni(OH)2/Ni/CC composite. The Ni(OH)2/Ni/CC composite had a specific capacitance of 1760 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1 and the capacitance retention of 88% after 3000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The special structure of Ni(OH)2/Ni/CC composite may be the main reason for its high energy storage performance.
