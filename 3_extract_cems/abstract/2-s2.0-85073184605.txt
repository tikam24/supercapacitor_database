Advances in renewable and sustainable energy technologies critically depend on our ability to rationally design and process target materials with optimized performances. Advanced material design and discovery are ideally involved in material prediction, synthesis and characterization. Control of material crystallization enables the rational design and discovery of novel functional inorganic materials in multi-scale. Material processing can be adjusted by various physical fields and chemical effects at different energy states. Material microstructure, architecture and functionality can thus be modified by multiple design methodologies. In this review, we show typical examples using physical and chemical methods to shape inorganic functional materials and evaluate their specific applications in Na-air batteries, Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. Furthermore, this review also provides insight into the understanding of synthesis-structure relationship of inorganic functional materials.
