MXene fibers are promising candidates for weaveable and wearable energy storage devices because of their good electrical conductivity and high theoretical capacitance. Herein, we propose a nacre-inspired strategy for simultaneously improving the mechanical strength, volumetric capacitance, and rate performance of MXene-based fibers through synergizing the interfacial interaction and interlayer spacing between Ti3C2TX nanosheets. The optimized hybrid fibers (M-CMC-1.0%) with 99 wt % MXene loading exhibit an improved tensile strength of âˆ¼81 MPa and a high specific capacitance of 885.0 F cm-3 at 1 A cm-3 together with an outstanding rate performance of 83.6% retention at 10 A cm-3 (740.0 F cm-3). As a consequence, the fiber supercapacitor (FSC) based on the M-CMC-1.0% hybrid delivers an output capacitance of 199.5 F cm-3, a power density of 1186.9 mW cm-3, and an energy density of 17.7 mWh cm-3, respectively, implying its promising applications as portable energy storage devices for future wearable electronics.
