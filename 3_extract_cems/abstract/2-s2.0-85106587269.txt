The nickel oxide (NiO) thin films are prepared with different level of cobalt (Co) doping (2–10 wt%) on conducting (FTO) by using spray pyrolysis technique. The effect of Co doping on the microstructure and electrochemical performance of NiO thin film electrodes are thoroughly investigated. The X-ray diffraction results exhibited the polycrystalline cubic NiO structure with (1 1 1) as preferential orientation. The XPS analysis revealed existence of Co in NiO thin films. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) of 4% Co:NiO thin films presented porous surface morphology. The maximum specific capacitance 835F. g−1 is attained at scan rate of 5 mV s−1 from cyclic voltammetry in 2 M KOH electrolyte for 4% Co doped NiO thin film. Further, exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 246.80F.g−1 at current density of 0.2 mA/cm2 with 96% capacity retention after 1000 cycle.
