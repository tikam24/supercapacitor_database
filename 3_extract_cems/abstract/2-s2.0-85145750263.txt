In this rapid growing eco-friendly research world, synthesis of non-toxic, highly effective photocatalyst for potential applications is necessary. Herein, a strong ability Bi2Zr2O7 nanoparticle (BZO NP) with pyrochlore structure was fabricated by solution combustion synthesis using green (Mentha spicata) and chemical (Glycine) fuels. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the formation of pure phase for synthesized BZO NP using pudina extract (BZOP NP) compared to BZO NP using Glycine fuel (BZOG NP). The lower energy band gap of synthesized BZOP NP was observed than BZOG NP and its values were found to be 2.26 and 2.49 eV measured by UV–visible absorbance spectral technique. The morphological analysis of pores and voids formation as examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. The synthesized BZOP NP shows excellent photocatalytic activity for degradation of three different dyes under sunlight irradiation for about 150 min with 97.9% for Rose Bengal (RB) dye with lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) value. For the very first time, the synthesized NPs can be utilized as supercapacitor with good specific capacitance (SPCcv) value of 14.3 F/g and SPCGD (12.5 F/g) for BZOP compared to BZOG indicating pseudocapacitance nature. The synthesized nanoparticles (NPs) can sense lead nitrate and dextrose at concentration 1–5 mM in the potential range of − 1.0 to + 1.0 V. Accordingly, the reduction potential peak at − 0.25 V and oxidation potential peak found at − 0.82 V confirms the presence of lead content and presence of additional potential peaks at − 0.37 V and − 0.71 V for detection of dextrose biochemical. Recyclability experiment showed the retainment of photocatalytic activity up to five cycles indicating the photostability.
