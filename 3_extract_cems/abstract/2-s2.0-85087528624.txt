Manganese oxides have attracted wide attention as promising electrode materials for high-energy density supercapacitors. However, the electrochemical performance of the manganese oxide materials deteriorates considerably with the increase in mass loading due to their moderate electronic and ionic conductivities. This phenomenon leads to low areal capacitance, which limits the practical application of these materials. Herein, we perform a potentiostatic electrodeposition of manganese oxides with Ce as rare earth (RE) modification on a nickel (Ni) foam substrate to achieve high areal capacitance. Under optimum conditions, manganese oxide nanosheets are axially grown on Ni foam to form a hierarchically porous network nanostructure, which ensures facile ionic and electric transport. The Ce-modified manganese oxide with the Mn:Ce molar ratio of 1:0.1 yields an outstanding areal capacitance of 3.67 F cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2 and a good rate capability compared with the capacitance of 2.59 F cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2 of pure manganese oxide without the addition of Ce. This result verifies the importance of Ce modification to manganese oxides. Our results suggest the important role played by the RE element Ce in enhancing the electrochemical performance of high areal capacitance manganese oxide electrodes, which is essential to bringing them one step toward further practical applications.
