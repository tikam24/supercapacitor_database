Historically, graphitic and semi-graphitic materials have always played a major role in a wide range of electrical and electrochemical systems. A variety of top-down and bottom-up synthetic approaches emerged as a way to control the architecture and chemical functionality. This, in turn, has led to the development of nanostructured carbons for advanced applications such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, batteries, water-splitting systems, sensors, and gas chemisorbents. The strategies for inclusion of nitrogen functionalities at graphene edges can be divided into two groups: a post-pyrolysis procedure via reaction of the carbon material with N-containing gases and carbonization of N-rich precursors. The chapter briefly discusses the extent to which these approaches address the challenges associated with the control over the location and nature of the N-functionalities in carbon material and with assuring their electrochemical availability.
