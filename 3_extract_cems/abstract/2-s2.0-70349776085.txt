To meet the high current load requirement from the high energy density realized by metal oxide and high power density graphite, we propose a novel hybrid supercapacitor consisting of Nb2O5 and KS6 graphite in 1.0 M LiPF6-EC:DEC (1:2). This new system exhibits a sloping voltage profile from 2.7 to 3.5 V during charging and presents a high operating voltage plateau between 1.5 and 3.5 V during discharging. The cell was tested at a current density of 100 mA/g with a cut-off voltage between 3.0 and 1.0 V. This novel energy storage system delivers the highest initial discharge capacity of 55 mAh/g and exhibits a good cycle performance.
