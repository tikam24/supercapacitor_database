Researchers have developed an in situ porous Cu template method to prepare 3D hierarchical porous carbon nanomaterials in analogy to the in situ MgO template method. Nanomaterials in analogy to the in situ MgO template method. The unique 3D few-layer graphene-like carbon (3DG) is obtained which is characterized by the open porous architecture with interconnected micro-meso-macropores, specific surface area (SSA), high conductivity, and high wettability either in aqueous or in ionic liquid electrolytes. 3D few-layer graphene-like carbon (3DG) presents the high supercapacitive performances in both the electrolytes.
