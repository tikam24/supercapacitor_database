A facile hydrothermal route was employed to synthesize Co3O4/rGO nanocomposites. The preparation of nanocomposites involves hydrothermal heat treatment of mixed solutions of rGo and Co(NO3)2 under basic conditions without any reducing agents. To study the influence of graphene, different samples were synthesized by varying the mass ratio of rGO. The as-fabricated rGO/Co3O4 composites are characterized by XRD, HR-SEM, EDX and UV Visible spectroscopy. The electrochemical behaviour of the samples were carried out using CV, GCD AND EIS. The prepared sample acts as an efficient electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor applications with the highest recorded specific capacitance of 680.08 F/g.
