Hierarchical nanostructures (Hs) have recently garnered enormous attention due to their remarkable performances in catalysis, electronic devices, energy storage and conversion. Considering the advantage of hierarchical nanostructures, we have formulated a facile and template free method to synthesize novel hierarchical nanospheres (NHNs) of ZnV2O 4. Both zinc and vanadium are earth abundant, relatively economical and can offer several oxidation states, which can render a broad range of redox reactions favorable for electrochemical energy storage applications. Keeping these points in mind, we investigated for the first time the electrochemical supercapacitor performance of NHNs. The electrochemical measurements were performed in 2 M KOH solution. The measured specific capacitance of ZnV 2O4 electrode is 360 F/g at 1 A/g with good stability and retention capacity of 89% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, the hydrogen storage properties of NHNs were measured at 473, 573, and 623 K with an absorption of 1.76, 2.03, and 2.49 wt %. respectively. These studies pave the way to consider ZnV2O4 as prospective material for energy storage applications. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
