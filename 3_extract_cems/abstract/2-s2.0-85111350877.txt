Polyaniline (PANI) chains doped with very small amount of Activated Carbon (AC) as an electrode material in aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte was successfully employed in this work to enhance the electrochemical capacitive properties of PANI. The aim of this research is to improve overall specific capacitance of PANI by incorporating only minute amount of AC as a PANI dopant. There are many reports available on PANI/AC but the use of such a minute amount of AC in H2SO4 electrolyte which enhances the overall specific capacity of the composite has not been reported elsewhere. An improvement in the specific capacitance from 763.44 to 897.50 F g−1 in aqueous 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution is observed by adding mere 0.04 g of AC. It is envisaged that AC enhances SO4−2 ion transportation, forwards a stable and fast surface redox reactions, hence collectively improving the overall capacitive performance of supercapacitor electrode. The charge/discharge measurements shows that AC particles stops the PANI chains degradation during charge/discharge cycle. Also, the retention rate (54%) of PANI1.0/AC0.04 indicates approximately 11% more stability than pure PANI (43%) electrode alone. It was further observed that the electrochemical impedance parameters viz., that charge transfer resistance (Rct) (0.79 Ω), response frequency (0.26 Hz), response time (3.84 s) and knee frequency (9.16 Hz) of PANI1.0/AC0.04 electrode material shows excellent performance of the PANI doped AC. Considering its high specific capacitance, low-cost and ease of synthesis, PANI1.0/AC0.04 seems to be a promising electrode material for next generation symmetric supercapacitors.
