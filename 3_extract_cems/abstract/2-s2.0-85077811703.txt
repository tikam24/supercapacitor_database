The supercapacitors are expected to represent the future of energy storage unit equipment due to their good performance on both the energy density and the power density. This paper is the first presentation of the mathematical form of the supercapacitor, which consists of LaCoO3 nanofibers electrodes and carbon nanotube electrode (CNT) as well as the electrical and concentration channels, the dynamic model used to determine the impact of the thickness of CNT electrode on the performance of supercapacitors in COMSOL Multiphysics. The results showed that when changing the voltage scan rate from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 V/s, current and voltage increased. But the time to change the current density is reduced by a voltage scan rate of 0.001 V/s. The range of voltage changes from-0.4 to 0.4 V in the period of 1, 500 s and when adding the position of the length, the concentration will gradually decrease. The present model is conclusively verified to be effective and successfully provides a methodology to optimize the cell size in various applications.
