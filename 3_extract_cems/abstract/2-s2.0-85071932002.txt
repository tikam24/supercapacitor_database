We report for the first time that stretchable electronics systems with complex geometric constructs and multiple layers of patterns can be fabricated rapidly without the need of photolithography steps. Instead, a desktop-size vinyl cutter and a CO2 laser cutter are used as patterning tools in our proposed process. To demonstrate the capacity of our method, we fabricate within 50 minutes per device a waterproof, omnidirectionally stretchable micro-supercapacitor patch with four stacked constituent layers, each with a different pattern. This soft, compliant patch can maintain full electrochemical performances after >16 hours of immersion in water, and/or various types of extreme folding and stretching deformations.
