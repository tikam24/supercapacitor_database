In this paper, an energy regeneration during deceleration of direct torque control based induction motor drive for a heavy electric vehicle is presented. Charging and discharging of supercapacitor by bidirectional converter during acceleration and deceleration is studied. DC bus voltage observed during deceleration or braking. The energy recovered in supercapacitor in every deceleration is fed back through bidirectional converter during a transient increase of loading or during acceleration. Energy recovery during deceleration and braking makes energy efficient direct torque controlled induction motor drive.
