Enhancing the electrochemical performance while maintaining excellent mechanical properties of carbon nanofiber-based flexible electrodes remains a significant challenge, which blocks their potential application in advanced energy storage and conversion. Herein, taking advantage of the thermal stability difference between polyacrylonitrile and polypyrrolidone, we report a simple strategy to fabricate N-doped porous carbon nanofiber membranes with inter-fiber cross-linked structures via eccentric coaxial electrospinning combined with carbonization processes. During carbonization processes, the obstacles of large contact resistance are removed and sufficient contacts among electrospun nanofibers are formed, endowing the carbon nanofiber membranes with outstanding electrical conductivity (25.4 S cm−1) and flexibility in various forms. Further, NiCo2O4 nanoneedles are in-situ decorated onto the prepared carbon nanofiber membranes to construct hybrid electrodes for improving capacitance. The hybrid electrodes (NiCo2O4@NPCNFs) achieve a competitive specific capacitance (capacity) of 1474.2 F g−1 (245.4 mAh g−1) at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, as well as good rate performance (78.0% capacitance retention at a current density of 10 A g−1). In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitors exhibit a high energy density of 53.0 Wh kg−1. This study paves a promising way toward carbon nanofiber-based electrodes for application in energy storage systems.
