Supercapacitors represent one of the latest innovations in the field of electrical energy storage. The possible amount of stored energy, along with storage time is compatible with many industrial requirements. This paper explores the feasibility of application of sliding mode control technique to supercapacitors. A MATLAB SIMULINK model for supercapacitor is developed. Sizing of supercapacitor tank for a particular application is discussed. A boost converter with sliding mode control is used to achieve energy exchange between supercpacitor tank & the load.
