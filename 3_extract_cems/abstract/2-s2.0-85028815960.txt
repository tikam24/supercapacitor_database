For the low frequency vibration energy in daily environment, based on the cantilever beam piezoelectric structure with low frequency, the harvester's quasi-static vibration model was built, and corresponding simulation and experiments were conducted to verify the model. The research results show that the results of the mathematical model are in good agreement with the results of the simulation and experiments. When the structure was in a state of resonance (58.9 Hz), and the acceleration was 10 m/s2, the open circuit output voltage could reach 86.3 V and the maximum output power 27.5 mW. In addition, to solve the energy storage problem of the piezoelectric harvester, LTC3588-1 chip was used to design the energy harvesting circuit. With the energy harvesting circuit, the charging test of the super-capacitor was conducted. The results show that it takes 6 000 s for the voltage of the 0.22 F 5 V super-capacitor to rise from 0 V to 3.6 V.
