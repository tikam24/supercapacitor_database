The present work reports, direct growth of binary metal hydroxide ((Mn(OH)2)/(Co(OH)2)) nanocomposite on flexible carbon cloth substrate by a simple and affordable chemical bath deposition method. The as-prepared binder free binary metal hydroxide nanocomposite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 385 F g−1, in the symmetric two-electrode configuration in a stable potential window ranging from 0V to 1V. At a specific power of 1 kW kg −1, the supercapacitor gives a specific energy of 27 W h kg −1. The device exhibits a cycling stability of 96% even after 6000 cycles of charge-discharge at a current density of 2 A g−1. The structural and morphological analyses of the electrodes after the stability measurements, further confirm the superior electrochemical stability of the binary nanocomposite electrode. The results demonstrate the potential of Mn(OH)2/Co(OH)2 nanocomposite for energy storage applications.
