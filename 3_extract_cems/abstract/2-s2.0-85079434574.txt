In this work, we demonstrated the supercapacitor performance of pristine and composites of spinel NiCo2O4 with a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) assembled in a two-electrode cell configuration. Spinel NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4@MWCNT composites were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The supercapacitive performance of as-synthesized NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4@MWCNT fabricated on Ni-foam was studied in a 0.5M K2SO4 electrolyte using electrochemical measurement techniques. The symmetric cell configuration of NiCo2O4@MWCNT delivers high specific capacitance (374 F/g at 2 A/g) with high energy density and power density (95 Wh/kg and 3 964 W/kg, respectively) compared to that of pristine NiCo2O4 electrodes (137 F/g at 0.6 A/g). Furthermore, the energy storage performance of the asymmetric cells of NiCo2O4//MWCNT and NiCo2O4@MWCNT//MWCNT was studied to enhance cycling stability (retention of 74.85% over 3000 cycles). We have also theoretically studied the supercapacitance performance of pristine NiCo2O4 and NiCo2O4@SWCNT hybrid structures through its structural and electronic properties using density functional theory predictions. The higher specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4@SWCNT hybrid system with high power density and energy density is supported by the enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and increased quantum capacitance of the hybrid structure. We have theoretically computed the diffusion energy barrier of K+ ions of the K2SO4 electrolyte in the NiCo2O4 layer and compared it with the diffusion barrier for Na+ ions. The lesser diffusion energy barrier for K+ ions in the NiCo2O4 layer contributes toward higher energy storage capacity. Thus, owing to superior electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4 composites with MWCNTs, it can serve as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
