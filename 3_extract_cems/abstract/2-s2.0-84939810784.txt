A facile, time-saving and one-step process to prepare graphene-based materials with excellent comprehensive capacitive performance is very promising for practical applications. Here, porous nitrogen-doped graphene/carbon nanotubes composite (PNGC) with loosened structure was prepared by pyrolysis method and the porous structure of PNGC was controlled by combined action of urea and low-cost lignosulfonate. PNGC is equipped with porous structure and thin graphene nanosheets, and meanwhile possess numerous active sites and high surface areas. Importantly, PNGC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 246.6 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> and high stability of 96.5% capacitance retention ratio after 2000 cycles at 100 mV s<sup>-1</sup>, indicating an excellent performance of PNGC. Furthermore, the corresponding mechanism of pore formation in PNGC is hence proposed. This work of obtaining PNGC is of paramount importance for the future practical application of electrode materials for supercapacitor application.
