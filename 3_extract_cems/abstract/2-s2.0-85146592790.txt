Nowadays, more and more emphasis is placed on non-polluting electrical charge devices that increasingly satisfy the needs of the application. For this reason, a good part of the research focuses on the use of supercapacitors as devices for storing the electric charge and at the same time generating this charge to the system that needs a power supply. The capabilities of supercapacitors can significantly contribute to the proper functioning of the system where they are embedded and can also prolong its life given the fact that they have a very large number of charge-discharge cycles (> 100,000). Like any relatively new component, which is constantly being tested, it has also some disadvantages that the researchers in this area have tried to reduce. The materials used in the realization of supercapacitors represent the main source of influence on their operation. For example, the maximum working voltage (nominal voltage) is determined by the electrolytic decomposition voltage of the electrolyte solution. Talking about this, the paper's aim was to make and test new coin cells of supercapacitors in order to increase the maximum working voltage and capacitance per cell. We propose to use new materials that seem to bring benefits from this point of view to obtain supercapacitors that work at higher working voltages (over 3V). Thus, after testing and interpreting the obtained data, we can conclude whether the materials have been chosen according, in combination between electrode material and electrolyte solution proved to be suitable in finding a solution to this disadvantage of supercapacitors.
