Carbon has become a commercial electrode material for supercapacitors. From the viewpoint of sustainable development, biochar is a superior electrode material for supercapacitors. Therefore, the synthesis of supercapacitor layered interconnected porous carbon materials with excellent electrochemical performance from biomass solid wastes has become a research hotspot. This paper reports the preparation of sunflower straw-based porous carbon (SSPC) materials with good pore size distribution, self-doped nitrogen and oxygen, and microporous/mesoporous structure using HCOOK as a new-type activator. In the three-electrode system, the capacitance of the optimal sample SSPC600–4 was maintained at 230 F g−1 under a high current density of 100 A g−1. The symmetrical supercapacitor had the highest energy density of 25 Wh kg−1 (500 W kg−1) and excellent cycle stability (96.21% capacity after 20,000 cycles). In addition, the all-solid-state symmetrical supercapacitors showed flexibility and successfully powered five 3 V bulbs when connected in series, thus confirming their potential applications in portable and wearable devices.
