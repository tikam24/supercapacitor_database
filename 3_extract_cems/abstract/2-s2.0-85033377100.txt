Bimetallic metal sulfides have been intensely studied as electrode materials for energy storage. However, the synthesis methods are often multi-step. Herein, we proposed a simple one-step electrodeposition of nickel cobalt sulfide nanosheets on 3D Ni nanowires film. The as-synthesized Ni@Ni–Co–S was directly employed as electrode for supercapacitor. Taking advantages of 3D conductive nanostructure for Ni substrate and mesoporous nanosheets nature for active material Ni–Co–S, the as-fabricated electrode exhibits a high capacity of 392.8 C cm−3 at 0.5 A cm−3 and excellent rate capability. A hybrid supercapacitor based on Ni@Ni–Co–S positive electrode and rGO-CNTs negative electrode was fabricated for practical supercapacitor application. Our device demonstrated a high energy density of 18.4 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 254.5 mW cm−3 and excellent long term cycle performance with 90.5% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles.
