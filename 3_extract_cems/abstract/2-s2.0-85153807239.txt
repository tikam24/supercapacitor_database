In the field of energy storage devices (ESD), supercapacitor (SC) is one of the promising candidates because of its excellent properties, such as rapid charge-discharge rates, high power density, and long-term cyclic stability. In the last few decades, carbon-based materials (activated carbon (AC), carbon aerogel, carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, etc.) have been used as electrode materials in the fabrication of SC devices. These carbon-based materials show outstanding properties, such as good electrical and mechanical properties, high surface area, and unique structure. Benefiting from these excellent properties, carbon-based materials are widely used in the fabrication of SC devices for many commercial applications. Nowadays three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is being used in the field of supercapacitors (SCs). With the help of 3D-printing technology, it is very easy to fabricate SCs with proper geometry and desired shapes. Also, it is beneficial for the enhancement of energy as well as the power density of SC devices. In the present chapter, we aim to dis3D-printed carbon-based materials for the SC application. In the beginning, we discussed the 3D-printing techniques used for the fabrication of carbon-based SC electrodes. Then we have summarized the progress of 3D-printed carbon-based electrodes in the field of SCs. Lastly, we have discussed the benefits, challenges, and future perspectives of 3D-printed carbon-based materials in the field of SCs.
