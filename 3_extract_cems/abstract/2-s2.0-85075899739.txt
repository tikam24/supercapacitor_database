As the electric vehicles (EVs) inevitably operate over a wide temperature range, performance analysis and modeling of the energy storage devices (ESDs) at different temperatures are essential for the design of the energy control and management system. However, comprehensive studies of the ESDs and their suitable models over a wide temperature range are rarely reported. In this paper, three kinds of commercial ESDs including the Li(NiCoMn)O2/Graphite (NCM) battery, the LiMn2O4/Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) battery and the electrical double-layer supercapacitor are investigated. Their dynamic performances over a wide temperature range are analyzed. In order to determine the optimal mathematical models for the dynamic characteristics description, a comprehensive comparison of 13 equivalent circuit models is implemented on the ESDs. The results revealed that the performance of the NCM and LTO batteries are easily affected by temperature, while the performance of the supercapacitor is almost unaffected by temperature and maintains excellent power capability at the low temperature. For the dynamic characteristics models, the 3rd-order resistor-capacitor (RC) model with current depended factor, the 3rd-order RC model and the two-branch model outperform the other models as simulating the dynamic characteristics of the NCM battery, the LTO battery and the supercapacitor, respectively, considering the accuracy and applicability for a wide temperature range.
