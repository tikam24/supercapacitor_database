A reliable route for preparing highly crumpled nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets (C-NGNSs) with ultrahigh pore volume was developed. The unique electrochemical properties of C-NGNSs make them a promising electrode for supercapacitors with high capacity, excellent rate capability, and long-term stability.
