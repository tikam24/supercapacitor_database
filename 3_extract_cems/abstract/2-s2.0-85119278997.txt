Pyrolysis process consists of two-stages in integration aims to carbon purification, evaporates volatile compounds so that it enlarges the pore diameter, and increases the surface area of the activated carbon. This research was used Veitchia Merilli seed (VMS) waste by optimizing the stages-carbonization to obtain a high specific capacitance. Initial preparation begins with the pre-carbonization process at a temperature of 200°C, the activated carbon powder is converted into a monolith form using a Hydraulic Press and followed by a pyrolysis process in the stages-carbonization with temperature variations of 500°C, 600°C, and 700? and the stages-physical activation at temperature of 800°C. The results showed that the thermal resistance temperature of the carbon powder was 287°C. The lowest density value occurs in the VMS-600 sample of 0.591 gr/cm3and Microstructure analysis shows that the carbon electrode is amorphous which is characterized by the presence of peaks at 2θ angles around 24° and 44° with the highest Lcvalue of 15.069 nm, with the highest specific capacitance value of the supercapacitor cell of 210,442 F/g. Temperature 600°C is the optimum temperature carbonization in the process fabrication of carbon electrodes from VMS waste for supercapacitor cell application.
