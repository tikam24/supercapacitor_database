We report a rapid and efficient chemical synthesis of exfoliated graphite (EG) containing metal oxides such as manganese oxide (MnO and Mn3O4) and copper oxide (Cu2O) using microwave irradiation technique. The size of the manganese oxide particles is in the range of 50–800 nm, whereas, copper oxide is in the range of 30nm-2μm. Four types of EG materials (EG1, EG2, EG3 and EG4) were prepared to identify best electrode. Among all, EG4 electrode shows high performance for pseudocapacitors. The specific capacitance obtained was 335.9 (±12.4) F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g within a potential window of −0.3–0.8 V under aqueous 1M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. It exhibits good rate capability (76% retention when the current density increases from 0.5 to 10 A g−1), and long-term cycling stability, with 93.4% (±0.7) capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. Thus, the EG containing various metal oxides can present a promising potential candidate for pseudocapacitors and other commercial applications.
