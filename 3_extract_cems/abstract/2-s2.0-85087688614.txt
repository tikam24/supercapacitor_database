Nano sized ZnFe2O4 particles have effectively synthesized via chemical co-precipitation method. The synthesized ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles were characterized by using TG/DTA, XRD, FTIR, FETEM, VSM, and CV. The synthesized products (as-synthesized) were characterized using thermo gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA). TG curve indicate that the thermal stable phases which are attributed no weight losses occur beyond 450-900°C and the corresponding DTA graph indicate two exothermic peaks 290°C and 440°C was predicted and it was formed of the prepared ZnFe2O4 particles. X-ray diffractogram of annealed products clearly classify that the structure of single-phase nano estimated zinc ferrite structure. In accounts the crystallite size, X-ray density and lattice parameter of the measured values are tabulated. FETEM analysis revealed the spherical nature with finely dispersed in the prepared samples. M-H estimation affirms the excessively superparamagnetism conduct which was watched. CV investigation shows, upgraded explicit capacitance estimation of 212 Fg−1 was estimated in the lower filter rate. These materials suggested for super capacitor application.
