WO3 nanopowders are synthesized by solution combustion method and used as electrodes for supercapacitor. Then, the influence of glycine amount on pore structure and electrochemical performance is investigated. It is found that the spongy porous structure provides plenty of mesoporous channels for electrolyte transport, leading to better electrochemical performance. Significantly, the largest specific capacitance of 334.9 F·g−1 is achieved at 0.5 A·g−1 by the WO3 with the highest specific surface area and pore volume. Hence, the facile synthesis of nanostructured porous metal oxide electrodes open a promising mass-produced and cost-effective way towards electrochemical energy storage devices.
