The design of energy management strategy (EMS) plays a vital role in the power performance and economy of battery–ultracapacitor for electric vehicles. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based EMS is proposed to obtain an optimal power allocation strategy for battery–ultracapacitor electric vehicle, and its robustness is verified at different temperatures. First of all, the dynamic characteristic experiments of the battery and ultracapacitor were performed at 10°C, 25°C, and 40°C to obtain mechanism characteristics at different temperatures. Secondly, a genetic algorithm is selected to identify the parameters of the battery and ultracapacitor model. Next, the RL-based strategy takes the minimum energy loss of the hybrid energy storage system as the reward function and solves the optimal policy based on Markov theory. The simulation results show that the economy of the RL-based strategy correspondingly improved by 3.05%, 3.20%, and 3.15% at different temperatures in comparison with the fuzzy-based strategy, and the economic gap between the RL-based strategy and the DP-based strategy is further narrowed down to 7.30%, 3.88%, and 8.40% at different temperatures, respectively. Finally, the proposed strategy is validated under different driving conditions, which indicate that the RL-based strategy can effectively reduce energy consumption and has good robustness at different temperatures.
