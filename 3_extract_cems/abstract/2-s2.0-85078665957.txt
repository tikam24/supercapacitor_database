Conducting polymer hydrogels that are capable of contacting with electrolytes at the molecular level, represent an important electrode material. However, the fabrication of self-standing hydrogels merely composed of conducting polymers is still challenging owing to the absence of reliable methods. Herein, a novel and facile macromolecular interaction assisted route is reported to fabricate self-standing hydrogels consisting of polyaniline (PANi: providing high electrochemical activity) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT: enabling high electronic conductivity). Owing to the synergistic effect between them, the self-standing hydrogels possess good mechanical properties and electronic/electrochemical performances, making them an excellent potential electrode for solid-state energy storage devices. A proof-of-concept all-hydrogel-state supercapacitor is fabricated, which exhibits a high areal capacitance of 808.2 mF cm−2, and a high energy density of 0.63 mWh cm−3 at high power density of 28.42 mW cm−3, superior to many recently reported conducting polymer hydrogels based supercapacitors. This study demonstrates a novel promising strategy to fabricate self-standing conducting polymer hydrogels.
