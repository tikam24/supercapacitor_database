In this research, a rapid and controllable synthesis of octahedral Mn(OH)2 nanoparticles with a size range from 140 to 200 nm has been done by a sonochemial irradiation method for the energy storage applications. Transmission electron microscopic images, energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses clearly indicate the formation of octahedral Mn(OH)2 nanoparticles. Octahedral Mn(OH)2 nanoparticles were evaluated as a supercapacitor material that exhibits specific capacitance 127 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm-2 in the potential range from -0.1 to 0.8 V in 1 M Na2SO4 solution.
