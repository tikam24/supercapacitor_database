MoO3 nanoplates were prepared as anode material for aqueous supercapacitors. They can deliver a high energy density of 45 W h kg -1 at 450 W kg-1 and even maintain 29 W h kg-1 at 2 kW kg-1 in 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. These results present a new direction to explore non-carbon anode materials. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.
