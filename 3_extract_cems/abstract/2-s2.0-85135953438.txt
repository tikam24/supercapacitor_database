Recently, the demand for energy storage devices and the role of supercapacitors are increasing rapidly. Therefore, fabrication and designing of an electrode material for supercapacitor with superior performance, excellent structure, easy synthetic procedure, and highly abundant are mandatory for commercialization. In this point of view, Zinc metal-organic frameworks (Zn-MOF) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid composites with attractive wrinkled nanosheet-like topographical electrodes are fabricated with various composites of rGO by hydrothermal technique. The as-synthesized Zn-MOF-rGO nanocomposite shows wrinkled nanosheet-like structures which revealed notable supercapacitor performance. The optimized Zn-MOF-rGO20 electrode shows the highest specific capacity of 205 C·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1, as compared to Zn-MOF-rGO10 (153 C·g−1) and pure Zn-MOF (54 C·g−1) respectively. Additionally, the symmetric device of the Zn-MOF-rGO20 electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 82.5 F·g−1 and 7.1 Wh·kg−1 of energy density at 0.4 kW·kg−1 of power density. Therefore, the optimum rGO added to the Zn-MOF electrode is shown as a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
