In order to improve the capacitance performance of fibrous supercapacitors, carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers were subjected to anodizing pretreatment, metallization treatment and electrodeposition of polyaniline to obtain different electrode materials. CNT, CNT/polyaniline (CNT - PANI), CNT/ anodization/polyaniline (CNT-O- PANI), CNT/anodization/metallization/polyaniline (CNT-O-Ni-PANI) was used to assemble the fibrous supercapacitor separately, and its structure and electrochemical performance were studied. The results show that after anodic oxidation and metallization, polyaniline was uniformly and tightly dispersed on the surface of the CNT fibers, and there was no agglomeration phenominon. The supercapacitor prepared by CNT-O-Ni-PANI electrode material has excellent energy storage performance, and its specific capacitance and energy density are much higher than the other three electrode materials. At a current density of 1 A/g, its specific capacitance and energy density are 357.8 F/g and 178. 9 W Â· h/kg respectively, and at a scanning speed of 10 mV/s, its specific capacitance is as high as 1 246.3 F/g. The CNT-O-Ni-ANI supercapacitors have better stability performance, and at a current density of 5 A/g, the capacitance retention rate is still as high as 99. 7% after 10 000 constant current charge and discharge cycles.
