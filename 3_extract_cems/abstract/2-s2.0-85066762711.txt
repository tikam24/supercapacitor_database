The NiMoO4/CoMoO4 nanorod arrays wrapped by Ni-Co-S nanosheets were successfully grown on the surface of carbon cloth (NCMOS@CC) by combining of hydrothermal and electrochemical deposition methods. And the as-prepared NCMOS@CC showed good flexibility. The obtained NCMOS@CC as electrode materials were tested in a three-electrode system, showing a pretty good specific capacitance of 778.1 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent rate capability using 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. The flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (FASCs) were further fabricated using NCMOS@CC as the positive electrode and activated carbon@carbon cloth (AC@CC) as the negative electrode. The fabricated FASCs exhibited a safe working range with a potential window of 0–1.6 V with a maximum energy density of 33.1 Wh Kg−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and maximum power density of 3195 W kg−1 at 4 A g−1. The fabricated FASCs even bent at different angles still showed good flexibility and stable electrochemical properties. These performances enable the NCMOS@CC to be one of the potential flexible electrodes for using in flexible energy storage devices.
