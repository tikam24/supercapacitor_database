The electric car is now in great demand; however, the problem with them is noise in the output and large fluctuations, both of which must be resolved in the future. While hybrid electric cars provide many of the same advantages as hybrid automobiles, the key difference is that the vehicles are powered by an electric motor that is driven by an energy storage system that draws energy from batteries or the grid to supplement the primary energy source. The electric motor may also serve as a generator, converting the energy captured by the vehicle's regenerative braking system into electricity stored in the vehicle's energy storage unit. Typically, an energy conservation study of a vehicle employs a hybrid control technique that distributes the load across several operating modes, such as vehicle operation, to achieve energy saving. It is the purpose of this paper to explore the introduction of an electric vehicle (EV) design and its use in conjunction with a combined energy storage system. This article describes a novel hybrid energy storage technique for electric vehicles that will improve long-distance endurance while also lowering costs. It is proposed in this paper that an optimal control technique for a hybrid energy storage device be implemented using a dynamic constraint rule-based management of the Li-ion battery's capacity and the supercapacitor's state of charge in conjunction with an optimal control technique for a hybrid energy storage device. Because of the usage of an ANFIS controller, hybrid energy storage systems are able to provide outputs that are more precise and distortion-free.
