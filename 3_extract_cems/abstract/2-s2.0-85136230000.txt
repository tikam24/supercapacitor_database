As the biomaterial is an economical, copious, extensively available, and feasible natural source, the consequential porous activated carbons can be scientifically formed at high efficiency and at low-cost. These carbons are used for supercapacitor because of their porous structure, conductivity, and electrochemical kinetics. The preparation of aerogel strongly suggests the enhancement of macropores. Similarly, the chemical activation followed by carbonization is creating mesopores and micropores. KOH has been involved in creating more porosity for effective ion transport and introduction of oxygen functionalities into the carbon framework, further establishing the pseudocapacitance by encouraging redox reactions. In this detailed review, the synthesis of carbon-based materials such as graphene, CNT, and porous activated carbons and the way to improve the porous structure such as micropores, mesopores and macropores was considered. In addition to this, the influence of different electrolytes on porous carbon and the corresponding electrochemical parameters was discussed.
