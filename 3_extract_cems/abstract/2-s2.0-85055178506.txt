A new procedure employing infrared radiation to produce a nitrogen-containing highly porous carbon material based on polyacrylonitrile has been developed. The carbon material with a specific surface area of 1986 m2 g−1 demonstrated a specific capacitance up to 210 F g−1, which can be attributed to an electrical double-layer capacitance of about 160 F g−1 combined with a pseudo-capacitance of about 50 F g−1 associated with the redox reactions of the nitrogen-containing surface groups.
