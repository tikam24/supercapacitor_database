In this study, a method was developed for the management of marine plastic waste via the production of activated carbon. The specific surface area, micropore volume, and mesopore volume of marine-plastic-based activated carbon prepared at selected temperatures and using selected activator weight ratios were measured, and the specific capacitance and supercapacitor electrode performance were evaluated. At an activation temperature of 800 Â°C and a raw material to 8 M KOH weight ratio of 1:7, a specific capacitance of 201F/g and a high surface area of 2389 m2/g were obtained. Therefore, marine plastic waste-based activated carbon can be used as the electrode material in supercapacitors.
