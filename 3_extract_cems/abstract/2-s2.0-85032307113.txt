At the beginning of the paper, the fractional calculus is briefly presented. Then, the models of dielectric relaxation in supercapacitors are described. On the basis of the Cole-Cole model, a fractional-order model of supercapacitor impedance is formulated. The frequency characteristics of selected supercapacitors and their voltage response to a current step are assumed as a basis for the analysis of their dynamics. An example of the fractional dynamic model application was used for the critical assessment of the IEC standard recommendation on the conditions of supercapacitor capacitance measurements. The presented study shows some imperfections of the IEC standard recommendations, which probably result from the use of an inaccurate dynamics model. At the end of the paper, the authors propose a solution to this problem by changing the measurement conditions and introducing a concept of dynamic capacitance. The conclusions of the paper indicate that the models of fractional-order dynamics may be useful not only for the control purposes but also in other domains.
