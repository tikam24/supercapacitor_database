This document offered a novel construction of Au/PPy-MWCNTs/TiO2/Al2O3/p-Si/Al, which did not give in a lecture earlier. We synthesized this construction for request in manufactured electronic devices, sensors, supercapacitors, diodes, and high-energy storage devices. Remarkably tuned the dielectric constant ϵ′ and dielectric loss tangent tan δ by variable frequency, temperature, and voltage. At high frequency 2 × 107 Hz, the dielectric constant ϵ′ and dielectric loss tangent tan δ have positive and negative values from (250 to-3500), (−2 to 8). However, at all frequencies (107,106,105) Hz, the ϵ′ has high positive values (1000,3500,10000), but tan δ has low values (2.6,1.8,4.5). However, at frequencies (103,102) Hz, the ϵ′ and tanδ have positive and negative values. At a frequency of 10 Hz, the ϵ′ and tan δ have negative values only. The ϵ′ with lnf at all voltages and temperatures have negative values at high and low frequencies. In mid frequencies, the ϵ′ have positive values. Also, the Col-Col diagram and the current conduction mechanism of this construction Au/PPy-MWCNTs/TiO2/Al2O3/p-Si/Al were studied.
