In the current research a model simulating a system consisting of DC-DC converter with fuel cell and supercapacitor is presented. The model is realized in MATLAB/Simulink environment. For energy storage device a supercapacitor is used. On the base of the developed model and the control system of the energy flows, a researches related with the necessary value of the supercapacitor with the basic purpose provision of the aforetime set load profile are realized. Another essential problem of the control system of the power converter is to provide operation mode with maximal efficiency of the power source-fuel cell. This research is useful for determination of the optimal value of the energy storage device, which has significantly meaning for economically efficiency of the system for decentralized production of the electrical energy.
