This paper reports the synthesis, characterization and dual electrochemical application of a new kind of ionic liquid (IL) based polymer electrolyte. The ionic liquid 1, 2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (DMPImTFSI) and polymer Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) have been chosen for present study. The electrical conductivity measurement shows many fold enhancement of ionic conductivity by blending IL into polymer matrix. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image confirms the uniform surface morphology of the synthesized thin film and cross-section image shows the interface layer of polymer and electrode. We have fabricated an efficient dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) using IL-polymer electrolyte (optimized maximum conductivity) system which further affirms that this material is highly stable and reliable for long duration in energy devices.
