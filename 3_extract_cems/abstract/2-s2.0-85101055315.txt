In this article, we report vertically grown nanoflakes of lanthanum oxide (La2O3) and silver composited lanthanum oxide (Ag-La2O3) thin film electrodes on conducting substrate by facile and highly reproducible electrodeposition method. The material was characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectroscope, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) technique. The Ag-La2O3 electrode was used for non-enzymatic glucose detection and supercapacitor applications. Ag-La2O3 electrode exhibits sensitivity of 1677 µA mM−1 cm−2 and lower detection limit of 0.62 µM with wide linear detection range from 100 µM to 2.8 mM. The electrode shows excellent interference capability, long term stability, and reproducibility. Additionally, the electrode exhibits specific capacity of 30 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 with excellent stability of 88% over 4000 GCD cycles at current density of 0.5 A g−1. Ag composited La2O3 electrode displays enhancement in the electrocatalytic and electrochemical capacitive performance compared to La2O3 electrode.
