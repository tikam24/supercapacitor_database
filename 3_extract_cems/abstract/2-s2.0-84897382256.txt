Due to its capacity to store or supply energy with high power, the supercapacitor is becoming an attractive component. Because of the electrostatic nature of energy storage, the endurance of this component toward repetitive charge and discharge cycles is relatively high. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that cycling has an impact on the degradation of the supercapacitor and, as a result, on its lifetime. Based on accelerated cycling tests, some supercapacitors were studied using a dedicated test bench. Temperature, voltage, and current, which are the parameters that accelerate aging, are monitored. In fact, observations during the cycling tests show an important acceleration in the degradation compared with a similar static test having the same voltage and core temperature but without cycling. This paper proposes a method to quantify the acceleration of aging during a cycling phase. Â© 1982-2012 IEEE.
