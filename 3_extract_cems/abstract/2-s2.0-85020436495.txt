Solid-state supercapacitors are fabricated using transparent polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films decorated by breath figures BF, as an electrode and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-H2SO4 as an electrolyte. The holes on the surface of the transparent PMMA created by BF method have diameters of 0.5–10 μm. Graphene is deposited by spray coating using a dispersion mixture of graphene layers. The fabricated electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, charge stability and life time for evaluating their supercapacitance performance. From CV data at 5 mV/s scan rate, high specific capacitance equal to 344 for BFPMMA/G F/g and, 45 F/g for PMMA/G has been measured. By the same way, energy densities have been measured as 430 and 56.25 Wh/kg for the mentioned electrodes, respectively.
