The remarkable properties of graphene, such as its exceptional electrical conductivity and vast surface area exceeding that of carbon nanotubes, make it an attractive material for super capacitors with a 2D structure. To produce graphene, graphite was oxidized using a modified Hummers method, then reduced. The resulting graphene was subjected to tests using X-ray diffraction, SEM analysis, and cyclic voltammetry. SEM and XRD confirmed that the graphene was obtained from graphene oxide, while cyclic voltammetry revealed that the specific capacitance of graphene was higher than that of graphene oxide.
