For the realization of the miniaturized devices for flexible/wearable electronics systems in the current electronics industry; flexible, safe, and compatible energy storage devices are of great research interest. Herein, carbon cloth (CC) textile is coated by TiO2 nanofibers (NFs) through a safe and facile electrophoretic deposition (EPD) technique for flexible/wearable supercapacitor (SC) application. The modified microstructure of the flexible and binder-free electrode fabricated via EPD shows a high areal capacitance of 1651 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 current density. Moreover, the electrode shows the high cyclability with 100% capacitance retention after 15 000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2 current density, presents the ultra-high stability for the fabricated electrode. Further, a fully flexible symmetric SC device is fabricated utilizing the fabricated electrodes assembled with the gel electrolyte. The device delivers an areal capacitance of 468 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 current density with 97% capacitance retention after 30 000 successive cycles and 98% retention after 2000 bending cycles at 5 mA cm−2. Moreover, the SC device delivers the maximum areal energy density and areal power density of 0.14 mWh cm−2 and 3.6 mW cm−2, respectively.
