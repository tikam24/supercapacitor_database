In this work, a facile and cost-effective coprecipitation method was used to synthesize calcium-doped copper oxide (Ca@CuO) nanoparticles for electrochemical detection of antipsychotic drug perphenazine (PPZ) and symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) applications. Various spectroscopic techniques were employed to analyze the structural and morphological properties of Ca@CuO. The electrochemical behavior of PPZ at Ca@CuO modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) methods. The modified Ca@CuO/SPCE under optimized DPV response showed good linearity to PPZ concentrations in the range of 0.025–996.85 μM with a low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.0074 μM. Moreover, the developed sensor demonstrated good selectivity, stability, repeatability, and reproducibility. The real sample analysis of PPZ using the sensor was examined in biological samples with applicable recoveries. More interestingly, the pseudocapacitive type Ca@CuO/NF delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 314.4 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and good stability with 92.7 % retention for 5000 cycles. In addition, the fabricated Ca@CuO//Ca@CuO SSC device displayed an energy density of 11.33 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 399.8 W kg−1. According to these results, Ca-doped metal oxide can be used as an efficient electrocatalyst for sensor and supercapacitor applications.
