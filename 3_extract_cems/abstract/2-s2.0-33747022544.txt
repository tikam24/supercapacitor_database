Using the Nanostructured Origami™ 3D Fabrication and Assembly Process, 3D nanostructured devices can be made from exclusively 2D micro- and nanofabrication tools. The origami approach consists of first patterning large 2D membranes and then folding them along predefined regions to obtain the desired 3D configuration. State-of-the art nanopatterning tools can be integrated into the process, and batch-fabrication can be achieved via several actuation methods that allow automated, parallel manipulation of the 2D segments. This paper reports on the application of the origami method to the fabrication of a supercapacitor, a type of an electrochemical energy storage device. The advantages of utilizing the 3rd dimension and nanostructured surfaces in such devices will be discussed. ©2005 IEEE.
