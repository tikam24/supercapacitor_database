Abstract Nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (N-HPC) was synthesized using SiO<inf>2</inf> colloidal crystal and ionic liquids as hard template and carbon-nitrogen source. The as-synthesized carbon material features hierarchical porous structure with uniform hollow macroscopic cores and mesoporous shell. N content in N-HPC is revealed to be 6.67 wt%. The corresponding BET surface area and total pore volume are up to 695 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and 1.26 m<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. When employed as electrode material for supercapacitors, N-HPC exhibits a high capacitance of 170 F g<sup>-1</sup>.
