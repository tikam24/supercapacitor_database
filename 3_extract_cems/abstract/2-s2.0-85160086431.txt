Heavy haul railway has the characteristics of large carrying capacity, high energy consumption and low utilization rate of regenerative braking energy. In order to realize energy saving and consumption reduction of heavy-load railway, this paper analyzes the load characteristics, regenerative braking energy characteristics and power complementary relationship between adjacent traction substations based on the measured data; The comprehensive utilization technology of regenerative braking energy combining energy dispatching and energy storage between adjacent traction substations is proposed, and the corresponding power flow control strategy and converter control method are formulated. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed railway regenerative braking energy comprehensive utilization technology are verified by the test data of practical engineering applications.
