Energy storage devices (ESDs) need designing and development of high electrochemical performance and promising electrode materials. Transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are being actively investigated as the electrode for electrochemical ESDs. Herein, we report the design, synthesis, and electrochemical properties of the MnSe electrode by a facile hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized MnSe electrode has a flower-like morphology with the planes growing perpendicular to its center. The results of electrochemical performance testing indicate that the pseudocapacitive nature of the MnSe electrode has a critical effect on those properties. The MnSe electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 423.1 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and better cyclic stability among 3000 cycles. The synthesis of MnSe electrodes opens up opportunities for the design of TMCs electrode materials and the development of supercapacitors.
