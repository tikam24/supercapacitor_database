We reported a strong and cheap polymer modified Portland cement (PC) composites with interconnected pores as solid electrolyte for graphene supercapacitors. The porous polymer cement composites solved the low ionic conductivity question of construction materials. Herein, the effects of PAA molecular weight, PAA content and curing age on electrical energy storage and mechanical property were investigated in detail. The PAA (Mw = 5000)/PC-5 % sample delivers the best multifunctionality. Moreover, the as-assembled solid supercapacitor exhibits an optimum energy density of 15.93 mW h cmâˆ’2, as well as a considerable compressive strength of 16.2 MPa at 28 days. In addition, introducing PAA can result in high porosity which is conductive to ion migration. The symmetric electrode is directly loaded with GO on Ni foam by electrophoretic, followed by high temperature thermal reduction. The integrated solid supercapacitors are effective, holistic and effortless to operate at room temperature, and they exert a crucial role in energy storage field of inorganic building materials application.
