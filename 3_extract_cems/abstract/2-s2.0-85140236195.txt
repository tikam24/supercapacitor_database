Porous carbon materials was synthesized using MCM-41as template and self-N-doped porous carbon material was fabricated via a well-directed synthesized 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium triazole [Bmim]tr, an exemplary ionic liquid (IL) possessing 36.4 wt % N content and dual-aromatic anion/cation. The obtained materials had well-distributed hierarchical meso-/micro-pore structure, a large surface area (1425.6 m2 g-1), and high N content (11.29 wt%), which provided efficient electron transmission capability, thus significantly enhancing the electrochemical performance. At 1.0 A g-1, the specific capacitance from the CN900 sample achieved 376.4 F g-1. In addition, a high energy density of 13.07 Wh kg-1 at 500 W kg-1 was demonstrated. Furthermore, a high stability of more than 97.7% after 10,000 cycles was obtained. This study presents that the dual-aromatic cation/anion-based ILs with high N-content/MCM-41 template strategy is promising for the preparation of self-N-doped carbon materials for supercapacitor applications.
