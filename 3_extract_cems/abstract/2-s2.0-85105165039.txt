The fabrication and characterization of green, flexible, and ultra-thin supercapacitors that are able to operate above 1.5 V is reported, using an all-printed fabrication process. The devices are produced by aqueous spray casting of a natural-derived electrolyte ionogel composed by 2-hydroxyethyl cellulose and by the ionic liquid choline lactate, while the electrodes are composed of highly porous nanostructured carbon films deposited by supersonic cluster beam deposition (SCBD). The obtained supercapacitors (device thickness < 10 μm) are stable to bending and they possess power values up to 120 kW kg–1. The combination of aqueous spray casting and SCBD constitutes a versatile, scalable, and eco-friendly fabrication process able to directly print interconnected elements suitable for transient electronic systems.
