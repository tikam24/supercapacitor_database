Chemical reflux was used to synthesize a nanocomposite of nitrogen doped rGO and ZnCo2O4. Electrochemical reactions are significantly altered by nitrogen doping. X-ray diffraction was used to analyze the crystal structure and phase purity of the produced. N-rGO/ZnCo2O4 nanocomposite. Raman spectra's D and G bands clearly demonstrate a rise in D and a reduction in G band. ZnCo2O4 occupancy on the 2D N-rGO was investigated via SEM analysis. EDAX spectrum was used to investigate elemental compositions. Electrochemical performances of a working electrode made of GO/ZnCo2O4 and N-rGO/ZnCo2O4 were investigated. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge specific capacitances of the N-rGO/ZnCo2O4 nanocomposite are respectively 1086.1 and 950 Fg−1. After 5000 cycles, retention stability of about 89.6 % was attained. The estimated energy and power densities for N-rGO/ZnCo2O4 are 21 Whkg−1 and 1500 Wkg−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor made of N-rGO, ZnCo2O4, and N-rGO was developed, and its electrochemical characteristics were studied.
