Graphene is synthesized through chemical reduction of graphite oxide using sodium borohydride. Graphene is characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Partial reduction is observed when graphite oxide reduction is performed with NaBH 4, however, near complete reduction is observed when KOH-modified graphite oxide is used as a precursor. Specific capacitance of 120 Fg -1 is observed for graphene synthesized using KOH-modified graphite oxide with no Faradic contribution. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) reveals that graphene electrode has poor electronic conductivity, which improves upon addition of a conducting carbon in electrode formulation.
