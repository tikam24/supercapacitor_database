Compared to traditional metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks exhibit excellent properties, such as a high surface area, significant thermal stability, low density, and excellent electrochemical performance. Here, a simple process is proposed for the fabrication of rod-like vanadium metal-organic frameworks (VIV(O)(bdc), bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, or MIL-47), and the effect of the structure on the electrochemical performance is investigated via a series of electrochemical measurements. The VIV(O)(bdc) electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 572.1 F g−1 at current densities of 0.5 A g−1. More significantly, aqueous and solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors are successfully assembled. The solid-state device shows an excellent energy density of 6.72 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 70.35 mW cm−3. This superior performance confirms that VIV(O)(bdc) electrodes are promising materials for applications in supercapacitors.
