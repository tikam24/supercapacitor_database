The development of new materials with complex structures has proved to be an effective approach to improve their capabilities in a variety of applications. We present how to use the co-electrophoretic technique to decorate high electron conductive materials of copper oxide nanowire array (CuONWA) on 3D copper foam with activated carbon and Mn2O3 to form a unique structure. At a current density of 2 mA/cm2, the 3D-Cu/CuONWA/AC/Mn2O3(H) electrode has a high capacitance of 1.9 F/cm2, higher than the pure 3D-Cu/CuONWA electrode. The symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs), assembled with 3D-Cu/CuONWA/AC/Mn2O3(H) as a binder-free cathode and anode, exhibit a high energy density of 309.9 Wh/m2 and a high power density of 64.4 W/m2. After 3000 cycles, the cycle efficiency of SSCs remains 101% of the initial capacitance, showing excellent long-term cycle stability. The capacitive capacitance is dominant in the overall capacitance of the 3D-Cu/CuONWA/AC/Mn2O3(H), which could explain the SSCs’ long period stability. The enhanced abundant electroactive sites, facile electrolyte penetration into the electrode, fast electron and ion transport pathway are all factors that contribute to SSCs’ outstanding electrochemical efficiency.
