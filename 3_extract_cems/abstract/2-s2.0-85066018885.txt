Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) based on the mechanochemically prepared LiCoPO4 samples with different specific surface area and porosity as cathodes and the activated carbon (AC) Kuraray K-50 as anode were fabricated and studied. The effect of porosity and specific surface area of LiCoPO4 on its performance in HSC was investigated. The porosity was measured within the widest possible range (compared to other methods) of pore size (1–105 nm) using standard contact porosimetry (MSCP). The LiCoPO4 samples, prepared from different precursors, varied in a number of meso- and macropores and the specific surface area (13.9 m2 g−1 and 9.3 m2 g−1), while the specific surface area of AC anode was equal to 1340 m2 g−1. The capacity of the LiCoPO4 cathode with a larger specific surface area and amount of mezopores was superior. To achieve the highest specific power of the LiCoPO4/AC HSC, the active mass ratio of anode and cathode, the electrolyte composition, and the operating voltage range were optimized. As a result, the specific power of 2300 W kg−1 was achieved, which exceeds that observed earlier in the literature.
