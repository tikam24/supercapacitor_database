Scalable models generation for supercapacitor is a proper way to design, analyze and show how these supercapacitors scale up for applications which based on circuits and systems. Therefore, the primary objective of this research study was to construct a scalable models generation for supercapacitor applications by using Prony's method (ARMA modeling) using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and phase angle measurements. This research is carried out on Maxwell set of capacitors ranging from 5 to 50F. In addition, this paper includes five sections: introduction, methodology and model proposed, experimental work, results and discussions and conclusions. Finally, the error and confidence interval issues were studied and plotted to check the accuracy and validity of the system model.
