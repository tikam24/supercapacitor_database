By impregnating the cobalt nitrate Co(NO 3) 2Â·6H 2O into the pore channels of mesoporous silica MCM-41 and then calcining the obtained precursors, the Co 3O 4/MCM-41-x(x is the mass ratio of cobaltic-cobattous oxide Co 3O 4 to MCM-41)series composites are made. The X-ray diffraction, the transmission electron microscopy, the N 2 adsorption-desorption and the cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance spectroscopy are used to survey the chemical compositions, the structural characteristics and the electrochemical properties of titled materials. The results disclose that the specific surface areas and the pore volumes of materials are 280~440 m 2/g and 0.22~0.34 cm 3/g respectively. The loading of Co 3O 4, the sweep rate and the electrolyte concentration have significant influences on the electrochemical performances of the composites materials. When x is 1.6, the sweep rate is 3 mV/s, the specific capacitance of the material is 308 F/g and the electrode solution is 6 mol/L KOH, the retention rate of the specific capacitance is 91.3% after 500 continuous cycles.
