As a result of the growing demand for environmentally sustainable energy and the rapid depletion of traditional fossil fuels, significant research efforts have been directed toward developing environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage technology. A CuO-Cu2O heterostructure was effectively designed and synthesised using a simple chemical method and characterised by various techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) systems, the supercapacitance behaviour of electrodes coated with CuO-Cu2O was investigated. As a result, at 2 M KOH, the electrochemical supercapacitance of the CuO-Cu2O modified electrode may obtain the highest specific capacitance value of 780 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The CuO-Cu2O modified electrode was shown to be highly stable for 2000 cycles at 2 A/g, which is significantly more stable than stability of other prepared electrodes.
