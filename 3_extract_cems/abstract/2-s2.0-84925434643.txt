A novel composite with imine-linked covalent organic frameworks on graphene was synthesized in one step with the amine functionalized reduced graphene oxide as the support. The excellent electrochemical properties of this composite can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the introduction of covalent organic frameworks as well-dispersed nanoscale deposits on the conductive graphene surfaces.
