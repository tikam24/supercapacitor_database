To develop a promising electrode candidate for high-performance supercapacitors, a novel 3D ternary composite, graphene-Fe3O4-polyaniline (rGO/Fe3O4/PANI), was designed and developed via in-situ hydrothermal polymerization methods. After its structure and performances were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), the electrochemical enhanced mechanisms for supercapacitor electrodes were explored carefully. By virtue of the excellent synergistic effect among Fe3O4, PANI and rGO, the electrochemical properties of rGO/Fe3O4/PANI-based electrode for supercapacitor were improved greatly. The specific capacitance increased from 299.1 Fg−1 for PANI, to 371.1 Fg−1 for rGO/PANI and further to 486.5 Fg−1 for rGO/Fe3O4/PANI. Importantly, even after 2000 cycles, the retention ratio could still keep 52.1% for rGO/Fe3O4/PANI comparing with 38.9% for PANI.
