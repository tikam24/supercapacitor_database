Iron and nitrogen co-doped two-dimensional (2D) porous carbon-flakes have been fabricated by using foam-like Medulla stachyuri (MS, the stem pith of tetrapanax papyrifer) as both carbon precursor and template and ammonium ferric citrate as iron and nitrogen precursor. The ammonium ferric citrate-impregnated foams are subsequently converted into iron and nitrogen co-doped 2D porous carbon-flakes by pyrolysis at high temperature in an inert atmosphere. The porous carbon-flakes fabricated at 900 °C (MS-Fe-900) possess high surface area (1140.9 m2 g−1) and effective Fe/N co-doping (0.22 at.% Fe and 2.02 at.% N). In comparison with Pt/C, MS-Fe-900 exhibits superior ORR activity (E0 = 968 mV; E1/2 = 830 mV vs RHE), preferable methanol/CO tolerance and better stability. Furthermore, the MS-Fe-900-based electrode presents high-rate performance (80.1% capacitance retention from 1 to 100 A g−1), and good cycling stability for over 10000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work takes full advantage of the unique structure of biomass and provides a feasible approach to develop cost-efficient and high performance activated carbon materials for ORR electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.
