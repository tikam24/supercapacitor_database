Cost-effective synthesis of carbon nanospheres with a desirable mesoporous network for diversified energy storage applications remains a challenge. Herein, a direct templating strategy is developed to fabricate monodispersed N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres (NMCSs) with an average particle size of 100 nm, a pore diameter of 4 nm, and a specific area of 1093 m2 g−1. Hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and tetraethyl orthosilicate not only play key roles in the evolution of mesopores but also guide the assembly of phenolic resins to generate carbon nanospheres. Benefiting from the high surface area and optimum mesopore structure, NMCSs deliver a large specific capacitance up to 433 F g−1 in 1 m H2SO4. The NMCS electrodes–based symmetric sandwich supercapacitor has an output voltage of 1.4 V in polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 gel electrolyte and delivers an energy density of 10.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 14014.5 W kg−1. Notably, NMCSs can be directly applied through the mask-assisted casting technique by a doctor blade to fabricate micro-supercapacitors. The micro-supercapacitors exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility, long-term stability, and reliable power output.
