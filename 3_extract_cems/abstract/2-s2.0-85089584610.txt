Herein, homogeneously dispersed Pt and MnO2 nanoparticles were anchored to single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) to obtain an efficient electrode material for supercapacitors. XPS and TEM analysis of the Pt/MnO2@SWCNH surface morphology confirms that the SWCNHs exhibit a dahlialike cluster structure with Pt/MnO2 nanoparticles embedded in the interstices of the SWCNH horn structure to form a three-dimensional conductive network. This structure not only improves the overall conductivity of the composite but also provides more electron transfer pathways for the MnO2 nanoparticles. Accordingly the as-prepared Pt/MnO2@SWCNH composite displays a high specific capacitance (314.5 F/g at 1 A/g), good cycling stability (86.89% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g), and remarkable rate performance (254.8 F/g at 10 A/g). Among reported composites of metal oxides, precious metals, and carbon materials, the prepared Pt/MnO2@SWCNH composite has outstanding electrical properties and is a highly promising candidate as supercapacitor.
