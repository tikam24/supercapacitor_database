The energy management is one of the most important issues for the efficiency and performance of the hybrid vehicular power system, including the Lithium-ion battery and Ultra-Capacitor. This paper deals with a dynamic programming based optimal control strategy proposed for the hybrid vehicular power system. The proposed method utilizes the capability of dynamic programming to treat the global optimization problem. Within the optimization process, the total energy consumption is the optimization target and the state of charge of ultra-capacitor is the state variable. When compared to the single energy system, the energy consumption of the hybrid energy system with dynamic programming can reduce 2.5% and the high instantaneous power is allocated to ultra-capacitor, which can reduce the damage to Lithium-ion battery. This paper proves that the dynamic programming algorithm can be applied to the hybrid energy system and presents a rather well performance.
