Single-crystal α-MnO2 ultralong nanowires (∼40 μm in length, ∼15 nm in diameter), which were synthesized by a simple polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) assisted hydrothermal route, exhibited a better electrical conductivity, a highest specific capacitance of 345 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 with high rate capability (54.7% at 10 A g-1) and good cycling stability. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.
