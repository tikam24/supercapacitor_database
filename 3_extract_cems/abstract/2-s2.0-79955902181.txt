Polyaniline (PANI)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite electrode material was prepared by in situ chemical polymerization. The structure and morphology of PANI/CNTs composite are characterized by Fourier infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscopy. It has been found that a flocculent PANI was uniformly deposited on the surface of CNTs. The supercapacitive behaviors of the PANI/CNTs composite materials are investigated with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, impedance, and cycle life measurements. The results show that the PANI/CNTs composite electrodes have higher specific capacitances than CNT electrodes and better stability than the conducting polymers. The capacitance of PANI/CNTs composite electrode is as high as 837.6 F g -1 measured by cyclic voltammetry at 1 mV s -1. Besides, the capacitance retention of coin supercapacitors remained 68.0% after 3,000 cycles. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.
