The development of electrode materials for supercapacitors is a significant issue for future energy storage devices. In addition, the selective oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides that serve as key intermediates for synthesizing medically and chemically active molecules is still a critical challenge. In this study, two novel 3D POM-based metal-organic frameworks, formulated as [Cu3(bty)3][BW12O40]·4H2O (1) and [Cu2.5(bty)5][BW12O40]·7H2O (2) (bty = bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)ethane), were obtained via a one-step synthesis strategy by adjusting the pH value under solvothermal conditions. In compound 1, {BW12} as a 2-connected node is located between 2D Cu-organic sheets to yield a novel 3D POM-based metal-organic framework. There are 1D channel structures constructed with Cu-organic sheets in compound 2. Then, {BW12} as a 4-connected node merged into the orifice of the Cu-organic framework forming a glamorous 3D framework. Moreover, the 3D Cu-organic framework of 2 displays the fascinating shape of vase structures. These two compounds could be applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors with specific capacitances of 214.59 F g−1 and 189.17 F g−1 at 0.48 A g−1 respectively, as well as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for selective oxidation of sulfides to their corresponding sulfoxides.
