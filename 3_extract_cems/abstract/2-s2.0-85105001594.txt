Black phosphorus with a long history of âˆ¼100 years has recently attracted extraordinary attention and has become a promising candidate for energy storage and conversion owing to its unique layered structure, impressive carrier mobility, remarkable in-plane anisotropic properties, and tunable bandgap from 0.3 eV in the bulk to 2.0 eV in the monolayer. Aiming to fully dredge its potential utilization, several investigations are being carried out, from its intrinsic properties to energy-driven charge transfer behavior. This review specifically highlights the very recent progress in the synthesis and applications of black phosphorus in the energy process, including secondary battery system, supercapacitor device, and catalysis reaction. The present critical issues, challenges, and perspectives in terms of well-harnessed scalability, quality, and stability are comprehensively covered. An in-depth understanding of these aspects is of great importance for the design of black phosphorus as a multifunctional candidate in future energy storage and conversion.
