CuS nanoparticles (CuS NPs) and CuS-coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CuS/MWCNT) are synthesized under ambient conditions. By comparing their supercapacitive performance in 6 M NaOH and 1 M Na2SO4, it is discovered that CuS NPs and CuS/MWCNT exhibit terrible cyclic stability in 6 M NaOH due to the conversion of CuS to Cu(OH)2 during the GCD process. However, in 1 M Na2SO4, both CuS NPs and CuS/MWCNT show high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability.
