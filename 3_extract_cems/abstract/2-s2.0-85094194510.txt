Nanosized NiO, NiO/CuO-0.3, NiO/GO-30 and NiO/CuO-0.3/GO-30 composites were synthesized by a solvothermal method with ethanol as solvent, ammonia as precipitant, and P123 as surfactant. The morphology and the phase were characterized by TEM and XRD. The electrochemical properties were measured by a three electrode system. Experiments results showed that the crystallinity and grain size of NiO were reduced, while the specific capacitance was remarkably improved after composite with CuO or GO. The specific capacitance of NiO/CuO-0.3/GO-30 was 1451F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, which was 2.77 times of NiO. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention of NiO/CuO-0.3/GO-30 was 82.95% of its initial value, which was 1.07 times of NiO.
