Exploitation of NiCo2O4-based novel composite electrode materials with enhanced comprehensive properties is essential for high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets wrapped carbon nanoplates (NiCo2O4@CNPs) are fabricated by co-precipitation method and subsequent thermal annealing treatment. Characterization results indicate that 2D leaf-like NiCo2O4@CNPs is synthesized and NiCo2O4 nanosheets with thickness of 4 nm are tightly wrapped on CNPs. The NiCo2O4@CNPs is possessed of enhanced electrochemical properties in comparison to bare CNPs, bare NiCo2O4 and other NiCo2O4-based materials reported in literatures. The NiCo2O4@CNPs electrode shows higher specific capacitance (1265 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and remarkable rate capability. Furthermore, the NiCo2O4@CNPs electrode has excellent cycling stability, and 97.3% of the initial specific capacitance still remains after 2000 cycles. Reasons for the enhanced electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4@CNPs were analyzed. In addition, the supercapacitor of NiCo2O4@CNPs//NiCo2O4@CNPs displays a high energy density of 32.4 Wh kg−1 at 435 W kg−1 and a high power density of 8676 W kg−1 at 14.4 Wh kg−1. The above results manifested that NiCo2O4@CNPs is an potential electrode material for fabricating high-performance supercapacitor.
