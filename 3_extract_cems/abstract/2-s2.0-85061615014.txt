Li-ion capacitors (LICs) combine the merits of supercapacitors and batteries, which are usually fabricated by battery-type anode and supercapacitor-type cathode. The main challenge for LICs is to make kinetics balance between anode and cathode. Herein, we created a LIC based on superabsorbent polymer salt-derived carbon-based nanomaterials. By annealing the Mn 2+ adsorbed polymer salt precursor, the obtained MnO/C anode with a high specific surface area of 762 m 2 g −1 displays a high capacity of 540 mAh g −1 at 0.1 A g −1 and an excellent capacity retention of 80% after 500 cycles. The hierarchical porous carbon cathode is generated by the combined carbonization and KOH activation techniques, which exhibits an excellent capacitive storage performance. After well-matched capacity and kinetic behavior in both anode and cathode, the LIC possesses a high energy density of 97.3 Wh kg −1 and a superior cycle life with 80% capacity retention after 10000 cycles. This work gives a case study to fabricate high-performance energy storage devices by using environmentally friendly electrodes.
