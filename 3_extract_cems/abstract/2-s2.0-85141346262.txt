The modeling and simulation of both regenerative braking including a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drivetrain for electric vehicle (EV) purposes and fault-tolerant analysis are discussed in this article. The concept for electric brake controls of such a PMSM drive system with field-oriented control (FOC) is first investigated. After that, the optimum regenerative braking torque in the recovery configuration and the braking torque for the greatest recovery power is estimated. The combination of ultra-capacitors (UCs) modules with the batteries provides fast and scalable power transmission during regenerative braking mode. This became critical to regulating the power transfer towards the DC-link since it's a critical problem that impacts the complete performance of a system. Lastly, for a PMSM linked with an electric motor as the load, the quantities of kinetic energy which can be saved and also the performance with which it will be restored to the UCs and batteries are investigated. In addition, fault-tolerant methods for a three-phase PMSM with separate motor windings and independent voltage source inverters (VSI) are demonstrated in this work.
