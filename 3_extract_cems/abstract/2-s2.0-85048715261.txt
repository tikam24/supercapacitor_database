A simple chemical precipitation method is applied to synthesize pure-phase KCoF3 with size in the range of 1–5 μm, which is further used as electrode material in supercapacitors. The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test measurements are carried out for the KCoF3 electrode, and the results show a specific capacitance of 286 F⋅g−1 at 0.5 A⋅g−1 in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. Particularly, KCoF3 electrode exhibits long cycling lifetime with 96% retention of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5.0 A⋅g−1.
