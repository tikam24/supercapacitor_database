Electrode materials having high capacitance with outstanding stability are the critical issues for the development of flexible supercapacitors (SCs), which have recently received increasing attention. To meet these demands, coating of CeO 2 nanoparticles have been performed onto MWCNTs by using facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The formed CeO 2 /MWCNTs nanocomposite exhibits excellent electrochemical specific capacitance of 1215.7 F/g with 92.3% remarkable cyclic stability at 10000 cycles. Light-weight flexible symmetric solid-state supercapacitor (FSSC) device have been engineered by sandwiching PVA-LiClO 4 gel between two CeO 2 /MWCNTs electrodes which exhibit an excellent supercapacitive performance owing to the integration of pseudocapacitive CeO 2 nanoparticles onto electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) behaved MWCNTs complex web-like structure. Remarkable specific capacitance of 486.5 F/g with much higher energy density of 85.7 Wh/kg shows the inherent potential of the fabricated device. Moreover, the low internal resistance adds exceptional stability along with unperturbed behavior even under high mechanical stress which can explore its applicability towards high-performance flexible supercapacitor for advanced portable electronic devices.
