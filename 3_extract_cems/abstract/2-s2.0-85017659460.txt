A simple and one-step solvothermal synthesis method has been developed to prepare two-dimensional (2-D) hydrohausmannite ((Mn 4-2x Mn x )Mn 8 O 16-x (OH) x ) nanoplates with radial length of 300 nm and thickness of about 25 nm in a binary ethanediamine/water solvent system. The formation mechanism of hydrohausmannite is suggested. As an anode material for electrochemical capacitors, the plate-shaped hydrohausmannite not only displays a high specific capacity (215 at 0.1 A g âˆ’1 ) and good rate capability, but also shows good stable performance along with 94% specific capacity retained after 3000 cycle tests. The method can be easily controlled and expected to be applicable for the large-scale preparation of the 2-D hydrohausmannite.
