Graphene doped carbon nanotubes for high-energy supercapacitors A supercapacitor is an electrochemical capacitor with a relatively high energy density and is characterized by fast discharge rates and low maintenance. These characteristics have already been explored in various applications such as consumer electronics, wind energy system, smart grid applications and electric vehicles. The primary purpose behind the burgeoning effort in supercapacitor research is to achieve greater energy densities at a lower cost. Vertical carbon nanotube (CNT) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor production with a superior conductivity, large voltage window of stability, high surface area, steady mechanical strength and low cost. Capacitance values up to 135 F/g were reported with multi-walled carbon nanotubes. However, the relatively small inherent capacitance of CNTs confines their use to supercapcitor applications. In this study, using different methods, graphite will be doped into CNT walls to improve its capacitance. The doped CNTs will then be used in supercapacitor electrode applications and their performance tested in order to find a suitable method of improving overall capacitance. 200 F/g capacitance is expected after the optimization of doping materials and doping methods.
