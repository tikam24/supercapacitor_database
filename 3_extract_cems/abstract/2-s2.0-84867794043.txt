All-solid-state flexible supercapacitors based on a carbon/MnO 2 (C/M) core-shell fiber structure were fabricated with high electrochemical performance such as high rate capability with a scan rate up to 20 V s -1, high volume capacitance of 2.5 F cm -3, and an energy density of 2.2 × 10 -4 Wh cm -3. By integrating with a triboelectric generator, supercapacitors could be charged and power commercial electronic devices, such as a liquid crystal display or a light-emitting-diode, demonstrating feasibility as an efficient storage component and self-powered micro/nanosystems. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
