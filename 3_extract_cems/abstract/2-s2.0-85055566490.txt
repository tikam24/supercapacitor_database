This paper intends to explore the bidirectional DC/DC converter concept and super capacitor which are used in conversion of the kinetic energy in moving vehicles during braking into electrical energy and can be used again during the acceleration of a car. Three modes of Electrical Vehicle (EV) are examined. Power balance is guaranteed under fluctuations or ups and downs in load values. Implementation is carried out by MATLAB /Simulink software to show the feasibility of the presented control strategy. The simulation results indicate the amalgamation of the of bi-directional converters and assortment super capacitor show that the imposed cost of electrical energy generation can be decreased significantly by the proposed method, at the same time satisfaction of the EV user is also taken into account.
