Interconnected mesoporous carbon sheets (MCSs) were prepared from cheap coal tar pitch with low-cost CaCO<inf>3</inf> nanoparticles and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as porogens for supercapacitors. The results show that the surface area of MCSs can be tuned in the range of 87-167 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The interconnected MCS<inf>2-1-1</inf> made at 2:1:1 of CaCO<inf>3</inf>/coal tar pitch/CTAB mass ratio retains a capacitance of 87 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 A g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles in ionic liquid electrolyte with high retention of 93.1%, showing excellent cycle stability. The energy density of MCS<inf>2-1-1</inf> capacitor only drops from 64.18 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> to 22.19 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> with the average power density increasing from 115 W kg<sup>-1</sup> to 4267 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, demonstrating good rate performance. This work suggests a low-cost way to synthesize high performance MCS for energy storage materials.
