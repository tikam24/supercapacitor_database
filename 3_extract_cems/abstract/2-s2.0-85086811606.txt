The advanced carbon materials are desirable to possess outstanding performances in both aqueous and non-aqueous supercapacitors. Unfortunately, this pursuit often flaws owing to the intrinsically different electrical-double-layer mechanisms and the conflicting properties of targeting electrode materials. Herein, by the simultaneous manipulation of lignin structure and thermal retention stages during potassium hydroxide activation, the three dimensionally porous carbon derived from lignin with high molecular weight and graphene-like carbon sheets composed of lignin with low molecular weight were obtained. Correspondingly, due to the high specific surface area, abundant micropores, heteroatom-introduced wettability and pesudocapacitance, the 3D oriented porous carbon exhibited a remarkable capacitance in the aqueous electrolyte of 6 mol L-1 KOH. By contrast, the graphene-like carbon sheets showed the outstanding performance in the non-aqueous electrolyte of ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) by featuring a high electrical conductivity, a wide working potential and a prominent capacitance. This work not only successfully synthesizes carbon materials for different electrolytes from one biomass precursor, but also extends the exploration of bio-carbons with the inspiring formation mechanisms.
