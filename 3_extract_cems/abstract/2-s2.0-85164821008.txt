The paper presents modern technologies of electrochemical energy storage. The classification of these technologies and detailed solutions for batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors are presented. For each of the considered electrochemical energy storage technologies, the structure and principle of operation are described, and the basic constructions are characterized. Values of the parameters characterizing individual technologies are compared and typical applications of each of them are indicated. Selected characteristics illustrating properties of the presented electrochemical energy storage devices are also shown. The advantages and disadvantages of the considered electrochemical energy storage devices and typical areas of their application are indicated. In addition, new, constantly developing technologies, not yet commercially available, are mentioned. Examples of existing energy storage solutions using the discussed technologies on the example of electric cars or storage systems in the world are given.
