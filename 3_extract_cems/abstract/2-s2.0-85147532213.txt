La2O3/MnO2 (La–Mn) nanocomposites were achieved via using KMnO4 and LaCl2 as starting materials in an aqueous solution followed by hydrothermal and high-temperature treatment processes. The microstructure and chemical composition of as-prepared La–Mn composites were characterized by a series of techniques such as XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS and BET. The results show that the pure La2O3 microspheres were covered with its large amount of well-ordered nanorods, and MnO2 was distributed evenly on La2O3 surface to constitute La–Mn composites. Meanwhile, the electrochemical tests reveal that sample Mn–La exhibited the highest specific capacitance (Cm) of 1231 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1, good rate performance and excellent cycling stability (98.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at current density of 1 Ag−1). Such nanostructures endow the electrodes with short electrons, ion diffusion paths, and abundant charge adsorption sites. Excellent cycle performance is demonstrated by the built MnO2/La2O3//AC asymmetric cell, which has a high energy density of 44.1 WhKg−1 and power density of 701 WKg−1 at 1 Ag−1. Because of this, the resulting supercapacitors may prove useful in the development of devices with high energy and power densities.
