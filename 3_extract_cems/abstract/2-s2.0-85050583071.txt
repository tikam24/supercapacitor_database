In this paper, a multiport bidirectional DC-DC converter for hybrid Microgrid applications is proposed. The converter structure has N unidirectional ports and three bidirectional ports. The proposed converter is capable of hybridizing of power source, PV system, battery and ultra-capacitors. In this structure, the power can be delivered to load by either from one input or simultaneously from all the inputs. Depending on the charge and discharge of battery and ultra capacitor, the converter can be operated in three modes. For all three operating modes, converter operation and dynamic analysis is performed. For the control system design, small signal modeling of the converter is performed. The proposed converter has high gain in all operating modes. The proposed converter is modeled in MATLAB/SIMULINK. To validate the simulation and theoretical analysis, a hardware prototype of 500 W is developed using dSPACE DS1104 hardware in the loop controller.
