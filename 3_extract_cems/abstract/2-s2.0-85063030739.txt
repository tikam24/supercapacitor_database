Supercapacitor is a new energy storage device between traditional capacitor and rechargeable battery. Not only has the characteristics of fast charging and discharging of capacitor, but also has the characteristics of energy storage of battery. The electrochemical tests indicate that the electrode in view of porous Ni2P2O7 nanowires (NWs) has a specific capacitance of 772.5 Fg-1 at current density 1 Ag-1. Furthermore, porous Ni2P2O7 NWs have been successfully applied to construct all-solid hybrid supercapacitors. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) and easily treated nickel pyrophosphate (Ni2P2O7) are considered as electrode materials for supercapacitors under alkaline conditions. The equipment has a high energy density of 6.25 mWh cmâˆ’2 and good cycle stability of 94% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles, which identifies that porous Ni2P2O7 nanowires are promising supercapacitor active materials.
