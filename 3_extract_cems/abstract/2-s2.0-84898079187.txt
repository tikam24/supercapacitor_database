A high-performance supercapacitor electrode based on unique 1D Co-Ni/Co3O4-NiO core/shell nano-heterostructures is designed and fabricated. The nano-heterostructures exhibit high specific capacitance (2013 F g-1 at 2.5 A g-1), high energy and power density (23Wh kg-1 and 5.5kW kg-1, at the discharge current density of 20.8 A g-1), good capacitance retention and long cyclicality. The remarkable electrochemical property of the large surface area nano-heterostructures is demonstrated based on the effective nano-architectural design of the electrode with the coexistence of the two highly redox active materials at the surface supported by highly conducting metal alloy channel at the core for faster charge transport.
