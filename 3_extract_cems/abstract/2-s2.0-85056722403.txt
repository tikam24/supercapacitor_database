Supercapacitor have attracted much attention due to its fast power supply, long cycle life, simple principle, etc. Supercapacitors are widely used in consumer electronics. Activated carbon is a typical material for electric double layer capacitor. Here, we study the electrochemical performance of an activated carbon (TF-B520) bulky paper electrode made by vacuum filtration method. Cyclic Voltammetry and Constant Current Charge/Discharge were used to test the electrode capacitance and the rate performance. The results showing that TF-B520 activated carbon balky paper electrodes have the highest capacitance of 120F/g at scan rate 1mV/s and good capacitor behaviour at scan rate below 20mV/s and current density below 250mA/g.
