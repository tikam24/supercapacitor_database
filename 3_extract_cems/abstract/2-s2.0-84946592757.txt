The application of graphene (RGO)-based composites as electrode materials in supercapacitors can be limited by the fabrication complexity and costs, and the non-environmentally friendly nature of the production process. This study examined the effectiveness of a highly conductive graphene material (RGOHI-AcOH) compared to the hydrazine-produced RGO and graphene nanoparticle composite (RGO/Ni) materials on a carbon cloth substrate in supercapacitors. The composites were synthesized at different mass ratios (1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 10:1 and 1:2) of RGO to Ni nanoparticles. All synthesized samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The methylene blue method was used for determining the specific surface area. The RGOHI-AcOH electrode exhibited a higher electrochemical performance (40 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1 and 70 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) and stability (âˆ¼94%) than the other electrodes examined. Among the prepared composites, the composite with a RGO to Ni nanoparticle mass ratio of 1:1 showed a better electrochemical performance (30 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1, and 27 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) than the hydrazine-produced RGO and the other composite electrodes. Overall, RGOHI-AcOH as a first priority electrode material (particularly, coated on a carbon cloth substrate) has potential applications in energy storage devices.
