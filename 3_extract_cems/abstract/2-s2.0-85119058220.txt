Supercapacitors have many advantages that electrostatic capacitors and batteries do not such as fast charge and discharge speed, high efficiency, long cycle life, wide operating temperature range, and good reliability. In recent years, they have become a research hotspot in the field of electrochemical energy storage. Supercapacitors have been successfully applied in many fields. Such as: acting as a backup power supply for electronic products such as memory, computers, timers, used in electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles, used as auxiliary power supplies for solar and wind power generation devices, and can also be used in military, aerospace and other fields.
