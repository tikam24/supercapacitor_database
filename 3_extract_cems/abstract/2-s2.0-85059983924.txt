The paper presents investigation of resonant converters operating to a common load. The parallel stages are realized on the base of resonant inverters with reverse diodes and clamped resonant tank capacitor voltage. The matching converter between the modules and the load is a multi-phase rectifier. The investigation is performed for imbalanced topology operation due to asymmetry in the supply voltages. The mutual influence between the separate stages is presented. The parallel operation is considered for charging of a supercapacitor battery pack. The basic conduction circuits are pointed. The obtained dependencies are presented with graphics.
