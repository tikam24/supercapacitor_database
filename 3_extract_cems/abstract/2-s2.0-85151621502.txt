As the electric vehicle market is booming around the world, energy storage systems with proper power output are the need of the hour. Supercapacitors with relatively high power output are naturally a superior choice. Even though supercapacitor is a good choice, its sustainability remains a point of concern. In this chapter, an introduction to different electrolytes and electrode materials used in current supercapacitor technologies will be discussed in detail. This chapter mainly focuses on the power output, cyclic stability, cost analysis, environmental and social impact of the current state of the art of supercapacitor technologies. Finally, the future of supercapacitor technology is discussed and suggestions to develop cost-effective, echo friendly, and high-performance supercapacitors are included.
