A new type of ternary carbon nanotube fiber (CNF)/three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/polyaniline (PANI) electrodes with a double core-sheathed architecture composed of CNF/CNTs and CNTs/PANI was fabricated via low-potential electrophoretic deposition of CNTs and subsequent electrochemical polymerization of PANI on the CNF surface. The resulting all-solid-state supercapacitor possesses a high specific capacitance of 67.31 mF cm−2 at the current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and only a loss as less as 10% of its initial specific capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, it is capable of withstanding different bending deformations, and can maintain 99.8% capacitance, even after experiencing the bending of 180° for 500 times, which manifests a significant application potential in the field of flexible electronic devices.
