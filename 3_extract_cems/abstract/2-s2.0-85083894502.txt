Porous SiO2-Carbon composites with excellent electrochemical performance were fabricated from liquefied bio-based sawdust via a simple in situ doping approach. Morphologies and pore textures of the samples were controlled effectively by doping with SiO2 and optimizing carbonization temperature. The morphologies of SiO2-Carbon composites from carbonization between 700–900 °C changed from bump-like to coral-like, to a network-like structure, and the pore textures changed from a disordered to an ordered structure. Benefitting from specific morphologies and pore textures, the large specific surface areas (538-780 m2/g) of the SiO2-Carbon composites exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Remarkably, the reticular-like SiO2-Carbon composites with an ordered porous structure at carbonization 900 °C revealed a high specific capacitance (260 F/g), energy density (23.1 wh/kg) and power density (640 w/kg) at a current density of 1.6 A/g in 1 M KOH electrolyte, as well as a good rate performance and stability (with capacitance retention above 97 % after 5000 cycles). Especially, the capacitance is around 1.4 times and 1.3 times higher than that of the undoped carbon and SiO2-Carbon carbonized at 700 °C, respectively. The results indicate that SiO2-Carbon composites should be a promising candidate for capacitive application, and the excellent capacitance is attributed to the contribution of pseudo-capacitance from the SiO2 doping and double layer capacitance from the special pore textures. This work provides a simple way for full utilization of biomass waste for supercapacitor material.
