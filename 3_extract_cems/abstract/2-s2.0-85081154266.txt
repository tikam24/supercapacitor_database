Wireless power transfer system based on magnetic coupling resonance has attracted more and more attention in the field of electric vehicle charging. As one of the four basic compensation topologies, the series-series compensation topology has the simplest structure and is suitable for the application of battery and supercapacitor as charging load, because the output current is not affected by the load. However, this topology still has some natural drawbacks, for example, the primary-side of the serial-serial compensation topology cannot work independently. When the secondary-side is open or the external force is missing, the primary-side device will be damaged. In this paper, a design method of protection circuit to prevent secondary-side open is proposed, three protection ways are designed according to the priority of action, and the feasibility of the protection circuit is verified by simulation and experiment, which provide practical basis for the application of series-series compensation topology in the field of wireless charging of electric vehicles.
