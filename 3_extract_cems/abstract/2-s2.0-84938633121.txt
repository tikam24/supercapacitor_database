Three dimensional (3D) hierarchical network configurations are composed of NiCo2S4 nanotube @Ni-Mn layered double hydroxide (LDH) arrays in situ grown on graphene sponge. The 3D graphene sponge with robust hierarchical porosity suitable for as a basal growth has been obtained from a colloidal dispersion of graphene oxide using a simple directional freeze-drying technique. The high conductive NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays grown on 3D graphene shows excellent pseudocapacity and good conductive support for high-performance Ni-Mn LDH. The 3D NiCo2S4@Ni-Mn LDH/GS shows a high specific capacitance (Csp) 1740 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2, even at 10 mA cm-2, 1267.9 mF cm-2 maintained. This high-performance composite electrode proposes a new and feasible general pathway as 3D electrode configuration for energy storage devices. (Figure Presented).
