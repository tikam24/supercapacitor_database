Solar photovoltaics (PVs) are increasingly penetrating remote are a power systems. However, the adverse effect of pulse power loads and fluctuating PV power brings severe grid instability. Therefore, an effort is made to propose a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that encompasses hydrogen/bromine redox flow battery (RFB) and supercapacitor (SC) for grid-integrated PV systems to facilitate high energy and power support. Furthermore, the system is equipped with an antiwindup mixed-order generalized integrator (AWMOGI), an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) tuned tilt integral-derivative with filter (TIDF) controller, and a fast-acting adaptive dc-link power-based energy management control. AWMOGI extracts fundamental components of grid voltage and is immune to noise and grid disturbances. The ISSA-tuned TIDF controller has better error mitigation ability and quickly settles the actual signal to the reference for dc-link voltage control of the voltage-source inverter, PV maximum power point tracking, and HESS control that improves the overall system dynamics. The energy management system coordinates RFB and SC participation in handling sudden and average changes in power surges resulting in the first dc-link voltage regulation and less current stress on RFB. The proposed system and furnished control effectiveness are confirmed through MATLAB simulation and OPAL-RT real-time simulator test bench.
