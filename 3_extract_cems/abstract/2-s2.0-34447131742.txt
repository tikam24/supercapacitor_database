MHD generation is a direct generation of power, and it is a feasible high power microsecond pulse source. Supercapacitor is a new high power device. This paper propose a new method of using supercapacitor substitute high voltage pulse capacitor as energy storage device setting up high pulse magnetic field in the design of Explosively-driven MHD Generator; In the paper it gives the supercapacitor equivalent circuit model in the high pulse discharging application based on physical reasoning, the equivalent circuit model consists of R-C-L three elements, and at the same time the paper establishes the supercapacitor bank equivalent circuit in the high pulse discharging loop. It also gives the rules to calculate the size of supercapacitor bank, and proposes a management rules including charging method, voltage balancing device and temperature management for the supercapacitor energy storage system. According to the model and design that is given above, the supercapacitor bank discharging circuit is analyzed and calculated when the circuit belongs to oscillating and non-oscillating process respectively. At last, the discharging current of simulation between the high voltage pulse capacitor and supercapacitor is compared, and the simulation results shows that supercapacitor bank not only has a longer discharging time but also has smaller volume and less weight than the high voltage pulse capacitor when creating a same high discharging current, so it is feasible to use supercapacitor establishing high pulse magnetic field.
