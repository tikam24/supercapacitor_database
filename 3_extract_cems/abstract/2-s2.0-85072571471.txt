Solar PV sources are being increasingly implemented in many applications due to the growing concern of environmental pollution. The capacity of solar PV depends both on the transient power and nominal power required by any type of motor loads. The present investigation reports on a method to optimize the required capacity of Solar Panel by augmenting an Ultra capacitor bank for powering the transient needs of BLDC Motor. A PID based high quality dynamic response characteristics controller was designed to improve the speed transient response of the BLDC motor thereby reducing the transient energy requirement of the BLDC Motor. Tuning of PID parameters is critical to optimise the transient behaviour of the motor. The under damped step response tuning method has achieved an optimal PID parameters without any loss in speed transients when compared with other major tuning methods. PID controller is programmed in dsPIC controller that has high-resolution control and minimal control loop delays, thereby reduces torque ripples, harmonics and improves the dynamic behaviour in all speed ranges. The proposed optimal design of PV system augmented with Ultra capacitor for transient power delivery has been modelled and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink, which resulted in a reduction of plant size by 50 percent. The results obtained in simulation are verified experimentally.
