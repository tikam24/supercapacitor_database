This work presents the implementation of a control strategy for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) that uses a battery and an ultracapacitor as energy sources. For this configuration we developed a power demand prediction model which is intended for the power distribution of the vehicular system between the two sources. The proposed model, based on Wavelet decomposition and Neural Network, is a hybrid model developed in MATLAB&Simulink software. The distribution of the predicted power demand signal between the battery and the supercapacitor is necessary for improving the whole system performance and it is done according to their characteristics.
