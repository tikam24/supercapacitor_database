In order to improve the power supply problem of traditional power grid short-circuit fault monitoring system, a kind of self-powered power supply for grid short-circuit fault remote monitoring system is proposed. After short-circuit fault occurs, self-powered power supply starts to store the short-circuit fault energy, and the working voltage required for fault monitoring is quickly set up by charging the pre-capacitor, and the super-capacitor (SC) is charged to obtain the energy needed for the monitoring system to send the fault signal. According to the set hysteresis upper limit voltage of the pre-capacitor and its setting time, monitoring system minimum operating voltage and the power required for normal operation condition, a design method of the pre-capacitor capacity is proposed. According to the short-circuit duration, the maximum operating voltage, the minimum discharge cut-off voltage of the SC and the expected maintenance time of the system, a design method of the SC capacity is proposed. The self-powered power supply prototype is designed and applied to the grid short-circuit fault monitoring system. The experimental results verify the feasibility of theoretical analysis and self-powered power supply design schemes and methods.
