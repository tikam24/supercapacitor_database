In this work, a new catalytic-graphitization route has been developed to prepare porous carbons with a high graphitization degree (denoted as GPCs). By using anion-exchange resins (AERs) as carbon precursors, and K3[Fe(CN)6] as a catalyst precursor, the obtained GPCs exhibit an improved graphitization degree with the increase in carbonization temperature. Furthermore, the capacitive performances of GPC-based electrodes were investigated in a three-electrode system. The result shows that the GPC obtained at 800 °C (GPC-800) displays the best capacitive performances amongst all GPC samples, possibly due to its improved graphitization degree. When constructed as a practical supercapacitor, the GPC-800-based supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 22.1 W h kg−1, good rate capability and a stable cycling ability. It is believed that our method opens a new door for the synthesis of high-graphitization porous carbons.
