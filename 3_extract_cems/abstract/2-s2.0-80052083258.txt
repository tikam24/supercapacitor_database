This paper deals with a combined system with fuel cell and supercapacitor to provide a power to grid or electrical load. The supercapacitor is used to compensate the slow response of the fuel cell at the instant of abrupt load change. The operation of the bidirectional DC/DC converter for a supercapacitor during charging and discharging is analyzed, and a power control method to maintain a DC link voltage constant is proposed. Simulation results for 3kW combined system show the usefulness of the proposed method. Â© 2011 IEEE.
