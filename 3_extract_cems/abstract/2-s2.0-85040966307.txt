The electrochemical deposition method was used to prepare NF/rGO/Co3O4 and NF/rGO/Co3O4/NiO electrodes(NF=nickel foam; rGO=reduced graphene oxide). Here, with NF as a current collector, rGO, Co3O4 and NiO were grown on NF directly without any binder under specific conditions including optimized potential, time and concentration. NF/rGO/Co3O4 and NF/rGO/Co3O4/NiO electrodes were used as the electrode of supercapacitor, and three-electrode system was employed in cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impe-dance spectroscopy characterization of the electrodes. The results showed that the capacitance of NF/rGO/Co3O4/NiO electrode was 1188.6 F/g at 2 A/g; its rate capability was 75.7% when the current density varied from 2 A/g to 12 A/g; and its cycling stability was 80.5% after 2000 times. Compared with NF/rGO/Co3O4, the supercapacitor performance of NF/rGO/Co3O4/NiO electrode improved a lot, which can be attributed to the synergistic effect of Co3O4 and NiO. What's more, rGO could enhance the electroconductivity of electrodes to a large extent.
