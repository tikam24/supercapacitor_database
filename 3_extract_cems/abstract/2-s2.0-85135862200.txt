To satisfy the demand for emerging flexible electronics, there is an urgent need to develop integrated flexible all-solid energy storage devices. Here, a novel integrated supercapacitor is prepared based on a polyvinyl alcohol/glycerol-Mo (PVA/Gly-Mo) electrolyte and a polypyrrole/glycerol-Mo (PPy/Gly-Mo) electrode by simple in-situ polymerization and freezing/thawing methods. A series of electrode materials are prepared to understand the role of Gly-Mo in capacitor performance enhancement. The capacitance contribution is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry test data to investigate the charge storage mechanism of the optimal electrode material. Using the optimal electrode material, the as-prepared Gly-Mo based integrated supercapacitor can deliver an areal specific capacitance of 196.4 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mF cm−2 and a high energy density of 17.5 µWh cm−2 at a power density of 80 µW cm−2. The simple device fabrication, novel structural components and satisfactory electrochemical properties of Gly-Mo based supercapacitors make them promising candidates for practical applications.
