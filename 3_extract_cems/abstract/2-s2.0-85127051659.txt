Morphologically tunable copper oxide-based nanomaterials on Cu wire have been synthesized through a one-step alkali-assisted surface oxidation process for non-enzymatic glucose sensing. Subsequently, copper oxide-based nanomaterials on Cu wire as a supporting matrix to deposit manganese oxide for the construction of heterostructured Mn-Cu bimetallic oxide architectures through spontaneous redox reaction in the KMnO4 solution for supercapacitors. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that morphological and phase transformation from Cu(OH)2 to CuO occurred in copper oxide-based nanomaterials on Cu wire with different degrees of growth reaction. In non-enzymatic glucose sensing, morphologically tunable copper oxide-based nanomaterials owned the high tunability of electrocatalytically active sites and intrinsic catalytic activity to meet efficient glucose electrooxidation for obtaining promoted non-enzymatic glucose sensing performances (sensitivity of 2331 µA mM−1 cm−2 and the limit of detection of 0.02 mM). In the supercapacitor, heterostructured Mn–Cu bimetallic oxide-based nanomaterials delivered abundant redox-active sites and continuous conductive network to optimize the synergistic effect of Mn and Cu redox species for boosting the pseudo-capacitance performance (areal capacitance value of 79.4 mFcm−2 at 0.2 mAcm−2 current density and capacitance retention of 74.9% after 1000 cycles). It concluded that morphologically tunable copper oxide-based nanomaterials on Cu wire with/without deposition of manganese oxide could be good candidates for the future design of synergistic multifunctional materials in electrochemical techniques.
