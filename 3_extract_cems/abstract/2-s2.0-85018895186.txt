Ni3S4@MoS2 nanosheets grown on the carbon fiber paper (Ni3S4@MoS2/CFP) were successfully prepared via a facile one-step hydrothermal technique. Serving as a supercapacitor electrode, the obtaining Ni3S4@MoS2/CFP exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 1296 F/g, high rate capability of 57.8%, and excellent cycling stability of 96.2% retention after 5000 cycles. The superior electrochemical properties of Ni3S4@MoS2/CFP nanocomposite is attributed to the synergistic effects of the layeredNi3S4, MoS2 and the conductive CFP.
