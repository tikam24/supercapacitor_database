A simple chemical activation route is developed to convert insulating cotton T-shirt textiles into highly conductive and flexible activated carbon textiles (ACTs) for energy-storage applications. Such conversion gives these ACTs an ideal electrical double-layer capacitive behavior. The constructed asymmetric supercapacitors based on the ACTs and MnO 2/ACT composite show superior electrochemical performances. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
