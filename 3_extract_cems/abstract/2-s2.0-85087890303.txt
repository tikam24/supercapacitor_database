In this work, a 3D nanoflower-like Ni@FeCo2O4@Yb-Ni(OH)2 composite was prepared via a facile liquid phase chemical deposition and electrochemical deposition method. The as-synthesized Ni@FeCo2O4@Yb-Ni(OH)2 composites have a large specific surface area because of the developed nanoflower morphology, which creates good contact between the material and electrolyte. A high specific capacitance of 11.04 F•cm-2 is reached at a current density of 4 mA•cm-2. More importantly, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by using the as-synthesized Ni@FeCo2O4@Yb-Ni(OH)2 composites as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode exhibits a high energy density of 36.86 Wh•kg-1, a power density of 1.2 kW•kg-1 and excellent cycling stability (97.8% capacitance retention).
