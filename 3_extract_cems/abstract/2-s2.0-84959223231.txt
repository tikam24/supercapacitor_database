Carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) were synthesized from SiC powders (SiC-CDC) via gas phase chlorination within the temperature range from 1000°C to 1100°C. Thereafter the CDCs were additionally activated by CO2 treatment method, resulting in nearly two-fold increase in specific surface area. The lowtemperature nitrogen sorption experiments were performed and the specific surface areas from 1100 m2 g-1up to 2270 m2 g-1were obtained, depending on the extent of CO2 activation. The energy and power density characteristics of the supercapacitors based on 1 M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 solution in acetonitrile and SiC-CDC as an electrode material were investigated using the cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge/discharge and constant power discharge methods. The electrochemical data indicated two-times increase in specific capacitance. The activation of SiC-CDC with CO2 significantly increases (more than 40%) the performance of the supercapacitors, especially at higher potential scan rates and at higher power loads.
