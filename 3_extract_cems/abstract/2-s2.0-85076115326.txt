Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been attracting research interest due to their specific properties including supper large surface area, more active sites and fast electron transmission, which are beneficial to the improvement of energy and power densities for supercapacitors (SCs). In this paper, 2D LiCoO2 (2D-LCO) is prepared by fine-tuning the time in the synthesis process through a fast-composite-hydroxide-mediated approach. The electrode with the 2D-LCO mass load of 0.75 mg/cm2 exhibits the high specific capacitance of 310 mF/cm2 at 5 mV/s. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by 2D-LCO//Fe2O3/FeOOH delivers a high areal energy density of 56.25 μWh/cm2 at 1100 μW/cm2 with working window of 2.2 V and an excellent cycling stability of 80% at current density of 10 mA/cm2 for 2000 cycles.
