The article presents the results of research on the operational properties of contactless power supply system used in the PRT vehicle demonstration model, made within the framework of the ECO Mobility project. The area of transport applications of the PRT automated rail transport system is presented. Elements of the ECO Mobility PRT Drive System have been described â€“ an inductive linear motor, dynamic contactless power supply, and supercapacitor recuperation system. Electrical performance maps of the linear motor and contactless power system were presented. Also shown was the method of their use in calculation of traction energy consumption by means of theoretical journeys. The results of the simulation calculations for the trial track were presented. The results of design calculations of the power supply parameters for the planned line of the demonstrator with real dimensions are presented.
