In view of massive accumulation of pyrolytic carbon black (CBp) from waste tires with low quality, it is urgent to explore its application in electrochemical energy storage to realize the high-value utilization of carbon resources and reduce the cost of supercapacitors. Herein, in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers on activated CBp (ACBp) with the introduction of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) for enhanced N content was first performed to prepare the composite of CBp and polyaniline (PANI), denoted as ACBp-oPANI, and then a dual N-doped material (ACBp-oN) was obtained via direct activation of ACBp-oPANI. The ACBp-oN product shows satisfactory specific capacitance of 335 F g−1 (1 A g−1) with superior rate performance as well as long cycle life in three-electrode system. The investigated charging/discharging kinetics reveal rapid electron transport and ion diffusion, which are attributed to its doped N and enriched channel structure. Besides, the assembled Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor (Zn|C), including ACBp-oN cathode and electrodeposited Zn anode, delivers an amazing energy density of 68.9 Wh kg−1 which is almost 4 times higher than that of conventional symmetrical supercapacitor (C|C), demonstrating more practicality. The research provides new perception into the high-value utilization of waste CBp resources in energy field and strategy for the boosted electrochemical properties of carbon-based materials via the suggested Zn|C energy storage system.
