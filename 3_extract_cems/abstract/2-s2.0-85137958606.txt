Intercalation is basically the process of putting one or multiple guest elements into the van der Waals gaps of a parent crystal in a reversible way. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great promise with intercalant species ranging from organic molecules to ions. Apart from graphene, the most studied 2D materials are the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Intercalation in TMDs has led to new strategies beyond graphene for 2D structures in materials science, materials engineering, chemistry and physics. This review deals with the possible mechanism of intercalation as well as the window that intercalation can open for compact and ultrathin device technology. Modulation of the physicochemical properties of intercalated TMDs has been thoroughly reviewed. Finally, device performance, especially for energy storage and energy harvesting devices, has been evaluated and specific issues that need attention for future development are highlighted.
