To solve the agglomeration of layered double hydroxides (LDH) for improving their supercapacitor performances, Co, Mn-LDH nanoneedle arrays grown on Ni foam (Co, Mn-LDH@NF hybrid) was fabricated via a one-step hydrothermal strategy. The Ni foam served as the skeleton frame for anchoring Co, Mn-LDH nanoneedles to form three dimensional net structures, and open spaces among Co, Mn-LDH nanoneedles. When Co, Mn-LDH@NF hybrid was used as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors, it displayed outstanding supercapacitor performances with a high specific capacitance of 2422 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and superior cyclic stability for maintaining a capacitance of 2096 F g−1 after 3000 cycles, which was only 13.5% capacity loss ratio. The excellent supercapacitor performances were ascribed to three dimensional net structure and LDH nanoneedle structure, which provided abundant electrochemical active sites, alleviated volume expansion, and had good electrical conductivity.
