Nano-porous Co was prepared by electrochemically dealloying of Zr56Al16Co28 amorphous alloy in 0.5%(mass fraction) NH4F and 1 mol/L (NH4)2SO4 mixed solution. Nano-porous Co has the bicontinuous porous structure with large specific surface area and fast charge transfer ability. The prepared nano-porous Co exhibits good performance in many aspects: firstly, it delivers a high specific capacitance of 318 F/g at 2 A/g, suggesting its good performance as supercapacitor electrode; secondly, it exhibits degradation efficiencies under square wave potential as high as 96% for Direct Blue 6 and Acid Orange II respectively. The degradation ability of nano-porous Co electrode per unit mass is 3.5 times higher than that of Zr56Al16Co28 amorphous alloy electrode.
