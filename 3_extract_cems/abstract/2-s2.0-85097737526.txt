In the present work, a simple hydrothermal synthesis of novel Sr2Co2O5 Nanoparticles (NPs) was reported. The physical and chemical properties of Sr2Co2O5 NPs were investigated by various spectral and analytical tools such as FT-IR, Raman, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS and N2 adsorption studies. The as-synthesized Sr2Co2O5 NPs were explored for sensing of chloramphenicol in milk sample and for energy storage applications. The working potential window of electrochemical reduction of chloramphenicol (CAP) is 0.3 to -1 V with the fixed scan rate of 0.05 V/s and peak potential was obtained at -0.57 V. Sr2Co2O5 NPs modified GCE electrode (Sr2Co2O5 NPs/GCE) showed outstanding result for sensing of CAP with a desirable wide linear range of 0.01 to 21.1 and 31.1 to 931.1 μM and a lowest detection limit of 0.0023 and 0.011 μM respectively. The supercapacitive behavior of Sr2Co2O5 NPs coated Ni foil electrodes was investigated by performing Cyclic Voltammogram (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge measurement (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis in 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Sr2Co2O5 NPs/Ni foil electrode delivered a specific capacitance of 683 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s with significant cycling stability (88% retention after 5000 cycles, 2 Ag−1). These results proved that Sr2Co2O5 NPs could be utilized as the suitable electrode material for sensor and energy applications.
