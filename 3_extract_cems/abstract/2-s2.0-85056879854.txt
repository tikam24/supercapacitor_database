Carbon aerogels with biomimetic structures have shown excellent physicochemical properties and brought great potential applications to a wide range of fields. The utilization of renewable resources as the carbon precursors offers a low-cost and scalable way to fabricate biomimetic carbon aerogels with intriguing properties such as ultralight weight, superelasticity, and high conductivity. Inspired by the unique hierarchical mineral bridge structure of Thalia dealbata stem, we fabricated an ultralight, superelastic, highly conductive carbon aerogel (KGA) by using konjac glucomannan and graphene oxide as the carbon precursors. The unique mineral-bridged layered structure not only endows the carbon aerogel with a low density of 4.2 mg cm-3 but also a high electrical conductivity (12.9 S m-1). In addition, the carbon aerogel also exhibits a superelastic property of 80% maximal strain and no obvious degradation after 1000 cycles of compression. We demonstrated that this Thalia dealbata inspired carbon aerogel has potential applications in supercapacitor electrodes and piezoresistive sensors.
