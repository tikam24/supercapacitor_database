This work reported Co9S8 nanoparticle-decorated carbon nanofibers (CNF) as a supercapacitor electrode. By using a mild ion-exchange method, the cobalt oxide-based precursor nanoparticles were transformed to Co9S8 nanoparticles in a microwave hydrothermal process, and these nanoparticles were decorated onto a carbon nanofiber backbone. The composition of the nanofibers can be readily tuned by varying the Co acetate content in the precursor. The porous carbon nanofibers offered a fast electron transfer pathway while the well dispersed Co9S8 nanoparticles acted as the redox center for energy storage. As a result, high specific capacitance of 718 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 can be achieved with optimized Co9S8 loading. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with Co9S8/CNF as the cathode showed a high energy density of 23.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.75 kW kg-1 and good cycling stability (16.9% loss over 10, 000 cycles).
