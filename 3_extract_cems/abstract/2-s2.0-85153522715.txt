The reliable and controllable operation of the ITER machine relies on a compatible and stable power grid. The ITER Pulsed Power Electrical Network (PPEN) already has employed the Static Var Compensator (SVC), but issues, such as poor dynamic characteristics, insufficient capacity, and lack of means to cope with active power shock are still existed. To meet the updated needs of ITER&#x0027;s future operation, this paper proposes the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) combined with a supercapacitor (SC) energy storage scheme (E-STATCOM) to realize active and reactive power compensation. The Energy Management Mechanism (EMM) is detailed for the operation of the entire system. Furthermore, a cooperative control method based on an improved second-order filter is presented to achieve coordination with the existing SVC system, and the control decoupling are explored in the frequency domain. The detailed models are built in MATLAB&#x002F;Simulink and demonstrate that the recommended scheme can effectively and stably achieve the power compensation objective. The paper provides reference design for the upgrade of ITER machine, as well as the power compensation solution for the load with large capacity, high uncertainty and significant impulse characteristics.
