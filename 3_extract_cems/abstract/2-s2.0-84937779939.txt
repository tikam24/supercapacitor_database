Abstract This paper highlights suitability of three dimensional (3D) network composed of manganese oxide nanofibers (NF-MnO2), synthesized by the potentiodynamic electrodeposition for supercapacitor application. Electrodeposition mechanism of manganese oxide is discussed with the help of electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) study and it reveals that maximum mass deposited on the electrode surface occurs at 0.85 V vs SCE. The FE-SEM images exhibit an interconnected 3-D network composed of MnO2 nanofibers with diameter varies from 10 to 27 nm and length of the order of 0.1 to 0.5 μm, exhibiting high aspect ratio. XPS measurements revealed that the peak appeared at binding energies of 642.6 and 654.05 eV attributed to the Mn4+ state in the NF-MnO2. The maximum specific capacitance of ∼392 F.g-1 at 10 mV.s-1 by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and 383 F.g-1 at a current density of 2 mA.cm-2 by charge discharge studies were achieved for the NF-MnO2 in an electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4. The NF-MnO2 exhibits an excellent rate capability with high specific energy of ∼48.74 Wh.kg-1 and specific power of ∼2.12 kW.kg-1. The high specific capacitance and charge-discharge rates offered by NF-MnO2 make them promising candidates for supercapacitor electrodes, combining high-energy densities with high levels of power delivery.
