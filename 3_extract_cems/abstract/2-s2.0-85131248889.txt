The Rail Technical Strategy aims to meet the goals that reduce carbon emissions, increase rail speed, lower rail costs and improve customer satisfaction. The reduction of fuel consumption and costs for rail travel depends on more effective maintenance and operation. In a railway system, mainly diesel energy is needed for traction followed by 30 percent energy consumption. The engine will start a reaction to extract this carbon by running the gas supplying hot and reactive. The heat released by the reaction will be adequate to support the reaction under such conditions, resulting in very high local temperatures usually as a thermal wave. Energy efficiency of rail vehicles, expressed in the reduction of the size of diesel engines and the consistent development of battery and supercapacitor systems to promote regenerative braking are in focus. For the accessibility study of these issues with regard to the implementation of the engine control approach, level set calculations approaches were used in this study.
