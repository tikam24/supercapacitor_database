Nanostructured manganese dioxide (MnO2)/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite is fabricated via a simple hydrothermal process. The MnO2/RGO composite is used to construct supercapacitors as electrodes with high loading mass of active materials. The electrochemical properties of constructed supercapacitors are tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that MnO2/RGO electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 316 F·g-1 at a current density of 200 mA·g-1 and good long-term cycling stability with capacitance retention of 93% at 500 mA·g-1 after 1000 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of as-prepared composite could be mainly attributed to its unique structure, which is composed of MnO2 nanoflakes well-integrated on the surfaces of RGO.
