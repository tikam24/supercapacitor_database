In this study, a facile one-step homogeneous electrochemical deposition method was utilized to fabricate poly(aniline-2,5-dimethoxyaniline)co-polymer (PANI-PDMA) nanocomposite coated on the surface of graphite sheet (GS) electrode for an effective high-performance supercapacitor application. Physio-chemical characterizations were examined using FT-IR, XRD, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. The morphological view of as-synthesized copolymer nanocomposite was characterized using the FE-SEM technique. Electrochemical investigation of the as-fabricated modified electrode (GS/PANI-PDMA) was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charging and discharging (GCD) studies. Based on electrochemical studies, GS/PANI-PDMA modified co-polymer electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 595 F/g compared to GS@PANI and GS@PDMA. After 1000 cycles, it indicates 67% capacitance retention, which is indicated to be a potential alternative material for supercapacitor application.
