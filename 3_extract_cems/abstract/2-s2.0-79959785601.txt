Energy storage technique is one of the most effective technique means for the regulation of wind power. Aiming at meeting the requirement of balancing the fluctuating wind power, this paper proposed a hybrid energy storage system, which was composed of battery and superc-apacitor. By the reasonable design on charge-discharge controller, the precise management on the whole charge-discharge course and the extension of cycle life of the energy storage element were achieved. Meanwhile, the system could supply the constant dc output voltage. With respect to the control system design for the energy storage system, this paper developed a double-layer control model. Also, an expert information base was established. Based on the information of real-time wind power and state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage element, the corresponding control algorithm for the charge-discharge controller can be obtained by searching the expert information base in sequence under that double-layer control model. As a result, the control logic under various fluctuating conditions of wind power was simplified and the time cost for control was shortened. Through simulation analysis, it can be indicated that the configuration of the hybrid energy storage system and the control system design are feasible. This system can be widely used in wind farm, undertaking the task of balancing the fluctuating wind power. Â© 2011 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.
