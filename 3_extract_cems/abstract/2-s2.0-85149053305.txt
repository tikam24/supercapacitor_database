We report on the synthesis of activated carbon-semi-polycrystalline polyaniline (SPani-AC) composite material using in-situ oxidative polymerization of aniline on the carbon surface in an aqueous HCl medium at an elevated temperature of 60 °C. The electroactive polymeric composite material exhibits a uniformly distributed spindle-shaped morphology in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and well-defined crystallographic lattices in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum reveals sharp peaks characteristic of crystalline polyaniline. The characteristic chemical properties of polyaniline are recorded using laser Raman spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetry curves exhibit features of surface-redox pseudocapacitance. The specific capacitance calculated for the material is 507 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1. The symmetrical two-electrodes device exhibits a specific capacitance of 45 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1. The capacitive retention calculated was found to be 96% up to 4500 continuous charge–discharge cycles and observed to be gradually declining at the end of 10,000 cycles. On the other hand, Coulombic efficiency was observed to be retained up to 85% until 4500 continuous charge–discharge cycles which declines up to 72% at the end of 10,000 cycles. The article also presents a detailed description of material synthesis, the formation of polyaniline (Pani) chains, and the role of material architecture in the performance as surface redox supercapacitor electrode.
