In this paper, activated carbon with a high specific surface area up to 1872 m2 g−1 has been prepared from pitaya peel by chemical activation method using KOH solution as an activator. The novel activated carbon exhibits a significantly high specific capacitance of 255 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH, as well as excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 96.4% after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Our findings suggest that the biowaste like pitaya peel can be converted into available activated carbon, indicating a low-cost substitute for conventional electrode materials for supercapacitors.
