Polymeric hybrid materials of polyindole-reduced graphene oxide-titanium dioxide (PIn-rGO-TiO2) have been synthesized via chemical oxidative in-situ polymerization technique. Inclusion of rGO in polymeric matrix enhances the level of porosity and electrical conductivity of the resultant composite. The presence of TiO2 increases overall redox activity and charge storing capability of the hybrid polymeric materials. As a result, the composite materials possess revamped electrochemical out-turn. PIn-rGO-TiO2 comprising of 10% TiO2 (PGT10) exhibites exorbitant specific capacitance of 482.9 F g−1 with capacitance retention of 114% at current densities of 1 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively. The marked cyclic performance of PGT10 is attributed to the 2D supporting network of rGO for deposition of the polymer which precludes dissociation of the fragile polymeric backbone during uninterrupted cycling process. Nonetheless, the PGT10 composite electrode shows insignificant solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) representing its pompous charge transporting properties. These characteristics show that PGT10 could be one of the most competent candidates to be used as electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
