3D Porous carbon derived from pine needle is prepared by hydrothermal followed KOH activation process. The high surface area (1175 m2 g−1) and rich hierarchical pores provide the electrode with high capacitance. And the abundant surface oxygen functional groups offer additional pseudo-capacitance, which would increase the capacitance. It delivers the capacitance of 348 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode cell. The well performance and the low cost make the derived porous carbon as a promising electrode.
