A novel three-dimensional (3D) Î±-Fe2O3/MoS2 hierarchical nanoheterostructure is effectively synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. The zero-dimensional (0D) Fe 2O3 nanoparticles guide the growth of two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 nanosheets and formed 3D flower-like structures, while MoS2 facilitates the good dispersion of porous Fe 2O3 with abundant oxygen vacancies. This charming 3D-structure with perfect match of non-equal dimension exhibits high recyclable photo-Fenton catalytic activity for Methyl orange pollutant and nice specific capacity in reusing as supercapacitor after catalysis. The synergistic effect between Fe 2O3 and MoS2, the intermediate nanointerfaces, the 3D porous structures, and the abundant oxygen vacancies both contribute to highly active catalysis, nice electrochemical performance and stable cycling. This strategy is simple, cheap, and feasible for maximizing the value of the materials, as well as eliminating the secondary pollution.
