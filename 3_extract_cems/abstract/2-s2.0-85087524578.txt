The large surface area of CoNiSe2/CoNiSe2/Ti 3D urchis electrodes have been synthesized with high durability for electrochemical reactions and excellent catalytic performance for HER in the alkaline solutions. The asymmetric supercapacitor based on CoNiSe2/CoNiSe2//CoNiO2/CoNiO2 displays a maximum specific capacitance of 11.6F cm−3 and a high energy density of 2.9 μWh cm−3 at 34 μW cm−3. The present work highlights the ternary selenide is an promising electrode material in the field of advanced energy storage and conversion.
