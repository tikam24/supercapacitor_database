This paper aims to develop a way for synthesising Zinc Tungstate (ZnWO4) by Microwave method. Which is simpler easier and better than hydrothermal synthesis. Formation of the crystal microstructures were verified with the aid of Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and further, morphologies were investigated upon using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). The implications in the energy storage devices were examined by preparing a pseudo capacitor. The electrochemical characteristics were analysed by using three-electrode system and its performance was evaluated with the assistance of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The result presented the specific capacitance as 79 Fg-1 for a scan rate of 1mVs-1. The ZnWO4 as an active material retains 96.52% stability up to 1000 cycles. A significant increase in the impedance for lower frequencies can be observed for the material after 1000 cycles when compared to that of the first cycle.
