The hierarchical ZnCo2O4@Ni3S2 core/shell nanowire arrays were prepared on Ni foam by a two-step method using a hydrothermal process and subsequent electrodeposition. The one-dimensional core-shell structure as an electrode facilitated a rapid electron transport and provided a large number of active sites in the charge/discharge process. As a three-electrode system, the supercapacitor based on ZnCo2O4@Ni3S2/Ni foam exhibited a specific capacitance of 1725 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g, and maintained the cycling stability of 88.9% at a current density of 5 A/g after 1000 cycles.
