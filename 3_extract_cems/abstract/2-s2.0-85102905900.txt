The paper reports the results of the test and modelling activities carried out on large commercial supercapacitor cells at high current. Four commercials cells, with rated capacitance of 3000 F and rated voltage of 2.7 V, are considered. All cells are submitted to consecutive charge/discharge cycles at constant current. A test current in the range 80-130 A is used, which is comparable with the maximum operating current (up to 150 A) that the cells can reach in practical operations. A circuit model of the cells, able to reproduce the most relevant dynamic behavior, with a good compromise between accuracy, simplicity and robustness of the model's parameters, is also developed and validated against the experimental data. It is shown that all the investigated commercial cells are characterized by similar phenomena and comply with the same circuit model. Moreover, it is shown that the circuit parameters of the cells are in the same range and are weakly dependent on the test current. The obtained circuit parameters are accurately reported for all the cells and made fully accessible to users.
