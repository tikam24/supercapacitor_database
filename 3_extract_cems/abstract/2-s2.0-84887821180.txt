Mesoporous Ni-doped Co(OH)2 was uniformly deposited along indium-tin oxide nanowires (ITO NWs) which were directly grown on titanium substrates by chemical vapor deposition followed by potentiostatic electrodeposition through a hexagonal liquid crystalline phase of a nonionic surfactant. The as-synthesized electrode is a network composed of ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of about 10nm containing pores in the diameter range of 2-3nm. The mesoporous nanowire electrode demonstrates extremely high specific capacitance of 2052Fg-1 at discharge current density of 1Ag-1 in an aqueous KOH solution. Moreover, the nanowires with mesoporous nanosheets exhibit superior pseudocapacitive behavior, lower capacitance fading, and better rate performance than films with mesoporous nanosheets.
