The study of electric vehicle and its energy sources are being incorporated in undergraduate and postgraduate syllabuses. This article discusses the basic concepts and design of energy storage systems for electricity based transpiration application. The content of this work elaborates the importance of energy storage systems in electric vehicle and hybridization of energy storage systems i.e. battery and ultracapacitor, which seems to be a promising topic among the final-year project students as well as an emerging research topic among the research scholars worldwide. Hence, this article is prepared in order to trigger those studentsâ€™ knowledge in multisourced electric vehicle in depth. This study highly focuses on fuzzy logic-based energy sources power split strategy for a multisourced electric vehicle to enhance a better sharing of energy across the multisources with distinct characteristics like high specific power (ultracapacitor) and high specific energy (battery). In general, fuzzy logic controller best suits for a complicated real-time problem. Further it does not require a priori knowledge of a vehicle driving pattern over a time. Hence, the proposed control strategy can provide a satisfactory improvement in vehicle efficiency, assured reduction in stress factor, and energy consumption rate and reduced ultracapacitor sources state of charge difference in all different hybridization topologies. Thus, this paper can help students working on energy management problems of hybridization of energy sources.
