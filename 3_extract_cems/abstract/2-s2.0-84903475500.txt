Nowadays considerable resources have been invested on low emission passenger vehicle both for private and public transportation. A feasible solution for urban buses is a full electrical traction system fed by supercapacitor that can be recharged at each bus stop while people are getting on and off. Such vehicle covers a short distance between consecutive stops, usually less than half a kilometer. An energy storage system able to provide high power peaks and small amount of energy is required. For these reasons, supercapacitors, which are capable of fast charging during bus stops, appear the most appropriate storage devices [1]. In order to consider the worst operating condition for the bus (like traffic jam of higher distance to be covered), a conventional battery is also installed, getting an hybrid energy storage system. An energy management function, able to manage the energy storage system, has been developed and validated by means of a numerical simulation model. Copyright Â© 2013 by ASME.
