Herein the concomitant synthesis of a MoS2- and Cu7S4-decorated graphene aerogel is reported. The material is fully characterized and used as an active material to coat carbon fiber electrodes for the fabrication of a fiber-shaped supercapacitor. The device provides excellent capacitance values warranting stable performance even under high bending angle conditions. Moreover, a photocurable resin is selected as a smart packaging material to overcome stability problems usually affecting this class of devices. It is noteworthy that superior stability is demonstrated with a retention of almost 80% of the initial capacitance after one month. Flexible supercapacitors were also coupled with third-generation solar cells to successfully demonstrate the fabrication of wearable, portable, and integrated smart energy devices.
