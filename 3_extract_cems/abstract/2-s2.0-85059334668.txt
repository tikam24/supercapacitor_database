The growing interest in developing wearable energy storage devices requires the identification of suitable materials for the fabrication of their components. In this paper we report a new asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor exploiting a composite of hematite and reduced graphene oxide aerogel obtained by a hydrothermal synthesis in presence of green extract as anode material and electrodeposited nanostructured MnOx as cathode. The three dimensional arrangement of the graphene flakes during the hydrothermal self-assembly process provides a highly conductive porous matrix with high surface area and, most importantly, a pores structure able to guarantee the rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ions and a fast electron transport. By simply modifying the hydrothermal recipe adding a dispersion of hematite nanoparticles, obtained using olive leaves extract as green surfactant, it is possible to obtain the decoration of the graphene network with the pseudocapacitive material. The resulting nanocomposite rGO/Fe2O3 aerogel exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive behaviour and it is used, in combination with MnOx nanostructured electrode, to fabricate a flexible fiber-shaped device exhibiting superior rate capability and bending stability. The use of a green surfactant during the synthesis opens up new avenues for the fabrication of environmentally friendly electrodes for wearable energy storage applications.
