In this paper, a model-free DC bus voltage control and energy management strategy are designed for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle. First, the fuel cell hybrid power system which is composed of fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor is described, and the ultra-local model is constructed based on the input and the output of the system. Then, the model-free continuous fast terminal sliding mode control method is proposed and adopted to design the DC bus voltage controller and sources current controller, and the high-order fast terminal sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the unknown terms of the ultra-local model. Finally, a novel state-based energy management strategy which is composed of cruise state, low power state and charge power state is developed to provide efficient power distribution between different power sources. To verify the performance of the controller, simulations have been done on MATLAB/Simulink, which show that the proposed control strategy ensures good performance and a finite time stability which simultaneously meets all the control objectives.
