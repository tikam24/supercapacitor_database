This study provides new data on the fabrication of hybrid batterysupercapacitor with an excellent cycling stability based on composites of α-Ni(OH)2 and activated carbon (AC). The α-phase, Ni(OH)2.0.3H2O, consists of charged Ni(OH)2-x layers, SO2- 4 anions being intercalated in the interlayer spaces. The hydroxide has a mesoporous structure and contains nanometric primary particles bounded into micrometric aggregates. The supercapacitor performance of α-Ni(OH)2 mixed with AC is tested by galvanostatic experiments in KOH-LiOH electrolyte. The ratio between α-Ni(OH)2 and AC is varied in a whole concentration range: 0≤x≤100 wt.%. In comparison with the symmetrical supercapacitor, the composite electrodes containing α-Ni(OH)2 between 6 and 35 wt. % demonstrate higher and more stable discharge capacitance, as well as a higher effectiveness of chargedischarge process. α-Ni(OH)2 has a better cycling stability in comparison with the b-phase. The supercapacitor performance is discussed in terms of structure and morphology stability of α- Ni(OH)2 in alkaline electrolyte.
