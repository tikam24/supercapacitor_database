A three-dimensional elastic carbon nanotube aerogel is fabricated via a simple solution-based strategy using Te nanowires as templates, which can be recycled. The pipe diameter and wall thickness of the carbon nanotube are strongly dependent on the diameter of the Te nanowires and carbon source. The obtained free-standing carbon nanotube aerogel with a large specific surface area (up to 1865 m2∙g-1) is promising as an electrode material for supercapacitors. After com-bination with MnO2, the capacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 360.4 F∙g-1 at a current of 1 A∙g-1 and retention of 97% after 2000 cycles. The high power capabilities and good stability make it a promising candidate as an electrode for super-capacitors.
