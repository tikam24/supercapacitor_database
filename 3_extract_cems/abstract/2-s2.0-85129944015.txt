A facile novel method of alkali etching was proposed to enhance the application of metal-silicates in supercapacitors. First, 3D N, S, P-doped C-zinc-silicate (C-ZnSi), and C-manganese-silicate (C-MnSi) were derived from calcined green algaes (GAs) in a N2 atmosphere. Second, the synthesized products were soaked in a 3.0 M NaOH aqueous solution for alkali etching (soaked for 6, 12 and 24 h) to obtain the etching metal silicates (e-C-ZnSi and e-C-MnSi). This method can yield a higher specific surface area and more pores, and this in turn can improve the electrochemical performance. In the three-electrode system, e-C-ZnSi and e-C-MnSi, which were soaked in NaOH solution for 12 h, exhibited the highest specific capacitances and cycling performance. Solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) devices were manufactured using C-MSi, e-C-MSi (M = Zn and Mn), and activated carbon (AC) (denoted as C-MSi//AC and e-C-MSi//AC). In the two-electrode system, the e-C-MSi//AC HSC devices exhibited higher areal specific capacitances and energy densities and better cycle performance than those of C-MSi//AC, especially e-C-MSi//AC-12 h HSC devices, which exhibited the best electrochemical properties. This study demonstrated that the naturally polluted GAs can be used as a reusable silica source for the synthesis of supercapacitors. Furthermore, alkali etching can enhance the electrochemical performance of metal silicates and can be used to prepare electrode materials applied for high-performance supercapacitors.
