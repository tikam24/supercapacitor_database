Composites combining electrostatic charge accumulation and faradic reaction mechanisms are especially attractive high-performance supercapacitor electrodes for electrochemical energy storage. Up to now, it is difficult to prepare low-cost carbon composites from renewable resources. In this work, an outstanding and low-cost composite was fabricated by using sustainable N-self-doped carbon framework as a hierarchical porous carbon substrate from renewable resource. The N-self-doped carbon framework was fabricated from chitosan via a facile yet unique self-assembly and ice template method without any physical or chemical activation, and exhibited hierarchical porous structure. This texture not only allowed the efficient infiltration and uniform coating of polyaniline (PANI) in the inner network but also permitted a rapid penetration and desorption of electrolytes. Due to short diffusion pathway, uniformly coating of PANI, and high accessibility of PANI to electrolytes, the composite electrode had a very high supercapacitance of 373 F g-1 (1.0 A g-1) and excellent rate capability (275 F g-1, 10 A g-1) in a three-electrode system. The symmetric supercapacitor also showed a supercapacitance of high up to 285 F g-1 (0.5 A g-1), and a very high energy density of 22.2 Wh kg-1. Furthermore, the composite also presented a good cycling stability.
