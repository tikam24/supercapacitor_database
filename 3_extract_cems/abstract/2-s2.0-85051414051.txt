This study reports on the fabrication of pressure/temperature/strain sensors and all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors using only polydimethylsiloxane coated microporous polypyrrole/graphene foam composite (PDMS/PPy/GF) as a common material. A dual-mode sensor is designed with PDMS/PPy/GF, which measures pressure and temperature with the changes of current and voltage, respectively, without interference to each other. The fabricated dual-mode sensor shows high sensitivity, fast response/recovery, and high durability during 10 000 cycles of pressure loading. The pressure is estimated using the thermoelectric voltage induced by simultaneous increase in temperature caused by a finger touch on the sensor. Additionally, a resistor-type strain sensor fabricated using the same PDMS/PPy/GF could detect the strain up to 50%. Flexible, high performance supercapacitor used as a power supply is fabricated with electrodes of PPy/GF for its high surface area and pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, an integrated system of such fabricated multifunctional sensors and a supercapacitor on a skin-attachable flexible substrate using liquidâ€“metal interconnections operates well, whereas sensors are driven by the power of the supercapacitor. This study clearly demonstrates that the appropriate choice of a single functional material enables fabrication of active multifunctional sensors for pressure, temperature, and strain, as well as the supercapacitor, that could be used in wirelessly powered wearable devices.
