Highlights The multiple heterojunction are constructed by the space-confined effect of NaCl. The C-S bonds connect nickel sulfide and N-doped amorphous carbon. The electronic interaction contributes to high electronic conductivity. The multiple heterojunctions multiplies the electrochemical performance.
