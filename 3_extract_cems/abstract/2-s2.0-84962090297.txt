A high-surface-area mesoporous carbon material has been synthesized using a self-templating approach via reduction of carbon tetrachloride by sodium potassium alloy. The advantage is the reduction-generated salt templates can be easily removed with just water. The produced mesoporous carbon has a high surface area and a narrow pore size distribution. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, this material exhibits a high specific capacitance (259 F g-1) and excellent cycling performance (>92% capacitance retention for 6000 cycles).
