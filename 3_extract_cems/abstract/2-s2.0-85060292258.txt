This paper reviews supercapacitor-based energy storage systems (i.e., supercapacitor-only systems and hybrid systems incorporating supercapacitors) for microgrid applications. The technologies and applications of the supercapacitor-related projects in the DOE Global Energy Storage Database are summarized. Typical applications of supercapacitor-based storage systems in microgrids are reviewed. Open research issues at both the device level (modeling and characterization of a supercapacitor cell and cell balancing circuits) and the system level (system design, control, and valuation) are outlined.
