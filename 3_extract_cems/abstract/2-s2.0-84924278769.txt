A three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide hydrogel (rGOH) was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis based on the electrostatic force and chemical reaction between graphene oxide (GO) and Ni ions in a nickel acetate solution. The Ni-rGOH fabricated in this study exhibited a highly increased surface area compared to NiO nanoparticles owing to the formation of 3D networks. After the reduction of functional groups in Ni-GOH, Ni-rGOH showed highly enhanced capacitance (351 F g-1) at a charge/discharge current density of 0.625 A g-1 and 90% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The energy density of Ni-rGOH was 175.5 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1.125 kW kg-1, while maintaining a high-energy density of 118 W h kg-1 at a power density of 4.5 kW kg-1. This journal is
