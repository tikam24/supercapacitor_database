Metal ferrites have outstanding electrochemical characteristics owing to the numerous oxidation states of the metal ions, making them promising materials for addressing both sustainable energy conversion and storage and growing environmental issues. Therefore, three nanocrystallites transition metal ferrites, CoFe2O4, CuFe2O4 and Co/CuFe2O4, were synthesized using citrate precursors and used as electrode materials for supercapacitor applications. Mixed transition metal ferrite nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) complemented with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and thermal analysis (TGA). The findings illustrated the formation of a single-phase spinel ferrite as proved from XRD data. In addition, the particle shape and particle size obtained from TEM analysis revealed that the as-synthesised nanomaterial exhibited spherical shape with a size ranging from 30 to 50 nm. The result demonstrated that while using a three-electrode configuration, the electrochemical performance of the ferrite nanoparticles achieved a remarkable maximum specific capacitance of 893 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. At a current density of 1 Ag−1, Co–Cu ferrite exhibited outstanding cycling stability for 3000 cycles with 90% capacity retention. Based on the aforementioned data, it can be considered that the remarkable electrochemical performance of the Co–Cu ferrite nanocomposites can be considered as promising materials to be used for supercapacitor electrodes.
