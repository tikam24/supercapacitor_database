A parameter identification method for supercapacitor equivalent circuit model using nonlinear least squares is designed to solve the problem that the model error of supercapacitors in hybrid energy storage system of electric vehicle is large and affects the state estimation of supercapacitors and system energy management. In order to actually characterize the process of charge redistribution inside the supercapacitor and its terminal voltage performance and to reduce the model error, a nonlinear parameter identification method is proposed. Firstly, based on a three branch equivalent circuit model, the initial parameters of the model are obtained by analyzing the internal charge redistribution process of the supercapacitor in the charge/discharge process. Then, initial values of model parameters are obtained by using a particle swarm optimization method accordingly. Finally, the nonlinear least-squares method with a trust region technique is employed to optimize the model parameters. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed parameter identification method based on the nonlinear least-squares method are verified by multiple constant current charge/discharge experiments for the supercapacitor. Results show that the average percentage errors between the terminal voltage calculated by the simulation model and the corresponding measured terminal voltage are within 0.5% under different charge/discharge conditions.
