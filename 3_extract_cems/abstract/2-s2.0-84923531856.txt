In this work, we report on the synthesis of spherically clustered MoS2 nanostructures through a facile hydrothermal route. The evolution of spherically clustered MoS2 nanostructures has been discussed using a suitable mechanism, with the aid of the electron microscopic results. The phase purity of the prepared specimens was additionally studied using Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical measurements on the MoS2 made electrodes showed a maximum specific capacitance of 122 F g-1 with better energy and power densities. The obtained results demonstrated the superiority of MoS2 made electrodes established through the present methodology to be highly suitable for supercapacitor applications.
