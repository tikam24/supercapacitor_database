Bimetallic sulfides possess great interest in energy storage application because of its multiple merits. In the present work, petal shaper CuCo2S4@GO was prepared by simple hydrothermal method and serves an active electrode to analyze for supercapacitor applications. FESEM images shows that wrapping of GO on the surface of CuCo2S4 shows petal shaped needle like structure with minute pores in it. It is noted that GO wrapped CuCo2S4 delivers the excellent electrochemical performance with the specific capacitance of about 900 Fg−1 with the capacity retention of about 80% after 5000 cycles. Addition to this asymmetric capacitor was fabricated by using CuCo2S4@ GO (3%) and AC as positive and negative electrode and delivers the higher energy and power density (47.2 Wh·kg−1, 0.896 kW·kg−1) and long cycling stability after 10,000 cycles. The electrochemical performance shows that CuCo2S4@GO will be a great electrode for energy storage applications.
