Multi-element doped mesoporous carbon materials are considered as one of the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their large specific surface area, abundant mesoporous structure, heteroatom doping and good conductivity. Herein, the N, O co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N/O-OMC) were successfully prepared by the solid-solid grinding method using KIT-6 as template, Fe(NO3)3 as catalyst, and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as source of C, N, and O. The effect of PVP amount on the structural parameters of the sample was also discussed. The resulting N/O-OMC replicated the morphology of KIT-6 and showed suitable N and O doping, a large specific surface area and an ordered dual-mesoporous structure. As the electrode materials, N/O-OMC exhibit excellent specific capacitance of 229 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate performance (79.5%) and cycle stability (92.3% after 5000 cycles). This multi-element doped mesoporous carbon material was proved a good candidate for high-performance electrode materials.
