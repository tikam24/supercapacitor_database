The Li1+xMn2-xO4 (0≤x≤1/3) spinel phases have been synthesised by wet-chemistry technique using metal acetates and succinic acid as polymeric agent. Precursors were decomposed at 400°C and heat-treated at 750°C Additionally stoichiometric powders were heat-treated at 800°C The physical properties of the synthesised products have been investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, electrical and magnetic measurements. The analysis of the intrinsic magnetic properties show that the magnetic interactions are Mn3+-O-Mn3+ interactions in a geometrically frustrated lattice, while the Mn4+-Mn4+ interactions are negligible, with the consequence that the paramagnetic Curie temperature vanishes in the limit x≈1/3, where only Mn4+ ions remain. A consistent description of both the extrinsic and the intrinsic properties including former investigations of electron paramagnetic resonance has been achieved. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
