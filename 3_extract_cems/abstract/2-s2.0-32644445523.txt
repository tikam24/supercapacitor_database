Activated carbon/carbon nanotube composite electrodes have been assembled and tested in organic electrolyte (NEt4BF4 1.5 M in acetonitrile). The performances of such cells have been compared with pure activated carbon-based electrodes. CNTs content of 15 wt.% seems to be a good compromise between power and energy, with a cell series resistance of 0.6 Ω cm2 and an active material capacitance as high as 88 F g -1. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
