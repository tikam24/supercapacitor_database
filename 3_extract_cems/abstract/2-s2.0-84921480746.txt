We demonstrate a simple method to prepare high-quality and uniform three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks through thermal degradation of graphene oxide (GO)-nitrocellulose composites over a large area. The nitrocellulose simultaneously acts as a support and aids in the reduction of GO by exothermic decomposition. The graphene networks have tunable porous morphology where the pore size can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of GO in the composite. This new technique is a very simple method to obtain 3D graphene networks and has the potential to produce 3D graphene-modified substrates for use in energy storage and conversion applications, in supporting frameworks of catalyst, and in sensors. In this report, the prepared 3D graphene networks were directly used as the electrodes of supercapacitors without using a binding agent and/or conducting additive with a high specific capacitance of 162.5 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 current density.
