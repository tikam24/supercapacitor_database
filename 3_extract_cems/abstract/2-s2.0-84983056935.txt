Hollow carbon nanospheres are considered as promising candidates for supercapacitor electrodes since they can provide excellent capacitive performance owing to their high surface area, large pore volume and uniform pore size distribution. Working as candidates for supercapacitor electrodes, hollow carbon nanospheres need to possess good electrical heating properties. Therefore, this paper investigates the electrical heating effects in hollow carbon nanospheres for a high current charge process. The nanoscale thermal transport model is employed to analyze the high current density-induced electrical heating effects in hollow carbon nanoparticles. The results reveal that the temperature in the 100 nanometer-sized hollow carbon spheres as supercapacitor electrodes is only about 28 °C for charge current 450 mA and voltage 5 V. However, the temperature in the 1000 nanometer-sized hollow carbon spheres as supercapacitor electrodes is about 175 °C for charge current 450 mA and voltage 5 V. The effects of various parameters on the electrical heating-induced temperature in hollow carbon nanospheres are also discussed.
