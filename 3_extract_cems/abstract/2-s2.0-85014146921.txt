The emerging smart power source-unitized electronics represent an utmost innovative paradigm requiring dramatic alteration from materials to device assembly and integration. However, traditional power sources with huge bottlenecks on the design and performance cannot keep pace with the revolutionized progress of shape-confirmable integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate a versatile printable technology to fabricate arbitrary-shaped, printable graphene-based planar sandwich supercapacitors based on the layer-structured film of electrochemically exfoliated graphene as two electrodes and nanosized graphene oxide (lateral size of 100 nm) as a separator on one substrate. These monolithic planar supercapacitors not only possess arbitrary shapes, e.g., rectangle, hollow-square, "A" letter, "1" and "2" numbers, circle, and junction-wire shape, but also exhibit outstanding performance (âˆ¼280 F cm-3), excellent flexibility (no capacitance degradation under different bending states), and applicable scalability, which are far beyond those achieved by conventional technologies. More notably, such planar supercapacitors with superior integration can be readily interconnected in parallel and series, without use of metal interconnects and contacts, to modulate the output current and voltage of modular power sources for designable integrated circuits in various shapes and sizes.
