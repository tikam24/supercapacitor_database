The triblock copolymer (PAA-b-PAN-b-PAA) is prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization, and then blended with polymer (PAN) and metal hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) as a precursor for heat-treatment. A composite material of hierarchical porous nanofibers and nickel oxide nanoparticles (HPCF@NiO) is prepared by electrospinning combined with high-temperature carbonization. The effects of the ratio of PAA and PAA-b-PAN-b-PAA on the internal structure of nanofibers and their electrochemical properties as positive electrode materials are investigated. The experimental results show that when the ratio of PAA to PAA-b-PAN-b-PAA is 1.3 to 0.4, it has good pore structure and excellent electrochemical performance. At the current density of 1 A/g, the specific capacitance is 188.7 F/g and the potential window is âˆ’1 V to 0.37 V. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with activated carbon as the negative electrode materials has a specific capacitance of 21.2 F/g in 2 mol/L KOH and a capacitance retention of 85.7% after 12,500 cycles at different current density.
