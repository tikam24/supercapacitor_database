An electroplating method was used for the first time to synthesize 3D porous graphene oxide (PGO) architectures, exhibiting ultrahigh capacitance and energy density as electrodes of supercapacitors. Scanning electron microscopy illustrated the porous structures which promoted the stability and alleviated the stacking of the graphene oxide layers. As investigated in a three-electrode supercapacitor cell, PGO electrodes exhibited the maximum capacitance and energy of 973 F·g-1 and 98.4 Wh·Kg-1, which are better than current reports and comparable to batteries. At 4 A·g-1 for high-power applications, PGO electrodes reached a capacitance, energy, and power density of 493 F·g-1, 49.9 Wh·Kg-1, and 1700 W·Kg-1, and they retained ∼97.83% of capacitance after 10 000 charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, when the PGO was bent exaggeratedly, it still displayed identical properties, which is of important significance for supporting wearable devices.
