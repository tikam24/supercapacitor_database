Graphene/Mn 3O 4 composites were prepared by a simple hydrothermal process from KMnO 4 using ethylene glycol as a reducing agent. Mn 3O 4 nanorods of 100 nm to 1 μm length were observed to be well-dispersed on graphene sheets. To assess the properties of these materials for use in supercapacitors, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charging-discharging measurements were performed. Graphene/Mn 3O 4 composites could be charged and discharged faster and had higher capacitance than free Mn 3O 4 nanorods. The capacitance of the composites was 100% retained after 10 000 cycles at a charging rate of 5 A/g. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
