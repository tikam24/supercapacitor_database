High capacitance and high output voltage are two important research focuses of electrochemical supercapacitors. Herein we present two novel designs (laminated and tandem) of coin-cell supercapacitors based on a textile coated with active material. The fabric electrodes were prepared by dipping the non-woven cloth into a dispersion of carbon nanotubes and subsequent MnO 2 electrodeposition. In the lamination configuration, several pieces of active-material-coated cloth were laminated to construct individual electrodes that enable fold-increased areal capacitances and excellent cycling stability. In the tandem structure, individual cells with solid-state electrolyte (polyvinyl alcohol/H3PO4) sandwiched between the fabric electrodes were stacked together to form a single device. The assembled device composed by ten unit cells was demonstrated to drive four LED digital screens in series with 10 V output. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
