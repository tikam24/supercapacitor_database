Doping strategy with optimized particle size is an appealing way to manipulate the electrochemical energy storage mechanism of metal oxides for supercapacitor applications. Herein, we reported the optimized co-precipitation method to synthesize the pure and Sm doped BaMoO4 nanostructures for energy storage application. More number of hydrophilic group present in the Sm doped candidate favors for easy adsorption of OH− ions to support for oxidation/reduction reaction. With abundant redox couple, optimized particle size, nano porous nature, and surface area (14.74 m2g−1), Sm doped BaMoO4 electrode exhibited high 135 F/g capacitance at 1 A/g. Lowest 2.3 Ω Rct value was reported and evidenced for high conductivity of Sm doped electrode. Hence, this work provides a great insight toward the rare earth elements supported scheelite type molybdate nanostructures for energy storage and conversion applications.
