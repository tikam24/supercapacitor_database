Herein, we report a simple strategy for the rational design of a three-dimensional carbon material, in situ nitrogen-doped porous multi-nano-channel carbon nanorods (N-MCNR), using immiscible polymers blends. A series of N-MCNR with discrete and well-connected continuous nanochannels ranging from 18 to 75 nm in size was developed. The N-MCNR developed in this work represents the good controllability of nanopores and nanochannels integrated at the nanoscale level. Three-dimensional N-MCNR nanostructured materials have been recommended as a promising electrode material for use in high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). A prototypical pouch-type symmetric SC was assembled and operated under practical application conditions. The N-MCNR-based symmetric SC device fabricated in this study delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 335 F g-1at 0.25 A g-1 with corresponding energy density of 11.2 Wh kg-1, and also exhibited an outstanding long-term cycle stability of 50 000 cycles, with 92.6% charge retention.
