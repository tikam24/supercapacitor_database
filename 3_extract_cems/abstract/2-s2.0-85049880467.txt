This paper describes the initial development of a low-cost Lagrangian drifter based on solar panels, ultracapacitor and open hardware-software platform. The drifter is powered by a solar panel and a single Ultracapacitor that stores the energy. The drifter has a sensor suite formed by a GPS, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity sensors and a camera. The energy management and signal processing from sensors is supported by an Arduino Mega development board. The communications between the ground station and a deployed drifter is based on Iridium Satellite Terminal. All mechanical and electronic components are self-contained in a pressure housing. The main purpose of this Lagrangian drifter is: detect a red tide near Ecuadorian coasts, obtain physical-chemical parameters in-situ then send the measurements trough a satellite network to a ground station. Results from sea trials are shown.
