Hybrid Microgrids supersede traditional AC Micro-grids as they eliminate inverting equipment and reduce power losses caused by the AC/DC converters. Hybrid grids also isolate DC sources and loads to the DC side and AC interfaces to the AC side of the microgrid. However, microgrids are inherently low inertia systems, and their inertia control is an actively discussed topic. The impact of low inertia is particularly huge in hybrid grids, and it can lead to instability of both AC and DC sub-grids and eventual system failure. This work proposes an improved two-stage control scheme for the bidirectional converter that interfaces the two sub-grids to prevent this total blackout. The first stage of the converter is controlled as a virtual-synchronous machine to form the AC grid and support the voltage and frequency. The second stage controls the voltage to the build-in supercapacitor. Thus, it augments the inertia of the grid and supports maintaining stability. The proposed approach provides a smooth voltage transition and a better system dynamic response.
