Flexible magnetite (Fe3O4) based film electrodes were fabricated by combining facile wet chemistry approaches with a cost-effective spray deposition route. One-dimensional Fe3O4 nanowire and pyrrole treated Fe3O4 nanowire electrodes composed of randomly oriented interpenetrating networks exhibited a high capacitance of 106 F g-1 and 190 F g-1 respectively along with excellent electrochemical stability in an aqueous electrolyte. The supercapacitor configurations and the scalable fabrication technique provides a new solution for large-scale production of printable and flexible energy storage devices.
