In this work, a highly efficient free-standing flexible electrode material for capacitive deionization and supercapacitors was reported. The reported porous carbon shows a high surface area of 2070.4 m2 g-1 with a pore volume of 0.8208 cm3 g-1. The material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 357 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in a two-electrode symmetric setup. A solid-state supercapacitor device has been fabricated with a total cell capacitance of 152.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in a solid PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte with an energy density of 21.18 W h kg-1 at a 501.63 W kg-1power density. A long-run stability test was carried out up to 15,000 cycles at 5 A g-1 that showed capacitance retention of 99% with âˆ¼100% Coulombic efficiency. Furthermore, the electrosorption experiment was conducted by a flow-through test by coating on commercially available cellulose thread that was employed, which shows electrosorption ability up to 16.5 mg g-1 at 1.2 V in a 500 mg L-1 NaCl solution. Complete experiments were conducted with a proper procedure, provided by scientific approaches with analytical data. Thus, the reported electrode material showed bifunctional application for energy storage and environmental remediation.
