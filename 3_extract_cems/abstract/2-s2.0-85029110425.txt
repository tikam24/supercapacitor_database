In this study, cobalt sulfide (CoS) electrodes are synthesized using various solvents such as water, ethanol and a combination of the two via a facile chemical bath deposition method on Ni foam. The crystalline nature, chemical states and surface morphology of the prepared CoS nanoparticles are characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transition electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of CoS electrodes are also evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. When used as an electrode for a supercapacitor, CoS prepared with ethanol as a solvent exhibits a capacitance of 41.36 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1, which is significantly better than that prepared using water and water/ethanol-based solvents (31.66 and 18.94 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1, respectively). This superior capacitance is attributed to the ideal surface morphology of the solvent, which allows for easy diffusion of electrolyte ions into the inner region of the electrode. High electrical conduction enables a high rate capability. These results suggest that CoS nanoparticles are highly promising for energy storage applications as well as photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, water splitting and solar cells, among others. These results show that CoS is a promising positive electrode material for practical supercapacitors.
