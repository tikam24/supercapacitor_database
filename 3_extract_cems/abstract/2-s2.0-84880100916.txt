The paper presents the synthesis and characterization of Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films prepared by the simple and low cost successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The TiO2 thin films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), FT-IR, FT-Raman and UV-VIS spectroscopy techniques. The SEM study of TiO2 shows the cracked morphology on the substrate surface. The characteristic peaks of TiO2 are observed in the FT-IR and FT-Raman studies. The optical study shows band gap of 3.3 eV. The cyclic voltammetry study shows the specific capacitance of 16 F.g-1. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
