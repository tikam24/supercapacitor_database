ZnSnO3 (ZTO), a ternary pseudocapacitive material had received great interest due to its multifunctional characteristics for diverse applications. In this work, ternary ZnSnO3@carbon composite was prepared using co-precipitation and calcination routes. The composites with different weight ratios of pre-activated garden waste: ZTO source (GW: ZTO) were synthesised and the crystallinity was examined by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphology and specific surface area were further observed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET). GW-ZTO1 achieved the highest specific capacitance of 104 Fg−1 at the current density of 0.3 Ag−1. Analysis from the plots of 1/C vs v1/2 and C vs v−1/2 indicated that 90% of the capacitance was contributed through the insertion process in GW-ZTO1 and highlighted the role of ZnSnO3 in total capacitance. Moreover, GW-ZTO1 exhibited excellent durability characteristic with more than 80% retention after a prolonged cycling process (5000 cycles) over various current densities. The electrochemical outcomes signified ZnSnO3@carbon composite as a competitive material for supercapacitor application.
