Formic acid-doped polyaniline nanomaterils with different morphology have been synthesized successfully by interfacial polymerization with FeCl3 as oxidant and HCOOH as dopant. The morphology and structure of polyaniline were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with the polyaniline as active electrode material and 1 mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. These results show that polyaniline with different morphology depend on the concentration of formic acid. polyaniline with fiber morphology has better power characteristic and cycle performance in the application of supercapacitor, whose specific capacitance is about 292.2F/g at the current density of 15mA/cm2. After 500 charge-discharge cycles its specific capacitance was about 200.6F/g and its capacitance retention is 68.7%.
