In this work, symmetric activated-carbon-based electrodes in supercapacitors cells comprising PYR14 TFSL ionic liquid electrolyte, were studied. The electrochemical window of the cells was determined via cyclic voltammetry and cycle life and was set as 3-0V. The energy density of the supercapacitor cells is 23Wh/kg at 0.17A/g (normalized per mass of the active material). The above capacitor cells were cycled for 140,000 cycles with 9% decrease in the capacitance. However, the resistance of the cell was increased by 100%. The present findings demonstrate that incorporation of ionic liquids as electrolytes in carbon-carbon symmetric supercapacitors is an effective and promising approach to increase the energy density of supercapacitors.
