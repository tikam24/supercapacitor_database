Ultrathin α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets are prepared by exfoliation of α-Ni(OH)2 intercalated with SDS in formamide. Layered α-Ni(OH)2/RGO composites are further synthesized through a facile electrostatic self-assembly method combined with a hydrazine-reduction approach. The resulting α-Ni(OH)2/RGO composites show high specific capacitance of 1568.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good rate capability even at a high current density in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, α-Ni(OH)2/RGO//AC ASC exhibits a wide cell-voltage of 1.8 V and a maximum specific capacitance of 168.8 F g−1 with an energy density up to 76 Wh kg−1. It can still deliver a high energy density of 51.5 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 8512.6 W kg−1, and achieve a superior cycling stability with 92.4% retention after 2000 cycles. The outstanding characteristic of α-Ni(OH)2/RGO composite suggests it is a promising candidate for supercapacitor devices and energy-storage applications.
