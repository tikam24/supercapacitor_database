The pyrolysis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is an effective strategy for the synthesis of novel nanoporous structures for energy storage applications. In this work, the preparation of a zirconium oxide/carbon (ZrO2/C) nanocomposite via the pyrolysis of UiO-66 (a zirconium-based MOF) is reported for the first time. These MOF-derived metal oxide/carbon (ZrO2/C) materials have a great advantage in the case of supercapacitor applications over other MOFs or their derivatives as they do not need any external conductive agent. The ZrO2/C electrode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance, delivering a specific capacitance of 241.5 F/g at 1 A/g current density. A 2 V symmetrical supercapacitor device is also prepared by employing a solid-state polymer gel electrolyte. The assembled device of ZrO2/C electrode has delivered a high energy density of around 29 Wh/kg (at a high power density of 1.5 kW/kg) while retaining almost 97% of the specific capacitance even after 2000 continuous charge/discharge cycles.
