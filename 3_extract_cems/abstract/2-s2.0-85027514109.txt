A high-performance, all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device was assembled successfully. The ZnCo2O4 nanowire array (NA)/carbon nanotube film (CNTF) positive electrode materials and the assembled device possess areal specific capacitances of 1.019 F cm−2 and 158.08 mF cm−2, respectively. A supernal volume energy density of 49.5 mWh cm−3 was obtained when the voltage window increased to 1.5 V. Moreover, the assembled HSC device exhibited good cycling stability with 90.7% initial capacitance retention after 6000 cycles, and the coulombic efficiency remained near 100%.
