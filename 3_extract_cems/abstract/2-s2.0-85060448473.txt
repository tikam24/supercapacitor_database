Vanadium-based metal oxides have attracted widespread attention as a promising candidate for electrode materials owing to the novel morphologies and the wide range of practical applications. In this work, the microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method was used for the first time to synthesize CoV2O6 micron blocks and Co3V2O8 nanoparticles. Briefly, heating the solution to 100 Â°C and adjusting the pH can result in desired micro blocks and nanoparticles within 10 min. After systematic characterization of material structures and morphologies, the resulted two materials were further fabricated to electrodes, and thoroughly characterized their electrochemical performances. The test results showed that both the two cobalt vanadates had a great potential as supercapacitor electrode materials. Moreover, by adjusting the pH of the solution, the type and morphology of the synthesized product could be precisely controlled, which could largely affect the electrochemical properties of the materials.
