Porous carbon materials with a synergistically large specific surface area (SBET) and an adjustable structure are urgently needed to meet the demands of high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) and other electrochemical devices. Although numerous studies have been dedicated to designing multifunctional porous carbons, most of them still have shown hard-control doping sites and unclear structures. Herein, we prepare a series of structure-controlled F/N co-doped porous carbons (FNCs) with large SBET via an in situ doping process based on F- and N-rich covalent triazine-based frameworks (FCTFs) as precursors. The as-prepared high-F/N-containing FNC-700 with a large SBET (âˆ¼1849.1 m2 g-1) as the aqueous-based SC electrode achieves a specific capacitance (Cs) of 326 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, remarkable cyclability with negligible capacitance decay after 10,000 cycles in three-electrode systems, and a maximum energy density of 31.4 Wh kg-1 in two-electrode systems. This study has an insightful hint in exploring multifunctional heteroatom-doped carbons by the in situ doping process.
