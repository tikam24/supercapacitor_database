The corn-starch based porous carbon was synthesized using two step process and characterized. Also, a highly conducting ionic liquid doped polymer electrolyte was sandwiched between electrodes. The conductivity and specific capacitance of electrolyte and electrode of a capacitor was calculated using different characterization techniques.
