A high-performance symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using a Na0.33V2O5 nanocomposite synthesized by means of a simple co-precipitation technique. The structural and morphological investigation showed that the synthesized Na0.33V2O5 nanocomposite exhibited a monoclinic structure with a nanorod-like morphology. The electrochemical properties of the Na0.33V2O5 symmetric supercapacitor were studied utilizing three different aqueous electrolytes, such as 1 M of LiCl, NaCl and KCl, respectively. Interestingly, the fabricated Na0.33V2O5 symmetric supercapacitors exhibited excellent electrochemical capacitance behaviour in all the electrolytes with a maximum specific capacitance value of 168 F g−1 in 1 M LiCl, 146 F g−1 in 1 M NaCl and 132 F g−1 in 1 M KCl electrolytes at 0.5 A g−1 discharge current density. In addition, Na0.33V2O5 symmetric supercapacitors demonstrated an excellent cyclic stability in 1 M NaCl electrolyte with high capacitance retention of approximately 81 % after 50 000 charge/discharge cycles.
