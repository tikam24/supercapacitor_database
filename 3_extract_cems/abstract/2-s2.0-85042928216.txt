The aim of the presented paper is the study of an optimal integration of Supercapacitor based storage system and Inductive Power Transfer system for the free-catenary operation of a tramway. The paper starts from the definition of the Inductive Power transfer pad system and proposed an optimal integration strategy for the correct size of on-board supercapacitors and the inductive energy transfer.
