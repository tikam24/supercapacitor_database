3D graphene holds promise as electrode materials for electric double layer capacitors due to its unique porous network structure, large specific surface area and excellent optical, electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. In this paper, 3D coal-based graphene (3D-CG) was prepared from coal by a combined technique involving the catalytic thermal treatment, modified Hummers method and one-step hydrothermal self-assembly method. The morphologies and structures of the samples were examined by TEM, SEM, XRD, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of 3D-CG materials in 6 mol/L KOH, 1 mol/L H2SO4 and 1 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte were systematically studied by galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) tests. The results indicated the good capacitive performance and stability of 3D-CG, as the specific capacitance was 288.9 F/g in 6 mol/L KOH aqueous electrolyte, with a high retention ratio of 91.6% even after 1 000 cycles.
