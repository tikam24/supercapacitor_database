In the carbon-based energy storage applications, the abundant pore structure and good graphitization of porous carbon are helpful to improve its adsorption capacity and electron transfer capacity on the surface of electrolyte ions. Therefore, the synergistic regulation of pore structure and graphitization degree of porous carbon is an important aspect of the synergistic regulation of porous carbon material. However, during the porous carbon preparation, the evolution of pore and microcrystalline structure is interdependent and difficult to coordinate. In this paper, a one-step K2CO3 high-temperature activation process was proposed based on the pore formation and catalytic graphitization of K-based components in a high-temperature etching reaction, which realized the synergistic regulation of coal-based porous carbon pore and graphitization degree. The obtained coal-based porous carbon exhibited excellent performance in electrolyte ion adsorption and storage. Research results show that the porous structure obtained by the one-step K2CO3 chemical activation evolved from ultramicropores to micropores and hierarchical pores. The carbon structure changed from amorphous to graphitized, and the synergistic development of porous structure and microcrystals was realized when temperature increased up to 1000â„ƒ. As electrode material for the symmetric capacitor device with organic electrolyte, the obtained hierarchical porous carbon with graphene-like structure had a higher specific capacitance, higher rate performance, and higher operation stability.
