There has been increasing interest on various properties and applications of electronically conducting polymers. Polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) is an interesting polymer of this type as it exhibits very high ionic conductivity. In the present study, PEDOT has been electrochemically deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrate for supercapacitor studies. PEDOT/SS electrodes prepared in 0.1M H2SO4 in presence of a surfactant, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), have been found to yield higher specific capacitance (SC) than the electrodes prepared from neutral aqueous electrolyte. The effects of concentration of H2SO4, concentration of SDS, potential of deposition, and nature of supporting electrolytes used for capacitor studies on SC of the PEDOT/SS electrodes have been studied. SC values as high as 250 F/g in 1M oxalic acid have been obtained during the initial stages of cycling. However, there is a rapid decrease in SC on repeated charge-discharge cycling. Spectroscopic data reflect structural changes in PEDOT on extended cycling. Â© 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
