Graphene aerogel (GA) supported flower-like ferrous disulfide (FeS2) composite was synthesis by a two-step self-assembly method using eco-friendly and low-cost precursors. The formation of well-crystallized pyrite FeS2 and the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) was demonstrated by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. According to the scanning electron microscopy images, the flower-like FeS2 distributes uniformly on the inter-linking GA networks. The electrochemical tests indicate that the as-prepared GA-FeS2 exhibits enhanced specific capacitance (313.6 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g), which is almost twice as high as that of bare FeS2 (163.5 F/g). It is noticed that this composite also has excellent cyclability (88.2% retention after 2000 cycles at 10 A/g) and low transfer resistance. A symmetric supercapacitor device with wide potential range was assembled using GA-FeS2, while its energy density could reach 22.86 Wh/kg. The excellent specific capacitance, good rate capability, and high energy density make it a promising candidate for next generation supercapacitors.
