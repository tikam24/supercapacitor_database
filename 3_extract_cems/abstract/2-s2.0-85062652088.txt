Most of the supercapacitors reported in literatures showed little or no flexibility in the working temperature around 150°C. However, the supercapacitors are generally exposed under complex system or extreme temperature, such as electric vehicles and extremely cold area. Herein, we successfully fabricated a large-scale robust nanocarbon hybrid film consisting of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and MnOx nano-flowers with the size up to 550 cm2. The mechanical properties of the hybrid films depend on the ratio of CNTs. The supercapacitors prepared with the hybrid films exhibit high flexibility and keep their performances in a temperature range from −20 to 200°C. In addition, the devices display remarkable electrochemical and deformation stability at extreme temperature. This strategy has a potential for the more efficient preparation of flexible electrode materials.
