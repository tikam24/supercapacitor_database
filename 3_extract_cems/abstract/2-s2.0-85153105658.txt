Continuous efforts are on from scientists to develop new and efficient materials for their use in energy storage and conversion devices. Recently, Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) have paved their way for the application of them as electroactive materials in supercapacitor devices. The LDHs are considered attractive materials because of their various tunable properties. But, along with many fruitful properties, the main drawback of LDHs is their structural instability. This can be overcomed by addition of different materials such as conducting polymers (CPs) and by preparation of nanocomposites of them. CPs can be advantageous as they act as current carrier as well as binder, which can help LDHs bind very well to the substrate. This timely short review uniquely focuses on recent works done in the area of LDHs-CPs-based nanocomposites for supercapacitor application. The importance of LDHs-CPs-based materials is highlighted by referring to the relevant and latest important examples from the literature. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
