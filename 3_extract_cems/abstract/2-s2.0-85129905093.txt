In this work, the assembly of lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is described by pairing conversion type CuO nanoparticles recovered from the Cu current collector of spent lithium-ion batteries (r-CuO) as battery type electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the capacitor type electrode. The Li-storage property of r-CuO is studied in the presence of two binders (polyvinylidene fluoride, PVDF and carboxymethylcellulose, CMC) and found the aptness of CMC in comparison with PVDF. Accordingly, the Li/r-CuO half-cells with CMC binder exhibits better electrochemical performance such that even after 150 charge–discharge cycles, the cells could retain a specific capacity of ≈680 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. The assembled LIC (AC/r-Cu0+Li2O) having electrochemically pre-lithiated r-CuO phase with balanced mass loading of AC can exhibit a maximum energy density of 65.6 Wh kg−1 with excellent cyclic stability at 2 A g−1 for 10,000 cycles with ≈80% capacity retention. It is worth mentioning that the thus fabricated LIC shows decent performance at high (50 °C) and low (−5 and 10 °C) temperature conditions.
