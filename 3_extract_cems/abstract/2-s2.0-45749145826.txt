Layered LiC1-2yNiyMnyO2 materials were synthesized with high homogeneity and crystallinity using the wet-chemical method assisted by oxalic acid as polymeric agent. The long-range and local structural properties are investigated with experiments including X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, Raman scattering, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The evolution of the structure is discussed as a function of the cobalt content, which confers layer-like behavior on the framework. Studies of the lithium extraction from the host lattices are also reported. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
