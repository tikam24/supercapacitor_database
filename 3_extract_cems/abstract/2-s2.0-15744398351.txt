Amorphous hydrous nanostructured MnO2 was synthesized in chemical coprecipitation method by mixing KMnO4 and manganese acetate aqueous solution using polyethylene glycol(PEG) as disperser. The product was characterized by SEM, TEM, FT-IR, XRD and BET. The results show that the amorphous hydrous nanoparticles with the mean particle size of 10-30 nm were obtained and BET specific surface areas are 160.7 m2/g. Electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Amorphous α-MnO2 · nH2O in 1 mol/L Na 2SO4 aqueous electrolyte was proved to be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of 203.4 F/g was obtained at the scan rate of 4 mV/s in the range of -0.2-0.9 V (vs.SCE).
