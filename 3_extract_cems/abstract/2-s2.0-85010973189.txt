Two structures composed of ZnCo2O4micro-flowers and ZnCo2O4micro-sheets on Ni foam were synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method and annealing treatment. These two different structures were evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitors. The ZnCo2O4micro-flowers electrodes offer specific capacitance of 2256 F/g at 2 mA/cm2, excellent rate capability of 84% as the current density increasing from 2 to 20 mA/cm2. The ZnCo2O4micro-sheets electrodes could achieve a specific capacitance of 2037 F/g at 2 mA/cm2and low rate capability of 46% as the current density increasing from 2 to 20 mA/cm2. The reasons of these different electrochemical performances of ZnCo2O4micro-flowers and ZnCo2O4micro-sheets are discussed. This study provides a comprehension of structure dependent of the electrochemical performance of electrodes.
