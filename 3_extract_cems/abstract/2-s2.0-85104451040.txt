In this work electrochemical performance of thin composite films consisted of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), graphene oxide (GOx) and oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (oxMWCNTs) is investigated in various sulphates (Li2SO4, Na2SO4, K2SO4, MgSO4) and acidic (H2SO4) electrolytes. Capacitance values, rate capability and cycling stability achieved for the composite layers are correlated with the electrolytes’ properties such as the conductivity, viscosity, cation size and pH. The highest capacitance values are achieved in acidic solution (98.6 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2), whereas cycling stability is better in neutral electrolytes (88.4% of initial capacitance value after 10′000 cycles recorded for symmetric supercapacitor in 0.5 M MgSO4 solution). Diffusion controlled and non-diffusion controlled capacitance contributions are calculated and the results are discussed considering various ranges of sweep rates taken into account in the linear fitting and extrapolation of parameters.
