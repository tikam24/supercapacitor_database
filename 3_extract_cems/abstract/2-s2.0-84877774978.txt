A symmetric micro-supercapacitor is constructed by electrochemically depositing manganese oxide onto micro-patterned current collectors. High surface-to-volume ratio of manganese oxide and short diffusion distance between electrodes give an ultra-high areal capacitance of 56.3 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> at a current density of 27.2 μA cm<sup>-2</sup>. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
