In this paper, a new type of nitrogen-doped carbon fiber/molybdenum disulfide (N-CFs/MoS2) hybrid electrode materials are prepared via a certain concentration in solvothermal synthesis followed by a high-temperature carbonization process and using the carboxymethylcellulose ammonium (CMC-NH4) as a structure-directing agent for MoS2 nanosheet growth during the solvothermal synthesis process. The addition of CMC-NH4 effectively prevents the agglomeration of MoS2 nanosheets to increase the specific surface area. Moreover, it not only serves as a carbon source to provide conductive pathways, but also introduces N atoms to improve the conductivity of the CFs and promote the transfer of electrons and ions. This ultimately increases the conductivity of the electrode materials. Thus, the as-prepared N-CFs/MoS2 hybrids exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance is up to 572.6 F g-1 under a current density of 0.75 A g-1 and the specific capacitance retained 98% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles of charge-discharge tests at a current density of 2.5 A g-1. Moreover, the hybrids show a maximum energy density of 19.5 W h kg-1 at a power density of 94 W kg-1. Therefore, the as-prepared N-CFs/MoS2 hybrids with remarkable electrochemical properties, low cost and environment protection show potential for practical application in the development of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices.
