A direct-readout photoelectrochemical (PEC) lab-on-paper device based on coupled an electricity generating system and paper supercapacitors was established for highly sensitive detection of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Concretely, CdSe quantum dots (QDs) decorated ZnO networks assembled sensing surface provided outstanding photoelectric properties, on which glucose oxidase (GOx) labeled aptamer was subsequently immobilized via the hybridization chain reaction. With analytes present, specific recognition was stimulated by aptamer, resulting in labeled GOx released. Such released GOx could flow to electrochemical cell to conduct electrochemical redox reactions, which could effectively produce electricity that was stored by capacitor I. Sequentially, photoactive material produced an outstanding voltage due to the decrease of steric hindrance on the sensing interface, which was utilized for charging an external capacitor II. The two instantaneous current was acquired along with the discharge of capacitor I and II by digital multimeter (DMM) readout, respectively. The summational current values performed an increment in pace with the addition of target ATP concentration with the dynamic working range from 10 nM to 3 Î¼M and a detection limit of 6.3 nM attained. Significantly, the signal amplified strategy utilizing as-generated electricity from electrochemical redox reactions were isolated from the photoelectrodes, which was beneficial for amplifying the signal response in the PEC matrices and the development of more efficient signal performance.
