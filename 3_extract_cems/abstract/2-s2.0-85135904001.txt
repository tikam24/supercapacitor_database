MXenes, a family of the typical two-dimensional materials, that are considered to be an excellent candidate material for supercapacitors, due to their large surface area, high conductivity and high specific pseudocapacitance. However, when assembled into electrode, MXene nanosheets are easy to aggregate because of the strong Van der Waals force. The assembled dense structure will limit the transport of electrolyte, decrease the active sites and electrochemical performance. In this work, in order to suppress the self-restacking of nanosheets and introduce more electrolyte transport channels, Ti3C2Tx nanosheets are partially oxidized and etched to get porous nanosheets. Film electrode based on porous Ti3C2Tx nanosheets shows higher specific surface area (48.3 m2/g) and improved electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance of 385 F/g at 1 A/g and good cycle stability of 92 % after 10,000 CV cycles at 100 mV/s.
