This work focuses on design and fabrication of selective and sensitive electrochemical sensor for detection of neurotransmitter drug dopamine on SnS-C quantum dots modified glassy carbon electrode. The microwave irradiation approach was used to make SnS-C quantum dots in a simple one-step process. Highly porous nanocrystalline SnS quantum dots were synthesized in a facile approach. Though the SnS-C quantum dots were reported for battery and supercapacitor applications, limited reports are there in sensor fields. XRD, SEM, XPS, UVâ€“Vis DRS, pore size distribution methods, and other techniques were used to characterize the quantum dots that were manufactured. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and chronoamperometric method were utilized to investigate the performance of the changed electrodes. The LOD of 30 nM has been observed, and high selectivity has been obtained for these synthesized quantum dots.
