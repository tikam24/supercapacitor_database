Rational construction of transitional metal oxides electrode materials with suitable structure and composition is an effective strategy of improving their electrochemical performance. Herein, novel MCo2O4 hierarchical nanofibers (H-MCo2O4NFs, M = Ni, Co and Mn) were fabricated by a multi-step self-templating method using electrospun nanofibers as precursors. Benefiting from the unique structure, such as numerous of vertically interlinked nanosheets on the surface and 1D interwoven nanofibers networks, the obtained H[sbnd]NiCo2O4NFs electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1750 F g−1 (At a current density of 0.5 A g−1), good rate capability (Capacitance retention of 70% at 20 A g−1), and outstanding cycling stability (Capacitance retention of 92% after 6000 cycles). Moreover, the solid-state hybrid supercapacitor assembled by H[sbnd]NiCo2O4NFs and activated carbon (AC), delivers a high energy density of 38.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability. Thus, the H[sbnd]NiCo2O4NFs is a promising candidate material for supercapacitors electrode and this self-templating method in this work also provides a new path for the preparation of one-dimensional hierarchical metallic oxides.
