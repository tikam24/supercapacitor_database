In this work, Co-phthalocyanin/CNTs nanocomposite has been produced, evaluated, and used as an effective supercapacitor. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations validate the structure of the new nanocomposite (PcCo@CNTs). In 6.0 M KOH electrolyte, the electrochemical activities of PcCo@CNTs composite are measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GSCD). The PcCo@CNTs composite has a high specific capacitance of 1112 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, as well as a high energy density of 55.6 Wh kg−1. According to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) procedure, adding CNTs to Co-phthalocyanin considerably increases the surface area and pore volume of the supercapacitor material. Additionally, the PcCo@CNTs composite exhibits high cyclability and capacitance retention of 95%. Generally, the PcCo@CNTs composite shows significant promise for improving the energy density of supercapacitors.
