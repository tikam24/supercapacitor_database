Here, a novel Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam was successfully synthesized by onestep hydrothermal method. At the same time, the diameter of Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire grown on Ni foam was easily controlled by the reaction times. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam were analyzed and compared by the cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that the capacitive properties of Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam were related to the diameter of Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire. The composite foam containing Ni3S2@MoS2 nanowire with diameter of ca.320.0nm showed high rate capability of 10.8 F cm-2 at 5.0mA cm-2 and good cycle stability with capacitance retention of 83.0% after 1000 cycles. The capability was obviously higher comparing to others Ni3S2 grown on Ni foam reported in previous works. These results implied that the design of Ni3S2@MoS2 grown on Ni foam without polymer binder was an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications.
