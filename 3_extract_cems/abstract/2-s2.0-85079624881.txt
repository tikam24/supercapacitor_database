This paper describes the properties of a lead-free ceramic material based on barium titanate, designed for the construction of ultracapacitors and sensors used in mechatronic systems. The admixture of lanthanum (La3+) served as a modifier. The ceramic powders were obtained by the solid phase reaction method (conventional method-mixed oxides method-MOM). Technological conditions of the synthesis process were determined on the basis of thermal analysis. The obtained samples are characterized, at room temperature (Tr < TC), by a single-phase tetragonal structure and a P4mm space group. Properly developed large grains (d = 5 μm) contributed to the increase in electric permittivity, the maximum value of which is at the level of " εm ≈ 112,000, as well as to a strong decrease in specific resistance in the ferroelectric phase, whereas above the Curie temperature, by creating a potential barrier at their boundaries, there was a a rapid increase in resistivity. The temperature coefficient of resistance of the obtained posistor is 10.53%/K. The electrical properties of the obtained ceramics were examined using impedance spectroscopy. In order to analyze the obtained results, a method of comparing the behavior of the real object and its replacement system in a specific frequency region was used, whereas the Kramer-Kroning (K-K) test was used to determine the consistency of the measured data. The proper selection of the stoichiometry and synthesis conditions resulted in the creation of an appropriate concentration of donor levels and oxygen gaps, which in turn resulted in a significant increase in the value of electrical permittivity, with small values of the angle of dielectric loss tangent. This fact predisposes the discussed material for certain applications (in the construction of ultracapacitors, among others).
