This article presents results of a pulsed UV laser method for the simultaneous reduction of graphite oxide (GO)and patterning of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This direct laser writing method was applied to the fabrication of graphene-based, in-plane interdigitated micro-supercapacitors (μ-SCs), prepared on free-standing GO paper (10 μm thick). The electrochemical performance of μ-SCs was studied using two different electrolytes (KOH and NaCl). The results from cyclic voltammetry measurements exhibited typical electrical double layer behavior, with specific capacitances of 9.3 μF/cm2 and 13.8 μF/cm2 (at a scan rate of 10 mV/s)for KOH and NaCl electrolytes, respectively. The μ-SCs exhibited good performance, with retention of 95% of the original capacitance values after 3400 charge-discharge cycles. When compared to devices obtained by conventional lithographic techniques, the laser fabrication of planar μ-SCs is faster, cost-effective and scalable. We believe this one-step and environmentally friendly laser-assisted method to be a good alternative for the fabrication of flexible energy storage devices.
