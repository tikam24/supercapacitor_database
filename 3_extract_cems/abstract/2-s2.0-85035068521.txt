Aligned reclaimed carbon fiber (RCF) was reused as a conductive support to load hierarchical molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) spheres and thus MoS2/RCF composite was constructed. The synthesis of MoS2 and its loading were simultaneously completed during a facile hydrothermal process. This MoS2/RCF was directly utilized as the negative electrode for supercapacitor without any further process, which exhibited superior electrochemical performance: A specific capacitance of 225 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by coupling this MoS2/RCF electrode (−) with MnO2/RCF electrode (+), which delivered an energy density of 22.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 703 W kg−1 over a wide potential range of 1.7 V. This RCF may be a promising conductive support candidate for those electrodes in the energy storage devices.
