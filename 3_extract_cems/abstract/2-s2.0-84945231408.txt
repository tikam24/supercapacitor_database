A study concerning the effect of TiO2 on duck eggshell membrane as separator in supercapacitor applications. Concentration of TiO2 on duck eggshell membrane are 1 %wt, 5 %wt and 10 %wt respectively. Construction capacitor cell is shaped sandwich system. Membrane separator placed in the midst of the two carbon electrodes containing H2SO4 solution. From the micrograph Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), it observed that TiO2 particles in all samples are uniform in size. At concentration of 1 %wt, TiO2 particles covered all fiber of duck eggshell membrane, but not many pore is formed while at concentration of 5%, the TiO2 particles fill the pores between the fibers, thus causing the pores between the fibers get smaller and multiplied in number. However, if the TiO2 particles added is the more than 10 %wt, the particles will actually cover the pores between the fibers of the membrane. Characteristics of the capacitor was measured by using Edaq cyclic voltameter. Maximum value of specifics capacitance (Csp) was 2.3 F / g, with current 0.007 mA and voltage of 0.002 V. This value occurs at a concentration of 5 wt% TiO2 on the charging time for 20 seconds.
