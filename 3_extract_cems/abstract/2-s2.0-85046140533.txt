To explore a high-performance electrode material for a supercapacitor, Co-decorated MoS2 nanosheets (CMS) were fabricated using a simple one-pot hydrothermal method. The obtained CMS were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS, and their energy storage performance was also evaluated for use as an electrode material in a supercapacitor. The decoration of the Co can reduce the crystalline size and remarkably enhance the energy storage ability of the pure MoS2 nanosheets, achieving a capacity of 510 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is among the best for MoS2-based electrode materials, permitting its use in supercapacitors. This strategy can also be extended to the optimization of other transition metal dichalcogenides for use in the energy storage and conversion fields.
