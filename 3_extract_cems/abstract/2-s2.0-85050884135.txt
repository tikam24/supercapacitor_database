We herein reports the preparation and characterization of hybrid carbon nanofibers (CNFs) based on polyimide (PI) and manganese dioxide (MnCh) as self-standing and binder-free superacapacitor electrodes, which are prepared via electrospinning, imidization, and carbonization of mixed solutions of PI precursor, poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), and manganese acetate. The microstructures and morphological features of the hybrid CNFs are characterized as a function of carbonization temperature. The electrochemical performance of the hybrid CNFs as self-standing supercapacitor electrodes is investigated with aids of cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge test.
