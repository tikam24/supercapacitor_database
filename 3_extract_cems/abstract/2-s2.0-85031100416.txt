This paper studied a power distribution control strategy of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). In HESS, battery is as a main power source and an ultra-capacitor (UC) is as an auxiliary power source. Regarding the power stage of energy conversion, a boost converter is connected with the main source and a buck-boost converter is connected with the auxiliary source. The objectives of the control strategy are as follows: (1) stabilize DC bus voltage regulations, (2) perfectly trace the current reference of super capacitor, (3) achieve asymptotic stability of the closed loop system. The HESS and control strategy are modelled and simulated under the Matlab Advisor simulation environment, and a prototype of HESS is also built. The results show that the designed control strategy meets all the objectives. It can make full use of the advantages of battery and UC.
