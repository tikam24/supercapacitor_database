The unique feather-like arrays composing of ultrathin secondary nanowires are fabricated on nickel foam (NF) through a facile hydrothermal strategy. Thus, the enhancement of electrochemical properties especially the low charge transfer resistance strongly depends on more active sites and porosity of the morphology. Benefiting from the unique structure, the optimized NiCo2O4 electrode delivers a significantly lower charge transfer resistance of 0.32 Ω and a high specific capacitance of 450 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1, as well as a superior cycling stability of 139.6% capacitance retention. The improvement of the electrochemical energy storage property proves the potential of the fabrication of various binary metal oxide electrodes for applications in the electrochemical energy field.
