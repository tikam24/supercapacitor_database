Polypyrrole(PPy) and polypyrrole/graphene(PPy/GNs) electrode composites were prepared via electrochemical polymerization and chemical reduction from pyrrole(Py) and GO(graphite oxide). Fracture morphology and electric performance of the composites were characterized by scanning electron microscope and VMP2 electrochemical workstation. It is found that the specific capacitance of PPy/GNs composite electrode synthesized by direct current is 13.5% higher than that of polypyrrole electrode. Comparison of electrochemical performance between PPy and PPy/GNs composites indicates that the PPy/GNs composite synthesized by pulse current(PC) have higher capacitance and better rate capability than that of direct current(DC). The specific capacitance can reach to 280 F/g at the 100 mV/s scanning rate.
