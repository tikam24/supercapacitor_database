Developing a multifunctional and sustainable electrode material for hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitors is a highly feasible avenue for producing the high energy density and renewable energies. In our study, nanostructured NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF nanoarrays are rational developed in experiments via a simple hydrothermal reaction. Ascribed to the 3D nanostructured NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 with numerous exposure active sites and large contact areas for the electrolyte, the binder-free feature of NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF facilitates a low charge transfer resistance, as well as the synergetic effect of NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2. The obtained electrocatalyst showed ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity with an overpotential of 111 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec−1. In addition, the electrode showed an area specific capacity of 6.13 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 and superior rate capability (2.72 F cm−2 at 80 mA cm−2), accompanied by excellent cycling stability. This results presented in our work can provide an effective strategy for rational design of other hybrid materials with excellent electrochemical performance in the application of electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.
