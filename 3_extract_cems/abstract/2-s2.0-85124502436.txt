A new double-layer hybrid electrode based on MnO2 nanofibers was prepared by the electrostatic flocking method. Compared with the traditional dopping method, the MnO2 nanofibers can be embedded on surface of graphene/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite coating. The symmetrical supercapacitor based on electrostatic flocking electrode was further assembled, which showed a high energy density of 12.1 Wh kgâˆ’1 and ultra-long cyclic life of 109.4% after 10 000 cycles. The result was attributed to that electrostatic flocking MnO2 nanofibers were directly exposed to electrolyte, reducing interfacial resistance. The work provides a new way to prepare high-performance electrode for various applications.
