A manganese cobaltite spinel oxide was synthesized successfully via d-glucose-assisted solvothermal process. The structure and morphology of the sample heat treated at 300 and 400 °C for 6 h has been studied with X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and transmission electron microscope. Cyclic voltammograms at different scan rate have demonstrated that an excellent capacitance feature of MnCo2O4 spinel oxide electrode. Pseudotype-capacitive behavior of the sample was further corroborated by the charge-discharge measurements at various current densities. The estimated specific capacitance of spinel oxides with two calcination temperature was found to be 189 and 346 F g-1 at a constant current density of 1 A g-1. Observed specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability of MnCo2O4 spinel oxide has ascribed to their high surface area and mesoporous microstructure. This facilitates to easy electrolyte ion intercalation and deintercalation at electrode/electrolyte interface. In this study, we suggest that the MnCo2O4 spinel nanostructure with high surface area and desired cation distribution could be a promising electrode material for next-generation high-performance supercapacitor. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
