In this paper, we report CoP nanowires supported on carbon cloth (CC) (CoP/CC) as a bifunctional electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and supercapacitor. CoP/CC possess an excellent electrocatalytic performance for HER, with a Tafel slope of 56 mV/dec and a low overpotential of 68 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Remarkably, the bifunctional CoP/CC used as electrode for supercapacitor exhibit a higher specific capacitance of 674 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 and maintains long-life cycling stability, retaining 86% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. CoP/CC will be a promising candidate as electrode for HER and supercapacitor.
