In this article, a {H} control methodology is proposed for a hybrid power generation system composed by a 500 W PEM fuel cell and a 58 F supercapacitor. The control strategy consists in synthetizing a multivariable PI controller with {H} performance in order to manage powers between two electrochemical sources. The controller is then designed through an optimization procedure based on solving some linear matrix inequalities (LMI). The control performance in time and frequency domains are then analyzed and compared with classical controllers. Results show the efficiency of the proposed methodology in order to reduce time spent for design. Â© EDP Sciences, 2011.
