Highly transparent and supremely stretchable electrodes based on graphene and silver nanowires (Ag-NWs) hybrid structures are being reported in this study. A prestretched polyacrylate (PAC) technique is used which endows 200% multiaxial stretch ability to the fabricated electrodes. A novel bubble template method is used for the uniform distribution of Ag-NWs. The Ag-NWs decrease the resistivity of the fabricated electrodes remarkably and enhance the connectivity between graphene segments when graphene gets partially divided into small segments upon appliance of strains >150%. Piezoresistive measurements show that the graphene/Ag-NWs electrodes are suitable for the fabrication of stretchable electronic devices. The electrodes are tested for the fabrication of supercapacitors and their working under high applied strains. Results from cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the demonstrated electrodes can work efficiently under applied strains up to 200%.
