We prepared the special alkali metal oxide doped cu catalyst by sol-gel combustion method. Through controlling the reaction temperature and the content of alkali metals in the catalyst, multiporous carbon nanofibers were synthesized using this kind of catalyst by thermal CVD method. Characterized by BET, TEM and Raman Spectrum method, the multiporous carbon nanofibers have specific surface are of 1162 m2/g, which was much higher than the conventional carbon nanofibers. The BET results also show that there are plenty of mid-level holes in this structure, which could break the limitation of useful area and low specific capacitance. All of these characters make the multi-porous carbon nanofibers become a potential candidate of the electrode materials. Through the test of cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge curve using the battery instrument and the electrochemical workstation, this kind of carbon nanofibers also show excellent electrochemical behavior, reversibility, and a electrochemical capacitance of 203 F/g. These findings will be useful for studying of controlled preparation of carbon nano-materials, and also provide a supercapacitor electrode material with potential application.
