Co3O4@MnMoO4 composites on nickel (Ni) foam were first synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal process and exhibited better electrochemical properties than pure Co3O4 nanorod clusters according to the electrochemical test. The specific capacities of the Co3O4 and Co3O4@MnMoO4 electrodes were 436 F/g and 663.75 F/g, respectively at a current density of 2.5 mA/cm2. After 3000 cycles, Co3O4 and Co3O4@MnMoO4 electrodes retained 100% and 95.32% of the initial specific capacities, respectively, at a current density of 3 A/g. The great capacitive property of Co3O4@MnMoO4 composites was attributed to their specific area, which led to a higher electron/ion-transfer rate, more electroactive reaction sites and larger electrolyte infiltrate area than Co3O4 nanorod clusters.
