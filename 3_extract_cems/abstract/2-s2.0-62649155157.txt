A network of CoxNiyAlz layered triple hydroxides (LTHs) nanosheets was prepared by the potentiostatic deposition process at -1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) onto stainless steel electrodes. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the CoxNiyAlzLTHs belong to the hexagonal system with layered structure. Cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge measurements in the potential range of -0.1 to 0.5 V and 0.0-0.4 V, respectively, vs. Ag/AgCl in 1 M KOH electrolyte indicate that CoxNiyAlzLTHs have excellent supercapacitive characteristics. The maximum specific capacitance of ∼1263 F g-1 was obtained for Co0.59Ni0.21Al0.20LTH. The impedance studies indicated highly conducting nature of the CoxNiyAlzLTHs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
