Mixed transition metal oxide (MTMO) MnFe2O4 was synthesized by the solution combustion method. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the cubic spinel structure with space group Fd3m. A specific capacity of 136 mAh g−1 in 1 M KOH and 193 mAh g−1 in 1 M LiOH was obtained through cyclic voltammetry. The formation of nanoparticles of size around 40 nm and porous nature of the surface was observed under field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) which reveals its use as electrode material in Li-ion batteries. An absorption edge around 500 nm and a band gap of 1.56 eV were obtained from UV spectra. This lower band gap will cause easier excitation of the electrons useful for energy storage devices.
