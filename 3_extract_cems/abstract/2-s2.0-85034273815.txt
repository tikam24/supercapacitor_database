The MoO3 nanobelts/graphene nanocomposites were prepared via facile ultrasonic self-assembly method. The composition and structure of the final product were characterized by various characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The composites could be used as supercapacitive electrode materials. The electrochemical results showed that the specific capacitance of MoO3 nanobelts/graphene nanocomposite was 285.5 F • g-1. Furthermore, the prepared supercapacitor nearly remained 99.5% of its initial capacitive value after 1 000 cycles at a current density of 1 A • g-1 showing its excellent cycle stibiliy.
