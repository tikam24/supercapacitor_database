Transition metal hydroxides have attracted considerable attention as promising electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage. In this work, we first used a facile and green approach to synthesize Ni4Yb(OH)10NO3 ⋅ 3H2O nanosheets, which are thin-layer hexagonal structures. Additionally, this method can be developed to synthesize other lanthanide-doped Ni(OH)2 materials. When used as electrode materials, these nanosheets exhibited excellent electrochemical energy storage performance and good cycling stability. For example, the Ni4Yb(OH)10NO3 ⋅ 3H2O nanosheet electrode showed a specific capacitance of 1482.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, while maintaining great cycling stability (a capacity retention of 71.8 % after 2000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1).
