Ag/polypyrrole (PPy) composites were synthesized with different dispersants via interface polymerization method. The morphology of the composites was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, and the results showed that the dispersant had strong effect on the morphology of the obtained composites. The structure of the products was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The specific capacitance and impedence of Ag/PPy composites electrode was evaluated through charge/discharge measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, respectively. Electrochemical performances indicated that Ag/PPy composite electrode used polyvinyl alcohol as dispersant exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 635.5 F/g at a current density of 2.45 mA/g, which provided potential application as supercapacitor materials.
