This work demonstrates a high-performance hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor (HASC) workable in very high current density of 30 A g−1 with in-situ pyrolytic processed sulfur-doped graphitic carbon nitride/cobalt disulfide (S-gC3N4/CoS2) materials and bio-derived carbon configuration and achievement of high electrochemical stability of 89% over 100,000 cycles with the coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. In the electrochemical studies, the S-gC3N4/CoS2-II electrode showed a high specific capacity of 180 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density in the half-cell configuration. The HASC cell was fabricated using S-gC3N4/CoS2-II material and orange peel derived activated carbon as a positive and negative electrode with a maximum operating cell potential of 1.6 V, respectively. The fabricated HASC delivered a high energy density of 26.7 Wh kg−1 and power density of 19.8 kW kg−1 in aqueous electrolyte. The prominent properties in specific capacity and cycling stability could be attributed to the CoS2 nanoparticles engulfed into the S-gC3N4 framework which provides short transport distance of the ions, strong interfacial interaction, and improving structural stability of the S-gC3N4/CoS2-II materials.
