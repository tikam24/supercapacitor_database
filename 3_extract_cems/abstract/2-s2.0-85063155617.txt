With the rapid development of new energy power generation technologies such as wind power and photovoltaic, the fluctuation of new energy output power caused the obvious change of voltage value, which affected the power supply quality and the stable operation of the power system. The paper analyzed the short-term rapid and high-power charging and discharging characteristics of super capacitor in hybrid energy storage system. Proposed the method of using power decoupling and voltage stabilization control strategy of four-quadrant voltage source converter and bidirectional DC/DC converter to suppress the wind farm output power fluctuation. The wind farm accessed with the hybrid energy storage system is simulated and analyzed in DigSILENT/PowerFactory. Simulation results indicated the effectiveness of the coordinated control strategy in suppressing the fluctuation of the wind farm output power and improving the stability of the voltage stability.
