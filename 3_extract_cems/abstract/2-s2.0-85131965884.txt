Inexpensive and eco-friendly cobalt boride@vermiculite (CoB@Ver) composites with excellent electrochemical kinetics were fabricated by a facile chemical liquid-phase reduction method. Because of the loading of intermetallic CoB and the extraordinary wettability of vermiculite, the affinity between the CoB@Ver-3 and the electrolyte was significantly improved, resulting in a short relaxation time with a satisfactory specific capacitance. The charge storage mechanism belonged to redox pseudocapacitance, and the contribution of pseudocapacitance in the whole charge storage process is 70.8%. Based on the investigation of the effect of different interlayer properties of two clay minerals, montmorillonite and vermiculite, on the electrochemical performance, it was found that clay minerals with variable interlayer spacing had a positive effect on the loading of active materials and could efficiently prevent the changes of electrode materials during cycling. Furthermore, the constructed CoB@Ver//AC device delivered a maximum energy density of 11.3 W h kg−1 with a power density of 206.1 W kg−1, and a satisfactory life cycle.
