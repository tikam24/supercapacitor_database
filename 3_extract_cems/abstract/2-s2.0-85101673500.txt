This paper studied the structure of energy storage grid connected inverter which is composed of super capacitor, bi-directional DC/DC converter, and voltage type DC/AC converter. The working principle of bi-directional DC/DC converter and DC/AC converter was separately analyzed. Then a joint control strategy of DC/DC converter and DC/AC converter was proposed with the main control objective of maintaining DC bus voltage. According to the different states of DC bus voltage and super capacitor voltage, five control modes of energy storage inverter were set. Besides, the DC/AC converter was controlled to compensate the reactive power and harmonics, and provide certain active power for the power grid according to the actual situation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed energy storage inverter structure and control strategy were verified through simulation analysis.
