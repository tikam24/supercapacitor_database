Hollow structures have shown great potentials in a variety of important applications, such as energy conversion and storage. In order to further enhance the performance, the rational design of hollow structures with higher complexity in terms of composition and structure is highly desirable and still remains a great challenge. In this work, an efficient strategy was established for the fabrication of novel NiO@Co3O4hollow spheres (HSs) with hierarchical porous surfaces by silica spheres template-assisted hydrothermal synthesis. The as-fabricated NiO@Co3O4HSs showed high specific surface area of 219.68 m2·g-1, and significant enhancement in ion diffusion and utilization rate, as well as effective prevention in nanoparticle agglomeration. When used as electrodes, the NiO@Co3O4HSs exhibited a large specific capacitance of 1140.9 F·g-1at the scan rate of 5 mV·s-1and excellent cycling stability, suggesting a promising application for supercapacitors.
