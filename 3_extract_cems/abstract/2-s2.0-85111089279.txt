The design of three-dimensional (3D) core-shell heterostructures is an efficient method to achieve high mass specific capacity of electroactive materials under high mass loading. In this work, porous Ni4Co1-OH nanosheets with a mass loading of 7.7 mg·cm−2 are obtained by using Ni4Co1-(NO3)2(OH)4 supported on the CuO nanowires as precursors via an unavoidable electrochemically induced phase reconstruction. During the electrochemical reconstruction process, the NO3− anions in Ni4Co1-(NO3)2(OH)4 are easily replaced by OH− anions in the electrolyte. The phase reconstruction is accompanied by the decrease of ionic diffusion resistance and the increase of pore volume, and the shift of binding energy. The obtained Ni4Co1-OH nanosheets show a high mass specific capacity of 363.6 mAh·g−1 at 5 mA·cm−2. The as-fabricated alkaline hybrid supercapacitor and Ni-Zn battery deliver high energy density of 293.1 and 604.9 Wh·kg−1, respectively, indicating excellent alkaline energy storage performance.
