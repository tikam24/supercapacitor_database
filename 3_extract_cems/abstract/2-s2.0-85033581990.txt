Core-shell nanostructures of Co3O4@CdS were synthesized on nickel foam using a facile, economical, scalable, and one pot hydrothermal method and a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The synergistic effects arising due to the hexagonal Co3O4 sheets and CdS nanostructures were assessed for potential electrochemical energy storage applications. The effects of the CdS SILAR coating cycles were examined by varying the number of cycles from 2 to 10. The Co3O4@CdS core-shell electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1539 Fg−1 (1385 Cg−1) and 1322 Fg−1 (1189 Cg−1) at 10 mVs−1 and 30 mA, respectively, with 98.5% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. In addition, the Co3O4@CdS core shell nanostructure-based symmetric supercapacitor displayed excellent capacitive characteristics with a specific capacitance of 360 Fg−1 (288 Cg−1) and 99 Fg−1 (79 Cg−1) at 10 mVs−1 and 10 mA, respectively, and 92% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles.
