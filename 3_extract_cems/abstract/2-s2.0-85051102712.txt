Cubic phase CoSn(OH)6 nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using NaOH as a mineralizer. The prepared sample was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the analysis confirmed that the CoSn(OH)6 nanoparticles have a spinel cubic structure with lattice space group Pn3m and mean crystalline size of 25 nm. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) study showed that the cubic with polyhedral shaped surface morphology of the CoSn(OH)6 nanoparticles was seen. The specific capacitance value of 450 Fg-1 was calculated at the scan rate of 2 mVs-1 as measured by using cyclic voltammetry. In the present investigation, the prepared CoSn(OH)6 nanoparticles are suggested as a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
