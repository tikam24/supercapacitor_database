A direct, low-cost methodology for the fabrication of porous SiC/C foams was developed, based on the foam replica technique, using sucrose and tetraethyl orthosilicate as precursor materials. The resulting highly porous structures contained up to 96% SiC, showing a specific capacitance of 43.65 F/g, a specific energy density of 1.51 Wh/kg, and a power density of 35.16 W/kg at 0.14 A/g. Most interestingly, these foams exhibited a wide potential stability window (2 V), a unique trait for carbonaceous materials, which we believe had not been previously reported, and therefore, warrants further investigation for supercapacitor applications, such as electric double-layer capacitors.
