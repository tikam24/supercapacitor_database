Sulfur covalently bonded to porous graphitic carbon (CB-S@PGC) as an anode for lithium-ion capacitors is shown to offer an ultrawide operating potential window of 4 V. When coupled with activated carbon as a cathode, the CB-S@PGC electrode exhibits a markedly high specific capacitance (412 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) and superiorly high capacity retention. And CB-S@PGC//lithium cobalt oxide cells exhibit high power and energy densities (e.g., a power density of 1665 W kg-1 is obtained at an energy density of 411 W h kg-1).
