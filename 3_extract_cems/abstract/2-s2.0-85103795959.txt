Due to environmental crisis and developed numerous portable electronic device and electric vehicles, it is necessary to find commercial alternative energy source to fulfil the future charge storage demand. In the present work, we have addressed the facile sol-gel root for the synthesis of Bismuth ferrite (BFO) along with modified carbon solution. The effect of carbon on structure, morphology and electrical properties on the BFO ceramic were investigated. XRD study reveals the prepared samples were found to be highly amorphous and rhombohedral structure. The morphology analysis demonstrates that the modified BFO nanoparticles size (~20 nm) is smaller than pure BFO of size (~30 nm) which helps to reduces the leakage current and improved electrical properties. Influence of carbon solutions on the BFO have been investigated for supercapacitor application. The modified BFO exhibited good electrochemical energy storage performance with a specific capacity of 678 Fg-1at a scan rate of 5 mVsec-1and excellent cyclic retention ~90.5% even after 3000 cycles. In addition, the developed electrode materials are used to fabricate an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor (ASC) device for demonstrating the practical applicability.
