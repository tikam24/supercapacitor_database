Selenium shows high level of electroactivity and fast faradic reactions. Therefore, selenides are potential candidate electrode materials of supercapacitor. In this work, nickel–cobalt selenides are fabricated through a two-step solvothermal method. The effects of NH4F dosage on the crystal phase, morphology, and electrochemical properties of nickel–cobalt selenides were systematically investigated. Research shows that the morphology and thus electrochemical properties of selenides can be controlled by tuning the addition amount of NH4F. In the absence or only trace amounts of NH4F, the obtaining selenides show irregular morphology. With the increase of the addition of NH4F to 10 mmol, the morphology of selenides gradually presents 3D interconnected structure assembled by nanorods and nanotubes. However, when the amount of NH4F is increased further, instead of 3D structures, hollow and broken nanotubes appear in the corresponding selenides. The obtained 3D selenides show relative high performance. This may be because 3D structure is beneficial to electrolyte ion diffusion, electron conduction, and exposure of electroactive site. Therefore, selenides with unique morphology and high electrochemical properties can be prepared by adjusting the amount of NH4F. It provides an idea for the controllable preparation of high-performance Ni-Co selenides as supercapacitor electrode materials.
