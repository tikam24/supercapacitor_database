In this study, N and S co-doped carbon nanometer active fibers were prepared by electrostatic spinning, carbonization and activation with lignin as sulfur and carbon source and polyacrylonitrile as nitrogen source and spinning aid. At the same time, graphenes (GNs) were doped in the spinning liquid, and the adsorption and fixation effects of GNs on N and S were utilized to increase the heteroatom content in carbon fiber. The carbon material was used as the active material to prepare the supercapacitor. The results showed that the preparation of supercapacitor in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte electrode system had good electrochemical properties, compared with supercapacitor before GNs doped, specific capacitance increased from 114.6 F/g to 253.4 F/g, the equivalent series resistance reduced from 24.1 Ω to 6.8 Ω, the energy density increased from 3.96 Wh/kg to 8.99 Wh/kg.
