We report the synthesis and characterization of chemically converted graphene (CCG) with composite pores that has exhibited high specific capacitance (up to 350 F g-1). The porous CCG was obtained by photocatalytic reaction aided by ZnO quantum dots and it has both macropores (>50 nm) and meso/micro-pores (<10 nm). The introduction of macropores allowed penetration of electrolyte into the inter-layer space of CCG while the meso/micro-pores increased the adsorption of charges. The supercapacitor made from such porous CCG also exhibited excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
