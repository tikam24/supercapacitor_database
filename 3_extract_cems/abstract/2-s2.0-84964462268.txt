Emerging Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology employed to dynamically charge Electric Vehicles (EVs) has the potential to overcome the limitations of EVs by extending vehicle driving range, making them lighter and less expensive. However, while moving over road-embedded pads during a regular driving and charging routines, the vehicle energy storage system is exposed to short-duration, high-energy bursts delivered from the road-embedded equipment. To manage energy storage and distribution inside a vehicle, a hybrid energy storage system is proposed, consisting of a battery and supercapacitor modules actively connected to an internal DC bus while supplying the inverter-motor drivetrain. Considering the specificity of the wireless charging system as a power delivery infrastructure, as well as the operational constrains of supercapacitor and battery storage units, we formulated the requirements and proposed a new energy management system (EMS). The proposed EMS strategy was verified for selected battery and supercapacitor modules through simulations over the downscaled standardized ECE-15 Urban Drive Cycle (UDC) and for various layouts of wireless charging infrastructure. Simulation results have proved the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid energy storage and superimposed EMS algorithm.
