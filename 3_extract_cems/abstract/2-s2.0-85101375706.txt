We demonstrate a facile strategy to fabricate flexible paper-based supercapacitors, in which all the components are integrated onto a paper with poly (vinyl alcohol)/H3PO4 as the gel electrolyte. The electrodes are drawn on both sides of the paper in a mirror image with a surfactant-free ink of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes and graphene. The resultant supercapacitors present a high volumetric capacitance of 0.45 F cm−3 and an energy density of 40.0 μWh cm−3. Moreover, this strategy is intrinsically scalable toward flexible energy devices while maintaining their electrochemical and mechanical performance.
