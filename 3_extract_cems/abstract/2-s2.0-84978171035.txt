A composite electrode (CE) consisting of activated carbon and quinine derivative 2-((2-(1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl) amino) naphthalene-1, 4-dione (HBU-551) was probed in different hydrogen ion conducting electrolytes such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl). The electrochemical performances of the CE in the electrolytes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge. The different hydrogen ion conducting electrolytes with different ionic conductivity induce different electrochemical properties in the CE. The specific capacitance is in the order of H2SO4 > H3PO4 > HCL > NH4Cl at 100 mV/s and a potential range of -0.2 - 0.8 (V vs Ag/AgCl).
