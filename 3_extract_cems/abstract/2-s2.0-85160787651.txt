Integrating electrochromism and energy storage capabilities of materials into a supercapacitor has great potential for developing intelligent and sustainable power systems and electronics. An intriguing aspect of such materials is their ability to undergo a real-time color change, indicative of the supercapacitor's charge level. In this work, Ti3C2 MXene/nickel cobalt phosphate (MXene/NiCoP) nanocomposite was successfully prepared by electrodeposition followed by spin-coating. The MXene/NiCoP nanocomposite was optimized using response surface methodology/central composite design (RSM/CCD). The proposed quadratic model displayed a residual standard error (RSE) of <5 %, indicating good model predictability. The conformational investigations, which included FTIR, Raman, XRD, XPS, FESEM, mapping, and EDX show that MXene/NiCoP nanocomposite was successfully synthesized. The synergistic effect offered by MXene/NiCoP nanocomposite resulted in superior and remarkable electrochromic energy storage performances in terms of coloration efficiency (56 cm2/C), optical contrast retention (84.45 %), specific capacity (453 mAh/g) and cycling stability (94.12 % after 5000 cycles). The MXene/NiCoP nanocomposite has exhibited exceptional electrochromic and supercapacitive properties, making it a promising candidate for advanced electroactive materials in future intelligent hybrid energy storage systems.
