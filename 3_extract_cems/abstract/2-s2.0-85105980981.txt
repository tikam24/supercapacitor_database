To promote the development of supercapacitors and their applications in modern electronics, it is crucial to explore novel supercapacitor electrode materials. As a representative member of the rising 2D MXenes, Ti3C2Tx MXene has shown tremendous potential for supercapacitor electrodes owing to its unique physicochemical properties. Here, the most recent advances in Ti3C2Tx-based supercapacitor electrodes are comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the vital role that Ti3C2Tx MXene plays in the remarkable electrochemical performance and related mechanisms. The fabrication methods, electrode structures, working mechanisms, electrochemical performance and related influencing factors, mechanical properties and applications, as well as the associated advantages/disadvantages of Ti3C2Tx-based supercapacitor electrodes are thoroughly and exhaustively summarized and discussed. Based on the recent progress, the existing challenges along with the corresponding possible solutions, and the future prospects of Ti3C2Tx-based materials for supercapacitors are also outlined and discussed.
