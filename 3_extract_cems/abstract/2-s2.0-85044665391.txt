We apply direct ink writing for the three-dimensional (3D) printing of polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide (PANI/RGO) composites with PANI/graphene oxide (PANI/GO) gel as printable inks. The PANI/GO gel inks for 3D printing are prepared via self-assembly of PANI and GO in a blend solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone and water, and offer both shaping capability, self-sustainability, and electrical conductivity after reduction of GO. PANI/RGO interdigital electrodes are fabricated with 3D printing, and based on these electrodes, a planar solid-state supercapacitor is constructed, which exhibits high performance with an areal specific capacitance of 1329 mF cm-2. The approach developed in this work provides a simple, economic, and effective way to fabricate PANI-based 3D architectures, which leads to promising application in future energy and electric devices at micro-nano scale.
