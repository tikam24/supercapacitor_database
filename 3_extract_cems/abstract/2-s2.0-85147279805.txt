Although challenging, the fabricated supercapacitor electrodes with excellent rate capability, long cycling stability, and high mass-loading are crucial for practical applications. Herein, a novel 3D porous poly(p-aminoazobenzene)/reduced graphene oxide hydrogel is designed and prepared as an ultrafast, high-loading, and durable pseudocapacitive electrode through a facile two-step self-assembly approach. Owing to abundant stable redox-active sites, fast electrolyte diffusion, and efficient charge conduction, the PRH electrode (5 mg cm−2) shows a high specific capacitance (701 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and ultrafast rate (97% capacitance retention at 100 A g−1). Furthermore, even with a mass-loading of 10 mg cm−2, the electrode still exhibits comparable high performance and excellent long-term cycling life (only 6.7% capacitance loss after 10 000 cycles). This work demonstrates novel polyaniline analog composites for constructing novel electrodes, promising to open an avenue toward practical applications.
