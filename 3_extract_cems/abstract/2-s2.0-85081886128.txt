Wearable electronic devices have attracted significant attention owing to their very high portability. However, the implementation of these electronic devices places high requirements on corresponding power supply systems, such as light weight, high flexibility, high energy and power densities. We attempt to use metal foil as electrodes for flexibility supercapacitors(SCs), which offer unique properties such as high mechanical strength and high electrochemical capacitance. Nowadays, Highly ordered TiO2 nanobelts@NiCo2S4 nanoplates core/shell arrays on the Ti foil substrate (TiO2@NiCo2S4) have been controllable fabricated via a stepwise hydrothermal approach and further investigated as additive-free anode materials for SCs exhibit a positive synergistic effect and display high capacity, good rate capacity and excellent cycle stabi-lity. The unique structure not only greatly promotes the transmission of electrons and charges, but also effectively reduces the volume expansion in redox reaction, and has good electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance and rate capability. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitors based on TiO2@NiCo2S4//coal-based porous carbon electrodes demonstrate a high energy density (41.6 Wh•kg-1 at 400 W•kg-1). To verify the feasibility of TiO2@NiCo2S4//CPC capacitors for energy supply, a two-series battery was assembled to drive the green LED. The device can power the LED for 10 minutes. The design of this interwoven three-dimensional (3D) frame architecture and flexible substrate opens up new opportunities to obtain high comprehensive performance flexible substrate electrode materials in the energy storage field.
