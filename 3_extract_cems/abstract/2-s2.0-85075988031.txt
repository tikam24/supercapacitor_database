Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) have come up as potential advance materials for energy applications owing to high surface area and tuneable porosity. The poor electrical conductivity and stability of MOFs restrict their vital use in supercapacitor applications. Herein, a smart approach was employed to synthesize NiOx nanoparticles decorated with nitrogenous porous carbon (NiOx@NPC nanocomposite) via PET-derived MOFs. The nitrogenous porous carbon not merely enhanced the electrical conductivity and stability but as well improved the charge relocation operation for the better performance of supercapacitor devices. The as-prepared NiOx@NPC composite demonstrated high specific surface area of 1523 m2/g for the first time. In a three-electrode setup the as synthesized NiOx@NPC composite electrode demonstrated an excellent specific capacitance of 581.30 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Moreover, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor (2E system) device demonstrated a specific capacitance of 291 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s using 6 M KOH electrolyte. The excellent cyclic stability of the NiOx@NPC composite was obtained after running 5000 segments of CV at a sweep rate of 50 mV/s. Thus, the obtained results show that NiOx@NPC composites certify and support the novelty of the materials for next-generation energy applications.
