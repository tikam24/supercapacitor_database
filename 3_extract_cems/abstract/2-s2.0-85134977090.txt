Herein, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) decorated tungsten oxide (WO3) nanorods were synthesis by a facile hydrothermal followed by the photo deposition process. The compositional, microstructural, and electrochemical properties of Ag-WO3 was ascertained. Benefiting from the synergetic effect of highly conductive Ag NPs and WO3 nanorods which can provide enough active sites, the Ag-WO3 exhibit a high specific capacitance of 591.11 F gâˆ’1 at 1 Ag-1, decent rate capability and excellent durability. Overall, the reported results here have significant implications as electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors.
