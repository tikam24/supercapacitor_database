Two-dimensionally (2D) connected metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a new class of materials that are of considerable interest because of their potential applications in energy storage devices. In this work we report, the fabrication, by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of, an ultra-high cycling stability supercapacitor, with the 2D MOF Nickel-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaaminotriphenylene (Ni3(HITP)2) as the active electrode material. The MOF-based symmetric supercapacitor, exhibited an excellent electrochemical capacitive performance over a potential window of 0–1.0 V, and displayed an areal specific capacitance of 15.69 mF cm−2. Furthermore, the Ni3(HITP)2 supercapacitor exhibited an exceptional capacitance retention of 84% after 100,000 cycles providing the best reported ultra-high cycling stability for an MOF to date. Such excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the EPD process, the 2D MOFs nanosheets which facilitate the electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion, and the large surface area of Ni3(HITP)2. These results provide a great prospect for developing MOFs as a new class of materials for energy storage devices.
