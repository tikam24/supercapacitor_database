We report intercalation pseudocapacitance of 250 F g−1 for exfoliated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in non-aqueous electrolytes that contain lithium ions. The exfoliated MoS2 shows surface-limited reaction kinetics with high rate capability up to 3 min of charge or discharge. The intercalation pseudocapacitance originates from the extremely fast kinetics due to the enhanced ionic and electronic transport enabled by the slightly expanded layer structure as well as the metallic 1T-phase. The exfoliated MoS2 could be also used in a Li-Mg-ion hybrid capacitor, which shows full cell specific capacitance of 240 F g−1.
