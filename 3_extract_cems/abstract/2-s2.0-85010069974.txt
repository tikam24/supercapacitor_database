Hetero atoms containing conductive nanocarbon materials are being studied extensively for their electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications. Herein, we report a facile process for the preparation of N-containing carbon/graphene nanocomposites by simultaneous thermal decomposition of polypyrrole into N-containing carbon and reduction of graphene oxide into graphene in H2/Ar atmosphere. The XRD pattern of N-containing carbon/graphene nanocomposites prepared at different temperatures indicated the formation of reduced graphene oxide from the reduction of GO. The FT-IR and Raman spectroscopic analysis revealed the presence of N atoms in the nanocomposites and the elemental analysis was used to estimate the amount of N in the nanocomposite. The XPS analysis distinguished the pyridine, pyrrolic and quaternary forms of N present in the nanocomposite. The slow decomposition of polypyrrole resulted in the mesoporous structure to the resulting nanocomposite, which was confirmed by the BET adsorption-desorption isotherm. The electron microscopic analysis confirmed the presence of highly transparent carbon nanosheets. The amount of N in the nanocomposite that depends on the decomposition temperature was found to influence the electrochemical performance. The nanocomposite prepared at 700Â°C showed a large specific capacitance of 296 F/g with an excellent cycling stability of 93% after 1000 cycles.
