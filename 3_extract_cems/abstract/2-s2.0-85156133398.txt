In this study, the supercapacitor (SCAP) connected at the DC-link of the DVR is used to inject the voltage required to sustain the mitigation of the power quality problems incurred in a system. SCAP has the advantage of rapid power charge and discharge required by the DC-link voltage for immediate and sustainable mitigation of power quality. The output voltage transmitted from the DC link to the inverter is controlled by the bidirectional DC-DC converter and is depending on the type of power quality problem. Once the voltage sag is detected, the bidirectional DC-DC converter will operate in a boost mode. On the overleaf, the buck mode is operated when the voltage swell occurs. The proposed DVR-SCAP technique is performed by injecting the required voltage for mitigation into the system. MATLAB/Simulink platform is utilized to exhibit the simulation results which validates the proposed DVR-SCAP configuration's compensation capability for the grid disturbances.
