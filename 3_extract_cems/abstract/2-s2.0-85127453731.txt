Renewable energy transitions are essential for climate change mitigation and energy security. Microgrids are significant structures to integrate distributed renewable energy sources. DC microgrid has natural compatibility with the DC power generating sources like solar PV, storages like battery and supercapacitor, and modern DC loads like laptop batteries, cell phone batteries, and DC powered LED lights, etc. Power management has been a great concern for the developers and academic researchers in an islanded microgrid system to maximise the utilisation of the intermittent renewable sources, provide quality and reliable power, and stabilise the DC microgrid system. A DC microgrid can be developed in household or community sizes. In this paper, A DC microgrid system has been proposed for residential purposes. The proposed DC microgrid's components details and power management scheme has been discussed. The hybrid energy storage (battery and supercapacitor) has been considered storage for the proposed DC microgrid. The incremental conductance (INC) algorithm has been implemented for the MPPT of the PV system as it is considered one of the most developed and accurate MPPT algorithm. A MATLAB/Simulink demonstration for the proposed system has been carried out. The simulations have been performed for various cases to analyse and validate the effectiveness of the proposed DC microgrid system.
