To solve the problem that the specific capacitance of the electrode was decreased rapidly after running for a period of time, the Ni3S4 nanorods with excellent electrochemical performance and with size of about 100 nm were synthesized by thermal injection method. The results show that the preparation of small nanomaterials as electrode material of supercapacitor is conducive to the rapid infiltration of electrolyte during the reaction process, and the electrochemical performance can be further improved. The prepared Ni3S4 nanorods can work stably in the voltage range from 0 to 0.55 V. When the current density is 1 A•g-1, the specific capacity reaches 1 097 F•g-1. When the current density is 20 A•g-1, the specific capacity still remains about 740 F•g-1. The retention rate of the material can reach 91% when it is tested for 10 000 cycles at 10 A•g-1.
