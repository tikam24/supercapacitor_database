As an important electrode material, bio-based carbon materials have a broad range of applications in the electrochemical field and have become one of the key research topics. Biomass is a cheap reusable resource and provides abundant carbon source for the preparation of carbon materials. The new biomass wood butterfly carbon material is an activated carbon material prepared by chemical activation using KOH and can be put into use in high-performance supercapacitors. The morphology, microstructure and electrochemical properties of the carbon materials were studied using X-ray diffractometer, SEM scanning electron microscope and electrochemical workstation. The experimental results show that the prepared wood butterfly activated carbon sample (MHD3) shows a perfect porous layered structure. The MHD3 sample shows a high particular surface area and a structure rich in pores. The MHD3 porous material can provide a particular capacitance of 101.7 F·g-1 at a current density of 1 A·g-1, and show fabulous ion transport properties and high conductivity in electrochemical alternating current (AC) impedance measurements. Biomass carbon materials prepared with wood butterfly as a carbon source will have great prospects in the application of supercapacitors.
