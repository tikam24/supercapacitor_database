We demonstrated and verified the use of Laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) supported on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate for flexible supercapacitor applications. We compared the interdigitated in-plan structure with the conventionally stacked structure supercapacitor. To understand the role of increasing the number of sub-electrodes per unit area, three electrode architecture of 2, 4, and 6 sub-electrodes were studied. Polymeric gel electrolyte of poly (vinyl alcohol) and phosphoric acid (PVA-H3PO4) was selected for the realization of the cells. The interdigital in - plane supercapacitor with 6 sub-electrodes I-PS(6) showed a volumetric capacitance of 9.3 Fcm-3 opposed to 3.6, 0.6, 0.5 Fcm-3 for I-PS(4), I-PS(2), and conventional structure supercapacitor, respectively at 0.1 mA cm-2 current density. The maximum stated energy density of 0.409 mWh.cm-3 and power density of 994.6 W.cm-3 were for I-PS(6). Our results clearly showed that the LRGO can hold much promise for low-cost, easy, and scalable supercapacitor fabrication.
