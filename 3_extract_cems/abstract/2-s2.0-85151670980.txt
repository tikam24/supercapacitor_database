With rising demand for sustainable and economical energy transformation and storage systems, the smart integrated system has gained attention around the globe. In recent years numerous attempts were made to integrate conversion and storage technologies to improve the efficacy of the overall system. Among the various diverse opportunities, multiresponsive supercapacitors can be energized using broad sustainable energy sources like solar radiation, mechanical energy, temperature which are broadly anticipated as propitious energy integrated systems due to its distinctive characteristics as supercapacitor such as simple configuration, high power density, fast charging and discharging rates. In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive discussion on the mechanism of harvesting solar radiation, temperature, and mechanical sensations into electrochemical energy. The challenges associated with the integration of both energy harvesting, conversion and storage technologies are highlighted.
