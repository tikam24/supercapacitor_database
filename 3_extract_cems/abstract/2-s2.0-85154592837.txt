In this work, NiCo2O4 microflowers are developed via hydrothermal method. The impact of precursor concentration on morphology and supercapacitor performance is investigated. The XRD, FTIR and XPS study reveals the formation of NiCo2O4. The FE-SEM study shows the formation of microflower-like morphology. The NiCo2O4 with molar ratio Ni:Co = 1:2 exhibited a BET specific surface area of 147.3 m2 g−1. The supercapacitor study confirms the optimized NiCo2O4 electrode showed a maximum sp. capacitance of 747.4 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. It exhibited highest energy density of 9.27 Wh kg−1 (@55.55 W kg−1) and 82.32% capacity retention over 5000 cycles.
