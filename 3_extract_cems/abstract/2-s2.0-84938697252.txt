MnO2 tube-in-tube arrays supported on carbon fiber cloth (MnO2 TTAs/CFC) were designed and synthesized. As a robust integrated 3D electrode with high utilization rate and fast ion transport, the MnO2 TTAs/CFC exhibits a high areal specific capacitance (Csp) of 322 mF cm-2 (âˆ¼1007 F g-1 for MnO2 at 0.125 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (95.1% retention of the initial Csp after 2000 cycles) at a high scan rate of 100 mV s-1. The assembled flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) based on MnO2 TTAs/CFC electrodes show a high volumetric energy density of 0.073 mW h cm-3 at a power density of 25 W kg-1 and high cycling stability (96.4% retention of the initial Csp after 2000 cycles). This study demonstrates that the 3D MnO2 TTAs/CFC electrodes hold great potential for use in flexible energy storage devices.
