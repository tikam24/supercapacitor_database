A low cost nonaqueous potassium-based battery–supercapacitor hybrid device (BSH) is successfully established for the first time with soft carbon as the anode, commercialized activated carbon as the cathode, and potassium bis(fluoro-slufonyl)imide in dimethyl ether as the electrolyte. This BSH reconciles the advantages of potassium ion batteries and supercapacitors, achieving a high energy density of 120 W h kg−1, a high power density of 599 W kg−1, a long cycle life of 1500 cycles, and an ultrafast charge/slow discharge performance (energy density and power density are calculated based on the total mass of active materials in the anode and cathode). This work demonstrates a great potential of applying the nonaqueous BSH for low cost electric energy storage systems.
