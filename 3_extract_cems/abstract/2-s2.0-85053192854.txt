A polyoxometalate based composite material (NiPW12NP/FrGO) was synthesized successfully, in which the nanoparticle of a polyoxometalate compound (NiPW12NP) distributes on carboxylate group functionalized reduced graphene oxide (FrGO) homogenously. There exist intensive chemical bonds between NiPW12NP and FrGO, which guarantees the stability of this composite material. When employed as a cathode material, NiPW12NP/FrGO exhibits high specific capacitance, remarkable rate capability and long-term stability. When the current density is 4 A g−1, a specific capacitance as high as 437.6 F g−1 is achieved by NiPW12NP/FrGO. With NiPW12NP/FrGO serving as cathode and MnO2 acting as anode, a high performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled, which possesses a high energy density of 12.96 W h·kg−1 at 0.67 kW kg−1. It also shows a good rate capability, when the current density increases from 4 to 12 A g−1, its specific capacitances decreases from 115.2 to 90.9 F g−1, with 78.9% capacitance retention. After 5000 cycles charge-discharge experiments, 94.3% of its capacitance can be maintained, which exhibits good stability. Furthermore, NiPW12NP/FrGO composite material also shows excellent tetracycline adsorption ability with capacity 288.28 mg g−1, the adsorption can be well described with Temkin model, which suggests electrostatic attraction dominates the adsorption process.
