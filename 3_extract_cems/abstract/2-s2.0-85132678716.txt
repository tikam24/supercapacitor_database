Nanodendrite is a unique nanostructure having branched nano-extension. Nanodendrite may have different types as carbon nanodendrite, metal nanodendrite, and bimetallic nanodendrite. Nanodendrite modified graphene and graphene oxide nanostructures have also been developed. This is an exclusive overview on design, features, and applications of nanodendrite, polymer/nanodendrite, and polymer/graphene-nanodendrite nanocomposite. Polymers like poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polyethylenimine, polyamidoamine, nafion, and other conductive and non-conjugated polymers have been used. Amalgamation of unique nanodendrite nanoreinforcement with polymer has revealed inimitable morphology, electrical, electrochemical, thermal, mechanical, capacitance, and sensing properties. The high performance polymer/nanodendrite and polymer/graphene-nanodendrite nanocomposite have found potential for supercapacitor, fuel cell, and sensor.
