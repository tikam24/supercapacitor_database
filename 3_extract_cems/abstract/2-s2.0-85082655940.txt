Although the graphene is regarded as a promising material for the electrode of the supercapacitor, its electrochemical performance is still less enough to satisfy the current demand raised in real applications. Here, using a home laser engraver, firstly we performed the prompt and selective reduction of the graphene oxide to produce multilayered and highly porous graphene maintaining high electrical conductivity. Subsequently, the resulting graphene was conformally deposited with pseudocapacitive thin VOx using atomic layer deposition in order to enhance specific capacitance of graphene. We observed that various forms of VOx exist in the VOx/graphene hybrid through XPS analysis. The hybrid showed highly improved specific capacitance (âˆ¼189 F/g) as compared to the graphene without VOx. We expect that our approach is accepted as one of the alternatives to produce the graphene-based electrode for various energy storage devices.
