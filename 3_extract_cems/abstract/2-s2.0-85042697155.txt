Based on the Hummers methods, the graphite oxide was synthesized from natural flake graphite. Then the graphene films were obtained by the chemical reduction method. Finally, the graphite oxide and graphene were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), Raman spectrum analyzer (Raman), FTIR spectra and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The aboved analysis showed that the hydrophobic graphite or graphene films dispersed homogeneously in water when the pH was approximately 10. The graphene films performed satisfactorily, and had a small thickness confirmed by SEM as well as a ratio of C to O near 8.8.X-ray diffraction results showed that layer spacing of graphene films became larger than the original graphite. Raman results showed that ID/IG of graphene films was larger than graphite oxide, and the degree of sample disorder increased. The present study on microstructure of graphene films will promote its further application as supercapacitor electrode or membranes for heavy metal-containing wastewater purification.
