Present work deals with the pseudocapacitance of carbon nanomaterials modified by nitrogen heterosubstitution and electroactive polymers taking place in ionic liquids and lithium salts solutions in organic media. It is shown that N-doped materials, where nitrogen atoms are located within grahene layers, due to excess of electrons and variation of specific cooperation demonstrates higher capacitance than non-doped samples in the whole range of voltage applied, restricted by electrochemical stability window of electrolyte. The values were found to mostly depend on correlations of the ions size and pore size in the material. For composites of carbon nanotubes with electroactive polypyrrole, obtained electrochemically in the ionic liquid, the capacitance can increase more than 3 times due to reversible red-ox processes. In case of high purity of components there were no polymer degradation process observed. The possibility of implementation of mixed electrolytes based on solutions of high voltage ionic liquids with symmetrical electrochemical stability window and lithium salts in dry acetonitrile for realization of pseudocapacitance effect together with ion-pore size correlations is proposed.
