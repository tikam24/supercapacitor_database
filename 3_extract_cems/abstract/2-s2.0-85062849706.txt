The power fluctuations of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems have negative impacts on the power quality and stability of the utility grid. In this study, the combinations of a battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and the PV power curtailment are used to smooth PV power fluctuations. A PV power curtailment algorithm is developed to limit PV power when power fluctuation exceeds the power capacity of the HESS. A multi-objective optimization model is established to dispatch the HESS power, considering energy losses and the state of charge (SOC) of the supercapacitor. To prevent the SOCs of the HESS from approaching their lower limits, a SOC correction strategy is proposed to correct the SOCs of the HESS. Moreover, this paper also investigates the performances (such as the smoothing effects, losses and lifetime of energy storage, and system net profits) of two different smoothing strategies, including the method of using the HESS and the proposed strategy. Finally, numerous simulations are carried out based on data obtained from a 750 kWp PV plant. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is more economical and can effectively smooth power fluctuations compared with the method of using the HESS.
