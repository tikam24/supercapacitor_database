Microporous organic polymers with redox-active hydroquinones (MOP-HQs) were synthesized on Cu nanowires through the surface Cu2O-catalyzed azide-alkyne click reaction. The resultant Cu@MOP-HQ2 with the optimized contents of MOP-HQ and Cu nanowires showed high capacitances up to 370 F/g (@0.5 A/g) and 360 F/g (@1 A/g), respectively, for pseudocapacitors. In particular, the Cu@MOP-HQ2 retained capacitances of 348 and 343 F/g at high current densities of 10 and 20 A/g, respectively. During 10000 cycling tests, coin cell-type pseudocapacitors maintained 98.3-98.6% of their original capacitances. The excellent electrochemical performance of Cu@MOP-HQ2 is attributable to an electron pathway role of incorporated Cu nanowires.
