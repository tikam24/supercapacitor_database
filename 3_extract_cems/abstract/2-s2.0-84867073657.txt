We overview the challenges and opportunities associated with energy storage systems for range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs, often referred to as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles). The progress in electrochemical energy storage is briefly reviewed, and the unique need for both high specific energy and power are investigated. A potentially useful approach to addressing the energy storage system requirements is to employ both a battery and a supercapacitor, and a specific architecture for this combination is described, mathematically modeled, and compared to state of the art battery systems available in low-volume today for REEV applications.
