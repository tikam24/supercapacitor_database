Zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) coating was successfully fabricated through electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods. The study on the electrophoretic deposition behavior indicates isopropanol containing polyethyleneimine is the suitable dispersion system. The N-doped porous carbon coating electrode derived from the pyrolyzed ZIF-67 coating shows a high specific capacitance of 197 F·g−1 at a scan rate of 50 mV·s−1. We believe that this study can pave a new way for preparing ZIF-67 coating or ZIF-67 derivative coating for application in supercapacitor electrode and electro-catalyst.
