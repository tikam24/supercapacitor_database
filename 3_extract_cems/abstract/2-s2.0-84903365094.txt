Two types of graphene/MnO2 composites were synthesized by different reaction procedures. R-GO/MnO2 was synthesized as follows: first, nanoneedle MnO2 was formed on the GO sheets using various functional groups (GO/MnO2). In the second stage, GO/MnO2 was reduced to graphene/MnO2 (R-GO/MnO2) via the dipping method. rGO/MnO2 was synthesized using a different reaction order: first, graphene oxide was reduced to graphene and nanoneedle MnO2 was formed on graphene sheets. Characterization indicated that the nanoneedle MnO2 structures in the R-GO/MnO2 composite were homogeneously dispersed on graphene sheets, whereas MnO2 in the rGO/MnO2 composite formed aggregates due to absence of functional groups. The R-GO/MnO2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 327.5 Fg-1 at 10 mVs-1, which was higher than that of the rGO/MnO2 electrode (229.9 Fg-1). It is anticipated that the formation of nanoneedle MnO2 on the GO surface following the reduction procedure could be a promising fabrication method for supercapacitor electrodes.
