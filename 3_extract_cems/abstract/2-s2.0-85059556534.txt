This work shows the potential application of carbon materials prepared by three different ionic liquid-based methods, using 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate [bmim][MeSO3], for electrochemical supercapacitors. The effects of [bmim][MeSO3] on morphology, texture and surface chemistry of prepared materials has been explored by SEM/TEM, N2/CO2 adsorption measurements and XPS. The results indicate the possibility of synthesis of carbon materials with tunable physicochemical properties using ionic liquid based methods. The charge storage behavior of all materials was studied in three different pH aqueous electrolytes. The pseudocapacitive and double layer contributions were estimated and discussed from the aspect of the textural changes and the changes of the chemical composition of surface functional groups containing heteroatoms. C[dbnd]O type functional groups, with the contribution of COOH groups, were found to be responsible for a different amount of charge, which could be stored in alkaline and acidic electrolytic solution. The material prepared by direct carbonization of [bmim][MeSO3], showed the best electrochemical performance in alkaline electrolyte with a capacitance of 187 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 (or 148 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), due to the contribution of both electric-double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance which arises from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur functional groups.
