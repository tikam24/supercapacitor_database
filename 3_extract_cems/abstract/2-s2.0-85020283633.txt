In this study we successfully synthesized layered Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheets and the electrochemical properties of as prepared material are investigated. X-ray diffraction studies confirm the as prepared MoS2 is hexagonal in structure. Functional groups were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Morphology of as prepared sample is determined by scanning electron microscopy. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge studies show the electrochemical property of as prepared MoS2 sample. In addition, the MoS2 nanosheet electrode showed a good cyclic stability as an excellent electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
