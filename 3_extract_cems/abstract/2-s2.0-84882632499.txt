The problem of converters coordination of a fuel cell system involving a hydrogen fuel cell with super-capacitors for applications with high instantaneous dynamic power is addressed in this paper. The problem is solved by using a non-linear controller based on passivity. The controller design is based on the interconnection and damping assignment approach, where the proof of the local system stability of the whole closed-loop system is shown. Simulation and experimental results on a reduced scale system prove the feasibility of the proposed approach for a real electrical vehicle. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
