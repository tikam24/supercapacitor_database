In the present work, nitrogen doped hierarchically activated porous carbon (APC) samples have been synthesized via single step scalable method using ethylene di-amine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) as precursor and KOH as activating agent. Activated porous carbons with different pore sizes have been developed by varying the activation temperature. SEM, TEM and SAXS analysis suggest that with variation of activation temperature, a hierarchical porous structure with interconnected meso-pore and micro pores has been achieved. The sufficiently high surface area of the synthesized materials provides active sites to enhance the diffusion of ions between the electrolyte and the carbon electrodes. The electrode prepared at 800 °C activated sample exhibited highest specific capacitance of 274 Fg-1 in two electrode setup, at a current density of 0.1 Ag-1 in 1 M aqueous H2SO4. Along with this, it showed maximum energy density of 9.5 Whkg−1 at a power density of 64.5 Wkg-1. The remarkable electrochemical performance reveals that the synthesized nitrogen doped activated carbon electrodes derived from EDTA can be tuned to have optimum pore structure and pore size distribution for better electrochemical performance, so it can be considered as a potential electrode material for applications in electrochemical energy storage.
