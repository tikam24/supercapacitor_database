Composites based on both unmodified and amine-modified graphene were successfully prepared via in situ oxidative polymerization of pyrrole in presence of SrTiO3. To characterize the graphene/amine-modified graphene-polypyrrole-SrTiO3 composite electrodes, cyclic voltammetry test for measuring specific capacitance, cyclic charge discharge test and an ac impedance test were executed. The composite with unmodified graphene showed better specific capacitance but a little lower cyclability compared to that of modified graphene composite. The presence of SrTiO3 ensures the better thermal stability of the composites compared to that of simple graphene-polypyrrole composite. Â© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
