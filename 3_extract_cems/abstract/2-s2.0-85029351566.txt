The frequent load fluctuations caused by the marine environmental variability and the operational requirements of the ship itself will have adverse impacts on the economics and reliability of the ship power grid. To alleviate these adverse impacts, the energy management technology is adopted and the super capacitor is employed as the energy storage unit in the ship DC electric propulsion system. In addition, the smooth fluctuation power control method is used, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter and the capacity of super capacitor. As results, the fuel consumption cost of the diesel generator and energy storage cost can be minimized, and the negative impact caused by the ship load fluctuations can be mitigated. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed methods can effectively improve the performance of ship propulsion system.
