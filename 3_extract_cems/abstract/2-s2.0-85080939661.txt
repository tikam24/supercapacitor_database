In this paper, a power-split strategy based on a real-time average power method is developed for improving power output of battery and mode switching frequency of a multi-mode hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in electric vehicles. To achieve mode switching and power distribution for the multi-mode HESS, a rule-based strategy is designed based on the high-frequency power demand. Furthermore, a simple real-time average power method is adopted to process the high-frequency power demand. Then, the real-time average power is used as a variable logic threshold value for the power-split strategy. Since the power-split controller responds to the smooth average power rather than the high-frequency power demand, the high-frequency mode switching of the multi-mode HESS can be avoided. The ultra-capacitor works as an enhanced low-pass power filter and the battery can supply smooth and steady output power to the motor inverter. Comparative simulations between the developed power-split strategy and the rule-based strategy are performed. The advantages of the developed power-split strategy for improving the power output of the battery and the mode switching frequency of the multi-mode HESS in electric vehicles are indicated under three typical driving cycles. Moreover, the longer time duration of the real-time average power is designed, the smoother power output of the battery and the lower mode switching frequency of the multi-mode HESS can be achieved.
