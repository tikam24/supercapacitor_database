Fluorinated microwave exfoliated graphite oxide (MEGO) samples containing 5.7-29.3 at.% of fluorine were prepared by gas phase treatment of MEGO with XeF2. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy data, fluorination of MEGO occurs at C=C bonds while leaving the oxygenated domains intact, and increases the O/C ratio. Cyclic voltammetry studies of fluorination effect on double layer capacitance of MEGO shows 67% growth of its specific capacitance, making such and related carbon materials prospective for supercapacitor applications.
