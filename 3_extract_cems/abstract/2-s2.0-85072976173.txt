Simple, green, and energy-efficient methods for preparing electroactive materials used to generate and store renewable energy are important for a sustainable future. In this study, we showed that noble and certain non-noble metal nanoparticles can be deposited on graphite without the aid of any reducing agent. This method of reducing metal ions to metal nanoparticles by graphite involves only one step (i.e., immersion into a solution) and one chemical (i.e., a metal salt). Hence, the method is exceedingly simple, green, and does not require any energy input. Large amounts of metal nanoparticles are generated both on the surface and deep into the bulk of graphite (∼100 μm). Despite the simplicity of this method, the metal deposited on graphite showed good electrocatalytic performance for ethanol oxidation and oxygen evolution reactions and also functioned as electrodes for supercapacitors. This method is thus ideal for preparing electrocatalytic materials and electrochemical energy storage devices due to its simplicity and environmental sustainability. The simplicity of the method is due to the inherent reducing potential of graphite (i.e., a material that is generally perceived as inert). Results from analyses showed that functionalization of the reactive edges in the regions of defects allowed the graphite to serve as a reducing agent. Increasing the amount of defects (e.g., via chemical or simple mechanical treatments) is shown to be the fundamental principle for increasing the reactivity of graphite.
