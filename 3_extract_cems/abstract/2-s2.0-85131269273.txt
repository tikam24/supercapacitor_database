In today’s technologically advanced world, large-scale energy use and its storage are crucial. The present focus of scientific research in this area is on the development of high-performance supercapacitors. Graphene has sparked interest in supercapacitor applications due to its exceptional characteristics. In present work using phenyl hydrazine hydrochloride functionalization of graphene oxide are studied. Different techniques such as X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are used to analyze materials in prodigious detail. Using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) techniques, the electrochemical parameters of GO and functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) for supercapacitor applications are analyzed. Each sub-nanopore in the graphene interlayer of functionalized graphene around a hundredth of a nanometer in diameter displayed the greatest specific capacitance of 1207 Fg−1 with highest energy density of 482 W h kg−1. A simple and cost-effective production approach facilitates the commercialization of functionalized graphene with good capacitive performance.
