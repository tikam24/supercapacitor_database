In the present investigation, we are reporting the first time synthesis of polyaniline (PANI) thin films by microwave assisted chemical bath deposition (MW-CBD) method on the stainless steel substrate. The PANI thin films are prepared by the oxidation of aniline in the domestic microwave oven working with frequency 2.45 GHz. The PANI thin films are characterized for their structural, morphological and optical studies by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and UV-vis spectrophotometer. The wettability study is carried out by measuring the contact angle. The supercapacitive behavior of PANI electrode is studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 using cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements. The X-ray diffraction pattern showed the films are amorphous. Morphological study revealed PANI thin film is well covered over the entire substrate surface with less overgrown fine spherical granules. The optical band gap of PANI thin film is found to be 2.5 eV. The hydrophilic nature of the PANI thin films is observed from water contact angle measurement. A maximum specific capacitance is found to be 753 F g-1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
