Polyaniline-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PANI/MWCNTs) composite has been synthesized by in situ oxidizing polymerization of aniline in water dispersion of MWCNTs and has been tested as a supercapacitor electrode material. Supercapacitive behaviour of the shell core composite has been investigated by a cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. In order to obtain information about the composite composition additional thermoanalytical tests have been carried out including mass decrement and heat stream in function of temperature. The research is aimed at utilization of the specific structure of the shell core composite type for designing new materials with promising properties which could find application as supercapacitor electrode materials.
