In this paper, boron doped activated wood derived carbon (BAWDC) was successfully employed to support and disperse polyaniline (PANI) particles for the application as supercapacitor electrode materials. Compared to pure PANI and BAWDC, the as-prepared polyaniline coated boron doped wood derived porous carbon composite (PANI-BAWDC) displays significantly enhanced specific capacitance, due to the synergetic effect between PANI and BAWDC. Moreover, the obtainable highest specific capacitance (421 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1, 372 F g-1 at 2 A g-1) and energy density (45.2 Wh kg-1 at 876 W kg-1) of this PANI-BAWDC composite are comparable to those of some similar PANI coated carbon composites, suggesting a good potential of PANI-BAWDC composite for future supercapacitor applications.
