In this work, we report a facile approach for the synthesis of a periodically stacked 2D composite of α-Ni(OH)2 monolayer and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) single layer as electrode material for application in supercapacitors. The self-assembly of ordered nanostructure was spontaneously driven by the electrostatic attraction between positively charged α-Ni(OH)2 monolayers and negatively charged graphene oxide (GO) single layers. The produced intermediate was reduced in H2 atmosphere to obtain target composite. The periodic 2D nanostructure provided the fast transfer channel for electrolyte ions between layers and minimized the diffusion process of electrolyte ions. The key for the composite is that the alternately intercalated rGO in the multilayered composite greatly reduced the internal resistance originating from α-Ni(OH)2. Consequently, the composite presented high electrochemical performance for the supercapacitor application.
