As a new multifunctional organic porous polymer, COFs have attracted more and more attention. A microporous phosphazene-triazinyl based COF (HM-COF) was designed and synthesized by polymerization reaction of hexachlorocyclo-triphosphazene (HCCP) and melamine (MA) under simple and easy reaction conditions. The BET specific surface area and pore size of HM-COF are 305.7 m2∙g−1 and 12.6 Å, respectively. The maximum specific capacitance of HM-COF was calculated as 145 F∙g−1 at current density of 0.5 A∙g−1, and the capacitance retention was 84.6 % of its initial capacitance after 30, 000 cycles.
