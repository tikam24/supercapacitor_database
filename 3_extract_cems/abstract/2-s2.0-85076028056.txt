This paper deals with a modeling and control of a hybrid power system based on fuel cell and wind turbine (WT) system based a Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). To improve the performance of the hybrid energy system, a super-capacitor storage system is associated with a fuel cell which is not able to compensate the fast variation of the load power demand. In this case, rule based energy management algorithm should be applied to share energy between three source elements in order to satisfy load power demand. The main originality of this work lies in the new topology of the WT-DFIG/Full cell/super capacitor hybrid power system which presents an easier accessibility of DC and AC grid. For the wind energy conversion system, the proposed control is the Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithm based a torque control loop (OTC). The wind turbine is equipped with a DFIG operated at variable speed which the control is based on direct power control. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and the energy management algorithm. A dSpace 1104 real-time board is used for management algorithm implementation. The obtained experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed control strategy.
