By storing energy from electrochemical processes at the electrode surface, pseudocapacitors bridge the performance gap between electrostatic double-layer capacitors and batteries. In this context, molecular design offers the exciting possibility to create tunable and inexpensive organic electroactive materials. Here we describe a porous structure composed of perylene diimide and triptycene subunits and demonstrate its remarkable performance as a pseudocapacitor electrode material. The material exhibits capacitance values as high as 350 F/g at 0.2 A/g as well as excellent stability over 10000 cycles. Moreover, we can alter the performance of the material, from battery-like (storing more charge at low rates) to capacitor-like (faster charge cycling), by modifying the structure of the pores via flow photocyclization. Organic materials capable of stable electron accepting pseudocapacitor behavior are rare and the capacitance values presented here are among the highest reported. More broadly, this work establishes molecular design and synthesis as a powerful approach for creating tunable energy storage materials.
