The complex g-C3N4/RGO/Ni(OH)2 nanowires-nanoflakes are architectured first via a simple and fast microwave process, which can intercalate g–C3N4–RGO nanosheets into layers of Ni(OH)2. In this study, g–C3N4–RGO nanosheets can improve the composite conductivity and provide high specific surface area structure for Ni(OH)2 nanosheets to improve the mass transfer of ions/electronics, which can facilitate the overall structural stability. Results of electrochemical tests demonstrate that nanowires-nanoflakes structure has high specific capacitance of 1887.4 F g−1 (1 A g−1), and displays outstanding stability (91.4% retention) after 2000 cycles. The presented work provides an efficient approach to design the remarkable electrode.
