Supercapacitors are considered potential energy storage devices and have drawn significant attention due to their superior intrinsic advantages. Herein, we report the synthesis of ReS2embedded in MoS2nanosheets (RMS-31) by a hydrothermal technique. The prepared RMS-31 electrode material demonstrated superior pseudocapacitive behavior in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution, which is confirmed by the heterostructure of RMS-31 nanosheet architectures. RMS-31 has a specific capacitance of 244 F g-1at a current density of 1 A g-1and a greater areal capacitance of 540 mF cm-2at a current density of 5 mA cm-2. The symmetric supercapacitor device with the RMS-31 electrode delivers an energy density of 28 W h cm-2with a power density of 1 W cm-2and reveals long-term stability at a constant current density of 5 mA cm-2for 10,000 cycles while accomplishing a retention of 66.5%. The high performance of this symmetric device is attributed to the synergistic effect of ReS2and MoS2and the presence of the metallic 1T-MoS2phase in the RMS-31 electrode. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of increasing the interlayer spacing of 2H-MoS2by incorporating ReS2for symmetric supercapacitor applications.
