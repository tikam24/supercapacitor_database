The non-solvent induced phase separation method is utilized to produce a free-standing electrode with good conductivity retention during 1000 bending/stretching cycles. The as-prepared electrode has been fabricated for an integrated device consisting of an ethanol fuel cell, a supercapacitor and a motion sensor. This method for fabricating free-standing electronics reveals a cost-effective approach towards wearable devices.
