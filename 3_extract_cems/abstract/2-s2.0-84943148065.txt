Taking supercapacitor and battery pack as the energy storage unit, a novel type of regenerative braking system for electric vehicle driven by in-wheel motors is presented, and a braking energy regeneration control strategy is set up. Then, a co-simulation test based on CRUISE and Simulink is conducted. The results of simulation show that the novel type of system can ensure the safety of battery pack and significantly improve the rate of energy regeneration.
