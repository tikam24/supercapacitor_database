In this paper, a classic proportionalâ€“integral (PI) control strategy as an energy management strategy (EMS) and a microgrid stand-alone power system configuration are proposed to work independently out of grid. The proposed system combines photovoltaics (PVs), fuel cells (FCs), batteries, and supercapacitors (SCs). The system supplies a dump load with its demand power. The system includes DC/DC and DC/AC converters, as well as a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to maximize the harvested energy from PV array. The system advantages are represented to overcome the problem of each source when used individually and to optimize the hydrogen consumption. The classic PI control strategy is used to control the main system parameters like FC current and the state-of-charge (SOC) for the battery and SC. In order to analyze and monitor the system, it was implemented in the MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation done for fuzzy logic and high frequency decoupling and state machine control strategies to validate the PI classic control strategy. The obtained results confirmed that the system works efficiently as a microgrid system. The results show that the SOC for the battery is kept between 56 and 65.4%, which is considered a proper value for such types of batteries. The DC bus voltage (VDC) is kept within the acceptable level. Moreover, the H2 fuel consumption is 12.1 gm, as the FCs are used as supported sources working with the PV. A big area for improvement is available for cost saving, which suggests the need for further research through system optimization and employing different control strategies.
