Functional chrysanthemum-like MnCo2O4 nanoparticles were prepared successfully via a facile and low-cost one-pot solvothermal method. A species of small molecule compound such as dopamine (DA) was used as both surfactant and interparticle linker in economical and environmentally friendly solvothermal process. The MnCo2O4 nanoflowers modified by short-chain surfactantwith particular catechol structure have large specific surface area and open pore structure, which make it a potential bifunctional materials for supercapacitors and catalyst for activating potassium percxymonosu fate triple salt (PMS) degrading dyes. Electrochemical properties were tested in detail that such MnCo2O4 nanoflowers exhibited specific capacitance of 843.3 F•g − 1 at a current density of 1 A•g − 1 and the capacitance retention rate reached 75.4% after 1000 cycles with current density of 10 A•g − 1. It is worth noting that we used the recovered electrode sheet as catalyst to activate PMS to degrade four different dyes with degradation efficiency of over 98%.
