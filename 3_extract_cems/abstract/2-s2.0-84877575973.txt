Interesting thin film electrodes of nickel doped vanadium pentoxide with different levels of doping (2.5-10 wt.%) are prepared on FTO and glass substrate at 300 C using sol-gel spin coating method. The structural and morphological studies are made to understand the nature of the surface of the thin films. The electrochemical characteristics have been investigated through cyclic voltammetry and ac impedance spectroscopy measurements. The doping of nickel with β-V2O5 has led to enhanced intercalation and deintercalation of ions. β-V2O5 films with 5 wt.% of Ni exhibit the maximum specific capacitance of 417 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, with a good cyclic stability making it a promising candidate for supercapacitor application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
