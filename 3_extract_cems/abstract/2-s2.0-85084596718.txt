In consideration of effective supercapacitors which are also affordable and lightweight, metal oxides can be considered because of the higher charge storage capability. This work establishes the in situ fabrication of a supercapacitor electrode, employing spent Zn–C batteries as precursor. Every year, extensive number of waste batteries including Zn–C battery end up in landfill, which prolonged the compulsion of waste disposal in landfill and creates environmental and health threat. The transformation of waste battery materials into fabricating components for energy applications, is of great significance for sustainable strategies but it is a challenging work to produce nanomaterials with purity by green methods. The present study proposes the in situ fabrication of ZnO NPs as ultra-thin film on a porous silicon (P-Si) substrate from spent Zn–C battery at 900 °C in the horizontal tube furnace under argon atmosphere. The particles were around 45 nm size and semi-spherical in morphology and showed uniform distributions all over the substrate as a discrete ultra-thin film. The ZnO ultra-thin film basically comprised of several ZnO film layer which stacked with each other periodically and made one thin layer of ~ 390 nm, where the single layer was ~ 45 nm. Formation of ZnO NPs were detected by the analysis of XRD, EDS and XPS. Using cyclic voltammetry as well as impedance spectroscopy in 0.6 M KOH as electrolyte, electrochemical properties of developed electrodes and supercapacitor have also been examined. The ZnO/P-Si electrode demonstrated a highest value of specific capacitance 547 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate. Obtained results demonstrate that spent Zn–C battery can be selected to fabricate the energy storage devices which can offer economical, technological and environmental advantages.
