We demonstrated a simple and environment-friendly method in the preparation of N-doped carbon/PANI (NCP) composite without binder. The structure and the property of NCP have been characterized by XPS, IR, XRD, SEM, CV, GCD and EIS. The results reveal that NCP has high capacitance performance of up to 615 F·g−1 at 0.6 A·g−1. Additionally, the asymmetric NCP300//carbon supercapacitor delivers a high capacitance (111 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1) and a capacity retention rate of 82% after 1200 cycles at 2 A·g−1. The ASC cell could deliver a high energy density of 39.1 W·h·kg−1 at a power density of 792.6 W·kg−1.
