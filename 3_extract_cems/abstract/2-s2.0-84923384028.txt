A novel wearable supercapacitor textile with the desired and combined properties of being thin, lightweight, transparent, and flexible is developed by stacking two aligned carbon nanotube fiber-based textile electrodes. The supercapacitor textile is further integrated to create a new energy textile that can convert solar energy to electric energy, in addition to storing it with a high entire photoelectric conversion and storage efficiency.
