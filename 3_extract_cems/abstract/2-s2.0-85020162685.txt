One-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon was prepared by carbonized and activated plant metaplexis and exhibited large surface area and high performance as supercapacitor electrode materials. Scanning electron microscope, transmission electrode microscope, X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman were used to characterize the microtopography and chemical composition of the materials as well as their transformation during the preparation process. With specific surface area (1394m2 g−1) and fine electrochemistry performance, the product exhibited a capacitance of 256.5 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and a very low equivalent series resistance of 0.16 Ω. The fine supercapacitor performance could be attributed to the hierarchically porous, large surface area and the specific ultralong tubular structure.
