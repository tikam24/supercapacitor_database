Current trends suggest that as manufacturing and energy demand increase, there will be a greater consumtion for energy storage, requiring its utilization for days, weeks, or even months in the future. Recent studies also need to be conducted on binders that could support electrode performance, considering that binders are also a crucial component of the electrochemical processes in cells. In this study, activated carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes were fabricated using three different binders: PVDF, SBR, and LA133. With a gravimetric capacitance and power density of 52.57 Fg−1 and 92.64 W.kg−1, and a lifetime up to 87.23% after 1000 cycles, AC/CB LA133 has the best performance. LA133 was used as a binder to generate a Ni/Si composite as a battery electrode combined with the AC/CB LA133 supercapacitor to fabricate a supercapattery. This clearly shows that when a suitable binder such as LA133 is used, the electrochemical performance could be improved.
