Summary: Partially reduced graphene oxide supported hierarchical birnessite-type manganese oxide (MnO2) nanonocomposite (MnO2-pGO) with large surface area (116 m2 g-1) were successfully synthesized by a facile ultrahigh dilute vesicle solution approach, via surfactant Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), as a structure-directing agent. The resultant structure exhibit hierarchical porous MnO2 nanocluster, which were self-assembled from elongated nanorods and grafted successfully on the surface of the pGO nanosheets. Furthermore, the obtained MnO2-pGO nanocomposite was found to exhibit favorable electrochemical activity showing ultra-high specific capacitance of (282 F/g at 0.5 A/g), the enhanced rate capability of (67.7%) at 10 A/g), the most stable capacitance retention (91.4 %of its initial capacitance was retains after 5000 cycles, with âˆ¼100% Coulombic efficiency). The result suggests that the approach is not only effective to deposit MnO2 over the pGO sheets, but also offered great promise to prepare other pGO- metal oxide composite electrode materials for supercapacitor.
