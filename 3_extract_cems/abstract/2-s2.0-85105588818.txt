In this study, a novel nanohybrid composite containing nitrogen-doped multiwalled carbon nanotubes/carboxymethylcellulose (N-MWCNT/CMC) was synthesized for supercapacitor applications. The synthesized composite materials were subjected to an ultrasonication-mediated solvothermal hydrothermal reaction. The synthesized nanohybrid composite electrode material was characterized using analytical methods to confirm its structure and morphology. The electrochemical properties of the composite electrode were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a 3 M KOH electrolyte. The fabricated composite material exhibited unique electrochemical properties by delivering a maximum specific capacitance of approximately 274 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The composite electrode displayed high cycling stability of 96% after 4000 cycles at 2 A g−1, indicating that it is favorable for supercapacitor applications.
