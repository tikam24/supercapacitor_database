Herein, an efficient versatile nanocomposite constructed of melamine-functionalized graphene oxide nano-sheets (GO@melamine), iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), and zinc oxide (ZnO NPs) is presented. Moreover, two different applications have been studied for the prepared Fe3O4/GO@melamine-ZnO nanocomposite: First, as a heterogeneous catalyst for synthesis of pyrano[2,3-c]pyrazole derivatives in short reaction time (10 min) with high yields (96 %), second, as a substantial electrical supercapacitor with typical capacitive behavior, high resistance, and excellent electrode stability. From the catalytic aspect, high effectiveness, convenient isolation, and significant reusability could be referred as the distinguished properties for the produced nanocomposite. Turn-over number (TON) and turn-over frequency (TOF) values for the presented catalytic system have been estimated 17.2 × 106 and 1.71 × 106 min−1, respectively, which revealed high catalytic performance of this catalytic system. From electrochemical aspect, economic benefits for fabrication of the introduced nanocomposite containing low-cost materials, make it as a suitable electrical supercapacitor for industrial applications.
