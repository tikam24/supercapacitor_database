Lightweight energy storage devices with high mechanical flexibility, superior electrochemical properties and good optical transparency are highly desired for next-generation smart wearable electronics. The development of high-performance flexible and transparent electrodes for supercapacitor applications is thus attracting great attention. In this work, we successfully developed flexible, transparent and highly conductive film electrodes based on a conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). The PEDOT:PSS film electrodes were prepared via a simple spin-coating approach followed by a post-treatment with a salt solution. After treatment, the film electrodes achieved a high areal specific capacitance (3.92 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2) and long cycling lifetime (capacitance retention >90% after 3000 cycles) with high transmittance (>60% at 550 nm). Owing to their good optoelectronic and electrochemical properties, the as-assembled all-solid-state device for which the PEDOT:PSS film electrodes were utilized as both the active electrode materials and current collectors also exhibited superior energy storage performance over other PEDOT-based flexible and transparent symmetric supercapacitors in the literature. This work provides an effective approach for producing high-performance, flexible and transparent polymer electrodes for supercapacitor applications. The as-obtained polymer film electrodes can also be highly promising for future flexible transparent portable electronics.
