This paper presents a new control strategy to operate a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) 1,2 kW and Supercapacitor (SC) through a hybrid converter proposed. The Fuel Cell (FC) has a slow dynamic device by its nature; therefore it is recommended to have an additional auxiliary power such as the SC to improve system performance in all its applications. So has been made a study of the DC/DC converters as well as control strategies employed recently used to operate the FC and SC system. This paper shows an experimental validation of the system which has been simulated in Matlab-Simulink. For this two test have been proposed using different load demands of power and cut off FC power. Under disturbances from FC voltage and load voltage these tests are possible to verify that the system achieves an excellent output voltage (Vo) regulation and SC Voltage (V SC) control. Â© 2011 IEEE.
