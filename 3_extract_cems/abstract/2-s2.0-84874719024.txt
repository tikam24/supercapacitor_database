A MnO2-CNT-graphene oxide (MCGO) nanocomposite is fabricated using graphene oxide (GO) as a surfactant to directly disperse pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for the subsequent deposition of MnO2 nanorods. The resulting MCGO nanocomposite is used as a supercapacitor electrode that shows ideal capacitive behavior (i.e., rectangular-shaped cyclic voltammograms), large specific capacitance (4.7times higher than that of free MnO2) even at high mass loading (3.0mg cm-2), high energy density (30.4-14.2Wh kg-1), large power density (2.6-50.5kW kg-1), and still retains approximately 94 % of the initial specific capacitance after 1000cycles. The advanced capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability may be attributed to the unique architecture, excellent ion wettability of GO with enriched oxygen-containing functional groups, high conductivity of CNTs, and their synergistic effects when combined with the other components. The results suggest that the MnO2-CNT-GO hybrid nanocomposite architecture is very promising for next generation high-performance energy storage devices. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
