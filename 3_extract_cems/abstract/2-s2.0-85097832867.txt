Most of the iron oxides based electrode materials are unstable during long-term running, especially in an acid environment. Herein, a simple method was rationally designed to prepare an acid-resistant self-supporting iron oxide decorated carbon nanofiber (CNF). By one-pot electrospinning β-cyclodextrin (β-CD), iron acetylacetonate (Fe-ac), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution, followed by carbonization, the carbon-encapsulated iron oxide composite carbon nanofiber (FeOx@C-CNF) was successfully synthesized with good flexibility and high stability in an acid solution. A uniform carbon protecting layer (about 3.5 nm) was formed around iron oxide particles during the pyrolysis of β-CD and Fe-ac. The obtained FeOx@C-CNFs exhibited a high specific capacitance of 341.3 F·g-1 at 0.5 A·g-1 in a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, much higher than that in KOH and Na2SO4 electrolyte solutions. The FeOx@C-CNF-based supercapacitor cell achieved a high energy density of 45.2 Wh·kg-1 at a power density of 0.71 kW·kg-1 and superior cycle stability (99.8% retention after 80 000 cycles). This carbon protecting layer around iron oxides endows FeOx@C-CNF superb stability in acidic solution. This strategy renders the carbon-protected FeOx as an electrode material for supercapacitor and other electrochemical devices in an acidic medium desirable and applicable.
