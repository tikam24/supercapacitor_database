Constructing intelligent clothing through integrating flexible and wearable electronics in daily clothing has raised the demand for flexible supercapacitors with high energy storage, small thickness and mechanical durability. Herein, a vacuum-filtration assisted layer-by-layer strategy is developed to prepare MXene-based flexible all-in-one supercapacitors. The MXene/carbon nanotube@MnO2composite film electrode is firstly synthesized by embedding the carbon nanotube@MnO2nanosheet composite into the interlayer of MXene films. This electrode structure blocks the restacking of MXene nanosheets, leading to a large ion-accessible surface area and efficient ion diffusion pathways. Moreover, the synergistic cooperation of MXene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes forms a 3D conductive network, which avoids the negative influence of MnO2on the electronic conductivity of electrodes, ensuring a rapid electron transport rate. Benefitting from these advantages, the MXene/carbon nanotube@MnO2composite film shows a high specific capacity of 221 F g−1, good cycling stability and flexibility. The assembled all-in-one flexible supercapacitor device exhibits a high volumetric energy density and power density of 24.5 mW h cm−3and 2.5 W cm−3, respectively.
