The fabrication, characterization, and energy storage capacity of a graphene-oxide (GO)-based supercapacitor device is reported. This device is fabricated via a facile screen-printing technique, providing a highly reproducible and flexible symmetrical supercapacitor device. The capacitive properties of these GO devices are investigated in both aqueous electrolytes and room temperature ionic liquids. The GO devices are shown to improve the capacitive performance from 0.82 F g-1 displayed by a graphitic screen, to a competitive 423 F g-1, representing a ca. 500-fold increase. The GO supercapacitor device also exhibits an impressive power handling capability of up to 13.9 kW kg-1 and an energy density of 11.6 Wh kg-1. This work demonstrates that GO, before it has been reduced to graphene, is a high performance supercapacitor material of its own right.
