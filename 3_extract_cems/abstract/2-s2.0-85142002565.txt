Many studies are being conducted in the field of energy storage devices to improve the performance of electrode materials for future application. In recent years, numerous research have been published that fully define Nano level synthesis techniques, dopant and composite-based work for improving the charge storing capability and long cycle life of energy storage devices, particularly in supercapacitors. In this current era, researchers prefer eco-friendly synthesis techniques to rectify unnecessary hazardous issues. Since, environmental friendly technic along with good cyclic stability was one of the major focuses in scientific society. Here, the present paper concentrates on the synthesis of Trimanganese Tetroxide / Mn3O4 (Hausmannite) under a facile co-precipitation technique. Upon Co-precipitation based technique the formations of nanoparticles cramped on nanorods occur simultaneously. The three electrode supercapacitor cell system composed of Mn3O4 shows high capacitance and capacity retention. The highest specific capacitance of 499F/g is achieved at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s, with 75 % of retention after 5000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.
