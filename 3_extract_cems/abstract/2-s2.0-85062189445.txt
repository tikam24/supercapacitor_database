The present paper deals with a real time implementation of a new adaptive frequency-based power management strategy of a small-scale hybrid battery-super capacitor system, dedicated to an electric vehicle. The ultimate objective of the strategy is to ensure a smart use of the two sources, improving as a consequence both the autonomy and the system lifetime. To do so, and unlike the conventional power frequency separation technique, the filter adapts its pass band frequency to keep the charge's state of each source in a tolerable range and provides power amounts to the load demand. The experimental results demonstrate that the system commutates smoothly between the operating modes, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed control techniques.
