Co@NiSe2 electrode materials were synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method by using nickel foam in situ as the backbone and subsequently characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and a specific surface area analyzer. Results show that the Co@NiSe2 electrode exhibits a nanowire structure and grows uniformly on the nickel foam base. These features make the electrode show a relatively high specific surface area and electrical conductivity, and thus exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The obtained electrode has a high specific capacitance of 3167.6 F路g-1 at a current density of 1 A路g-1. To enlarge the potential window and increase the energy density, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by using a Co@NiSe2 electrode and activated carbon acting as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The prepared asymmetrical supercapacitor functions stably under the potential window of 0-1.6 V. The asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a high energy density of 50.0 Wh路kg-1 at a power density of 779.0 W路kg-1. Moreover, the prepared asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a good rate performance and cycle stability.
