Rational design of electrode materials and facile synthetic process are essential for developing high performance energy storage devices. Here, a novel reduced graphene oxide/molybdenum disulfide/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) ternary material is constructed and deposited on carbon fiber cloth by a facile hydrothermal polymerization method. Thereinto, the graphene oxide is directly used as an oxidant to initiate the polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene. Meanwhile, graphene oxide is transformed into reduced graphene oxide subsequently. This unique ternary flexible electrode exhibits a remarkable areal capacitance of 241.81 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2 as well as good stability with 93.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties can be attributed to the profitable synergistic effect among three components. Reduced graphene oxide as a framework provides improved electrical conductivity network. Molybdenum disulfide and poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) afford large pseudocapacitance. Moreover, the ternary electrode possesses porous folded structures which can reinforce the electronic/ionic transport and result in the conspicuous increase in areal capacitance. In addition, the assembled fabric micro-supercapacitor based on the ternary electrodes delivers a superior energy density of 1.44 Î¼Wh/cm2 at a power density of 0.058 mW/cm2. This as-prepared device with excellent flexibility and favorable capacitive performance demonstrates a promising wearable energy storage device.
