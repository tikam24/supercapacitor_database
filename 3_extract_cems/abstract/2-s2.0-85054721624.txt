Biomass processing wastes (humins) are anticipated to become a large-tonnage solid waste in the near future, owing to the accelerated development of renewable technologies based on utilization of carbohydrates. In this work, the utility of humins as a feedstock for the production of activated carbon by various methods (pyrolysis, physical and chemical activation, or combined approaches) was evaluated. The obtained activated carbons were tested as potential electrode materials for supercapacitor applications and demonstrated combined micro- and mesoporous structures with a good capacitance of 370 F g−1 (at a current density of 0.5 A g−1) and good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 92 % after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles (at 10 A g−1 in 6 m aqueous KOH electrolyte). The applicability of the developed activated carbon for practical usage as a supercapacitor electrode material was demonstrated by its successful utilization in symmetric two-electrode cells and by powering electric devices. These findings provide a new approach to deal with the problem of sustainable wastes utilization and to advance challenging energy storage applications.
