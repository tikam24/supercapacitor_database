In view of the intermittent distributed power output and load variability, energy storage becomes an important way to support DC microgrid voltage and improve power quality. In order to make full use of the advantages of hybrid energy storage to achieve reasonable power distribution, an autonomous-frequency-split power control strategy for hybrid energy storage is proposed. In this method, the equivalent output impedance of converters is reshaped by introducing the virtual impedance or virtual capacitor in the droop control. By this way, the advantages of supercapacitor and battery can be integrated. At the load mutation, supercapacitor rapidly absorbs the high-frequency component of power fluctuation to improve the dynamic respond speed. Meanwhile, battery is mainly used to balance the low-frequency power in order to extend the service life and ensure the reliable operation of system. The simulation verifies the correctness of the proposed method.
