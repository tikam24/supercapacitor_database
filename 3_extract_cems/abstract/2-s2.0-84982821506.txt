Facile and simple co-precipitation method has been used to synthesis copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures. The effect of temperature on the structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of the CuO has been studied and reported. X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the formation of monoclinic CuO at 300, 400 and 500oC. Electrochemical investigation indicates that the CuO nanostructures prepared at 400°C reveals a specific capacitance of 345 Fg-1 at 2 mV s-1. Cycle-life tests show that the capacitance retention of the CuO nanoworms is 99 % even after 1500 cycles. The lower charge transfer resistance (3.3 Ω) of this material enhances their supercapacitive features. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was constructed using CuO nanoworms and activated carbon (AC) as electrode materials. The functional performance of the system showed a specific capacitance of 47 Fg-1 with an energy density/ power density of 6.5 Whkg-1 and 249 Wkg-1 respectively.
