Nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide with a three-dimensional (3D) sea-urchin-like structure was successfully developed by the hydrothermal process. The obtained structure enables the enhancement of charge/ion diffusion for the high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. The mole ratio of nickel to cobalt plays a vital role in the densely packed sea-urchin-like structure formation and electrochemical properties. At optimized nickel/cobalt mole ratio (1:2), the highest specific capacitance of 950.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and the excellent cycling stability of 178.3% after 3000 charging/discharging cycles at 40 mV s-1 are achieved. This nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide electrode yields an energy density in the range of 42.9-15.8 Wh kg-1, with power density in the range of 285.0-2849.9 W kg-1. The charge/discharge mechanism at the atomic level as monitored by time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (TR-XAS) indicates that the high capacitance behavior in a nickel-cobalt carbonate hydroxide is mainly dominated by cobalt carbonate hydroxide.
