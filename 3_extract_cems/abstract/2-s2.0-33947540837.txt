Co3O4 material was prepared by calcination in air atmosphere at 350°C, for 3 h of a precursor that obtained previously from room -temperature solid reaction using CoCl2 · 6H2O and NH4HCo3 as raw materials. X -ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and infrared spectroscopy (IR) analysis results indicate that the obtained sample is nano-structured cubic spinel Co3O4. Cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance results show that the Co3O4 electrode exhibits reversible Faraday reaction characteristic and good kinetic property in 6 mol · L-1 potassium hydroxide aqueous solution. Galvanostatic charge/discharge results demonstrate that the alkaline Co3O4/AC hybrid capacitor using Co3O4 as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode and 6 mol · L-1 KOH as electrolyte exhibit better charge/discharge performance and cyclic stability at high current densities.
