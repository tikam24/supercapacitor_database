Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has attracted much attention for the promising electrode material of supercapacitor because of its high Faradaic activity and stable crystal structure but suffer from the low electronic conductivity and poor ionic diffusivity. Previous methods improve performance via attachment of nanoscale V2O5 onto the carbon host with oxygen-containing functional group, which may decrease the intrinsic electrical conductivity of carbon and lead to poor behavior of electronic transport process. Herein we report a new strategy for the preparation of 3D monolithic porous aerogels consisting of uniform carbon nanofibers (CNFs)/V2O5 core/shell nanostructures by introduction of nitrogen atoms into CNFs lattice structure. As a proof-of-concept we have combined simulations and experiments analysis to demonstrate the effect of N doping treatment on the formation of CNFs/V2O5 core/shell nanostructures. Benefiting from the stable and homogeneous core/shell morphology, the improved charge-transfer effect of CNFs, 3D N-doped CNFs (N-CNFs)/V2O5 composite aerogel exhibits high specific capacitance (595.1 F g−1), excellent energy density (82.65 W h Kg−1), and extremely outstanding cycling behavior (>12000). The approach of introducing N atoms into carbon lattice may be leveraged to a wide range of carbon materials for fabricating metal oxide/carbon composite nanomaterial, leading to opening up new opportunities for these electrode materials in high-energy-density storage systems.
