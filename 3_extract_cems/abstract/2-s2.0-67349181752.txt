A novel high-performance electrode material based on fibrillar polyaniline (PANI) doped with graphene oxide sheets was synthesized via in situ polymerization of monomer in the presence of graphene oxide, with a high conductivity of 10 S cm-1 at 22 °C for the obtained nanocomposite with a mass ratio of aniline/graphite oxide, 100:1. Its high specific capacitance of 531 F/g was obtained in the potential range from 0 to 0.45 V at 200 mA/g by charge-discharge analysis compared to 216 F/g of individual PANI. The doping and the ratio of graphene oxide have a pronounced effect on the electrochemical capacitance performance of the nanocomposites. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
