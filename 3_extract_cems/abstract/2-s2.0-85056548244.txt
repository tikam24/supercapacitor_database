Polyaniline (PANI) was effectively immobilized on the surface of ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) by using Mn2O3 as sacrificial template. The observed microstructure and morphology indicate that a thin layer of PANI was coated on OMC uniformly. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the discharge capacity of the optimized PANI/OMC could reach 467 F/g, which is far higher than that of OMC, PANI and Mn2O3/OMC. Furthermore, PANI/OMC composites with different content of PANI are obtained by adjusting the amount of Mn2O3 on OMC and their properties are characterized. The results show that a thin layer of PANI can improve the capacity of PANI/OMC composites effectively and the further increase of PANI reduces the capacity of PANI/OMC composites. The sacrificial template method presented here is beneficial to coating a layer of polymer on carbon materials, and the content of polymer layer can be controlled by adjusting the amount of Mn2O3 in Mn2O3/OMC.
