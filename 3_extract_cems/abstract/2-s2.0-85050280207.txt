Supercapacitor is a new type of energy storage element, and its performance is easily influenced by temperature. In order to have more precise energy storage characteristic research of supercapacitor, a modified porous circuit equivalent model is proposed on the basis of porous circuit equivalent model in electric double layer supercapacitor. The simulation results show that modified porous circuit equivalent model can reflect impedance performance more accurately. Besides, changing rule of the supercapacitor impedance spectroscopy under different temperature is analyzed briefly. The modified porous circuit equivalent model can describe the self discharge (mainly caused by leakage current) of supercapacitor.
