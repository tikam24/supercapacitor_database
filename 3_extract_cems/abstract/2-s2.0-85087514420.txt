In this paper, a wavelet transform-based energy management strategy (EMS) governing fuel cell (FC)/variable-structure super-capacitor (SC) hybrid power system prototype is developed to apply for city bus. The hybrid power system integrates FC as the main power source and the variable-structure SC as the auxiliary power source, where SC modules are connected in series acting as a power supply and in parallel under charging conditions. Wavelet transform EMS is proposed to distribute the demand power into high frequency power and low frequency power. The high frequency power is absorbed by variable-structure SC. Rule-based control is also used to further process the low frequency power, ensuring the output power and the power change rate of FC in a reasonable range. The simulation results show that the variable-structure SC's energy recovery current is improved 59.4%. At the same time, the output power of FC is less than 120 kW and the maximum power change rate is about 5 kW/s, which demonstrates the proposed EMS with the hybrid system can effectively guarantee the power demand and dynamic response.
