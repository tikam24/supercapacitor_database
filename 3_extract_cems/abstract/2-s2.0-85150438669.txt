Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly desired for energy-storage devices due to their intrinsic layered structure, huge surface area, and the large number of active sites. However, the TMDs fail to reach their potential due to restacking of 2D layered structures that remains a major technological hurdle. Herein, MoS2 nanosheets and cellulose fiber binary composite (MoS2@Cellulose) prepared by the microwave-assisted technique are demonstrated as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. The prepared material are tested in symmetric and asymmetric all solid-state device assemblies. It is found that the quasi-solid-state symmetric and quasi-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors exhibited remarkably higher specific capacitance of ≈294 and ≈177 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, respectively, than their counterpart. Furthermore, the symmetric and asymmetric devices deliver excellent energy densities of ≈40.84 and ≈42.67 Wh kg−1 while maintaining the power density of 400 and 791.81 W kg−1, respectively, and outstanding cyclic stability. The cellulose entanglement causes a reduction in the aggregation and restacking of MoS2, which may improve the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. Herein this research, a pathway is provided to create an efficient energy-storage system using 2D materials with sustainable cellulose.
