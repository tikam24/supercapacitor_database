This work presents, the synthesized CeO2/PANI/MoS2 tri-composite performance as a symmetric electrode material for supercapacitor application. Analysis of XRD and FTIR was performed on the synthesized materials to investigate their crystalline structure and functional groups. The tri-composite SEM morphology shows a sheet-like structure covered with aggregated cerium and polyaniline nanoparticles. The electrochemical performances of the composite were done using the two-electrode symmetric system in 0.5 M of H2SO4. The resultant specific capacitance from the cyclic voltammetry was 177 F/g at 5 mV/s and from galvanostatic charge-discharge was 62 F/g at 0.5 current density. At 5 A/g, the composite demonstrated 98% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The impedance of the electrode materials was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The tri-composite's solution resistance and transfer resistance values were 3.09 Ω and 0.51 Ω respectively.
