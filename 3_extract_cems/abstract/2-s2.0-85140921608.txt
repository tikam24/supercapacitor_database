To develop comparative understanding on recent model of supercapacitor for various parameter values. The different parameters addressed here are performance variables of supercapacitor. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation, waste minimization and green technologies are need of hour. Conclusively environment protection is essential now for sustainability of life. This paper focuses on how effectively simulation software called MATLAB-Simulink be used to develop optimized model of supercapacitor before fabricating the real device.
