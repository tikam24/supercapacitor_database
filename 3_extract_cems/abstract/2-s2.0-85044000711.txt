Solar energy harvesting that provides an alternative power source for an energy-constrained wireless sensor network (WSN) node is completely a new idea. Several developed countries like Finland, Mexico, China, and the USA are making research efforts to provide design solutions for challenges in renewable energy harvesting applications. The small size solar panels suitably connected to low-power energy harvester circuits and rechargeable batteries provide a loom to make the WSN nodes completely self-powered with an infinite network lifetime. Recent advancements in renewable energy harvesting technologies have led the researchers and companies to design and innovate novel energy harvesting circuits for traditional battery powered WSNs, such as Texas Instruments Ultra Low Energy Harvester and Power Management IC bq25505 [see https://store.ti.com/BQ25505 for Texas Instruments (TI) Ultra Low Power Boost Charger IC bq25505 with Battery Management and Autonomous Power Multiplexor for Primary Battery in Energy Harvester Applications datasheets (2015).]. In modern days, the increasing demand of smart autonomous sensor nodes in the Internet of Things applications (like temperature monitoring of an industrial plant over the internet, smart home automation, and smart cities) requires a detailed literature survey of state of the art in solar energy harvesting WSN (SEH-WSN) for researchers and design engineers. Therefore, we present an in-depth literature review of Solar cell efficiency, DC-DC power converters, Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithms, solar energy prediction algorithms, microcontrollers, energy storage (battery/supercapacitor), and various design costs for SEH-WSNs. As per our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature survey of SEH-WSNs.
