The use of fuel cells for the generation of electric power is discussed. Fuel cell power generation systems will be used in portable applications, transportation applications, and in stationary power applications for which fuel cell systems can provide both power and heat with cogeneration efficiencies as high as 80%. The fuel cell utilizes the chemical energy of hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity without pollution. A fuel cell stack requires fuel, oxidant, and coolant in order to operate. The fuel cell stack must be surrounded by a fuel system, fuel delivery system, air system, stack cooling system, and humidification system to control the coolant temperature. Fuel cells are good energy sources to provide reliable power at steady state and supercapacitor energy storage devices can advance the load following characteristics of fuel cell by providing a stronger power response to changes in system loading.
