The urgent need for efficient energy storage devices greatly stimulates the development of high power, highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and low-cost energy storage devices. Supercapacitors, unlike batteries, store energy by ion adsorptions on high surface area electrodes. The physical ion migration provides a high charging/discharging rate, power density, and reversibility. In this work, we synthesize graphene materials by a rapid thermal annealing process and examine the material properties. With the synthesized graphene as electrodes, the outstanding electrochemical performance of these supercapacitors is demonstrated. This provides a new method for developing supercapacitors with high charge/energy storage capability at low cost.
