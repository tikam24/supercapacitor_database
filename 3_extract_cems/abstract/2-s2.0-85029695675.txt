Herein, a series of novel iron nitride (Fe2N)/cubic-ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) composites (Fe2N@OMC) were synthesized via a facile nanocasting route and ammonia calcination. Physical characterization results indicate that small non-aggregated Fe2N nanoparticles were evenly distributed on the external surface and in the pores of the carbon material with a linear array of mesopores in a regular interval arrangement. An electrochemical test was carried out using Fe2N@OMC as a negative electrode of a supercapacitor in 6 mol L-1 KOH aqueous electrolytes. The results indicated that the obtained Fe2N@OMC-2 exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 547 F g-1 at 1 mV s-1 and 520 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1, an excellent rate capability (398 F g-1 at 20 A g-1 with capacitance retention of 76%), and an outstanding cycling stability. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance retention of Fe2N@OMC-2 remained 85%, which was much higher than 28% of the bare Fe2N.
