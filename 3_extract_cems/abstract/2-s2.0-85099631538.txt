In this work, the Perovskite powders LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3with space group of P m - 3 m was obtained by sol-gel method. The nanoscale powders of LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3have been tested as a cathode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. The CVA and charge-discharge curves were obtained at 0.5 mV/s to 16 mV/s and 0.5 mA/s to 16 mA/s scan rates accordingly. It is established that the cathode material LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3demonstrates the specific capacity up to 16 F/g at discharge scan rate 0.5 mV/s. Additionally, the maximum of the specific capacity was calculated and it is determined that C is 29.26 F/g, and specific capacity of double electric layer CDEL is 3.44 F/g. It was determined that, the contribution of the redox reactions in specific capacity is 88 %. The Nyquist plots and Mott-Schottky plots for LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3were obtained. They consist of two parts which correspond to different type of conductivity. Thus, it is established that LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3shows different types of conductivity depending on applied potential. The received values of flat band potential are -1.00 V and 0.16 V for n type and p type of conductivity accordingly.
