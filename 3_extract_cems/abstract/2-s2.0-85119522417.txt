This paper utilizes the energetic macroscopic representation formalism to model a port crane load hoisting system. A rule-based energy management strategy is developed to manage the power split between the battery, supercapacitor, and grid energy sources. The crane model developed includes the mathematical model, the crane's local control system, and a MATLAB/Simulink model for simulation. This study investigates and confirms the suitability of a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system for port crane applications. This is done by evaluating two objectives which are using the battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system to reduce both the crane's energy consumption from the grid and the peak power it consumes from the grid. The supercapacitor achieves 100% peak shaving for energy consumed from the utility grid and the battery achieves 65% energy savings during peak time based on the energy price arbitrage technique.
