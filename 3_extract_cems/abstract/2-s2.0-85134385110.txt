In the last sentence of the abstract, 161 mF cm.2 and 31 μWh cm-2are corrected to 177 mF cm-2and 34 μWh cm-2, respectively, so that the sentence reads:the electrochemical performance test showed that the composite film treated with KOH solution as the MSC electrode had an area capacitance of 223 mF cm-2and an area energy density of 42 μWh cm-2, which was better than composite film electrode of the MSC without KOH treatment (area capacitance of 177 mF cm-2and area energy density of 34 μWh cm-2). In the Conclusions, in the fourth and fifth sentences, 161 mF cm-2, 62 mF cm-2, and 40% are corrected to 177 mF cm-2, 46 mF cm-2, and 26%, respectively, so that the sentences read:we found that the area capacitance of the MSC assembled with MXene/BCKOH composite film electrode increased from 177 mF cm-2to 223 mF cm-2. The area capacitance is increased by 46 mF cm-2, which is about 26%.
