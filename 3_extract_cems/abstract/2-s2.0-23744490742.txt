Based on the potential applications of Micro generator used in distribution sensors, mini-spy-plane and so on, many researches of Micro vibration generator have been reported presently, but in the following work, there is a bottleneck in how to store the power which comes from the micro generator, and discharge it effectively in using occasions. According to the structure and parameters of micro fingers-capacitive vibration generator which was designed and analyzed by our lab, the energy storage system was designed and analysed. Three methods were brought forward, analyzed and compared, then we decided to use the method by super-capacitor. The feasibility analyze and key problem research are done and the storage circuit was designed. Finally, the circuit simulation experiments and result analysis were done. It confirms that this storage circuit is useful and effective in this micro generator.
