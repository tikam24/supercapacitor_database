Copper oxide (CuO) nanosheets (NSs) have been synthesized using improved chemical bath deposition (CBD) method and used as energy materials in supercapacitor devices. The quality of CuO-NSs were investigated using different techniques such as, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The structure, composition, and morphology of CuO-NSs were examined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersion spectrum (EDS). CuO-NSs device exhibited maximum specific capacitance about 564 Fg-1 at 5 mV/s. Antibacterial properties of CuO-NSs with Bacillus subtilis and Salmonella typhimurium have shown promising prospects for the development of antibacterial agents.
