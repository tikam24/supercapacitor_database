From the electrically insulating nature to paving the way for their use in electrochemical energy storage technology, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have yet again demonstrated to be the most defining material of the 21st century. Their controllable structures, rationally tunable pore sizes and variational features warrant a brilliant electrical conductivity and high charge mobility. Prevalent to the direct application of metal-organic frameworks as supercapacitors (SCs), there is a growing need to strategically orchestrate these porous materials into active materials for energy storage. This chapter discusses the accomplishments and the challenges that remain in the development of high-performance MOF supercapacitors. Progress in Pristine MOFs, MOF composites, and derivatives are studied and emphasised. This section aims to interest readers in the ever-expanding research field of metal-organic frameworks to provide insight into the function of MOFs supercapacitors as a viable option for fulfilling the growing demands of the energy sector.
