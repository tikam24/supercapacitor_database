A new coordination polymer, [Ag5(brtmb)4][VW10V2O40] [1, brtmb = 1-bromo-4-(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene], has been synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Its structure was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and further characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, bond valence sum (BVS) analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Each of the [VW10V2O40]5– clusters in polymer 1 acts as an octadentate connector, connecting with eight silver–brtmb subunits to generate a three-dimensional structure. When employed as as the electrode material in supercapacitors, compound 1 showed remarkable electrochemical performances with a high capacitance of 13.3 mF cm–2 at 0.5 mA (206 F g–1 at 110 A g–1) and good cycling ability at various currents up to 2.0 mA (440 A g–1) with 81.7 % of the initial capacitance remaining after 1000 cycles. The above results reveal that polyoxometalate-based hybrid coordination polymers may be a new-generation alternative electrode material for high-performance electrochemical capacitors.
