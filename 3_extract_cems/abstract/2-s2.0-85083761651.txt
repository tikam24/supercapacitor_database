The doubly-fed wind turbine operates in the maximum power point tracking mode and cannot respond to the grid frequency change, and there is no standby active power to support the grid frequency control. When the wind power penetration rate increases continuously, the equivalent time constant of the system decreases, the frequency regulation pressure of the grid increases continuously, and the wind abandonment phenomenon is serious. The traditional control reduces power generation efficiency, speed adjustment range and frequent start of pitch angle control. To this end, a frequency adjustment strategy for coordinated control of doubly-fed wind turbines and energy storage devices was proposed. In the stochastic fluctuation of source and load, the power generation efficiency is close to the maximum power tracking mode, which is significantly higher than the overspeed load shedding control mode. At the same time, it also has a primary frequency adjustment capability that is significantly better than the traditional overspeed load shedding control, and does not require a pitch angle adjustment, which is beneficial to extend the life of the pitch system and improve its safety and reliability.
