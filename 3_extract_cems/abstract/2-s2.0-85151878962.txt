Herein, we prepared three-function chestnut-like CoZn-LDH by a facile one-step solvothermal method with excellent performance for energy conversion and storage. Specifically, the as-prepared products yielded outstanding water splitting performance (η10 = 160 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and η50 = 330 mV for oxygen evolution reaction) and high areal specific capacitance (2.24 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2). In addition, according to the electrochemical measurements, the viewpoint for explaining the coexistence of three functions (oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction and capacitive performance) in chestnut-like CoZn-LDH was proposed for the first time. Last but not least, this work definitely shed light on the construction of multifunctional material.
