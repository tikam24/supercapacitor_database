The ionic liquids (ILs) N-butyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium trifluoromethanesulfonate (PYR14Tf) and N-methyl-N-propyl-pyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PYR13FSI) are investigated as electropolymerization media for poly(3-methylthiophene) (pMeT) in view of their use in carbon/IL/pMeT hybrid supercapacitors. Data on the viscosity, solvent polarity, conductivity and electrochemical stability of PYR14Tf and PYR13FSI as well as the effect of their properties on the electropolymerization and electrochemical performance of pMeT, which features >200 Fg-1 at 60 °C when prepared and tested in such ILs, are reported and discussed; the results of the electrochemical characterization in N-butyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide of the so-obtained pMeT are also given, for comparison. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
