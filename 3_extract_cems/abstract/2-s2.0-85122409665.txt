Due to the overconsumption of fossil energy by the rapid pace of human production activities, the disappearing resources and deterioration of the living environment force researchers to exploit novel materials for energy storage. For this purpose, we developed O-doped carbons with an ultrahigh specific surface area possessing excellent ability for energy storage. For the application of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as anode materials, the prepared O-doped carbons show the highest specific discharge capacity of ca. 3211.7 mAh·g-1 at 0.1 A·g-1 initially, with the good cyclic stability of about 200 cycles at 1 A·g-1, which is a relatively high current density. Moreover, the obtained O-doped carbons are also used as cathode materials in zinc-ion supercapacitors (ZSs), which display a maximum energy density of up to about 144.2 Wh·kg-1 at 83 W·kg-1, exhibiting a long-life cyclic ability over 7000 cycles. The above-mentioned properties demonstrate that the synthesized carbons are bifunctional materials for energy storage in LIBs and ZSs, which may be assigned to the existence of abundant O-doped and hierarchical porous structures.
