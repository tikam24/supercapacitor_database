The mesoporous carbon hollow spheres with high surface area, mesoporous shell (pore size > 7.0 nm) and macroporous interior (> 50.0 nm) have been easily prepared by using gelatin-phenol formaldehyde polymer blend as organic template. Because of short diffusion pathways, the existence of the ion-buffering reservoirs, and the absence of microspores, the mesoporous carbon hollow spheres demonstrate a large specific capacitance of about 132 Fg- 1 at scan rate of 25 mVs- 1, and superior retention (≈ 90%) in capacitance even at high scan rate to 1000 mVs- 1. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of the resulted carbons retain symmetrically rectangular shape at all voltage sweep rate between 25 and 1000 mVs- 1. © 2008.
