Transition metal oxides with metallic composites are attractive for advanced electrodes due to their high capacitance, high conductivity, and low cost. Here, a multihierarchical structure (NiCo LDH/M Co3O4, M is the mass of Co3O4) of NiCo-layered double hydroxide (NiCo LDH) nanosheets uniformly grown on the surface cobalt oxide (Co3O4) is synthesized via a mild hydrothermal method. In particular, the NiCo LDH/50 mg Co3O4 nanocomposite material has the advantages of large specific surface area, wealthy aperture, high pseudo-capacitance, and small internal resistance. Electrochemical investigation reveals that the NiCo LDH/50 mg Co3O4 is rather outstanding, which delivers high energy density, long-life supercapacitor as a positive electrode material. It is worth mentioning that the specific surface area and specific capacitance of NiCo LDH/50 mg Co3O4 are threefolds and fivefolds that of pure Co3O4, respectively. The specific capacitance of NiCo LDH/50 mg Co3O4 is 1393.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with outstanding cycle stability (88.4% up to 5000 cycles). The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by employing the NiCo LDH/50 mg Co3O4 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which delivers a voltage window of 1.5 V and a high energy density of 46.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750.4 W kg−1. These excellent properties make it a promising candidate in electrochemical energy storage materials.
