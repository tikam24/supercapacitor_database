A series of reduced graphene oxide/cobalt oxide composites (Co3O4/rGO) were fabricated via a chemical precipitation approach and subsequent calcination in Ar atmosphere. Experimental results show that Co3O4/rGO composite with 86 wt% of Co3O4 loading exhibits the optimum specific capacitance of 240 F g-1 in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte at the current density of 0.8 A g-1, excellent quick charge-discharge performance and outstanding cyclic stability with 2.3% of its specific capacitance increase after 2400 cycles at the current density of 8 A g-1 in GCD test, exhibiting significant potential of Co3O4/rGO composite in the application of supercapacitors.
