Gasified rice husk carbon, which is a byproduct of power generation by gasification, can be converted to porous carbon (RHAC). This product is environmentally friendly, has excellent electrochemical performance, and represents a high value utilization of biomass resources. In this paper, the heterostructured nano composites were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal reaction. RHAC loaded sulfur-doped tin oxide was used to synthesize composites with a highly conductive porous structure, short ion/electron transport path, and enhanced pseudo capacitance kinetics. The specific capacitance of this composite was improved over that of biomass porous carbon RHAC. At a current density of 1.5 A/g, the specific capacitance of S-doped RHAC/SnO2 composite, RHAC/SnO2 composite, and RHAC were 215 F/g, 177 F/g, and 141 F/g, respectively. The current density was increased from 1 A/g to 5 A/g, and the specific capacity of the S-doped RHAC/SnO2 composite was maintained at 67% with good rate performance. At a current density of 0.4 A/g, the charge capacity was maintained at 78.5% after 5000 cycles of charge and discharge, indicating that the electrode has a long cycle life.
