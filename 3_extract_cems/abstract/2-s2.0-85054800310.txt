We have synthesized the titanium dioxide (TiO2)/graphene nanocomposite with simultaneous N-doping (N-TiO2/NG) by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis for energy storage application. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns, Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Raman spectroscopy was done to evaluate the morphology, crystalline structure and functionality of the material. The surface elemental composition and bonding was analysed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and EDS mapping. The N-TiO2/NG electrode showed a specific capacitance of 205.1 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1, with good cyclic stability of 78.8%, after 5000 continuous charge/discharge cycle at 1 A g−1, whereas TiO2/rGO showed only 67% of retention, which shows its potential for energy storage application.
