Mesoporous MnO2 with high specific surface area (192 m2 g-1) and narrow pore distribution (10 nm) was synthesized by a simple method through the reaction of potassium permanganate and ethanol under ultrasound irradiation. The obtained material was characterized with XRD, XPS, nitrogen sorption, TEM and FE-SEM. The electrochemical properties of synthesized material were determined with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle tests. The specific capacitances of 229 F g-1 and the specific capacitance retention of 97.3% after 2000 cycles were obtained. The excellent electrochemical property of this mesoporous MnO2 can be ascribed to its mesoporous structure and high specific surface area caused by the cavitation effect of the ultrasound during synthesis.
