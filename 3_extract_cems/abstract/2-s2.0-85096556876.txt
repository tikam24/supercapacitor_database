Transition-metal nitride (TMN) thin films are recognized as the leading electrode material for new generation, high-performance, stable, flexible, smart supercapacitor because these films exhibit wider voltage range, good sustainability and high electrical conductivity. Herein, we have deposited high quality thin film of metal nitride in controlled vacuum level by using reactive DC-magnetron sputtering for enhanced performance supercapacitor. TMN film was grown on 304 Stainless Steel (304 SS) substrate at 2000 C for 30 minutes in Ar-N2 atmosphere. TMN film of VN@SS was tested as an electrode material in aqueous solutions of 1M KOH at various scan rates. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed the film thickness and confirm the nanoflake type structure for the TMN film, while composition was confirm by the EDAX attached with SEM. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed the phase orientation and crystal structure of TMN film. These metal nitride based electrodes exhibited super hydrophilic nature (with contact angle 190 for VN@SS) in presence of used electrolytes and revealed enhanced volumetric capacitance with an excellent rate performance.
