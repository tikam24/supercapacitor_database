A novel ternary nanocomposite of nickel-manganese oxides/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (NMO/MWCNTs) coated with poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was prepared by chemical oxidation method. The filling of NMO particles inside MWCNTs and the uniform coating of NMO/MWCNTs with PEDOT intensified the capacitive behavior of MWCNTs. The lowest IR drop (0.1 V) and highest specific capacitance (SC) values of 526.55 F/g of NMO/MWCNTs/PEDOT imply it as highly efficient hybrid supercapacitor materials in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
