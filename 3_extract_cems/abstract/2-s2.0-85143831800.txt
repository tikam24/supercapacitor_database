Managing energy flows in a hybrid storage source powering an electric car is always tricky because there are endless ways to do it. The main questions to ask are how to optimally manage these flows and what is the right compromise between advantages and disadvantages. The management strategy based on fuzzy logic is proposed in this study. The popular software 'Matlab-Simulink' was used in our study to validate the feasibility and performance of this management proposal for three driving cycles which are the European NEDC standard, the real cycle carried out on the Twizy electric vehicle and finally for a WLTP class 3 cycles. The results obtained showed that this fuzzy logic strategy can play a key role in solving the problem of fluctuating range and power demand of an electric vehicle with battery and supercapacitor.
