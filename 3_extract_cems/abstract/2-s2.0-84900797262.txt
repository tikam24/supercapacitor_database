Nanobelt-like poly[Ni(salen)] obtained by electrodeposition of potentiostatic method has been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscope. The polymerization mode and the energy storage mechanism were investigated through the methyl replacement in the para-position of phenyl rings in Ni(salen) monomer and the removal of center metal ion Ni. The electrode samples were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.
