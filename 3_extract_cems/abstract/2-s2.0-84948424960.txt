In this paper, using CoS@NiCo2S4 as an example, we report the successful design and synthesis of a novel hierarchical core/shell metal sulfide with conductive CoS on nickel foam via a facile ion exchange process. The prepared sulfide core/shell nanoarrays exhibit superior redox reactivity for supercapacitors. High areal capacitances of 7.62 F cm-2 (almost a 2.5-fold enhancement compared with the CoO nanowire@NiCo2O4 sheet arrays) at a scan rate of 5 mA cm-2 and even 5.52 F cm-2 at 30 mA cm-2 were achieved. The superior electrochemical performance demonstrates that the CoS nanowire@NiCo2S4 sheet arrays are promising for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
