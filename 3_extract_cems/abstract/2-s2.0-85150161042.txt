To reduce the effects of large current shock on energy storage, the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of battery and supercapacitor together with energy management strategy to allocate energy supply reasonably is utilized in electric vehicle (EV). An optimization-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy was adopted to handle the current fluctuations under the different working conditions, as well as to solve the unmeasurable variables and nonlinear issues in prediction and linearization with the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In consideration of output error, battery energy loss, and battery current changes, the current fluctuations in battery can be decreased with the rolling optimization and quadratic programming. The results show that the 84.20% drop of current variance in battery, and 29.36% decreases in the Ampere-hour (Ah) throughout of battery can be obtained in HESS happens in the mode with the above energy management strategy than that without.
