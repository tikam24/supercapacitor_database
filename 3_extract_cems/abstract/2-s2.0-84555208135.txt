Graphene-based nanocomposites are emerging as a new class of materials that hold promise for many applications due to their unique nanostructure and particular properties. In this paper, a novel graphene sheets/Ag 2S composite was synthesized through a facile solvothermal method and its electrochemical performance was carried on a modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in a three-electrode electrochemical cell. The microstructure and morphology of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscope. The results revealed that β-Ag 2S nanoparticles (NPs) with an average size of ca. 53 nm were uniformly deposited on the surface of graphene sheets (Gs). The composite materials showed better electrochemical performance than the pure individual components and can be employed as supercapacitor materials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
