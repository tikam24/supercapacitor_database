Green solid polymer electrolytes have drawn attention as multifunctional electrolyte as compared to liquid electrolyte due to their flexibility membranes. In the present work, biodegradable iota-carrageenan polymer has been chosen as the host polymer with magnesium tri-fluromethanesulfonate (MgTf2) as the salt. The polymer film was incorporated with methyl-trioctylammonium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide (AmNTFSI) ionic liquid to amplify the ionic conductivity via adding mobile cations and tuning the crystallinity as well as the glass temperature of the polymer. Upon the incorporation of AmNTFSI, the ionic conductivity was remarkably augmented from (1.24 + 0.01) × 10−6 S cm−1 to the maximum value of (3.20 + 0.01) × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The thermal, structural, and temperature dependence conductivity measurements of polymer films (with and without AmNTFSI) have been analyzed, and the performance as the supercapacitor electrolytes has been evaluated.
