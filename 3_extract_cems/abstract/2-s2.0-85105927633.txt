Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-based electrode materials have drawn wide interest in energy storage applications. Herein, a nickel-based metal–organic framework (Ni-MOF) has been synthesized by simple hydrothermal reaction with different reaction times. The hydrothermal reaction time has an impact on the energy storage performance of the synthesized material. Structural characterization confirms the layered structure and purity of the synthesized Ni-MOF. Significantly, improved energy storage performance was found for the Ni-MOF prepared under reaction time 30 h as compared to other reaction times. It exhibits the highest specific capacity of 1498.6 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g along with good rate of capability. This investigation provides useful approach to improve the capacitive performance of MOF-based electrode materials.
