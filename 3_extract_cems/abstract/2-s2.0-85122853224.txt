In this study, graphene oxide (GO)-polyaniline (PANI) binary nanocomposite was prepared with a facile, green, and one-step in situ polymerization approach using dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid as a dopant and stabilizing agent to achieve production of processable GO-PANI nanocomposite for supercapacitor applications. The synthesized nanocomposites were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitor electrode materials were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) utilizing a two-electrode configuration. The effects of the amount of aniline-to GO-nanosheet ratio, used for preparation of the nanocomposite, on electrochemical performance were investigated. The GO-PANI nanocomposite demonstrated promising electrochemical performance towards supercapacitor applications. At 1 A/g current density, the GO-PANI electrodes show a high specific capacitance value of 269.3 F/g. In addition, the GO-PANI nanocomposite exhibited 81.3% specific capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles.
