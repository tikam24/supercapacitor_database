Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared by thermal reduction technique from graphene oxide (GO) in N2 gas atmosphere at 600Â°C for 1 h. The results shown that rGO possessed a multiple layer structure and a specific surface area BET of 389.9 m2/g. The electrochemical properties of the rGO materials have been investigated for supercapacitors. Electrochemical measurements show that rGO exhibit a specific capacitance of 85.3 F/g at 1 A/g, and still kept 85 % capacitance after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g, indicating rGO could be a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
