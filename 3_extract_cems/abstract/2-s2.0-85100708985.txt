To design a supercapacitor with fascinating properties, the development and fabrication of innovative electrode materials with interesting architectures are highly desirable. In this work, hierarchical Zn-Mn-Ni-S@NiSe assembled from Zn-Mn-Ni-S nanowires and NiSe nanosheets has been grown on nickel foamviaa consecutive hydrothermal reaction and electrodeposition route for supercapacitors. Owing to the tight contact between Zn-Mn-Ni-S and NiSe, Zn-Mn-Ni-S@NiSe offers an efficient nanoporous network, appropriate channels, and desirable conductivity for the rapid transfer of electrons as well as ions for the reversible reaction. In a three-electrode configuration, the optimized Zn-Mn-Ni-S@NiSe electrode shows higher capacity (358 mA h g−1), rate performance (71.8% up to 24 A g−1), and cyclability (90.1% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) than the optimized Zn-Mn-Ni-S electrode (287 mA h g−1at 2 A g−1and 64.8% up to 24 A g−1). Besides, a promising hybrid supercapacitor device using optimized Zn-Mn-Ni-S@NiSe and activated carbon demonstrates a desirable energy density (ED) of 59.6 W h/kg at 805.4 W kg−1and considerable cyclability of 86.6% after 10 000 cycles. Thus, this research proposes a favorable route for developing new electrodes for energy storage systems.
