We synthesized porous Co 3O 4/Ruo 2 composite using the soft template method. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was used to make micell as a cation surfactant. The precipitation of cobalt ion and ruthenium ion for making porosity in particles was induced by OH - ion. The porous Co 3O 4/Ruo 2 composite was completely synthesiszed after anealing until 250 oC at3 oC /min. From the XRD ananysis, we were able to determine that the porous /RuO2 composite was comprised of nanoparticles with low crystallinity. The shape or structure of the porous Co 3O 4 composite was studied by FE-SEM and FE-TEM. The size of the porous Co 3O 4/Ruo 2 composite was 20~40 nm. From the FE-TEM, we were able to determine that porous cavities were formed in the composite particles. The electrochemical performance of the porous Co 3O 4/Ruo 2 composite was measured by CV and charge-discharge methods. The specific capacitances, determined through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement, were ~51, ~47, ~42, and ~33 F/g at 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV/sec scan rates, respectively. The specific capacitance through charge-discharge measurement was ~63 F/g in the range of 0.0~1.0 V cutoff voltage and 50 mAh/g current density.
