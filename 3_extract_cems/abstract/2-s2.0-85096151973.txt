Metal ion hybrid capacitors (MIHCs) have been recognized as one of the most promising power sources owing to their combined merits of high energy density in batteries and high power output in supercapacitors. The kinetics mismatch between the capacitor-type cathode and battery-type anode yet must be well addressed before implementing their practical feasibility. Here, we overview the recent progress in sodium and potassium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs and PIHCs) and discuss the major challenges and give an outlook on the future directions in this field. The fundamental knowledge and the history will be firstly introduced, and special emphasis is then laid on the development of a variety of electrode materials in recent years. The prospects of future research of MIHCs are finally proposed towards their practical applications. We wish that this feature article can not only educate newcomers starting their reasearch in this field, but also inspire experieced researchers to contribute to the development of high-performance MIHC devices.
