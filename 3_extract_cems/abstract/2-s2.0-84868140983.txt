Abstract. Electric energy is the most convenient and clean energy sources, and it is used far and wide. While there are many problems of power quality which imperil greatly electronic loads. Modern times, high quality power supply is required by modern manufacturers, and a quick and efficient energy storage technology is now starved for in order to improve and solve the transitory power quality.As a new kind of energy storage component, super capacitors have fast response, high charge-discharge efficiency. This paper focuses on the application background that the super capacitor DC energy storage unit can improve the quality of electric energy, establish a mathematical model of the storage unit, analysis and design the control scheme of super capacitor DC storage energy system, to achieve rapid compensation of the instantaneous power of the system, effectively improving the power quality and stability of the system.
