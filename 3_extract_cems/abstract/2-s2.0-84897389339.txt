Self-organized vanadium oxy-fluoride nanotubular or nanoporous layers were grown by anodization of vanadium in a [BF4]- electrolyte. By a thermal conversion of this amorphous VOxFy precursor structure in ammonia gas, aligned vanadium oxy-nitride (VOxN y) nanoporous/nanotubular layers could be formed. We established conditions to reach conversion of precursor structures to a well crystallized VOxNy nanotube structure, without the formation of any secondary phases or the collapse of the ordered morphology. Such vanadium-nitride based structures have considerable potential in supercapacitor applications. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
