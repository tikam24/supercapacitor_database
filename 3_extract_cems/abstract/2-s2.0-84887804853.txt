TiO2 nanotube arrays have been treated with a facile cathodic reduction process to introduce oxygen vacancies. The capacitance of the treated sample is 13 times larger than the pristine TiO2 nanotube arrays. This work demonstrates a feasible and simple method to improve the electrochemical activity and conductivity of TiO2 for the use of supercapacitors. Â© OSA 2013.
