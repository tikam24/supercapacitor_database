NiCo2O4 has been proved to be a promising electrochemical material. In this work, a hollow NiCo2O4 material with an urchin-like structure is constructed by a self-template of Ni-Co complex compound based on the Ostwald ripening mechanism. During the thermal annealing in air, the residual carbon from the organic ligands of the Ni-Co complex compound leads to the generation of oxygen vacancies in urchin-like NiCo2O4. The as-obtained hollow NiCo2O4 (H-NiCo2O4-12) material manifests admirable specific capacitance of 886 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and preserves 80% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor of H-NiCo2O4-12//AC delivers an energy density of 33.4 W h kg-1 at 747.7 W kg-1 and a high coulombic efficiency of about 95%. The improved supercapacitive performance of H-NiCo2O4-12 is attributed to its synergistic effect of hollow structure and oxygen vacancies. The hollow urchin-like structure of NiCo2O4 can buffer the volume expansion, expose abundant reaction active sites, and favor the transport of ions; while oxygen vacancies can adjust the electronic structure of NiCo2O4, which can favor the transfer of electrons. This work may throw some light on designing a virtue supercapacitor electrode material with hollow nanoporous morphology. This journal is
