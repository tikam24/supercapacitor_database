TiO2 electrode material is a poor choice for supercapacitor electrodes because it has low conductivity, poor cyclic stability, and a low capacitance value. It is inevitable to enhance electrode materials of this kind by increasing the surface area and combining high electronic conductivity materials. In the current research work, it was proposed to combine reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as it might provide a large surface area for intercalation and deintercalation, and also, it could establish the shorter paths to ion transfer, leading to a reduction in ionic resistance. The size, surface morphology, and crystalline structure of as-prepared rGO/TiO2 nanocomposites were studied using HRTEM, FESEM, and XRD, respectively. Using an electrochemical workstation, the capacitive behaviors of the rGO/TiO2 electrode materials were assessed with respect to scan rate and current density. The capacitances obtained through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques were found to be higher when compared to TiO2 alone. Furthermore, the as-synthesized nanocomposites were able to achieve a higher energy density and better cycle stability.
