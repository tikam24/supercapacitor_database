Core-shell Ni(OH)2@CuO electrodes grown on three-dimensional copper foams were synthesized by a facile thermal oxidation and chemical bath deposition method. The electrochemical experiments present that the Ni(OH)2@CuO electrode delivers large areal capacitance (1.625 F cm−2 at 3 mA cm−2), excellent rate capacity (1.285 F cm−2 at 30 mA cm−2), and brilliant cycling stability (retaining 96.4 % after 5000 cycles). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device was designed taking Ni(OH)2@CuO electrode and active carbon (AC) as a positive and negative electrode, respectively. The ACS device exhibits a high voltage of 1.6 V and remarkable energy density up to 58.59 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 686.45 W kg−1. This work may serve to develop new areas of low-cost materials for energy storage and conversion system.
