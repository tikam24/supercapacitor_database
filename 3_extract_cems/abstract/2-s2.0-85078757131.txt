Developing low-cost electrode materials with high performance for supercapacitor still faces great challenges. In this work, CoTe2 nanoflowers (NFs) were successfully developed by employing a facile solvothermal route. The transmission electron microscopy image reveals that the thickness of the CoTe2 is approximately 20 nm, which will improve the contact area with electrolyte as well as boost the ions/chargers transport rate. Results from the electrochemical measurement disclose that the CoTe2 NFs electrode has an outstanding electrochemical capacitance of 460 F g−1 under 1.5 A g−1. Specifically, the 91% of electrochemical capacitance is retained after 5000 cycles, demonstrating its good cycle durability. Our results reveal that the CoTe2 NFs is kind of promising electrode material for use in the advanced energy storage system.
