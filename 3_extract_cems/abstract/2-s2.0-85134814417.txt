Designing novel nanostructured electrode materials is a vital step to upgrade electrochemical applications. Certain facile methods are followed to develop nanomaterials with unique morphology that could encourage electrode activity in a supercapacitor. Here we have explored the electrochemical behavior of hydrothermal synthesized Sn3O4 flower-type nanostructured for supercapacitor application. It is found that the mixed state of tin oxide (Sn3O4) is highly electroactive in 3 M KOH electrolyte which exhibited a high specific capacity of 194 C g−1. Such high charge storage may be due to the 3D-marigold flower-type morphology of Sn3O4 nanoparticles that could provide ample space for electrode–electrolyte interaction. The thin nanoflakes also afford a large number of active surfaces for the charging-discharging process. Further, the electrode was implemented in an asymmetric device with activated carbon. The device delivered 34.4 Wh/kg energy density at a 775 W/kg power density with 99.8% Coulombic efficiency for 5000 cycles. Thus, the Sn3O4 flower-type nanostructure is potential electrode material for charge storage in supercapacitors and the practical applicability of the asymmetric device is proved by illuminating the green light-emitting diode.
