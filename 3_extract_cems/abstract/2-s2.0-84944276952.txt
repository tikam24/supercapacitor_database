Cable-shaped supercapacitors (SCs) have recently aroused significant attention due to their attractive properties such as small size, lightweight, and bendability. Current cable-shaped SCs have symmetric device configuration. However, if an asymmetric design is used in cable-shaped supercapacitors, they would become more attractive due to broader cell operation voltages, which results in higher energy densities. Here, a novel coil-type asymmetric supercapacitor electrical cable (CASEC) is reported with enhanced cell operation voltage and extraordinary mechanical-electrochemical stability. The CASECs show excellent charge-discharge profiles, extraordinary rate capability (95.4%), high energy density (0.85 mWh cm-3), remarkable flexibility and bendability, and superior bending cycle stability (â‰ˆ93.0% after 4000 cycles at different bending states). In addition, the CASECs not only exhibit the capability to store energy but also to transmit electricity simultaneously and independently. The integrated electrical conduction and storage capability of CASECS offer many potential applications in solar energy storage and electronic gadgets. A novel coil-type asymmetric supercapacitor electrical cable (CASEC) is developed. CASECs show superb supercapacitive performance and excellent mechanical stability, which might be attributed to the nanostructured design of electrodes and the asymmetric and coiled configuration of devices. Moreover, CASECs exhibit dual capability that can store energy and transmit electricity simultaneously.
