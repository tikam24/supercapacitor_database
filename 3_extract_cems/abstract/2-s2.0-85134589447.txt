In this study, three-dimensional (3-D) architectures consisting of nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on carbonized cotton cloth (CC) were prepared and used as supercapacitors and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials. The surface morphology and mass of PANI on CNTs were altered by changing the concentration of aniline (AN) precursor in the polymerization reaction. It is found that when the PANI content on CNTs increased, the electric conductivity of nanocomposites decreased and the charge transfer resistance increased remarkably. The highest PANI-deposited nanocomposite was used to fabricate a proof-of-concept symmetric two-electrode supercapacitor, which exhibited an excellent areal specific capacitance of 3.1 F cm–2 (equivalent to a specific volumetric capacitance of 100.5 F cm–3) at the current density of 2.0 mA cm–2. In addition, the EMI shielding performance of the developed nanocomposites was studied, and the results revealed that 3 layers of nanocomposites with a thickness of less than 1 mm demonstrated an excellent shielding capability with total shielding effectiveness above 40 dB. Based on those findings, it is anticipated that the presented nanocomposite would be a potential candidate for flexible energy storage and EMI shielding applications.
