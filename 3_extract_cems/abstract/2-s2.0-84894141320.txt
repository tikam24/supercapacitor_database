We report the fabrication of one-dimensional highly electroconductive mesoporous graphene nanofibers (GNFs) by a chemical vapor deposition method using MgCO3·3H2O fibers as the template. The growth of such a unique structure underwent the first in situ decomposition of MgCO3·3H2O fibers to porous MgO fibers, followed by the deposition of carbon on the MgO surface, the removal of MgO by acidic washing, and the final self-assembly of wet graphene from single to double layer in drying process. GNFs exhibited good structural stability, high surface area, mesopores in large amount, and electrical conductivity 3 times that of carbon nanotube aggregates. It, used as an electrode in a 4 V supercapacitor, exhibited high energy density in a wide range of high power density and excellent cycling stability. The short diffusion distance for ions of ionic liquids electrolyte to the surface of GNFs yielded high surface utilization efficiency and a capacitance up to 15 μF/cm2, higher than single-walled carbon nanotubes. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
