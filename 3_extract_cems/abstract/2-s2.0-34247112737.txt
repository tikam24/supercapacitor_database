In this paper, the application of bicausal bond graphs for system design in electrical engineering is emphasized. In particular, it is shown how this approach is very useful for model inversion and parameter dimensioning. To illustrate these issues, a hybrid railway traction device is considered as a case study. The synthesis of a storage device (a supercapacitor) included in this system is then discussed. Â© IMechE 2006.
