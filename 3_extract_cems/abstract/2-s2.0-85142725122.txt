Supercapacitors play a crucial role in energy storage field in virtue of their high power density. However, their flexibility and energy density are still challenging to be improved for wearable electronics and other applications. Herein, carbon cloth (CC) is used as flexible substrate to incorporate NiO nanoparticles with a hydrothermal method, and to coat with graphene by a dip-coating treatment. The NiO with high redox activity and CC with excellent flexibility and conductivity enable fast ionic/charge transfer characteristics and superior electrochemical performances. Moreover, the flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (FASCs) are assembled, demonstrating a large potential window of 1.5 V, a high energy density of 33.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 750.0 W kg−1, a high capacitance retention of 92.6% after 10,000 cycles, and good flexibility. This work demonstrates great potential of the as-fabricated FASCs for future flexible wearable energy storage devices. Graphical abstract: Carbon cloth (CC) was used as flexible substrate to incorporate NiO nanoparticles with a hydrothermal method (named as NiO/CC) and to coat with graphene by a dip-coating treatment (named as G/CC). The flexible, conductive CC remarkably enhanced the conductivity and structural stability of electrodes. Moreover, the as-fabricated flexible supercapacitors demonstrated a large potential window of 1.5 V, a high energy density of 33.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 750.0 W kg−1, a high capacitance retention of 92.6% after 10,000 cycles, and good flexibility.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
