Supercapacitors are electrochemical devices that can store and restore electrical energy and are mostly used for powering dc or close-to-dc applications. As such they have not been explored enough for non-dc circuits. In this study, we implement a band-pass for frequency selectivity purposes and a relaxation oscillator for timing applications using a solid-state carbon electric double-layer capacitor. The expected behavior was observed for both circuits in the sub-Hertz and tens of Hertz frequency ranges. This confirms the possibility of using the frequency-dependent capacitive behavior of such devices in non-conventional low frequency applications not related to dc energy storage but requiring large time constants.
