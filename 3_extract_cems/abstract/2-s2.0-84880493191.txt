To handle the complexity of modern automotive power nets, simulation-based design methods are important and suitable models of all system components including the battery as a main part are therefore mandatory. However, simulation models of energy storage devices are difficult to obtain. In particular, batteries are time-variant and strongly non-linear. The paper presents an impedance-based modeling approach that copes with these characteristics and offers the development and parameterization of powerful models covering a wide dynamic range. The modeling approach has been applied to several different battery technologies. These models are already successfully used by an automotive manufacturer which reflects the applicability of this modeling approach. As an interesting example, this paper outlines the development of a NiMH battery model. Besides the impedance-based part of the model, the influences of the typical hysteresis effect of NiMH batteries is described in detail and an appropriate modeling approach is introduced.
