Electrochemical capacitors have been developing fast in recent years, and are slowly becoming an increasingly important component in the energy storage mix. Their particular properties, high power density, and medium energy densities, have made them suitable for a growing number of applications such as regenerative breaking and fast charging toys. Owing to its polarizability, electrical conductivity, accessibility, easy processability, relatively low cost, and chemical stability in a wide range of pH, traditionally, carbon has been the principal component of electrochemical capacitor electrodes. There are already well-established methods of obtaining high surface area materials with controlled pore size. Now graphene, with very high surface area and electrical conductivity seems a natural candidate material from which to make supercapacitor electrodes. This chapter reviews efforts toward the application of graphene in its various forms (from exfoliated powder to vertically chemical vapor-grown carbon nanowalls) into supercapacitor electrodes. Starting from a general introduction into the working and mechanism of capacitors and the context in which they operate, we review methods of electrode production, current performance, and possible application areas. We end by suggesting routes for further exploration.
