In the field of science, there is a significant interest in graphene due to its extraordinary properties such as high electrical conductivity, good electrochemical stability and excellent mechanical behavior. This paper presents the direct graphene growth on interdigital electrodes by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using Ni catalyst and methane (CH4) as the carbon source. The 100 nm of Ni was deposited on the top of SiO2 substrate functional as catalyst and electrode of MEMS supercapacitor. The growth of graphene was investigated at temperature 1000Â°C at 10 minutes and at fix power of 40 Watt. The morphology and structure of as- grown graphene were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). From Raman spectra, it is observed that the intensity ratio of the 2D band to G band produced a good quality bilayer graphene.
