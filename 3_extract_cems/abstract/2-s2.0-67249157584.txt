A machinery condition monitoring system from GE Energy for a trial in the industrial environment at the Nyhamna gas plant in Norway, is described. The trial focused on the power supply, which used a microgenerator to convert vibrational energy into useable electric energy and stored that energy in a supercapacitor for higher power bursts to determine and transfer condition monitoring data to a base station. The PMG17 microgenerator from Perpetuum was used as the vibration energy harvester during the trial. Machinery condition monitoring involved determining the vibrational spectrum of rotating machinery like pumps, motors, and turbines to examine their condition. Shell carried out field trial of this energy-harvesting system in the Nyhamna gas plant, which involved monitoring the condition of six rotating motors through sensors, reporting temperature, and vibration every five minutes.
