Nanosized NiO anode material was synthesized for lithium ion batteries and supercapacitor applications using pyrolysis of an oxalate precursor, which was prepared by a rheological phase reaction from nickel carbonate hydrate and oxalic acid. The obtained material was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transition electron microscopy (TEM). Cyclic voltammetry was conducted to examine the capacitive behavior of working electrodes made from these new NiO nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction results show that the particle size of the nanomaterials increases with increasing calcination temperature. The anode made from NiO at 400. °C shows a higher specific capacity (1188. mAh/g) than the anode made from NiO at 500. °C (1010. mAh/g). The better electrochemical behavior of the material prepared at 400. °C is attributed to higher porosity in the material. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
