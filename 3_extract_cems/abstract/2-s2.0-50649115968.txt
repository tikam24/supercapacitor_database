Comparative study of capacitative properties of RuO 2 /0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and Ru/0.5 M H 2 SO 4 interfaces has been performed with a view to find out the nature of electrochemical processes involved in the charge storage mechanism of ruthenium (IV) oxide. The methods of cyclic voltammetry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed for the investigation of electrochemical behavior and surface morphology of RuO 2 electrodes. It has been suggested that supercapacitor behavior of RuO 2 phase in the potential E range between 0.4 and 1.4 V vs reference hydrogen electrode (RHE) should be attributed to double-layer-type capacitance, related to non-faradaic highly reversible process of RuO 2 + ̇(OH - ) ad ionic pair formation and annihilation at RuO 2 /electrolyte interface as described by following summary equation: RuO 2 ̇ H 2 O ⇔ RuO 2 + ̇ (OH - ) ad + H + + e - (CB), where RuO 2 + and e - (CB) represent holes and electrons in valence and conduction bands, respectively. The pseudocapacitance of interface under investigation is related to partial reduction of RuO 2 layer at E<0.2 V and its subsequent recovery during the anodic process. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.
