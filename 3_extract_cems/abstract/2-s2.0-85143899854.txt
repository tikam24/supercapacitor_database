Cascaded H-bridge with bidirectional DC-DC converter (CHBDC) is promising in high voltage supercapacitor (SC) energy storage applications, in terms of multilevel voltage output, modularity, high efficiency, etc. However, the charging process becomes complicated when part of the SC voltages reach the target value ahead of the others. The improper charging may cause the CHBDC over-modulation and even grid current distortion. To solve this problem, this paper analyzes the stable operation area of the CHBDC in this scenario. Based on these analysis, a coordinated charging strategy is also proposed for the CHBDC, by adjusting the reference voltage of each H-bridge unit and the grid power factor. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed charging strategy.
