Disposal of a waste tire is a major environmental and economic issue. So to account for its re-usage different recycling methods have been studied. Among them, pyrolysis is regarded as one of the promising routes. Pyrolysis involves thermal degradation of the waste tire at elevated temperature. Tire pyrolysis process produces value-added products such as tire pyrolysis Oil (TPO), pyro char and pyro gas. TPO can be used for alternative fuel for the engine and can also be used as a precursor for benzene, xylene, toluene, and limonene synthesis. TPO has also been used as a precursor in the synthesis of carbon nanotubes. Pyro char can be converted to porous carbon structure and which can be used as adsorption and energy storage material like supercapacitor and battery. Pyro gas can be used directly as industrial fuel and hydrogen. In this way, the waste tire can be converted into valuable materials by pyrolysis.
