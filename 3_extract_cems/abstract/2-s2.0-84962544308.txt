Electrochemical capacitors utilize activated carbons for both positive and negative electrodes that show non-faradaic, double-layer charging-discharging mechanism in symmetric configuration. Thus the electrochemical capacitors are efficient energy storage devices that exhibit long lifespans and extremely rapid charge-discharge characteristics compared with batteries. Today, the capacitor technology is regarded as a promising means and has an additional advantage with increasing effectiveness when combined with solar and wind regenerative energy sources. In recent years, nano-composite battery materials have been vigorously researched in hopes to improve their energy density. Hybridizing battery and capacitor materials overcomes the energy density limitation of existing generation-I capacitors without much sacrificing the cycling performances. Normal battery-capacitor hybrids employ high-energy & sluggish redox electrode and low-energy & fast double-layer electrodes, possibly producing a larger working voltage and higher over-all capacitance. In order to smoothly operate such asymmetric systems, however, the rates of the two different electrodes must be highly balanced. Especially, the redox rates of the battery electrodes must be substantially increased to the levels of double-layer process. In this perspective we summarized various hybrid systems and show representative aqueous and non-aqueous asymmetric configurations for their energy-power enhancement. We attempt to identify the essential issues for the realizable hybrids and suggest ways to overcome the rate enhancement by exemplifying ultrafast performance of the Li4Ti5O12 nanocrystal prepared via a unique in-situ material processing technology under ultra-centrifuging.
