A hydrothermal method was used to prepare a hierarchical flower-like NiMoO4@Ni3S2 composite on a three-dimensional Ni foam substrate, and the effects of different amounts of ethylene glycol in the precursor solution on the morphology and performance of Ni@NiMoO4@Ni3S2 were investigated. The as-synthesized No-10/Ni3S2 electrode exhibits a specific capacity up to 870 C g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (capacity retention of 81.2% after 8000 cycles). More importantly, in a hybrid supercapacitor with a No-10/Ni3S2 as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode (No-10/Ni3S2//AC), the energy density of 128.31 W h kg−1 at a power density of 7106.4 W kg−1. As displayed, the performances make No-10/Ni3S2 a promising candidate as high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.
