Abstract We report a new method for the fabrication of flexible supercapacitor electrodes wherein mechanically exfoliated graphite on paper containing gold nanoparticles is used as supercapacitor electrodes. It has been found that the supercapacitor electrode made of paper containing gold nanoparticle with graphite exfoliation yields a capacitance, which is about 4.3 times higher than that of the electrodes without gold nanoparticles.
