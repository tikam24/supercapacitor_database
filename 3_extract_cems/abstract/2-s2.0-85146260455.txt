The self-supported nanoflake-shaped Bi2Se2 was synthesized with the convenient method of microwave reaction, and adhered to the flexible carbon fiber felt. A series of electrochemical tests indicate that capacitance of Bi2Se2/CF electrode can reach 877.0 C g-1 (1 A g-1). Assembled by ligninbased carbon materials and Bi2Se2/CF electrode, the asymmetric capacitor has the energy density of 20.83 W h Kg-1 while the power density can reach 749.9 W kg-1. After circulating for 2000 times under 3 A g-1, the remaining capacitance retention reaches 81% of the initial one.
