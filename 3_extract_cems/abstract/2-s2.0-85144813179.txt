Hybrid supercapacitor devices (HSs) are critical in developing electrochemical energy storage systems with large energy storage capacity and low operating costs. Here, we present the development of novel CdO-rGO nanocomposites, with changing rGO concentrations, as positive electrodes exhibiting outstanding energy storage performance. The nanocomposites were synthesized using a controlled and cost-effective hydrothermal technique. Interestingly, the composite with 25% optimal concentration (from now on referred to as CdO-25%rGO) demonstrated excellent specific capacitance (1195 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) with superior rate performance due to the addition of conductive rGO, allowing quick charge transfer kinetics. Inspired by the outstanding performance, we built CdO-25%rGO//AC HSC that expanded the voltage frame to 2 V when tested in a 3 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. Notably, the fabricated CdO-25%rGO//AC HSC delivered a high specific capacitance of 55 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and displayed a large energy density of 30 Wh kg−1 at a maximum power density of 5000 W kg−1 coupled with excellent stability (12% capacity fade after 7000 cycles). These findings provide a helpful, logical direction for developing materials with unique compositional properties and electrochemical performance for energy storage applications.
