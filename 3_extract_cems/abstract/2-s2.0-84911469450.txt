Ti/IrO2-SnO2-xCeO2 (mole fraction) electrodes with different mole fractions of CeO2 were obtained by thermal decomposition method at 360 ℃. The influences of the CeO2 content on microstructure and EIS properties of the prepared electrodes were investigated by XRD, EIS and stability test. The results show that the crystallization degree of the IrO2-SnO2 oxides decreases with increasing CeO2 content, which reveal that CeO2 can inhibit crystallization of IrO2-SnO2. The electrode with 20% CeO2 reaches maximum specific capacitance of 505.7 F/g, which is about three times than that of the IrO2-SnO2 binary oxides electrode. When the amount of CeO2 is less than 20%, the less effect on the transfer resistance (Rct) and relaxation time (τ) can be obtained. After 6000 times cycle, the specific capacitance of the electrode with 10%CeO2 increases by 34.39% and 20% CeO2 increases by 3.45%. The electrodes have good cyclic stability.
