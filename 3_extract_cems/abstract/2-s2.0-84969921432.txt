In this paper, large scale hierarchically assembled NiO nanosheets have been favorably fabricated through a facile hydrothermal route. The as-prepared NiO nanosheet assembles were characterized in detail by various analytical techniques. The results showed these nanosheets present the thickness of about 30 nm and the surface area is 116.9 m2 g−1. These NiO nanosheet assembles were used as the working electrode materials in electrochemical tests, which demonstrated a specific capacitance value of 81.67 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent long cycle-life stability with 78.5% of its discharge specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, revealing the as-synthesized NiO nanosheet assembles might be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
