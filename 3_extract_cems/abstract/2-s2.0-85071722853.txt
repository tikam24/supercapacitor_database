Single metal-organic coordination polymers have limited functions as precursors for porous carbon electrode materials. The construction of bimetallic organic coordination polymers can effectively utilize the advantages of each single metal-organic coordination polymer to improve the performance of the derived carbon materials. Herein, High performance nitrogen-doped porous carbon (BCFe–Ni) have been produced by directly carbonizing bimetallic organic coordination polymers formed by 4,4′-bipyridine (BPD) reaction with FeCl3 and NiCl2. The BCFe–Ni exhibits high nitrogen content (12.66 at%), large specific surface area (1049.51 m2 g−1) and hierarchical porous structure, which contributes to an excellent gravimetric specific gravity of 320.5 F g−1 and 108% of specific capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. The BCFe–Ni assembled symmetrical supercapacitor shows an energy density of 18.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 350 W kg−1. It is expected that the as-prepared N-doped porous carbon derived from bimetallic-organic coordination polymer is a promising electrode material for high performance energy storage devices.
