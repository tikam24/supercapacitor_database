In this study, we present a regulation architecture developed to coordinate a hybrid-powered source for an electric golf cart in a scaled operating of 5 kW. The hybrid power system is composed of a fuel cell stack, batteries, ultracapacitors bank, and their respective power conditioning units. To optimize the overall operation, the proposed strategy organized into three levels for its different frequencies and duration times in usage. The power demand for each energy source determined in realtime with a basis on frequency distribution and a cutoff frequency defined under the dynamical capacities of the sources. In this study, to consider the properties of each energy source, it is easy to find the optimal set point for them. Functional simulation obtained, where the power ensures the adequate battery and supercapacitor state of charge and soft current demands to keep the fuel cell working in its safe operating condition. Results also demonstrate that the control strategy allows the regulation of the DC bus voltage under the CYC-UDDS golf-cart-drive-cycle as load profiles.
