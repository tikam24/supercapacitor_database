A novel composite supercapacitor electrode material, MnO2 @ (004) preferred oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (p-MTNAs) had been synthesized via anodizing method and hydrothermal deposition. The experimental results showed that the introduction of p-TNAs to MnO2 could improve the electrochemical properties compared to the MnO2 @ random crystallography oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays (r-MTNAs), the reason was that the p-TNAs increased the electric conductivity for faster ion transport. The highest specific capacitance of p-MTNAs electrode could reach 190.6 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, p-MTNAs showed superior cycling stability, remaining 88% of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles.
