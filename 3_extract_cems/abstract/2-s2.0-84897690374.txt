MnFe2O4/graphene nanocomposite is synthesized and demonstrated as promising anode material for asymmetric supercapacitors. An asymmetric supercapacitor operating at 1.8 V is fabricated using MnFe 2O4/graphene as anode and MnO2/carbon nanotube as cathode. The asymmetric supercapacitor shows an energy density of 25.9 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 225 W kg-1 and an energy density of 18.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 14.4 kW kg -1, indicating an excellent power capability.
