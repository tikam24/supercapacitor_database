In this report, an RGO composite LaFeO3 material was prepared by a hydrothermal method and calcination method. The structure, morphology, and electrochemical behavior of LaFeO3/RGO composites were studied. In the composite, RGO is attached to the porous spherical LaFeO3, and the content of RGO has a great influence on the properties of the composite. The electrochemical performance of the LaFeO3/RGO sample is the best when the LaFeO3:RGO ratio reaches 1:2. When the current density is 1 A·g−1, the specific capacitance is 367.4 F·g−1, which is much higher than the sum of the current densities of LaFeO3 and RGO monomers. In addition, excellent cycle stability with a capacity retention of 89.2% after 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A·g−1 was obtained. Overall, the electrochemical behavior of the LaFeO3/RGO composites confirms the importance of composition adjustment of composites and demonstrates their potential as supercapacitors for energy storage applications.
