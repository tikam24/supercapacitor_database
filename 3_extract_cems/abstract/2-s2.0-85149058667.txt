Ni-MOF-derived NiO/Ni nanoparticles embedded on r-GO have been successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method followed by a calcination procedure (400 °C at Ar atmosphere) with different mass ratios of Ni-MOF and GO (1:0.1, 1:0.5, 1:1). The influence of GO addition with various mass ratios could enhance the electrochemical performance of Ni-MOF derived NiO/Ni electrode material. The mass ratio of (1:0.5) demonstrated the highest specific capacity (649.22 C g−1 at 3 A g−1) and maintained 81.1 % of its initial capacity value after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) with Ni-MOF derived NiO/Ni/r-GO composite and r-GO as the anode and cathode also displayed outstanding electrochemical performance. The value of maximum energy density reached 39.59 W h kg−1 and the maximum power density of 4.136 kW kg−1 with 85 % capacity retention. All these results confirmed that the MOF-derived NiO/Ni/rGO composite can be a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
