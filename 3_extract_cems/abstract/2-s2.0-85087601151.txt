New priorities in aircraft design are mapped out into an integrated holistic solution: an improved Green Taxiing system focused around the landing gear. The latter is streamlined through the use of fairings which also serve as landing gear doors. During the final approach phase, electric motors are used to rotate the wheels to the appropriate speed so as to reduce stress during touchdown. Energy, normally dissipated in heat, is collected in supercapacitors and used to power the aircraft subsystems for Green Taxiing. Titanium Matrix Composite is used to compensate additional weight. Super-capacitors power the aircraft during start and accelerations with engines turned off. For steady speed phase, the APU is used. An average 10 dB noise reduction is expected as well as a 4% decrease in operating costs and a 6% decrease in fuel consumption for a typical A320 mission.
