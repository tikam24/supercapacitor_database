Conducting poly(o-anisidine) coatings were obtained on low carbon steel in aqueous oxalic acid solution by using the galvanostatic technique. The coatings were characterised by potential-time relations, UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction measurements. The electrochemical performance of coated steel electrodes was evaluated on the basis of galvanostatic charge-discharge performance and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 0.5 M H2SO4. Maximum charging current was found in the case of the coating obtained at a current density of 8 mA cm-2 for 600 s duration at the supply voltage of 0.5 V. The estimated capacitance of the coated steel electrode for charging is 42.67 mF and 7.2 mF for discharging. It was also found that there was an increase in capacitance as a function of supply voltage and the maximum value was obtained at 0.5 V. The study reveals the possibility of using conducting poly(o-anisidine)-coated low carbon steel from oxalic acid medium as supercapacitor electrode materials.
