CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were synthesized by a facile one-step co-precipitate method. Their supercapacitor performances were investigated via a traditional three-electrode system and all solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor. The electrode shows a maximum specific capacitance up to 695 F·g−1. The flexible all solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated based on CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes and active carbon as positive and negative electrode. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance (97.3 mF·cm−2), good rate/mechanical stability and a long cycling stability (5000 cycles), demonstrating great promise for applications in all solid-state flexible supercapacitors.
