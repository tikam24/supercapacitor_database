The well-designed MWCNTs/MnO 2 /PPy composites, used as an anode in an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), were successfully synthesized via three steps. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)exhibits that the composites have a special structure which is composed of nanotubes and many particles. To enhance the electrochemical performance of the composites, the redox additive (I - /I 2 )with 1 mol L −1 Na 2 SO 4 solution is employed as electrolyte. As expected, cyclic voltammetry (CV)and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD)tests verify that, in three-electrode system, the specific capacitance can reach 806 F g −1 at the current density of 1 A g −1 with 1 mmol of I 2 . At the same time, after assembling an asymmetric supercapacitor with active carbon (AC), the maximum energy density and power density of the device is 92.4 Wh kg −1 and 761.9 W kg −1 , respectively. The most important thing is that the practical application of MWCNTs/MnO 2 /PPy composites can be strongly demonstrated by successfully lighting a light-emitting diode.
