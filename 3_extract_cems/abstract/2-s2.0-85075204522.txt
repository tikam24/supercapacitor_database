Porous carbon are excellent electrode materials for energy-storage devices. Here, we present a facile in-situ reduction method to improve the electrochemical performance of carbon materials by gold nanoparticles. The prepared porous carbon microspheres decorated with gold-nanoparticle had a 3D honeycomb-like structure with a high specific surface area of about 1635 m2 g−1, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The electrochemical performance of as-synthesized porous carbon microspheres was exemplified as electrode materials for supercapacitor with a high specific capacitance of 440 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 100% after 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Our method opened a new direction for the gold-nanoparticle-decorated synthesis of porous carbon microspheres and could be further applied to synthesize porous carbon microspheres with various nanoparticle decorations for numerous applications as energy storage devices, enhanced absorption materials, and catalytical sites.
