A new sol-gel process for the preparation of ultrafine Nickel hydroxide electrode materials was developed. The composite electrodes consisting of carbon nanotubes and Ni(OH)2 were prepared by mixing the hydroxide and carbon nanotubes in 20% ratio. A maximum specific capacity of 320 F路g-1 was obtained for the composite electrode compared with that of activated carbon (184 F路g-1). In order to enhance energy density, a combined type pseudocapacitor/electric double layer capacitor was considered and its electrochemical properties were investigated. Values for the specific energy and maximum specific power of 20.11 Wh路kg -1 and 8.6 kW路kg-1, respectively, were demonstrated for a cell voltage between 0 and 1.6 V. By using the modified anode of a Ni(OH)2/ carbon nanotubes composite electrode, the combined supercapacitor exhibited high energy density and stable power characteristics.
