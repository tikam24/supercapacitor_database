Sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) is a bio-electrochemical device that uses anaerobic bacteria to produce renewable energy. The voltage generated by SMFC is very low, so directly it cannot be applied to modern electronic devices. But, it is feasible to raise the output voltage of SMFC by connecting them in series-parallel combinations. In the present work, four SMFC modules are developed in the laboratory and by connecting in four different ways the output voltage as well as the output current are raised to the utility levels. The primary cause to avoid the practical application of series and parallel connected SMFC is voltage reversal problem. To do away with this problem, in this work each group of SMFCs is first used to charge a super-capacitor (4 F, 5.5 V) and then it has been used to power the dc boost converter. Moreover, in this research work, the effects of charging and discharging times of super capacitors for each module are also investigated. In the final stage, a dc boost converter is presented to step-up the voltage of stacked SMFCs which provides a regulated output voltage (9 V/12 V) at the load. The results obtained, show that module-4 connected boost converter provides higher output current for a longer duration as compared to other super capacitor connected modules. This technique of energy harvesting from SMFCs can be used as a power source (either of 9 V or 12 V) in practical electronic devices.
