Cr2O3 was prepared using a simple hydrothermal procedure followed by annealing and then used as the electrode material in supercapacitors. The as-prepared Cr2O3 exhibited good electrochemical performances. The maximum specific capacitances were 203 F/g at 10 mV/s and 130 F/g at 1 A/g. The Cr2O3 also showed good cycle-life stability and a low resistance, so Cr2O3 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
