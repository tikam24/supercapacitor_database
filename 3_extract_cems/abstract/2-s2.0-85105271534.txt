In this work, a non-toxic and mild strategy was presented to efficiently fabricate porous and nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets. Silkworm cocoon (SCs) acted as carbon source and original nitrogen source. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) could facilitate the SCs to expose silk protein and played a catalytic role in the subsequent activation of calcium chloride (CaCl2). Calcium chloride served as pore-making agent. The as-obtained carbon materials with protuberant porous nanosheets exhibit high specific surface area of 731 m2 g−1, rich native nitrogen-doped of 7.91 atomic %, wide pore size distribution from 0.5 to 65 nm, and thus possessing high areal specific capacitances of 34 μF cm−2 as well as excellent retention rate of 97% after 20 000 cycles at a current density of 20 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The assembled carbon nanosheet-based supercapacitor displays a maximum energy density of 21.06 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 225 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Experimental results show that a mild and non-toxic treatment of biomass can be an effective and extensible method for preparing optimal porous carbon for electrochemical energy storage.
