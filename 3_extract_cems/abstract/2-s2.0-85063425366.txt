A design of photovoltaic energy system consisting of a solar panel and hybrid supercapacitor is discussed. The application of lithium-ion capacitor in photovoltaic energy system is considered to be a novel promising way in order to fill up the gap between the specific energy, power and service life of the battery and supercapacitor. In this work there was developed an advanced lithium-ion capacitor that can provide both a sufficiently high energy density and the increased power density and service life. Developing the lithium-ion capacitors, the capacity of cathode can vary over a wide range, reaching the value required for the optimum photovoltaic energy system performance.
