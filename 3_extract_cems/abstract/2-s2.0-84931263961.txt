Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) are of great interest in energyrelated research and applications, partly due to their high surface areas, uniform pore channels, and narrow pore size distributions. During the past decades, a number of breakthroughs for the synthesis of OMCs, including hard templating methods and soft templating strategies, have been made by carbon chemists. Thanks to unique properties, OMCs-based supercapacitors are attracting more and more attention around the world in recent years in view of their ultrafast chargedischarge rate, high power capability, low maintenance, and long cycle life. In this chapter, we wish to overview those representative pathways for OMC materials and their performance in supercapacitor application.
