Due to the excellent mechanical, electronic, and optical properties, hydrogels made from the composite play a key role in fabricating lots of devices and further applications in bioelectronics, energy storage, and even medical delivery. MXenes, as one type of advanced two-dimensional material, have been explored in wide ranges of fields. In this work, a novel fabrication method is proposed to fabricate MXene-based composite material hydrogel. We have demonstrated the excellent mechanical stretching ability of this hydrogel. By the addition of MXene, the conductivity enhancement of composite hydrogel has been realized. Furthermore, this hydrogel is promising in further micro-/nano-electronic devices like microelectrodes and supercapacitor.
