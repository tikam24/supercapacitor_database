Li4Ti5O12 and LiNi1/3Co 1/3Mn1/3O2 electrode materials were prepared by solid state reaction. The structures and morphologies of these electrode materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical properties of the samples were investigated by cyclic voltammograms and charge-discharge tests. Among the composition explored, the electrochemical supercapacitor, which contained active carbon (AC) mixed with 10% LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn 1/3O2 and Li4Ti5O12, achieved the best specific capacitance of 178.6 F g-1 at 80 mA g -1 and maintained 92.5% specific capacitance value after 50 cycles.
