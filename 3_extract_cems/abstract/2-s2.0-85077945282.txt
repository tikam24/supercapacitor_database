Potassium-ion batteries are promising candidates for large-scale energy storage applications owing to their merits of abundant resources, low cost, and high working voltage. However, the unsatisfying rate performance and cycling stability caused by sluggish K+ diffusion kinetics and dramatic volume expansion hinder the development of potassium-ion batteries. In this study, we design a flexible potassium-ion hybrid capacitor (PIHC) by combining the K-Sn alloying mechanism on the Sn anode and the fast capacitive behavior on the AC cathode with high surface area and mesoporous structure. After optimization, the fabricated Sn||AC PIHC achieves both a high energy density of 120 W h kg-1 and high power density of 2850 W kg-1, much better than other similar hybrid devices. Moreover, a gel polymer electrolyte with a 3D porous structure and high ionic conductivity was employed to improve the structural stability of the Sn anode, which not only realizes good flexibility but also achieves long cycling stability with a capacity retention of nearly 100% for 2000 cycles at a high current density of 3.0 A g-1,.
