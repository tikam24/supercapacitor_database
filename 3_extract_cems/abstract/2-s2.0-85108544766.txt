In order to obtain high-performance flexible electrodes for supercapacitors, the nitrogen-doped delaminated-Ti3C2Tx (N-d-Ti3C2Tx) decorated with MoOx nanoparticles (N-d-Ti3C2Tx/MoOx) films are prepared by a one-step solvothermal method. The N-d-Ti3C2Tx nanosheets with high conductivity can facilitate electron transfer during the charge and discharge process, and the MoOx nanoparticles can contribute to high pseudocapacitance. Hence, their combination is expected to not only inhibit N-d-Ti3C2Tx nanosheets from re-stacking, but also enhance the specific capacity of the whole electrode. Here, benefiting from the synergistic effect of the two components, the obtained optimal flexible and free-standing N-d-Ti3C2Tx/MoOx film electrode delivers an ultrahigh capacity of 341.0 C g−1 (920.6 C cm−3, 487.1 F g−1, 1315.2 F cm−3) at the scan rate of 2 mV s−1, and shows superior capacity retention of 99.2% after 11000 cycles at the current density of 5 A g−1. Moreover, the flexible and free-standing N-d-Ti3C2Tx/MoOx film electrode is also beneficial to promote the development of flexible supercapacitors.
