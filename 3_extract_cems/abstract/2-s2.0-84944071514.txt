In this paper, a modeling and simulation method for planar interdigitated ruthenium oxide MEMS supercapacitor was proposed based on the electrochemical reaction mechanism of supercapacitor. The study simulated the planar interdigitated ruthenium oxide MEMS super capacitor using Comsol software. The highly accurate charge and discharge curves of the super capacitor, electric potential distribution graph and the concentration distribution graph were got through simulation. The effects of two structure-parameters were discussed in the research.
