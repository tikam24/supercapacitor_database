This work describes fabrication of a flexible supercapacitor electrode. The fabrication starts with graphite paper (GP). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are then grown directly to the carbon surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), forming a heterogeneous structure of GP/CNT. The integration of CNT enhances capacitive performance while maintaining the flexibility of GP, thus making GP/CNT a promising supercapacitor electrode material for potentially powering microsystem technology.
