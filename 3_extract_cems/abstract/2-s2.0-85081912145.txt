The development of supercapacitors with high-energy and high-power density as well as a long life cycle is highly desirable. Emerging two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials such as graphene have attracted great attention for use in supercapacitors, especially for their application to flexible, light, and compact electronic devices, owing to their excellent electric conductivity, high flexibility, and ultralight mass. First, we review in this chapter the state of the art of using 2D graphene nanomaterials for energy storage. Second, we report our strategies using 2D nanomaterials to improve electrode performance and subsequent energy density. A hybrid graphene/Ni foam (HGNF)-based MnO2/HGNF//polyaniline(PANI)/HGNF supercapacitor was prepared by in situ electrochemical techniques. The MnO2/HGNF//PANI/HGNF provides an excellent energy density of 41.0 Wh kg-1 at 787.3 W kg-1. We also address the strategy of using a 2D interfacial layer to improve electrode conductivity. The initial specific capacity in lithium-ion batteries using CuO cubes as anodes increases about 10 times at a 0.5Â°C rate after modification. Finally, we summarize the merits and drawbacks of 2D nanomaterials for application in energy storage devices.
