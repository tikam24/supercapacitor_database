Compact graphene film electrodes with a high ion-accessible surface area have the promising potential to realize high-density electrochemical energy storage (or high volumetric capacitance), which is vital for the development of flexible, portable, and wearable energy storage devices. Here, a novel, ultrafast strategy for stitching graphene sheets into films, in which p-phenylenediamine (PPD) molecules are uniformly intercalated between the graphene sheets, is simply constructed at the ethanol/water interface. Due to uniformly interlayer spacing (âˆ¼1.1 nm), good wettability, and an interconnected ion transport channel, the binder-free PPD-graphene film with a high packing density (1.55 g cm-3) delivers an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (711 F cm-3 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1), high rate performance, high power and energy densities, and excellent cycling stability in aqueous electrolytes. This interfacial stitching strategy holds new promise for the future design of enhanced electrochemical energy-storage devices.
