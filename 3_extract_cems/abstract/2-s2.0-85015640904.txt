In this study, sunflower marrow is used as raw material to prepare porous carbon via a simple carbonization method activated by ZnCl2 and FeCl3 mixture. The as-prepared porous sunflower marrow carbons (PSMCs) show large number of mesoporous and masoporous, maximum specific surface area of 1628.5 m2 g-1 and large pore volume of 2.34 cm3 g-1. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, the PSMCs possess high specific capacitance of 252.5 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. A symmetric supercapacitor used PSMCs as electrodes exhibits energies density of 12.4 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 817 W kg-1 operated in the voltage range of 0-2.0 V in 0.5 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Also, the carbon material shows excellent cycleability retains about 97% initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
