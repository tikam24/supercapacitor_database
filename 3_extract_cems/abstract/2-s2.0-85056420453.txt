This paper gives information about a Electric Vehicle (EV) which is most reliable with extended range power source. The main energy source consists of solar PV, a battery and Ultra capacitor (UC). Battery acts as a main energy source to the system which is connected with the Ultra capacitor and acts as a source of energy during the transient phase, for example during starting and braking of motor. Solar PV cell works during the steady-state operation. The advantage of this arrangement is improved travel range, reduction in the size of battery with improved battery life and fast response during the transient. When there is irregular solar irradiation, there is the deficiency of power source, so the system requires a energy storing device. Usually Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries are used for this kind of application. But to provide a large demand of current during the motor startup, it degrades battery plates which in return degrades the battery. The other method of providing large demand of current is to add VRLA batteries and super capacitors, to build a new hybrid storage system. In this hybrid system the battery will act as a continuous source of energy and the ultra capacitor will provide instant power .This paper is going to summarize the various other method of improving the efficiency of Electrical vehicles.
