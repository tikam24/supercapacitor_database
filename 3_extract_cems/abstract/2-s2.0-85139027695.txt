A hybrid material is defined as a material composed of an intimate mixture of inorganic components, organic components, or both types of components. In the last few years, a tremendous amount of attention has been given towards the development of materials for efficient energy harvesting; nanostructured hybrid materials have also been gaining significant advances to provide pollutant free drinking water, sensing of environmental pollutants, energy storage and conservation. Separately, intensive work on high performing polymer nanocomposites for applications in the automotive, aerospace and construction industries has been carried out, but the aggregation of many fillers, such as clay, LDH, CNT, graphene, represented a major barrier in their development. Only very recently has this problem been overcome by fabrication and applications of 3D hybrid nanomaterials as nanofillers in a variety of polymers. This book, Hybrid Nanomaterials, examines all the recent developments in the research and specially covers the following subjects: 3D hybrid nanomaterials nanofillers Hybrid nanostructured materials for development of advanced lithium batteries High performing hybrid nanomaterials for supercapacitor applications Nano-hybrid materials in the development of solar energy applications Application of hybrid nanomaterials in water purification Advanced nanostructured materials in electromagnetic shielding of radiations Preparation, properties and application of hybrid nanomaterials in sensing of environmental pollutants Development of hybrid fillers/polymer nanocomposites for electronic applications High performance hybrid filler reinforced epoxy nanocomposites State-of-the-art overview of elastomer/hybrid filler nanocomposites
