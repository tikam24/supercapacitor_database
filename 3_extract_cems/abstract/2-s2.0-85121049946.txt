Pine tree biochar produced by flame-curtain pyrolysis, an inexpensive and simple pyrolysis methodology, was used as the starting material for KOH-activated carbon. Flame-curtain pyrolysis is a simple, low-technology methodology that can be performed by non-specialized personnel. The elemental analysis of the biochars highlighted the high reproducibility of the process. The N2 adsorption isotherms indicated that KOH activation was effective for the preparation of high-surfacearea activated carbons from the biochar. The BET specific surface area increased with the quantity of KOH added in the activation process, achieving a maximum value of 3014 m2 g−1 at 85.7 wt.% of KOH addition. The adsorption isotherms of all samples were IUPAC type I, establishing their microporous nature. Results from the Mikhail–Brunauer (MP) method and αs plot indicated that the pore size distribution became wider and the pore volume increased as the KOH content increased. The measured capacitance values followed the same dependence on KOH content. The maximum capacitance value at 1 mV s−1 was determined as 200.6 F g−1 for the sample prepared at 75 wt.% of KOH addition. Therefore, pine tree biochar prepared by simple pyrolysis equipment is a suitable precursor for the development of an electric double-layer capacitor.
