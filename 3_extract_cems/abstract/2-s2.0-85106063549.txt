The NiCo2S4/C hybrid material was successfully prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Carbon composite increases the specific surface area of the material and provides more ion attachment points during the electrochemical process. Conducive to the ion transportation and transfer, the composition of carbon material greatly improves the conductivity of the hybrid material. Electric double-layer capacitor materials can accept transferred ions faster than pseudocapacitor materials, enable the hybrid materials better adapt to intensity current changes. Compared with a single carbon material or a pseudocapacitance material, it has a higher specific capacity. This discovery is of great significance to the research of pseudocapacitive materials and supercapacitors.
