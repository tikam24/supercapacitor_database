This paper presents a new configuration of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) to split the power between battery and super-capacitor (SC), and cooperative operation of multiple HESS in DC microgrid. The power sharing between the battery and the SC is achieved by means of the combination of internal battery resistance and output LCL filter, which consists of SC and two inductors. The battery current is compensated so that it smoothly changes regardless of any disturbance. The effect of the LCL parameters is investigated and evaluated by simulation with PSIM software. The simulation results prove that the proposed HESS configuration achieves high stability performance, lower cost and easy application to DC microgrid.
