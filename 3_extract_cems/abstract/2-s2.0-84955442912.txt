We present direct synthesis of graphene on vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) forest to form 3D CNT-graphene network by mean of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The multi-dimensional material assemble process is achieved by a first CVD process to construct CNT forest; the electroplating process to deposit an uniform metal film around individual CNTs; and a second CVD process for the synthesis of graphene. The large surface areas of VACNTs and high electrochemical reactions sites from graphene and metal particles (as pseudocapacitors materials) are utilized to enhance the electrochemical capacitance of the system.
