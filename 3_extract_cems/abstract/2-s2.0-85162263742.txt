In line with the upward demand for renewable energy resources, researchers have made tremendous efforts to develop sustainable graphene-based energy storage systems. Heteroatom doping of graphene significantly boosts the performance of emerging technologies like electrochemical energy storage systems. Various approaches have been used to achieve heteroatom doping in graphene for tunable chemical, electrical, and mechanical properties. Benefiting from such a distinct property, heteroatom-doped graphene can provide a key to the development of novel materials for effective energy storage applications. In this view, we summarize and discuss the latest progress in the synthesis and applications of heteroatom-doped graphene in batteries and supercapacitors.
