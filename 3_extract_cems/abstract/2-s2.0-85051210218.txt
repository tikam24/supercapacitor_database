This paper proposes an optimal power distribution method for multi-objective wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, aiming to improve the transmission flexibility and satisfy various power demands. Previous studies have barely explored the impact of wide-range and unpredictable variations of load parameters on the performance of multi-channel power transmissions. In this paper, by taking the impact of equivalent impedance, motion, power demand variation and response speed of charging object into consideration, an optimal power distribution scheme with fast response, high stability and high accuracy is proposed to satisfy various power demands from multiple objectives including portable electronics, moving electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and super capacitors, without using any communication networks. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by simulation results based on different charging cases and experimental results based on a 10W prototype.
