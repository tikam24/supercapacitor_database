The overuse of plastic products has caused serious environmental problems. It is of great importance to recycle waste plastics and convert them into high value-added materials, which can reduce pollution and save energy effectively. In this review, firstly, the application of supercapacitors and the current state of plastic recycling were stated, and waste plastic treatment methods, the energy storage characteristics of supercapacitors and the potential value of using waste plastics to prepare carbon materials for supercapacitors were introduced. Then, the preparation methods of porous carbon electrode materials were presented, and the specific requirements of the methods and their advantages and disadvantages were briefly analyzed. Next, some kinds of common plastics were introduced according to the type of plastics, and the research status of these common plastics used as carbon materials for supercapacitor was summarized. Recycling and converting waste plastics into activated carbon materials for supercapacitors was a new type of waste plastic recycling and reuse mothed, which can solve the problem of white pollution effectively.
