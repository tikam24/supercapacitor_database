Electrospinning is a simple and highly versatile method to produce one-dimensional polymeric, inorganic, and hybrid nanomaterials with controllable diameters, morphologies, and compositions. Due to their high aspect ratios, large surface areas, high porosities, and tunable compositions, electrospun nanofiber electrodes are considered ideal candidates for applications in a variety of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices. This chapter discusses recent research on electrospun nanomaterials for supercapacitor (SC) applications, including the architecture designs and their electrochemical performance. According to the charge storage mechanisms of SC electrodes, electrospun nanomaterials can be mainly classified into three kinds: electrochemical double-layer capacitive carbon nanofiber-based materials, pseudocapacitive conducting polymers, and metal oxide nanofiber materials and their hybrid materials. For each material class, the emphasis is directed at addressing the relationship between the compositions, nanostructures, and electrochemical properties of the electrospun nanomaterials. This chapter highlights the recent advances of electrospun nanomaterials for SCs, suggests new strategies to improve their electrochemical performance further, and pushes forward the future prospects of these promising materials for energy storage applications.
