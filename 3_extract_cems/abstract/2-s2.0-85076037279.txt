A polycarboxylic acid-based tritopic ligand H3L and a MOF, [Me2NH2][Co3(OH)(L)2(H2O)3]∙6H2O (1) have been synthesized. Both ligand and 1 have been characterized by various analytical techniques. The MOF 1 consists of a trinuclear anionic cobalt(II) cluster [Co3(μ3-OH)(L)2(H2O)3]‒ which is extended in two-dimension (2D) to result in a framework structure. When MOF 1 was tested as an electrode material for supercapacitor application, it showed a specific capacitance of 300 ​F g-1. The MOF showed retention in specific capacitance of ~94% after 1000 cycles.
