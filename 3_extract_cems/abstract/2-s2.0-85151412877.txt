Lithium ion micro capacitors (LIMCs) demonstrate competitive advantages of simultaneously high energy/power densities and long cycle life over many other micro supercapacitors and micro batteries. However, these performances are significantly determined by the carbon anode with fast Li+ storage kinetics. Herein, a design strategy at the precursor side of a typical porous aromatic framework-5 (PAF-5) from the carbon bonding levels is proposed, and coupling with the post pyrolysis, the sp2/sp3 domains ratio, interlayer spacing, and pore structure of derived carbons can be synergistically balanced. The inherited sp2 domains and porous structure from PAF-5 endow the derived carbon with high electron transport capability and fast Li+ adsorption capacity. Meanwhile, the developed sp3 domains and enlarged interlayer spacing also enable abundant and fast Li+ intercalation contribution, giving rise to a superior rate capability (141.9 mAh g−1 at 4 A g−1) that is 13 times better than a commercial graphite anode. A flexible LIMCs based on this carbon anode are fabricated, and simultaneously high energy/power densities (71.1 mWh cm−3/1.9 W cm−3), long cycle life (94.7% after 6,000 cycles), and flexibility are achieved, demonstrating a great feasibility of designed PAFs as the trimmed carbon anode precursors for high performance Li+ storage.
