This paper describes various setups for testing electric vehicle (EV) on-road operating conditions. The significance of a high-power density energy source during EV acceleration and deceleration is highlighted in this work. The drive motor (DM) draws a large current during acceleration, the magnitude of which is determined by the acceleration time and vehicle parameters. Also, the source must capture all of the regenerative power from the DM during deceleration. The battery life will be reduced if it is used as an energy source for acceleration. Furthermore, due to its low power–density, the battery cannot quickly store regenerative power. To meet the aforementioned requirements, a high power–density source, such as an ultracapacitor (UC), is required. The simulation results as well as hardware results are shown for EV emulation systems.
