The hierarchical hollow microspheres of ε-MnO2 have been synthesized through a facile chemical method at room temperature followed by selective removal of manganese carbonate structures with HCl. The microstructure and morphologies of the resulting materials are investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicate that the product obtained by simple reaction for 3 min has a porous shell with excellent permeability and uniform pore-size distribution. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectra. As a result, the hierarchical hollow ε-MnO2 showed the specific capacitance of 115 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. These results demonstrate that the ε-MnO2 as electrode materials have potential application for high-performance supercapacitors. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
