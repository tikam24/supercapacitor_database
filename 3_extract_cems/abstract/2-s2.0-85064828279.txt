Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors (Li-HSCs) are attracting extensive attention because of their high energy/power densities. However, the performance of most Li-HSCs suffers from the limitation of the sluggish kinetics of battery-type anodes. Herein, we demonstrate that with dual protection of carbon and graphene, a three-dimensional, strongly coupled ZnFe 2 O 4 @C/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite anode provides an effective solution to this issue. The covalent C-O-M linkage between ZnFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles and C/RGO promotes charge transfer and enhances structural stability. Two kinds of carbon-based buffering layers are able to well accommodate the volume change during charging/discharging, endowing the composite anode with high rate performance (692 mA h g -1 at 5 A g -1 ) and outstanding cycle life (98.3% of capacity retention after 700 cycles at 1 A g -1 ). The resulting ZnFe 2 O 4 @C/RGO//activated carbon Li-HSC shows an ultrahigh energy density of 174 W h kg -1 , excellent power density of 51.4 kW kg -1 (at 109 W h kg -1 ), and superior cycle life (80.5% of retention capacity after 10 000 cycles at 5 A g -1 ).
