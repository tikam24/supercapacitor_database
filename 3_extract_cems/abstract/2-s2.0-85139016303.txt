Global energy and environmental issues are driving the development of modern advances in efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage systems. Such systems must meet a range of requirements, which include high energy and power density, long service life, flexibility, industrial scalability, security and reliability. Progressive achievements in the field of energy storage are associated with the development of various kinds of batteries and supercapacitors. Supercapacitors are state-of-the-art energy storage devices with high power density, long lifespan, and the ability to bridge the power/energy gap between conventional capacitors and batteries/fuel cells. However, supercapacitors have limitations associated with low energy density, which can be solved by using various types of current collectors, since current collectors are one of the main massive components of supercapacitors. This review gives a complete understanding of the effect of current collectors on the actual performance and properties of supercapacitors. We reviewed current collectors based on carbon and metal-containing materials, and supercapacitor configurations to identify possible improvements in electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, power density, service life and variability in their application.
