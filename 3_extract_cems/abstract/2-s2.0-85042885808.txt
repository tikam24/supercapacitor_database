Lithium chloride doped polyaniline (PAni-LiCl) has been synthesized for using as an electroactive material for supercapacitor application. The morphological studies have been carried out by using SEM and HR-TEM techniques, while thermal studies have been made through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Characterization of the surface composition of the PAni-LiCl have been performed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical characterization was done by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and impedance spectroscopy measurements. The synthesized PAni-LiCl is subjected to electroanalytical technique to study the supercapacitor behavior. PAni-LiCl used as the electroactive material, could provide maximum specific capacitance of 395 F g −1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s −1 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 as electrolyte obtained from cyclic voltammetry technique and the specific capacitance of PAni-LiCl measured by the galvanostatic charge-discharge curve at a current density of 1 A g −1 shows 471 F g −1 using the same electrolyte. PAni-LiCl is observed to yield a higher energy density and power density of 65.42 W h kg −1 and 178.57 W kg −1 respectively. 100% Columbic efficiency has been attained after 1000 cycles. The specific capacitance of 167.28 F g −1 could be obtained through impedance spectroscopy.
