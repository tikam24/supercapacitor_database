In this demonstration a test bench is presented to test and exhibit the operation of a Switched Capacitor DC-DC converter, designed in 130nm CMOS technology. The converter generates a stable 0.9 V from an input voltage range of 1.2 to 2.3 V, that is provided by a supercapacitor power supply charged by a PV cell. The demonstration allows to select between different loads to change the output power level of the converter (up to 1 mW of output power). The voltages and currents of the input and output of the converter are measured in real time in order to create a real time graphical visualization of the several parameters of the converter.
