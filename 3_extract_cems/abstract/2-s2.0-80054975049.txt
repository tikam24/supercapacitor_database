Commercialization and popularization for HEVs are highly depended on the vehicle price and performance attributes. A novel hybrid electric vehicle architecture is designed and researched for HEV cost reduction while maintaining HEV's potential to improve the fuel economy and drivability. In this architecture, an All-In-One-Controller (AIOC) is designed, low-cost powertrain components are selected, and a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) using supercapacitor and battery concept is implemented. Cost validation and performance simulation are finished, and the results show that HEV cost can be reduced significantly and desired performance can be achieved. Copyright Â© 2010 by ASME.
