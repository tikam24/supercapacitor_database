The excellence of MXene electrode material for high performance battery and supercapacitor devices represents immense possibility to construct MXene-based metal ion capacitors (MICs) with a high energy/power density and long cyclic life. Various reports indicate that the MXene and its composites/heterostructures can be a suitable anode material to assemble MICs in non-aqueous/aqueous electrolytes. The pillaring of MXenes with Sn4+, Fe2O3, TiO2, Fe3O4/C, SnO2, NaNbO3, MoS2, CNTs, graphene, etc. effectively alleviates restacking of nanosheets and provides large interlayer spacing as well as additional active sites. Formation of three-dimensional network with porous structures and heteroatom doping are also advantageous for high performance electrode materials. Results indicate that the MICs can achieve a high energy density (up to 241 Wh kg−1) like rechargeable battery, a high power density (up to 25,000 W kg−1) like supercapacitor, and a satisfactory cyclic stability. This article reviews state-of-the art MXene-based anode materials for various MICs. After a brief introduction about the MICs, its storage principle, historical background, and insights of the MXene synthesis, property, and storage mechanism, the article summarizes/evaluates the electrochemical performance of various MICs assembled by the MXene-based anode materials. Finally, we outline challenges/future prospects of the MICs using MXene-based anode materials.
