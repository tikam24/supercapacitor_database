The application of supercapacitors as energy storage in the regulated electric drive allows to solve problems related to the reception, storage and further use of the braking energy. In this paper the problem of design of a controlled DC drive model with bidirectional DC-DC converter and a supercapacitor unit is under consideration. We examine the block diagram and the operating principle and modes of a bidirectional DC-DC converter. The DC drive circuit with a supercapacitor unit connected to it is described in the article. In the final part of the article the simulation results are given. The designed model shows that the use of supercapacitors in a controlled electric drive can significantly reduce its energy consumption.
