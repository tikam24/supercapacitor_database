The various methods that have been reported for the synthesis of nanostructured carbons are reviewed, emphasizing sol-gel processing, soft-templating and hydrothermal procedures. Hybrid materials can be obtained by incorporation of nanosized carbon components, such as carbon nanotubes or graphene-derived materials. In addition, the carbon surface chemistry can be tuned by functionalization with surface groups and/or by doping with heteroatoms, in order to suit specific applications. Nanostructured porous carbons can play a decisive role towards the development of efficient and cost-effective electrochemical devices for energy conversion and storage. In this article, we focus on novel electrocatalysts for fuel cells and electrolysers, and electrodes for electric double layer capacitors.
