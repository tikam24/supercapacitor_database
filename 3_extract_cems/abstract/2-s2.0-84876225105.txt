Ternary composites of amorphous carbon nanotube/MnO2/graphene oxide (a-CNT/MnO2/GO) were synthesized by a facile direct redox reaction between potassium permanganate and a-CNT, which was prepared by anodic aluminum oxide template method following co-filtration with GO. Needlelike, 100-nm-thick, MnO2 crystals were homogeneously coated on the a-CNT surface, which was then covered with GO. The electrochemical performance of the resulting MnO2-coated a-CNTs exhibited a specific capacitance of 473 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, and excellent charge/discharge stability after 500 cycles.
