The intercalation capacitance in MnO2-based supercapacitor gives rise to a higher energy density compared with the traditional supercapacitors. However, the ion intercalation process was greatly influenced by the surface charge distribution in the electrode. Optimizing the MnO2 surface charges for facilitating electrolyte ions intercalation/deintercalation becomes an effective way to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Herein, a harmonization effect was achieved between the electrolyte ion and surface charge of the typical MnO2-based electrode. In the experiment, by introducing redox radical 4-Hydroxy-2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethyl-piperidinooxy (HTEMPO) into the electrolyte, dissolved Mn2+ combines with negative-charged HTEMPOâˆ’ groups and forms an electrically neutral region during discharging, which significantly weakens the electrostatic repulsion effect of Mn2+ on electrolyte ions and enhances the intercalation of Na+ effectively. Such an electrochemical mechanism was carefully studied and confirmed by combining the electrochemical impedance and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance. The resulted electrode delivers superior electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 773 F/g, which is about 220% higher than that without HTEMPO (~357 F/g). Besides, the proportion of intercalation capacitance increases by ~3.3 times after adding HTEMPO, reaching 64.2% compared with that of 19.3% without HTEMPO. It is believed that the novel strategy proposed in this work will be greatly beneficial for the development of high-performance supercapacitors.
