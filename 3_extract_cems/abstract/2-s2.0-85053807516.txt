K1.33Mn8O16 nanorods were successfully prepared by a facile sol–gel method with KHCO3, Mn(Ac)2 and citrate acid as raw materials. The cyclic voltammetry results demonstrate that the K1.33Mn8O16 nanorods exhibit a quasi-reversible K+ intercalation/deintercalation behavior in a 0.5 M K2SO4 aqueous solution. It has also been found that the assembled activated carbon (AC)//K1.33Mn8O16 asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 17.74 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 210 W kg−1, and an energy density of 8.18 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 2124 W kg−1. Moreover, the AC//K1.33Mn8O16 supercapacitor shows a good cycling property. To the best of our knowledge, the synthesis of K1.33Mn8O16 nanorods via the sol–gel route and the use of K1.33Mn8O16 in supercapacitors are reported for the first time.
