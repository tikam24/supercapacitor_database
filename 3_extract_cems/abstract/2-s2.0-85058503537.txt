Electrochemically active organic materials are one of the best choices for replacing metal-based electrode materials in energy storage devices for their advantages of low cost, high capacitance, high safety performance and abundant reserves. In this paper, 1-aminopyrene and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets composites are successfully synthesized via solvothermal method. When used as electrochemically active organic material, it demonstrates that the nanocomposites electrodes show high capacitances with wonderful super-long cycle stabilities under the synergistic effect of various components. The as-obtained AprC2 electrode displays a capacitance as high as 381.48 F g−1 at 0.6 A g−1 and an superior rate performance. Furthermore, a high energy density of 43.67 W h kg−1 (0.72 kW kg−1) with excellent super-long cycle stability for over 12,000 cycles is obtained. These results strongly demonstrate that the easily synthesized electrode materials are very promising to replace metal-based composites to fabricate the next generation energy storage devices.
