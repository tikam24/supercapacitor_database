We report here the development of MnO2 nanostructure electrode for electrochemical energy storage application. MnO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a facile and efficient precipitation approach have been investigated for supercapacitor application. The structures and morphologies of MnO2 nanoparticles were systematically studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The synthesized nanoparticles are observed spherical in shape with uniform size distribution. The electrochemical properties were studied in two-electrode configuration by cyclic voltammetry process. A specific capacitance of 52.8F/g has been obtained for MnO2 nanoparticles at scan rate of 100mV/s. The electrode is able to deliver a power density of 0.66kW/kg and energy density of 1.8Wh/kg.
