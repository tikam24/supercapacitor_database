An electrolyte, N,N′-1-ethyl-4-butyl, triethylene diamine hexafluorophosphate dissolved in glutaronitrile, was developed and investigated in a symmetrical supercapacitor using activated carbon as electrodes (active carbon/active carbon). The electrochemical erformance of the supercapacitor was examined using ac impedance and constant current charging/discharging tests. According to the results, its singleanode specific capacitance could reach 324.7 Fg -1. The supercapacitor also has better capacitance characteristics. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
