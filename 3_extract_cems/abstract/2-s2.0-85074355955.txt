A self-powered origami paper-based analytical device (oPAD), being with a pop-up structure as mechanical valve to first realize dual-mode of differential pulse voltammery (DPV)/supercapacitor amplified signal read out systems, was designed for detecting adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) assisted by glucose oxidase (GOx)-triggered reaction. In order to accommodate the alternative step for dual-mode detection, a pop-up structure inspired by pop-up greeting cards was developed, making it possible to change the fluidic path with good registration and repeatability. To realize supercapacitor detection mode, a sandwich structure of a DNA sequence (DNA1), aptamer and a DNA sequence modified with GOx (GOx-DNA2) was formed on detection zone by hybridization reaction. With the addition of ATP, the GOx-DNA2 could be released with the specific binding between ATP and aptamer, and flowed into the reaction zone to catalyze the oxidation of glucose. Due to the difference in concentrations of [Fe(CN)6]3- and [Fe(CN)6]4- caused by the GOx-triggered reaction, a voltage could be produced to charge a paper supercapacitor which could provide a high instantaneous current with a digital multimeter to transduce the result of the assay, and realize the self-generation of an amplified electrical signal. By simply varying the direction of pop-up structure, the electrochemical signal from DPV read out mode could be achieved through catalytic oxidation of glucose by the remaining GOx-DNA2 on the detection zone. The proposed self-powered oPAD enabled the sensitive diagnosis of ATP in a linear range of 10–5000 nM with a limit of detection of 3 nM and 1.4 nM, respectively.
