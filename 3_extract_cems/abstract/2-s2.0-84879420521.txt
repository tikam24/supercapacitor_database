This report demonstrates a simple, but efficient method to print highly ordered nanopillars without the use of sacrificial templates or any expensive equipment. The printed polymer structure is used as a scaffold to deposit electrode material (manganese dioxide) for making supercapacitors. The simplicity of the fabrication method together with superior power density and energy density make this supercapacitor electrode very attractive for the next-generation energy storage systems.
