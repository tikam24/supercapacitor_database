Co(OH)2 particles were prepared with CoCl2 as the raw material and NH3-H2O(28wt%) as the precipitation agent by homogeneous precipitation method. The flower like α-Co(OH)2 obtained by the addition of surfactant Tween-80 was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical tests show that this material has a better capacity, and its specific capacitance as single electrode is up to 370 F·g-1.
