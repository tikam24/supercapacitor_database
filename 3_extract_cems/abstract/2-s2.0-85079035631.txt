Cyber-attacks have adverse effects on power grids. Although lots of studies have been performed on the impacts of cyber-attacks, but it is not understood which cyber-attack affects the power grid most. This information will be helpful in designing robust and resilient controllers for mitigating the adverse effects of cyber-attacks. This paper attempts to analyze the impact of various cyber-attacks and makes their ranking in terms of severity in a power grid. Nine types of cyber-attacks have been considered on the photovoltaic (PV) system located in a hybrid power grid consisting of wind generator, PV, synchronous generator, energy storage and loads. The severity of the attacks has been determined through a voltage-based index. Simulations have been performed by using the Matlab/Simulink software. Simulation results show that the hybrid power system is deteriorated due to cyber-attacks. Also, the Denial of Service attack affects the power system most and the Packet Drop attack affects the system least.
