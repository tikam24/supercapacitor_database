Electrochemical performances of LiCoO2 as a candidate material for supercapacitor are systematically investigated. LiCoO2 nanomaterials are synthesized via hydrothermal reaction with consequent calcination process. And the particle size increases as the calcination temperature rises. LCO-650 sample with the largest particle size displays the maximum capacitances of 817.5 FÂ·g-1 with the most outstanding capacity retention rate of 96.8% after 2000 cycles. It is shown that large particle size is beneficial to the electrochemical and structural stability of LiCoO2 materials. We speculate that the micron-sized waste LiCoO2 materials have great potential for supercapacitor application. It may provide a novel recovered approach for spent LIBs and effectively relieve the burdens on the resource waste and environment pollution.
