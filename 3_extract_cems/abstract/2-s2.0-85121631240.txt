As accurate step counting is a critical indicator for exercise evaluation in daily life, pedometers give a quantitative prediction of steps and analyze the amount of exercise to regulate the exercise plan. However, the merchandized pedometers still suffer from limited battery life and low accuracy. In this work, an integrated self-powered real-time pedometer system has been demonstrated. The highly integrated system contains a porous triboelectric nanogenerator (P-TENG), a data acquisition and processing (DAQP) module, and a mobile phone APP. The P-TENG works as a pressure sensor that generates electrical signals synchronized with users' footsteps, and combining it with the analogue front-end (AFE) circuit yields an ultrafast response time of 8 ms. Moreover, the combination of a mini press-to-spin-type electromagnetic generator (EMG) and a supercapacitor enables a self-powered and self-sustained operation of the entire pedometer system. This work implements the regulation of TENG signals by electronic circuit design and proposes a highly integrated system. The improved reliability and practicality provide more possibilities for wearable self-powered electronic devices.
