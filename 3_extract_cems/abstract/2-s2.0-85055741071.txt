We report herein a high energy density asymmetric supercapacitor cell consisting of polyaniline as a positive electrode and heteroatom-doped activated carbon as a negative electrode in aqueous sulfuric acid electrolyte. Polyaniline is prepared via oxidative polymerization of aniline using hydrothermally prepared manganese dioxide oxidant. Nitrogen and sulfur-doped activated carbon is prepared from AC by hydrothermal synthesis, employing ammonium thiocyanate as a heteroatom precursor. This asymmetric supercapacitor cell is cycled in the voltage range of 0 to 1.4 V, which exhibits an excellent performance with a high specific capacitance of 592 F g−1 and a high energy density of 80 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1, while symmetric cell configuration of individual components of polyaniline//polyaniline and activated carbon//activated carbon shows less performance, i.e., 35 W h kg−1 at 214 W kg−1 and 33 W h kg−1 at 286 W kg−1, respectively. Furthermore, asymmetric cells show good cycling stability retaining over 72% of its initial capacitance even after 10,000 continuous charge–discharge cycles at a higher discharge current, 5 mA. Practical device is demonstrated in the form of a CR2032 coin cell. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
