Layered sodium manganese oxides (LSMOs), with two-dimensional channels for ion diffusion, have been regarded as the promising electrode materials in the application of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, the layered Na0.5Mn2O4·1.5H2O was synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method by controlling the molar ratio of sodium and manganese. When the molar ratio of sodium to manganese is 3:1, Na0.5Mn2O4·1.5H2O has shown the best capacitance of 369 F/g with current density of 0.5 A/g, and maintained a capacitance of 265 F/g after 2000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor consists of the sodium manages oxides as the positive electrode and active carbon (AC) as the negative electrode in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 solution. The voltage of the asymmetric supercapacitor has been expanded to 0～2 V with an energy density of 10.13 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg based on the total weight of both active electrode materials when the mass ratio of AC to Na0.5Mn2O4·1.5H2O was 3:1.
