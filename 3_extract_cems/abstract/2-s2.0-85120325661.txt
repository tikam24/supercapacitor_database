Energy storage is currently one of the most significant technological challenges globally, and supercapacitor is a prominent candidate over batteries due to its ability for fast charging and long lifetime. Supercapacitors typically use porous carbon as electrodes, because of both the high conductivity and surface area of the material. However, the state-of-the-art porous carbon described in the literature uses toxic chemicals and complex procedures that enhance costs and pollute the environment. Thus, a more sustainable procedure to produce porous carbon is highly desirable. In this context, xerogel-like carbons were prepared by a new, cheap, simple route to polymerization reactions of tannin-formaldehyde in a bio-oil by-product. Using bio-oil in its natural pH allowed a cost reduction and avoided using new reactants to change the reactional medium. Textural properties and electrochemical performances were improved by fast activating the material per 20 min. The non-activated carbon xerogel presented a capacitance of 92 F/g, while the activated one had 132 F/g, given that 77% of the components used are eco-friendly. These results demonstrate that renewable materials may find applications as carbon electrodes for supercapacitors. Overhauling the synthesis route with a different pH or replacing formaldehyde may enhance performance or provide a 100% sustainable carbon electrode.
