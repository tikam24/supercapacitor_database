A cost-effective bimetallic NiCo2O4@nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) nanocomposite was prepared through bimetallic nickel/cobalt metal organic frameworks (Ni/Co-MOF) by employing a smart approach to utilize the waste Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics for energy storage applications. The NiCo2O4@NC nanocomposite was characterized successfully using analytical techniques. The nanocomposite comprises high surface area (813 m2 g− 1) and mesoporosity (~ 15 nm). NiCo2O4@NC nanocomposite demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of ~ 890 F g− 1 at 5 mV s− 1 and ~ 913 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 in 6 m KOH electrolyte. The cyclic stability tests confirm excellent retention capacity (~ 99%) with fifty cyclic segments. Low-cost, environmental friendly approach, and rich redox activity of NiCo2O4@NC nanocomposite make it an alternate potential electrode material for energy storage devices.
