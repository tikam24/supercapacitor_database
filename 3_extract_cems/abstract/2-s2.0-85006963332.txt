The optimal energy balance and effective using of mobile electric devices supplied from traction power supplies is the most limiting qualities in practice. The inconvenient combination or choice of different motors, batteries or supercapacitors is very often designed from the view of functionality mainly and energy balance is solved as the second step. This paper shows power-energy design of all-purpose mobile container platform for application in factory buildings. This presented design will be realized in interoperation logistics in manufacturing.
