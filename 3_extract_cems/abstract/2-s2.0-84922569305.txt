V2O5/Ketjin black (VK) nanocomposites with mesoporous mica-like structure were prepared by a facile sol-gel method. Through a dip-dry process, the VK nanocomposites were successfully assembled on nickel foams with controllable mass loadings. The as-prepared electrode (VK2) shows high areal capacitance (3.9506 F cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2) and good cycling stability (90% after 8000 cycles) in a LiCl/PVA gel electrolyte. Furthermore, the VK nanocomposite-based all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor can provide a maximum energy density of 56.83 W h kg-1. Such excellent electrochemical performance may promote the VK nanocomposites as promising electrode materials for practical applications. This journal is
