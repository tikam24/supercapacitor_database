Manganese sulfide is promising material for electrochemical applications. In this work, crystalline, porous, and nanostructured MnS2 and MnS2/carbon nanotube electrodes are prepared using dip dry and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods at room temperature (300 K). Comparative charge storage of MnS2 and MnS2/carbon nanotube is examined in aqueous Na2SO4 and KOH electrolytes. The superior charge storage of MnS2/CNT in Na2SO4 is observed with highest specific capacitance of 855 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 current density and 90.1% capacitance retention for continuous 5000 charge discharge cycles. The improvement in electrochemical charge storage of MnS2/CNT is associated with reduced electron transfer path and low equivalent series resistance (ESR) in Na2SO4.
