We report an all-solid-state supercapacitor with device fabrication by a simple vacuum thermal evaporation method, which allows not only a multilayer stacking structure to further enhance the capacitance, but also permits the supercapacitor to be easily incorporated with other electronic devices, showing interesting characteristics for both fundamental study and practical applications. Discussions about the mechanism of the supercapacitor is given. Â© 2005 American Institute of Physics.
