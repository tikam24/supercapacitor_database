Designing binder-free and core-shell-like electrode materials with synergistic effects has attracted widespread attention for the development of high energy density hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Herein, binder-free cobalt molybdate nanosheet-laminated cobalt phosphate micropetals on nickel foam (CoM NS@CoP/NF) were facilely prepared for use as an effective battery-type electrode in HSCs. With the multifunctional features, the rationally combined core-shell-like CoM NS@CoP/NF electrode exhibited a maximum capacity of 886.8 Î¼A h/cm2 at a current density of 5 mA/cm2 with a good rate capability of 64.2% and cycling stability of 87.4% (after 10 000 cycles). The high electrochemical performance of the hybrid composite could be attributed to the synergistic effects of hierarchical architectures and large accessible electroactive area, which facilitates the fast electron/transportation within the active material and accelerates the redox chemistry process. Utilizing the superior energy-storage properties, a pouch-type HSC was fabricated with core-shell-like CoM NS@CoP-6 h architectures as a battery-type electrode and activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte. The miniature hybrid device exhibited maximum energy and power densities of 0.44 mW h/cm2 and 40.35 mW/cm2, respectively, with good cycling stability. Moreover, the HSCs can energize various portable electronic equipments, which demonstrates their suitability for real-time applications.
