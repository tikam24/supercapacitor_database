In this report, graphene oxide (GO)-supported sheet-like CuO nanostructures have been fabricated through a novel room temperature method using copper-based metal-organic framework (MOF)-anchored graphene oxides. Copper terephthalate metal-organic framework (Cu-(BDC)-MOF) crystals were synthesized onto the surfaces of exfoliated graphene layers via coordination of the metallic centers with the oxygen functionalities of graphene oxides and terephthalate linkers. The alkaline ageing of the MOF supported graphene oxides in NaOH at ambient temperature leads to the GO/CuO hybrid nanostructures. The morphology and structure of the synthesized materials are examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). The well-dispersed sheet-like CuO nanostructures on graphene oxides show excellent performance in supercapacitor applications.The GO/CuO hybrid nanostructures are capable of delivering a high specific capacitance of 606 F gâˆ’1 at scan rate of 2 mV s-1 with excellent cycling stability over 93% retention of initial capacitance.
