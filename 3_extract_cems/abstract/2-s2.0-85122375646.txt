We studied a supercapacitor with high purity carbon paper electrodes [1] with a specific gravity of 20 g/m2. The specific capacitance of the electrode during assembly in a coin cell housing with an aqueous 6M KOH electrolyte, at a scan rate of 1 mV/s, is 52 F/g. The specific power is 195.42 W/kg and the specific energy is 0.19 Wâˆ™h/kg at a scan rate of 100 mV/s, which is included in the region of supercapacitors in the Ragone plot.
