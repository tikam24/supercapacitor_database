A novel based electrochemically active various electrodes (Carbon nanotube, metal oxides, conducting polymers and nanocomposites) materials has been overviewed for the development of supercapacitor applications. Different kinds of morphological (Flowers, nano fibers, nano wires, nano rod and nanoporous) based electrodes were reported reasonable specific capacitance, specific power, specific energy and excellent cyclic stability etc. The necessity of energy storage devices extremely focused on the following parameters such as cost-effective, cycle life and safety usage. In spite of that, the need of supercapacitors achievements in higher specific capacitance and long-durability of the electrochemical reaction have been carried out. In this article, we studied the different choice of electrode materials, capacitors classifications, morphological structure, BET surface and electrochemical optimization of the overall supercapacitors performance. Recently, most of the researchers have significantly addressed nanocomposite electrodes, because of, due to increase the BET surface area, narrow sized distribution and improve their supercapacitors (Specific capacitance, specific powers, specific energy and cyclic durability) parameters. The above discussed over all surveys literatures of electrochemical parameters, which can be used as emerging technologies for supercapacitors.
