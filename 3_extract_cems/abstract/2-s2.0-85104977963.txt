Nowadays, with the increasing world demands for cost-effective and clean energy storage systems, Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted attention more than ever. So, this review provides a comprehensive report of the strategies, synthesis methods, applications, and electrochemical studies over different types of Functionalized Graphene Oxides (FGOs) and their composites in the development of SCs. The results of several investigations on the materials used in SCs, such as novel Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs), Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), Conductive polymers, and Biomass-based FGOs, as well as their composites (binary and ternary), were discussed in detail. These materials have been considered essential parts of SCs development in recent years due to their unique properties. Also, the ways to fabricate Graphene-based electrode materials, along with the standard fabrication methods for energy storage devices, are entirely explained. Furthermore, this article reviewed the impact of the electrode materials morphology and the influence of the electrode components on the performance of the SCs.
