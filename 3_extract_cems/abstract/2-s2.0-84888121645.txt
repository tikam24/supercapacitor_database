In this work, we have successfully synthesized hierarchical ultrathin mesoporous NiMoO4 nanosheets through a simple hydrothermal method for the first time. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared NiMoO 4 nanosheets have been investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Remarkably, the as-prepared NiMoO4 displays a high specific capacitance and excellent rate capability. Even at a high current density of 20 A g-1, it still possesses a specific capacitance up to 1200.5 F g-1, and about 75% of the capacitance is retained as the charge-discharge rate changes from 2 to 20 A g-1. It is noted that a high specific capacitance about 1172.4 F g-1 is obtained after 2000 cycles at a current density of 6 A g-1. These results imply that the hierarchical ultrathin mesoporous NiMoO4 nanosheets could be a promising candidate for high performance supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
