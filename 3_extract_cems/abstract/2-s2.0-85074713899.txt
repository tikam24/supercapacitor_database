In this work a rapid and facile method has been adapted to synthesize Mn-MoO4/G nanocomposites through the self-limiting deposition of nanoscale Mn-MoO4 on the surface of graphene under hydrothermal conditions. The electrochemical performance of the nanostructured Mn-MoO4/G composite materials has been investigated. Mn-MoO4/G nanocomposite displays the specific capacitance as high as 302.08 Fg−1 at 0.1 Ag−1 which is significantly higher than that of GO (121.39 Fg−1) and Mn-MoO4 (201.81 Fg−1) in aqueous electrolyte Na2SO4. It has been observed that the capacitance retention ratio mainly depends on the current density with a maximum retention of 93.8% at 0.7 Ag−1. The energy density of 41.9 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 208 W kg−1 which is higher compared to pure Mn-MoO4. This is attributed to the higher operating voltage of the composite electrode. The improved electrochemical performance may be due to the increase in the electrode conductivity in the presence of graphene network, the increased effective interfacial area between Mn-MoO4 and the electrolyte, as well as the contact area between Mn-MoO4 and graphene.
