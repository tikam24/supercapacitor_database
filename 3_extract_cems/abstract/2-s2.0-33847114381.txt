V2O5 was prepared by quenching method. The sample was characterized by FTIR and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The test results show that the sample is amorphous V2O5. The capacitive performance of V2O5 was measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge/discharge method. Electrochemical reaction mechanism was also discussed. Electrochemical results indicate that the kinds of the aqueous electrolyte, potential limit, scan rate, current density have influence on V2O5 capacitive performance. In the range of -0.2-0.8 V (vs SCE), at 250 mA · g-1 constant current density, amorphous V2O5 exhibits a specific capacitance value of 185.1 F · g-1 with excellent cyclability in 1 mol · L -1 NaNO3 electrolyte.
