The stress-free electrochemical-based sensor equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT) device for salivary creatinine determination was fabricated for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of advanced kidney disorders. Beneficial and real-time data readout for preventive diagnosis and clinical evaluation of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) at different stages and renal dysfunction can be acquired by noninvasive monitoring of the creatinine amounts in saliva. The direct determination and real-time response of salivary creatinine can be attained using the supercapacitor-based sensor of cuprous oxide nanoparticles entrapped by the synergistically cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) gel-Cu2+ and Nafion perfluorinated membrane fabricated on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Here, we demonstrated that the degree of renal illness could be evaluated using salivary creatinine detection via a catalytic mechanism as Cu2+ ions bound irreversibly with CâN functional groups of creatinine. Besides, the computer simulation was performed to study the interaction between 5 functional groups of creatinine toward acrylic gel-Cu2+ The linear increment between the obtained anodic currents and creatinine concentrations varying from 1 to 2000 μM was accomplished with a selectivity efficiency of 97.2%. Nyquist plots obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) validated that the increment of impedance changes strongly dependent on the amount of detected creatinine both in artificial and in human saliva. The porosity features were observed in this interconnected nanocomposite and correlated with Nafion doping. Successively, the friendly portable device was invented and integrated saliva sampling with miniaturized, low-cost IoT electronics of world-location mapping, representing the first remote medical sensor focusing on salivary creatinine sensing.
