The most reliant storage technologies are batteries and supercapacitors. While supercapacitors are more efficient in terms of faster energy delivery, sustainability, and high capacity retention. In supercapacitors, mostly utilized precursors are least abundant which are toxic and costly, as well as facing structural stability issues during the advanced charging-discharging cycles. So in the present work, we have studied the sustainability and capacity retention profile of shape-dependent carbonaceous materials in terms of cyclic stability. Here, we have prepared an environment-friendly, cost-effective carbon@FeOOH composite series by low-temperature hydrothermal method. The galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis shows a high power density of 5000 W kg−1 at a current density of 10 A g−1. The advanced capacity retention up to 92% is seen up to 15,000 cycles and 100% Coulombic efficiency till the last segment (30000th segment of charging-discharging) of galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) for optimized mesoporous carbon@FeOOH (MCF) sample. The symmetric solid-state device comprising MCF electrodes has been fabricated at the laboratory scale. It has been able to glow red LED for 18 min and a panel consisting of 16 LEDs for 5 min. A self-explanatory mechanism has also been proposed for a better understanding of readers.
