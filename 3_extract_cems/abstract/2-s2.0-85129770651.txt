Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) are a subgroup of fuel cells that use enzymes as catalysts. EBFCs that utilize physiological substrates such as glucose or lactate are of great interest as implantable or wearable power sources to activate medical devices. This contribution introduces the working principles of EBFCs and summarizes recent progress in EBFC-enabled biosensors, pulse generators, and therapy. Biosensors with self-powered characteristic enjoy high selectivity, leading to potential “instrument-free” or “expensive-instrument-free” measurement. Autonomous pulse generation is based on the hybrid of EBFC and supercapacitor, which is promising for the application in medical related electrostimulation. By providing the direct electrical stimulation, or controllably releasing drug, EBFCs can also be used for self-powered therapeutic system. The further combination of self-powered sensing and treating enables EBFC as a possible platform of diagnostics and therapeutics. Future efforts can be focused on resolving the limited power density and lifetime of EBFC.
