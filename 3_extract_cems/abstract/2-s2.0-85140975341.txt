A new synthetic strategy has been developed for the facile fabrication of a N-doped porous carbon (NC-800) material via a facile carbonization of functionalized poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The prepared NC-800 exhibits good specific capacitance of 205 F/g at 1 A/g and cycle stability (95.2% retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A/g). The adsorption capacity of NC-800 on methylene blue and methyl orange was 780 mg/g and 800 mg/g, respectively. The facile and economical method and good performance (supercapacitor and adsorption) suggest that the NC-800 is a promising material for energy storage and adsorption.
