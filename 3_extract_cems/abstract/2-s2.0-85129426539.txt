Supercapacitors (SCs) are ideal energy storage components because of their high-power density and long cycle life. Several properties of the electrode materials are required for high-performance SCs, including a large surface area, good conductivity, and a high level of stability. Herein, nickel/cobalt/copper sulfide hollow multi-shell structure (NCCS-HoMS) with dodecahedral shape is developed using a sequential templating approach (STA) with a metal-organic framework (MOF) as a template. The NCCS-HoMS, as superior electrode material in high-performance asymmetric SCs, exhibited good rate capability and cyclic stability (89.4% recovery after 5000 cycles) and an extremely high specific capacitance (2437.5 F/g). The synergistic effect of tri-metal structures provides better electrochemical performance than bimetallic or mono-metal oxides due to rich oxidation states and abundant active sites. The metal sulfide thin layers of the complex hollow structure with the high specific surface area increase the electroactive sites and mass transfer, supporting rapid reaction kinetics for solid samples. As a result, the NCCS-HoMS//AC asymmetric SC demonstrates a specific capacitance over 280 F/g at a current density of 1.0 A/g with an energy density above 87.5
