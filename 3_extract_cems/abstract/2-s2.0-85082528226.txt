Lignocellulosic biomass was converted into hierarchical porous carbon by using a physical activation technique under a carbon dioxide environment. Both direct and indirect CO2 activation routes were utilized to investigate the effect of processing parameters and the kinetics of the activation. The porosity, surface chemistry, and morphology of the activated carbons were characterized in addition to their proximate and ultimate analyses. This was followed by the preparation of the activated carbon electrodes and the fabrication and electrochemical testing of these electrodes within a symmetrical supercapacitor cell. The results showed a dominant microporous structure along with the limited content of larger pores for the activated carbons prepared via both direct and indirect activation. Along with the preserved natural pore structure of the biomass, an engineered pore structure was achieved which is highly beneficial for the supercapacitors with respect to the transport and storage of ions. The morphological analysis also revealed their tortuous porous structure. The maximum specific capacitances of 80.9 and 92.7 F/g at the current density of 100 mA/g were achieved after direct and indirect activation routes, respectively. The surface functional groups were also found to play a significant role in the resultant electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors.
