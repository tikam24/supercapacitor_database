Co3O4/graphene composites have drawn more and more attentions, which was due to their high specific capacitance and good stability. However, reduced graphene oxide was commonly used for Co3O4/graphene composites, which was due to the groups on graphene sheets and its good dispersibility. The defects of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) limited the electrochemical properties of the composite. Moreover, heat treating of hydroxide/graphene oxide was commonly involved for synthesis of Co3O4/graphene composite. In this paper, low-defect density graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) were prepared by mechanical exfoliation, and a stable suspension of GNP and Co ions was obtained. The Co3O4/GNP composites were obtained by one-step method without further heat treatment. The thickness of the GNP sheets synthesized via mechanical exfoliation was about five layers and the layer spacing was 3.6 Å. The ID/IG ratio from the Raman spectrum was only 0.07, indicating that the GNP has lower defects density than that of RGO. Co3O4/GNP composites were prepared by one-step method using H2O2 as oxidant. The average particle size of square Co3O4 nanoparticles was about 12 nm. Electrochemical studies show that the specific capacitance of Co3O4/GNP composites reached 542 F•g-1 when weight ratio of Co3O4 and GNP was 8:1, and the internal resistance was only 1.57 Ω. The internal resistance of the composite increased with the amount of GNP. When weight ratio of Co3O4 and GNP was 3:1, the internal resistance was only 0.89 Ω. This work realized one-step synthesis of Co3O4/graphene composites. The graphene synthesized via mechanical exfoliation has a low defect density, and the one-step method ensures uniformly distribution of Co3O4 nanoparticles on GNP surface. The specific capacitance of composites reached 542 F•g-1.
