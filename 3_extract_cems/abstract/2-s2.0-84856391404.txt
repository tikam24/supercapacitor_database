We report on the pseudo-capacitance induced by a nitrogen substituted in the carbon network composite prepared by a simple carbonisation (750°C) of formaldehyde and melamine in the presence of carbon nanotubes. Nitrogen content in the composites varied from 7.4 to 21.7 wt.%. Such materials have a higher density than activated carbons, hence, they can supply better volumetric capacity. N-rich composites show an excellent charge propagation at current loads from 500 mA g-1 to 50 A g-1 because of multiwalled nanotubes which play a conducting as well as a supporting role. The electrochemical performance of various composites was investigated in two- and three-electrode cells using acidic (1 mol L-1 H2SO 4), alkaline (6 mol L-1KOH), neutral (1 mol L-1 Na2SO4) and organic electrolytes (1 mol L-1 TEABF4 in acetonitrile). Organic and neutral medium is not adapted for N-rich carbon electrodes of supercapacitor. The detailed electrochemical characterisation pointed out the differences of charge propagation of electrodes with the different polarity. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
