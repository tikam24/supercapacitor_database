In order to improve the fuel economy of fuel cell hybrid power systems for urban rail traffic and effectively to keep the state of charge (SOC) of energy storage units, this paper proposed a kind of suitable methods for fuel cell/ultracapacitor hybrid systems based on instantaneous equivalent minimum hydrogen consumption. The method uses the ultracapacitor RC equivalent circuit to establish an equivalent hydrogen consumption model of the ultracapacitor system. By deriving the analytical solution of the optimal output of the ultracapacitor, the output of the fuel cell system was controlled according to the optimal output power of the ultracapacitor under the current SOC and the demand power. Through the construction of the RT - LAB semi-physical hardware platform, this method and the power following method were compared and analyzed. Results show that the presented method can effectively reduce the hydrogen consumption and maintain SOC of ultracapacitors, and it will have a good application prospect in rail transportation of hybrid vehicles in high power applications.
