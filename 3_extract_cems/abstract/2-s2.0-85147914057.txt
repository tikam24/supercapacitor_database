Bismuth, a brittle, silvery-white, less toxic metal placed after the transition elements in the periodic table. It has a low melting point and thermal conductivity. It gets easily oxidized in air. It is naturally available in the form of bismuth oxides and bismuth sulfides with outstanding electronic and optical properties. Owing to its excellent redox reactions, various bismuth compounds such as bismuth oxides, sulfides, selenides, and oxyhalides were investigated recently in the supercapacitor technologies. In recent days, various efforts have been taken by various researcher groups to develop bismuth-based composites with high SCP, excellent cyclic stability respectively. Very few researches constructed the supercapacitor devices in terms of household appliances. In this present chapter, we have discussed the various synthesis methodologies of the notable bismuth enriched compounds and their electrochemical properties with respect to their morphological size and the specific surface area toward the electrochemical properties for supercapacitor device fabrication.
