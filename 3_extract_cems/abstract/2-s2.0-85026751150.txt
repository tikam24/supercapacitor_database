The urgent demand for clean energies and rapid development of modern electronic technologies have led to enthusiastic research on novel energy storage technologies, especially for supercapacitors. The most important part is designing electrode materials with excellent capacitive performance. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have sparked intense interest among researchers in the past decade due to the facile tunability of their composition, structure and morphology. Various and fruitful accomplishments have been achieved toward developing LDH-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes. This review outlines the recent advances in the designing of LDH-based electrode materials for supercapacitors. Feasible and practical strategies for improving the capacitive performance of LDH-based materials have been discussed and highlighted in terms of tuning the composition of LDHs, designing the electrode structure and assembling applicable supercapacitor devices. Through the ceaseless efforts of scientists, the capacitive performance and practicability of LDH-based materials have been greatly ameliorated, making them more competitive for modern energy storage applications.
