Different types of commercially available electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) were analysed in accelerated ageing tests by impedance spectroscopy. From these measurements the parameters of an impedance model were determined. The characteristic change of the impedance parameters is discussed and an ageing model for EDLCs is developed.
