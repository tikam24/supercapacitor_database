Supercapacitor is a novel energy storage component which developed in recent years. The electrode material affects the specific capacitance and the cycling stability of the supercapacitor. The emphasis of research is to improve the specific capacity of electrode materials. In this paper, iron-based compounds was successfully prepared respectively by adding sulfosalicylic acid, ammonium fluoride or the mixture of ammonium fluoride and tetrabutyl titanate in the process of synthesis. The iron-based compounds, which was synthesized by ammonium fluoride adding tetrabutyl titanate, had largest capacity 830 F g-1 at 1A g-1. Simultaneously, the cycling stability with an efficiency of almost 100% after cycling 5000 times at a current density of 10 A g-1 is achieved.
