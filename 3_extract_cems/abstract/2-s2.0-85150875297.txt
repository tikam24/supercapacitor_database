The rapid diminution of fossil fuel stocks and ever-growing energy demand promotes the researchers for the development of new functional materials to solve future energy demand. Thus, it remains a challenge to functionalize a material for achieving improved energy storage activity. In this review article, we demonstrate various synthesis methods including hydrothermal and/or solvothermal, sol-gel, spray, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and self-assembly, etc. to functionalize the surface chemistry of graphene assisted vanadium based nanocomposites and their enhanced supercapacitor applications. Further, we briefly discussed the use of graphene-assisted vanadium-based nanocomposite electrodes in symmetric, asymmetric, and all solid-state supercapacitor devices. In addition, we summarized the recent trends, and future aspects of graphene-assisted vanadium-based nanocomposite electrodes for energy storage applications. This review article would support researchers in a wide range of disciplines to procure concise and systematic information for the synthesis methods, and supercapacitor applications of graphene-assisted vanadium-based nanocomposites.
