In this research, two new nanocomposites of MoS2/MnO2 and Poly Ortho Amino Phenol (POAP)/MoS2/MnO2 are used for application in supercapacitor electrodes. The MoS2/MnO2 composites were synthesized without any impurity through by hydrothermal method and then ternary POAP/MoS2/MnO2 composite was synthesized by the electrochemical method on the Glassy Carbon Electrode. The structure, morphology and surface area of prepared samples are characterized by XRD, XPS, FTIR, EDX, FESEM, TEM, and BET. Electrochemical measurement of electrodes was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The supercapacitor performance of the POAP/MoS2/MnO2 composite shows a high specific capacitance of 529 Fg−1 (1 Ag−1). When assembled into symmetric supercapacitor devices, the specific capacitance is calculated as 271 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1, where the specific energy is achieved as high as 37.64 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 500 W kg−1. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibited excellent cycling performance (∼94% ) after 4000 cycles. The incorporation of MoS2/MnO2 nanocomposite and conductive polymer within POAP/MoS2/MnO2 by simple synthesis route along with unique structure, which provides a new idea for the design of active components proportion. Therefore, the novel nanocomposite with excellent electrochemical performance has a great potential for higher energy storage devices.
