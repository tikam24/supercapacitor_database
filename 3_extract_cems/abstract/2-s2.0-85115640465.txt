With the advantages of both lithium ion battery and supercapacitor, lithium ion capacitor battery has become a promising new energy storage system with its advantages of high energy density, high power density, long cycle life and fast charging and discharging. However, some key problems still exist, such as dynamic imbalance, less ideal energy density and poor cycling stability between battery electrode and capacitor electrode. The electrode material is an important part of the battery and seriously affects the overall electrochemical performance. To solve this problem effectively, a variety of new type of anode and cathode electrode materials should be developed in this field. Therefore, this paper introduces in detail the research progress and technical route of cathode(layered metal oxides, graphene composite anode and other novel cathode materials) and anode (transition metal oxides, carbon materials, lithium compounds and sulfides) materials for lithium ion capacitor batteries, and analyzes the existing problems. It is found that the properties of electrode materials can be improved by nano treatment, material coating and heteroatomic doping. At the same time, the future research direction of electrode materials is prospected, and new ideas and means are provided for the research of other chemical power sources.
