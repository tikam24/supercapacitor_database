Since its discovery in 1839, research on the synthesis and application of perovskite materials has multiplied largely due to their suitability to be used in the fields of nanotechnology, chemistry and material science. Appropriate changes in composition or addition of other elements or blending with polymers may result in new hybrid and/or composite perovskite materials that will be applied in advanced fields. In this review, we have recapitulated the recent progress on perovskite nanomaterial in solar cell, battery, fuel cell and supercapacitor applications, and the prominence properties of perovskite materials, such as excellent electronic, physical, chemical and optical properties. We discussed in detail the synthesis and results of various perovskite hybrid nanomaterials published elsewhere. We have also discussed the results of various studies on these low dimensional composite nanomaterials in broad sectors such as electronics/optoelectronics, batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells and electrochemical sensors.
