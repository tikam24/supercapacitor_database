In this work a composite monolith was prepared from widely available and cost effective raw materials, textile-grade polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers and phenolic resin. Two activation procedures (physical and chemical) were used to increase the surface area of the produced carbon electrode. Characterization of the thermally stabilized fibers produced was made using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Carbon-Hydrogen-Nitrogen(CHN) elemental analysis, in order to choose the optimum conditions of producing the stabilized fibers. Characterization of the produced composite monolith electrode was performed using physical adsorption of nitrogen at 77 °K, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrical resistivity in order to evaluate its performance. All the electrodes prepared had a mixture of micropores and mesopores. Pressing the green monolith during the curing process was found to reduce largely the specific surface area and to some degree the electrical resistivity of the chemically activated composite electrode. Physical activation was more suitable than chemical activation, where it resulted in an electrode with specific capacity 29 F/g, good capacitive behavior and the stability of the electrical resistivity over the temperature range-130 to 80 °C. Chemical activation resulted in a very poor electrode with resistive rather than capacitive properties.
