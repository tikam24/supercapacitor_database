In our work, we have developed a low-temperature and pressure-promoted solid-phase method for synthesizing electrode materials, which can realize surface functionalization and the adjustment of pore structure. In the closed autoclave at 200 °C, and oxygen-modified carbon materials can be finally obtained by simply mixing oxalic acid with activated carbon materials. The specific surface area of the prepared electrode material is increased from the initial 1604 to 1814 m2 g−1; the specific capacitance is increased from the initial 100 to 187 F g−1. The cycle stability test is carried out at a current density of 4 A g−1, which still has an initial capacitance of 73% after 5000 cycles. In the EMIMBF4/AN electrolyte, the energy density is as high as 36.0 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500.0 W kg−1.
