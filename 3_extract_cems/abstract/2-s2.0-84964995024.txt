Progression in renewable energy and hybrid electric vehicles in recent years has accelerated the growth of storage in these sectors. The new concept of hybridized battery supercapacitor storage has been subject to this growth but its practicality is still in question. The hybrid battery supercapacitor storage system is critically reviewed and compared with the well-established battery storage system. The devices were compared in terms of costs incurred, power quality, configuration complexity, component accessibility, lifespan extension, sizing protocol and technological benefits. The review shows that hybrid storage does provide significant and energy management enhancements, battery lifespan extension and high power discharge but is only feasible for applications where these improvements are essential and the necessary startup capital is available. The results found highlight the importance of balancing technological needs with economic feasibility when deciding on a storage device.
