Biowaste derived carbon materials are recently gaining attention owing to their high specific surface area (SSA) and decent electrical conductivity. Herein, pineapple peel derived porous carbon nanosheets have been synthesized at different activation temperatures (PP-600, PP-700 and PP-800). This shows that its high SSA along with hierarchal pore size distribution makes it a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors. Further, the electrochemical performance of the as prepared electrode material was carried out in three different electrolytes viz. acidic (1 M H2SO4), basic (6 M KOH) and neutral (1 M Na2SO4) and among them 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte shows superior electrochemical performance. Furthermore, PP-800 electrode material displayed highest specific capacitance of 368.8 F/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is much higher when tested and compared in 6 M KOH (34 F/g) and 1 M Na2SO4 (102.7 F/g) electrolytes at a constant current density of 1 A/g. Additionally, symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor was fabricated by utilizing PP-800 electrodes and PVA gel electrolyte, that rendered remarkable energy density of ∼43 Wh/kg at a high-power density of ∼1 kW/kg. The as fabricated PP-800//PP-800 device displayed an extraordinary cycle life exhibiting capacitance retention of 83 % after 10000 ultra-long charge-discharge cycles.
