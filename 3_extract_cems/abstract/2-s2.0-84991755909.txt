Activated carbon prepared from waste palm kernel shells using physical activation at a combustion temperature respectively of 300 and 400°C has been developed as a new supercapacitor electrode material. Activated carbon was characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX and FTIR methods and the electrical properties of supercapacitor have been measured by LCR meter. It was found that the activated carbon which was prepared by the carbonization process at a temperature of 300°C, the particle size of 90 μm, 0.3 NH3PO4 as the electrolyte and the surface area of the carbon paper of 3 x 11 cm2 with a roll method provides the highest capacitance of 41.21 μF and conductivity of 0.143 x 10-6 S / cm with a charging time of 60 minutes.
