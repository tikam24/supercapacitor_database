This chapter reviews the development of fiber-shaped micro-supercapacitors (FMSCs), a promising candidate for powering wearable electronics. First, a brief history of fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSCs) is introduced. As an essential branch of FSCs, the unique characteristics of FMSCs are described. Next, specific design considerations of FMSCs are summarized, including electrode materials and their microstructures, electrical conductivity, fiber electrode macrostructures, electrolytes, and their mechanical characteristics. After that, several representative FMSCs are introduced based on their fiber electrode scaffolds, including metal wires and various carbon-based fibers. Last, we offer our perspectives on the challenges and potential future research directions of FMSCs. We hope this chapter can stimulate more research to realize the practical applications of FMSCs.
