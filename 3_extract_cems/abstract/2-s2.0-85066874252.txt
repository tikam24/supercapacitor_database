Hybrid Electric Vehicle (EVs) adopting batteries, ultra-capacitor, and PV cells using a maximum power point track (MPPT) solar system is a unique power-sharing strategy technique which provides a promising solution, reduces power loss, and increases efficiency for upcoming automotive industry using hybrid electric vehicle. Batteries and solar photovoltaic’s cells are integrated with DC–DC boost converter and ultra-capacitors with DC–DC bidirectional converter to stabilize the voltage. This paper deals with the modeling of an efficient DC–DC converter which can be used in applications involving high values of power while simultaneously reducing the size of the batteries used. Several DC–DC converters are described and compared with the proposed converter to verify its efficiency, reliability, and stiffness. In order to deal with fast load dynamics in vehicles, an online energy management scheme is proposed which aims at optimizing the circuit’s internal flow of power and satisfies the power demand of the driver. Also, physical explanation about when to produce, consume, and store electric power during regenerative braking is also implemented and simulated in this paper using MATLAB/Simulink. Further, a DC motor is considered as a load to demonstrate the performance of this strategy.
