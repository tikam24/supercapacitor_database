The article explores a system for ultracapacitor charging from a source with varying and limited power (in this case photovoltaic module). The system is based on the Single Ended Primary Inductance Converter (SEPIC) and constant-power and voltage-limiting regulator. A scheme for computer simulation with PSIM program is presented, as well as the simulation results under different conditions.
