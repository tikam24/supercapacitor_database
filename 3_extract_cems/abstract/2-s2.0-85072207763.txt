The growing surge in demand for sustainable energy and wide reaching of dumping culture has collectively promoted researchers to develop waste-to-wealth concepts for eco-benign energy storage devices. By taking inspiration from agriculture cultivating strategy, the discarded cardboards (CBs) are favorably transferred into highly flexible, economically viable and prolific energy storage electrodes for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). Specifically, bilayered flower-like Cu1-xNix-O/Ni–P nanoarchitectures are rationally designed on CB paper by facile electroless plating and electrochemical conversion methods, respectively. With the virtue of high conductivity and synergistic effects of hierarchical architectures, the flower-like Cu1-xNix-O/Ni–P/CB paper exhibited superior redox chemistry along with high areal capacity of 331.1 μAh/cm2 and good cycling stability of 91.4% in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the CB-based HSC is fabricated using flower-like Cu1-xNix-O/Ni–P/CB paper as a positive electrode and porous carbon as a negative electrode, which shows excellent energy density of 0.28 mWh/cm2 (43.37 Wh/kg) and power density of 2.61 W/cm2 (2827.88 W/kg), respectively. Following, a self-charging renewable energy conversion/storage station is designed with flexible solar cell and CB-based HSCs to demonstrate its suitability for switching and proximity applications. It is believed that this work can open up a new avenue for the dynamic transformation of ubiquitous substrates into economically viable and effective electrodes for high-performance energy storage systems.
