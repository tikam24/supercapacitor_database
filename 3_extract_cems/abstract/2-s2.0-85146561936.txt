TiO2 is one of the most investigated materials due to its abundance, lack of toxicity, high faradaic capacitance, and high chemical and physical stability; however, its potential use in energy storage devices is constrained by its high internal resistance and weak van der Waals interaction between the particles. Carbon nanotubes are especially well suited for solving these issues due to their strong mechanical strength, superior electrical conductivity, high electron mobilities, excellent chemical and thermal stability, and enormous specific nanoporous surface. The hydrothermal approach was followed by chemical vapor deposition to produce a network composite of titanium dioxide nanoribbons (TNRs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The nanocomposite was characterized using a variety of methods. One phase of TiO2-B nanoribbons has porous pits on its surface, and MWCNTs are grown in these pits to produce a network-like structure in the nanocomposite. With a two-electrode supercapacitor configuration, the TNR/CNT gave a gravimetric capacitance of 33.33 F g−1, which was enhanced to 68.18 F g−1 in a redox-active electrolyte containing hydroquinone (HQ). Additionally, the areal capacitance per footprint was increased from 80 mF cm−2 in H2SO4 to 163.63 mF cm−2 in H2SO4/HQ. The TNR/CNT supercapacitor has superior cyclic stability than the previously reported TiO2-based electrodes, with 97.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. Based on these results, it looks like the TNR/CNT supercapacitor could provide portable electronic power supplies with new ways to work in the future.
