The high load power variation due to the frequent change of working conditions will cause the DC bus voltage fluctuation of ship DC microgrid, decrease the stability of power supply system. This paper uses hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of the supercapacitor and battery pack compensates or absorbs the power difference between generator and load, proposes a variable droop control strategy by taking consider the state of charge (SOC) of each battery, to suppress the fluctuation of power, and establishes Simulink simulation model for verification. Simulation results illustrate that: the proposed method can prevent voltage fluctuations from exceeding the limit, make super capacitor response high frequency power, battery pack response low frequency power; adjust the SOC of each battery pack unit, extend its operating life. The research results provide reference for the optimal operation control of ship DC microgrid.
