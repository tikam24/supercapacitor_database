Graphene-based planar micro-supercapacitors are layer-by-layer printed on flexible substrates using micro-extrusion technique. The laminated graphene films and polyvinyl alcohol-H2SO4 gel serve as the interdigitated micro-electrodes and electrolyte, respectively. The resultant solid-state micro-supercapacitors exhibit high capacitive performance, excellent flexibility and cycling stability. Such device promises potential applications in flexible electronics and lab-on-a-chip systems.
