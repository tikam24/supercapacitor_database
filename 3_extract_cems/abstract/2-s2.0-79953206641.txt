Polyaniline (PANI) naonfiber films with three-dimensional network structure were successfully prepared on platinum substrates using unipolar pulse electrochemical polymerization. The composition and morphology of PANI films prepared by pulse and CV polymerization were characterized by Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The supercapacitive performances of the PANI films were also investigated in 0.5 mol · L-1 H2SO4 solution with cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling in the range -0.2 V to 0.55 V (vs SCE), charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results show that three-dimensional porous network PANI films with uniform distribution on Pt are formed by this new method. The PANI films of pulse electrochemical polymerization display much higher ion exchange capacity, better stability and more excellent supercapacitive performances than the PANI films produced by the more common CV method. The highest specific capacitance value of 699 F · g-1 is obtained for PANI film when the pulse potential, aniline concentration, pulse frequency and duty cycle are 1.0 V, 0.2 mol · L-1, 1.25 s-1 and 50%, respectively. © All Rights Reserved.
