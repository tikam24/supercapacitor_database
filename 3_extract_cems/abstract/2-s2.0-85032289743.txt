KMnO4 was reacted with MnCl2 in reaction kettle at different temperature and doped with activated carbon. Then composite electrode materials for supercapacitor were prepared by combining ball mill process. XRD revealed that MnO2/activated carbon composite was hydrated amorphous while sintered at low 140 ℃ for 5 h. Meanwhile, the composite showed diffraction peaks at sintering temperature of 165 ℃. SEM analysis illustrated that the morphology of the electroactive composite was tiny and surrounded micro-nanometer whisker globe. Electrochemical performances of composite electrode were tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and impedance spectrum. When scan rate was 10 mV/s, specific capacitance of the electrode reached 365 F/g and equivalent series resistance value was of 1.32 Ω. After 3 000 cycles, capacitance value of composite electrode decayed by approximately 6%.
