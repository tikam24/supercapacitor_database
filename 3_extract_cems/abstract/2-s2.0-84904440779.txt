We have developed a facile and straightforward approach for the continuous fabrication of graphene/polypyrrole (G/PPy) composite fibers via a wet-spinning strategy. The diameter of G/PPy fibers can be well-controlled in the range of about 15-80 μm. Furthermore, the fiber possesses high conductivity and mechanical flexibility, thus offering significant advantages as flexible, lightweight electrodes for an efficient fiber-based electrochemical supercapacitor. The all-solid-state fiber supercapacitor with H 2SO4-polyvinyl alcohol (H2SO4-PVA) gel electrolyte has been demonstrated, which could be woven into a textile for wearable electronics.
