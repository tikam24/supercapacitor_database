The ruthenium oxide/activated carbon composite (RCC) were synthesized using an innovative plasma-in-liquid process, which is known as liquid phase plasma (LPP) process. This technique uses a single-step process for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles on supporting materials. LPP process led to simultaneous precipitation of ruthenium and ruthenium oxide nanoparticles on the surface of activated carbon, which is then oxidized to ruthenium oxide during the thermal oxidation process. The specific capacitances of RCC electrodes prepared through the LPP and oxidation process were higher than that of bare AC. The specific capacitance increased with increasing LPP process duration and oxidation treatment. The specific capacitance of ruthenium oxide/carbon composite increased with increasing LPP process duration. The ruthenium oxide/carbon composite prepared through the LPP process and thermal oxidation showed smaller resistances and larger initial resistance slopes than bare activated carbon powder and this effect was intensified by increasing the LPP process duration. The RCC electrodes showed smaller resistances and larger initial resistance slopes than bare AC and this effect was intensified by increasing the LPP process duration and oxidation treatment.
