In the manuscript, one highly controllable method for synthesis of porous carbon foam (PCF) through a hard-temple polymer coating approach is displayed, and the final product is directly used as the electrode material of micro-supercapacitor and secondary zinc battery. The PCF exhibits plentiful pore structure, easier ion-diffusion reactions, and richer electrochemical active sites. Due to the unique adjustable pore structure, the as-prepared PCF exhibits better cycle performance and higher specific capacity, which is concluded from serial electrochemical tests of as-assembled micro-supercapacitor and zinc-ion battery. When used as the electrode material of flexible quasi-solid-state symmetric micro-supercapacitor, the PCF exhibits a high capacity and could maintain the initial capacity after relatively long cycles. When working as the cathode of zinc-ion battery, the PCF displays an enhanced cycle stability compared to commercial active carbon.
