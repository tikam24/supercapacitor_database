Abstract: In this paper, we carry out and describe a large-scale experiment on the emergency (autonomous) operation of electric rolling stock (ERS) driven by the energy stored in an onboard storage device based on supercapacitors. Problems, the negative effect of which can be minimized by using energy storage systems in the power-supply systems of subways and all railways in general, are identified. The necessary energy required for the emergency (autonomous) operation of the newest ERS of the subway, the eight-car train 81-775/776/777 Moscow-2020, was estimated by using a full-scale experiment under real operating conditions of the subway.
