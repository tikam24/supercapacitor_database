Rod-shape porous carbon was prepared from aniline modified lignin via KOH activation and used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The specific surface area, pore size and shape could be modulated by the carbonization temperature, which significantly affected the electrochemical performance. Unique rod-shape carbon with massive pores and a high BET surface area of 2265 m2 g-1 were obtained at 700°C in contrast to irregular morphology created at other carbonization temperatures. In 6 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte, a specific capacitance of 336 F g-1, small resistance of 0.9 Ω and stable charge/discharge at current density of 1 A g-1 after 1, 000 cycles were achieved using rod-shape porous carbon as electrodes in an electrical double layer capacitor.
