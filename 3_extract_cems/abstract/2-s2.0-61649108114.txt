Mesoporous carbon nanofibers have been prepared by a confined self-assembly of triblock copolymers with soluble low molecular weight phenolic resol within the channels of anodic alumina membranes, SEM and TEM observations showed that hexagonally arranged mesoporous channels were coiled concentrically around the longitudinal axis of the carbon nanofibers. These carbon nanofibers with BET surface area over 1424 m2 g-1 have been used as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors tested in KOH and EC/DEC electrolyte solutions. Compared to mesoporous carbon prepared from the same precursor sol, these one-dimensional nanofibers could provide a shortened diffusion distance for electrolyte ions. The better performance of these mesoporous nanofibers greatly benefited from their high specific surface area, shortened diffusion distance, mesoporous openings on the outer surface, and well-controlled pore size. These mesoporous carbon nanofibers have been proved to be promising electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors in high-rate charge/ discharge operations.
