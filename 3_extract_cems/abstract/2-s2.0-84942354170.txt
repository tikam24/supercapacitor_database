With the advancement of miniaturized portable and wearable electronic devices, fiber-shaped energy-storage systems have attracted intensive attention due to their merits of flexibility, integratability and weavability. However, the inferior energy storage performance and relatively low stability derived from the curved fiber interface under severe deformations have largely limited their development. Here, we report a one-dimensional supercapacitor in a strip shape by mimicking bamboo strips of Chinese bed-mats. The strip-shaped supercapacitor is flexible with decent electrochemical performances. It delivers both a high energy density of 9.56 mW h cm-3 and a high power density of 2.91 W cm-3 that are sustainable to various deformations and outperforms other fiber-shaped counterparts. Such strip-shaped supercapacitors are further woven into a fabric that demonstrates both high structural and electrochemical stability under various deformations such as bending and twisting. The capability for high energy storage and feasibility for large-scale production provide an efficient platform in powering micro-electronic devices.
