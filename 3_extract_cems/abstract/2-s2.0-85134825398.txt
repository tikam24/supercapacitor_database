Due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources, we need sophisticated storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries. For fabricating the devices, many materials with vivid nanostructures have been explored by researchers. The transition metal oxides have acclaimed their advantageous position in energy storage. MnCo2O4 is one of the superior transition metal oxides discussed in this review. The central intention of this review article is to discover and summarize all possible ways of constructing the nanoarchitecture of MnCo2O4 and its composites for supercapacitors. The impacts of different thin-film and powder synthesis methods on electrochemical performance have been discussed. Also, the electrochemical performance of MnCo2O4 and its composite based on specific capacitance, energy and power densities, rate capability, and cycling stability is elucidated. In the future, MnCo2O4 can make its own important place in the field of electrochemical devices
