In this work, we reported a facile one-pot hydrothermal method to synthesize MnPO4·H2O nanowire/graphene oxide composite material with coated graphene oxide. Transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscope were employed to study its morphology information, and X-ray diffraction was used to study the phase and structure of the material. Additionally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study the elements information. To measure electrochemical performances of electrode materials and the symmetry cell, cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry were conducted on electrochemical workstation using 3 M KOH electrolytes. Importantly, electrochemical results showed that the as-prepared MnPO4·H2O nanowire/graphene oxide composite material exhibited high specific capacitance (287.9 F·g−1 at 0.625 A·g−1) and specific power (1.5 × 105 W·kg−1 at 2.271 Wh·kg−1), which is expected to have promising applications as supercapacitor electrode material.
