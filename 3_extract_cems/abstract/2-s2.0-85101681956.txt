PV standalone systems are challenged by the PV intermittent nature, hence integrating energy storage systems (ESS) is mandatory. In this paper a hybrid battery/supercapacitor ESS is employed, in a standalone PV system, to maintain continuity in power supply. Supercapacitors (SC), featuring fast charge/discharge rates, will store the transient energy peaks reducing battery required capacity, increasing its life span, and minimizing its replacement costs. Moreover, a control scheme is presented to manage the power flow between generation and load sides, thus fulfilling load demands and maintaining DC-bus voltage stability. In this strategy, a protection modification is proposed to prevent battery overcharge, thus limiting its degradation and improving system reliability. All the latter results in a robust PV system with a longer-life battery and capable of preserving energy balance at the DC-bus even at sudden changes. The proposed system effectiveness is verified using MATLAB/Simulink under different scenarios of load and irradiance variations.
