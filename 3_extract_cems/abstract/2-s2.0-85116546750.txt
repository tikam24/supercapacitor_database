Multivalent metal-ion hybrid capacitors (MMHCs) have drawn much attention in recent years because of their advantages of high energy density (similar to metal-ion batteries) as well as high power density, high rate capability, and ultra-long cycle life. However, there are still challenges in developing high-performance MMHCs, e. g., high-capacity capacitive materials are particularly needed to be developed to match high-energy battery-type electrodes. Therefore, designing novel electrode materials and exploring suitable electrolytes are of particular importance. Herein, we focus on the recent progress of MMHCs in relation to their cathode/anode materials, electrolytes, electrochemical properties, and energy storage mechanisms. Additionally, the current challenges or bottlenecks and future research trends regarding MMHCs are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the research framework of MMHCs and will be beneficial in the development of high-performance MMHC devices.
