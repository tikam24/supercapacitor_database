The structural and optical studies of cupric oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were carried out which were synthesized through electrochemical discharge process. The experiments were carried out with the variation of electrolyte temperature and under the influence of two different conditions such as magnetic stirring and ultrasonic vibration of the electrolyte. It was found that with ultrasonic vibration and reduced electrolyte temperature, wider peaks (XRD result) were observed than that of the other conditions. The average crystal size of CuO particles could be attained in the range of 17–23 nm under magnetic stirrer condition and 11–18 nm under ultrasonic condition. The crystal size was increased with an increase of electrolyte temperature under both the conditions. Electrochemical performance of CuO-based electrode was analysed to explore its application for super capacitors, which had a specific capacitance of 571.25 F/g at a current density of 1A/g.
