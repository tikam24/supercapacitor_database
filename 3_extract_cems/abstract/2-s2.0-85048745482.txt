Here, we report a facile, cost effective, and potentially scalable electrospinning technique to synthesize TiO 2 nanofibers and Ta-doped TiO 2 nanofibers. The nanofibers were characterized through various characterization techniques such as FESEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area analysis and XPS. The specific capacitance values for TiO 2 nanofibers, 2% Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers and 5% Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers at scan rate of 5 mV s −1 were found to be 111 F g −1 , 199 F g −1 and 146 F g −1 , respectively in 1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. TiO 2 nanofibers and Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers exhibit excellent cycling stability (100% retention in specific capacitance up to 3000 cycles). The superior charge storage performance of 2% Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers was found due to enhanced electrical conductivity of material, and facile charge transport. The 2% Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers based symmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated and showed specific capacitance of 81 F g −1 at current density of 0.1 A g −1 which remained 46 F g −1 when current density increased to 5 A g −1 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. The energy density of symmetric supercapacitor was found to be 11.25 W h kg −1 at power density of 100.49 W kg −1 , which remained as 6.32 W h kg −1 at higher power density of 6504.3 W kg −1 . Further, 2% Ta doped TiO 2 nanofibers based symmetric supercapacitor also showed an excellent cycling stability up to 5000 charge-discharge cycles. This study indicates the potential of Ta doping in achieving high energy density symmetric supercapacitor device.
