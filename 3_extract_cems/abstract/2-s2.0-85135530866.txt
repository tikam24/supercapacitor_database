In this work, we have successfully synthesized NiAl LDH@Mn3O4@Co-MOF ternary composites with good properties. Co-MOF sheets are first grown on NF (nickel foam) by the aqueous solvent method. Then Mn3O4 particles are grown on Co-MOF sheets by electrodeposition. Finally, ultrathin NiAl LDH nanosheet clusters were grown on Co-MOF sheets by hydrothermal method. The three-dimensional Co-MOF can offer a larger specific surface area and more active sites, and the combination of the three substances generates a synergistic effect, resulting in a ternary composite with superior performance, which has superior specific capacity characteristics of 1311 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and can retain 74.6% of the original capacity after 5000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with active carbon has a high energy density of 60.91 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 849.91 W kg−1 and retains 82.9% of the original performance after 5000 cycles. Therefore, the NiAl LDH@Mn3O4@Co-MOF can be applied as the positive material for supercapacitor, which has good research and application value.
