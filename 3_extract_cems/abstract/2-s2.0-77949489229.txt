Highly ordered MnO2 nanotube and nanowire arrays are successfully synthesized via a electrochemical deposition technique using porous alumina templates. The morphologies and microstructures of the MnO2 nanotube and nanowire arrays are investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates that the MnO2 nanotube array electrode has superior capacitive behaviour to that of the MnO2 nanowire array electrode. In addition to high specific capacitance, the MnO2 nanotube array electrode also exhibits good rate capability and good cycling stability, which makes it promising candidate for supercapacitors.
