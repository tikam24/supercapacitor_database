Super-capacitor is an emerging energy storage device and it has high potential to meet energy storage requirements for many applications in combination with batteries. Super-capacitors can be charged at faster rate than batteries and its output current delivering capacity is much greater than other energy storage devices. The storage in super-capacitor is much higher in terms of capacitance in comparison to traditional capacitor. But, the efficiency of current super-capacitor is less so there has to be high level of research in this field. In presented paper, electrode materials like Norit, Vulcan, PICA and YP50F and electrolyte materials like Potassium Sulphate, sodium sulphate, hydrochloric acid and lithium sulphate has been tested. The combinations of the above super-capacitors have been taken to make super-capacitor and then the supercapacitor giving the optimum result has been tested.
