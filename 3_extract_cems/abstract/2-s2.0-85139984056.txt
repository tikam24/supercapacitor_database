The prolonged reactions for phase and morphology stabilization remain an issue in layered double hydroxides (LDHs), for example, NiMn LDH. The present work proposes a rational strategy for tuning the interfacial surface chemistry in the NiMn LDH phase to obtain grassy-mat-like porous nanoarchitectures. The approach gifts a morphology possessing a high specific surface area available for the ions' adsorption and desorption, thereby enhancing the extent of reversible reactions. The porous nanoarchitecture displays excellent catalytic activity by reducing p-nitrophenol in just ∼300 s with a rate constant of 0.231 min-1at a 2 mg mL-1concentration. Alongside, as a freestanding binder-free supercapacitor electrode, the material delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼568 F g-1at 1 mA cm-2, which is highest among all NiMn LDH variants prepared at different reaction times. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an excellent energy and a power density of ∼22 W h kg-1at 1 mA cm-2and ∼6429 W kg-1at 10 mA cm-2, respectively. The device retains ∼83% capacitance, at 10 mA cm-2, after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report where NiMn LDH is optimized in a shorter duration and proposed as a competitive bifunctional material for heterogeneous catalysis and supercapacitors.
