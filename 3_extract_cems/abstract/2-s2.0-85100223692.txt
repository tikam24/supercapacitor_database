Aiming at the problem of wind power generation caused by wind power fluctuation and curtailment, the wind-hydrogen coupling system with the energy management system consisting of wind driven generator, electrolytic cells, fuel cells and supercapacitor is adopted to improve the quality of wind power. Based on the 12 operation modes of the wind-hydrogen coupling system, a kind of energy management is proposed to coordinate the flow of energy between the sub-units of hybrid system under control units. Not only does the management make controllable power out of wind-hydrogen coupling system, but also stabilize the DC bus voltage fluctuation and smooth the integration of wind power. The results of Matlab/Simulink verify the effectiveness of the cooperative control strategy of wind-hydrogen coupling system, and improve the capacity of wind power utilization.
