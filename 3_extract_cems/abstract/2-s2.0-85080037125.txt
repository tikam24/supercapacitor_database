The difficulty of enlarging the voltage window for aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors seriously impedes the enhancement in energy density, thus affecting their practical applications. Herein, lithium-rich Li4Mn5O12 nanoflakes are firstly in situ synthesized on carbon cloth through the electrochemical oxidation of prefabricated Mn3O4 nanowalls in a traditional three-electrode cell using Li2SO4 as electrolyte. It is intriguingly found that the potential windows for the Mn3O4 and Li4Mn5O12 electrodes can be enlarged to 0–1.2 V (vs Hg/Hg2Cl2) with high specific capacitances of 527 and 627 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, respectively. The CV kinetic analysis reveals different charge storage mechanisms for the Mn3O4 and Li4Mn5O12 electrodes, major capacitances of which are identified as the surface capacitive contribution and diffusion-controlled contribution, respectively. Making the best of separate potential window of the Li4Mn5O12 cathode and activated carbon anode, the as-assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits a wide voltage window of 2.2 V with a large energy density of up to 78 Wh kg−1 at 295 W kg−1 as well as ideal cycle stability, significantly outstripping previously reported Mn-based supercapacitors. Therefore, the excellent energy storage property together with low cost enables the assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors to become a highly potential candidate for more possible future applications.
