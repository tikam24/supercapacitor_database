In this chapter, the bio-derived carbon using D. stramonium seed pods was activated using diverse concentrations of KOH (1 M, 2 M, and 3 M) as potential activating agent. Activated carbon (AC-3) prepared by activation with 3 M KOH possesses high specific capacitance of about 675 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of AC-3 shows lower solution resistance of about 0.1 Ω and the charge transfer resistance of about 0.3 Ω. The cyclic stability of bio-derived activated carbon activated by 3 M of KOH was found to be 76% for 1000 cycles. The obtained results confirm the AC derived from D. stramonium seed pods activated by 3 M KOH provides enhanced electrochemical activity and can be used as a superior electrode for supercapacitor applications.
