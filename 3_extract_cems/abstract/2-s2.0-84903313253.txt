The development of a novel hybrid symmetric micro-supercapacitor based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) coated silicon nanowires using an ionic liquid (N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) as an electrolyte has been demonstrated. The hybrid supercapacitor device was able to deliver a specific energy of 10 W h kg-1 and a maximal power density of 85 kW kg-1 at a cell voltage of 1.5 V. The hybrid device exhibited long lifetime and an outstanding electrochemical stability retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after thousands of galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles at a high current density of 1 mA cm-2. The improvement of the capacitive properties compared with the bare SiNWs was attributed to the pseudo-capacitive behavior induced by the conducting polymer coating. Â© 2014 the Partner Organisations.
