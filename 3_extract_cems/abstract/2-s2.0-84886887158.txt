The composite electrodes consisting of amorphous and hydrous RuO2, polyaniline and polymeric binder, NafionÂ® or poly(vinilydene fluoride) were prepared. The electrochemical and pseudocapacitive properties of the prepared electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the responses of composite electrodes are very sensitive to the presence of individual components and their respective ratio in the mixture. The difference in the electrochemical behavior was explained by the different physico-chemical properties of the polymeric binders.
