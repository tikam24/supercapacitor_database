Microwaves assisted selective etching technique was used to prepare few-layered Ti3C2 with atomic layer spacing of 1.28 nm. The mass specific capacitance is 377.64 F/g, which is 154.27% higher than that of multilayer Ti3C2. The kinetic analysis of two kinds of Ti3C2 electrochemical storage processes shows that the charge storage of few-layered Ti3C2 is mainly contributed by surface capacitance, which is 76.28%.
