Diamond-Shaped ZnCo2O4 nanostructures were synthesized using a facile sodium hydroxide-mediated hydrothermal method. The size and crystallinity of the ZnCo2O4 nanodiamond structure were tuned by simply varying the reaction time and temperatures. The specific capacitance value of 560 Fg−1 has been obtained at the scanning rate of 10 mVs−1. The internal resistance of the material is 1.6 Ω. The GCD curve also reveals the ZCO-D electrode has good charge/discharge time and superior specific capacitance. The optical behavior of the synthesized sample was studied using UV-DRS technique and the band gap was found to be ∼ 3.5 eV. The photocatalytic degradation of diamond-like ZnCo2O4 nanostructure vaule for 88 % and 70 % degradation efficiency of MV and RhB, respectively.
