Mesoporous carbon electrode materials were prepared directly from pyrolysis of barium citrate. N2 adsorption shows that the carbons prepared are typical mesoporous materials and that the specific surface area, total pore volume, mesopore volume and average pore size increase with the rise of carbonization temperature. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the carbons prepared at 700 and 800Â°C have superior capacitive performances than OMC prepared by hard-templated method. BaC-700 and BaC-800 could maintain high energy density at high power output, at which their mesopore surface are utilized efficiently. It is believed that these carbons are very promising for the scenarios where both high energy density and high power output are required.
