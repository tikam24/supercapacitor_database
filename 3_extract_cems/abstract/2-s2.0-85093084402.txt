Metal oxide incorporated with a conductive polymer have shown great potential as high-performance energy storage devices. In this report, polyaniline wrapped silver decorated manganese dioxide (PANI/Ag@MnO2) nanorods were successfully synthesized and used as positive electrode material. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to investigate the electrochemical activities. The overall result demonstrates that as prepared PANI/Ag@MnO2 nanorod performed better supercapacitor activities compared to Ag@MnO2 and pure MnO2. The PANI/Ag@MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1028.66 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 (nearly close to the theoretical capacitance of MnO2). A detail investigation of the synergic effect of PANI, Ag and MnO2 on electrochemical properties is presented sequentially. The assembled (PANI/Ag@MnO2//AC) asymmetric supercapacitor device showed a high energy density of 49.77 W h kg−1 at power density of 1599.75 W kg−1. The facile and cost-effective production of PANI/Ag@MnO2 demonstrates a high specific capacitance and energy density with long life cycle introduces this material as a prospective candidate for energy management.
