Microemulsion is prepared by nonionic surfactant Twain -20 (Tween-20) and 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium six fluorophosphate ((Bmim) PF6), and ordered molecular aggregates (OMA) are prepared as soft template for the preparation of nano/micro structure polyaniline (P-PANI) at room temperature. SEM results show that the diameter of the synthesized P-PANI fiber is about 80~110 nm, the length is long, the dispersion is uniform, and the P-PANI fiber presents a good three-dimensional porous structure. FTIR, XRD and TG results show that the synthesized materials are all proton acid doped PANI structure, and P-PANI structure has good regularity and thermal stability. The specific capacity of P-PANI is 535.4 F/g at 0.1 A/g discharge current density. After 500 constant current charge discharge cycles, the specific capacity of P-PANI is 344.2 F/g and the retention rate is as high as 64.3%. The results show that it is easier to prepare porous fiber structure by using ionic liquid as the medium to construct OMA, which is conducive to the infiltration of electrolyte into the electrode material, forming a better conductive network, and improving the specific capacity and cycle stability of PANI electrode material.
