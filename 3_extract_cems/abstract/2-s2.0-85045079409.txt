Nanoporous carbons (NPC-2) were prepared from benzoxazine resin with ZIF-8 as a template and activation agent simultaneously by high temperature carbonization. The structures, morphologies and electrochemical performance are characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM, TEM and electrochemical measurements. In comparison with the carbonization product of pure ZIF-8 (NCP-1), the NCP-2 exhibits a large specific capacitance (168.9 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1) and superior cycle stability (96.1% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1). This indicates that the NPC-2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
