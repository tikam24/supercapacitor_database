In this study, hierarchically nanoporous pyropolymers (HN-PPs) including numerous redox-active heteroatoms are fabricated from polyaniline nanotubes by heating with KOH. In the large operating voltage range 1.0–4.8 V versus Li+/Li, HN-PPs store amphicharges by a pseudocapacitive manner of Li-ion (mainly <3.0 V) and electrochemical double layer formation of anion (primarily >3.0 V). Through these surface-driven charge storage behaviors, HN-PPs achieve a significantly high specific capacity of ≈460 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, maintaining specific capacities of 140 mA h g−1 at a high specific current of 30 A g−1 and 305 mA h g−1 after 2000 cycles at 3 A g−1. Furthermore, asymmetric energy storage devices based on HN-PPs deliver a high specific energy of 265 W h kg−1 and high specific power of 5081 W kg−1 with long-term cycling performance.
