Reported biosupercapacitors are new, but their specific capacitances and power densities are pretty low. Inspired by the sudden blast of unusually high power by humans during emergencies, we propose a new conceptual living-cell-based ultrahigh performance supercapacitor made from bacteria accomplishing a supercapacitance of 1171 F g−1 and energy density of 416 Wh kg−1, which are exceptionally higher than all reported biosupercapacitors by 2 to 3 orders, and even comparable to the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, while retaining a high power of 387 kW kg−1. We propose that 3 double layers in series in a living cell produce a wide potential window of 1.6 V, while millions of individual cell-based micro-supercapacitors in parallel result in ultrahigh supercapacitance. This new living-cell-based supercapacitor sheds fresh scientific light on the fabrication of extremely high energy devices while holding great promise for making highly-biocompatible high-power devices as a future energy source for artificial skin and implantable applications.
