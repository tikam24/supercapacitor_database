With the construction of large-scale distributed power stations, the distributed generation power imbalance becomes a serious concern as many distributed generation systems and large power grids cannot be consistent with users' load. Wind power, which is used worldwide, is regarded as the typical example of the distributed generation power. In the wind power plants, though reactive power can be easily compensated locally by adding static var devices, the compensation of active power can be difficult. In order to solve the problem, this paper conducts research on the supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system controlled wind power integration, striving to find ways to make the entire output smooth and stable. This method utilizes the characteristics of SC to compensate the intermittent wind power. Case studies on a test system are presented using wind data to substantiate the problem.
