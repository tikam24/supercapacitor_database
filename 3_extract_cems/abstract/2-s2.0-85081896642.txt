The graphene/PPy fiber nanocomposites were synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method. Moved by electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between the tetra-functional NiPcTs and PPy chain, a self-sorting mechanism acts to align the PPy chains to form one-dimensional PPy nanofibers on graphene. The in situ grown nanostructure possesses a good interconnectivity and porosity facilities. The well-designed microstructure of the composites achieves a synergistic effect between the graphene and PPy and shows a good electrochemical performance for supercapacitors of 316 F g−1 even at a high current density of 5 A g−1.
