Ni2P/GN hybrids are successfully prepared via a facile one-step method. It is found that Ni2P nanoparticles with a mean size of about 15 nm attach uniformly onto the surface of GN nanosheets. As an anode for lithium-ion batteries (LiBs), the as-prepared Ni2P/GN hybrid delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 1194.2 mAh g−1 and reversible capacity of 460 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles and at the current density of 50 mA g−1, respectively. As the electrode for the supercpacitor, the as-prepared Ni2P/GN hybrid also displays superior electrochemical performance, which has a high specific capacitance (2204.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 1086.9 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) and superior cycling performance. Even after 3500 cycles, the composite can still maintain 90.65% capacity retention. The improved electrochemical performance of Ni2P/GN hybrid might be related to the smaller size and well dispersibility of Ni2P nanoparticles and good synergistic effect between Ni2P nanoparticles and GN nanosheets.
