A simple and large-scale synthesis technique was developed to fabricate a nano-wedge IrO2/MnO2 hybrid film electrode for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors. When the galvanostatic charge/discharge rate was increased from 2.96 to 296 A g-1, the specific capacitance of the electrode declined from 573.5 to 379.2 F g -1 with a relatively limited loss of 34%. In particular, the hybrid film electrode presents a loss of only 4.9% in the specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 The Electrochemical Society.
