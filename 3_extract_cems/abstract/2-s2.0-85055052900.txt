Porous graphene-like carbon materials (PGCMs) for supercapacitors were synthesized from petroleum pitch by a nano-CaCO3 template strategy combined with KOH activation. The PGCMs were characterized by TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy and N2 adsorption. Results show that their specific surface areas are 1 542-2 305 m2 g-1, depending on the template/pitch ratio, KOH/pitch ratio and activation temperature. The PGCMs feature interconnected graphene-like carbon layers with abundant small pores. The optimum supercapacitor electrode is produced when the PGCM is synthesized with a template/pitch ratio of 1.5, a KOH/pitch ratio of 1.5 at 850 â„ƒ for 1h. It has a specific capacitance of 293 F g-1 at a current density of 0.05 A g-1, an excellent rate capability with a capacitance of 231 F g-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1 and an outstanding cycling stability with a 97.4% capacitance retention after 7 000 cycles in a 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. It also exhibits a high specific capacitance of 267 F g-1 at a current density of 0.05 A g-1, and a high energy density of 148.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 204.2 W kg-1 in a BMIMPF6 ionic liquid electrolyte. This is a possible method for the synthesis of PGCMs for high-performance supercapacitors.
