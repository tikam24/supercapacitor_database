In order to enhance the microgrid's ability of tracking scheduling plan and reduce the impact of power fluctuations of distributed generations and loads on the tracking effect,a two-layer double-time scale real-time control strategy is proposed to track the scheduling plan by utilizing the HESS(Hybrid Energy Storage System) composed of SC(SuperCapacitor) and BS(Battery Storage). In the upper layer,the intra-day rolling optimization model is established based on model predictive control. Combined with the ultra-short term power prediction results of distributed generations and loads,the tracking scheduling plan rolling optimization is carried out by comprehensively considering the tracking deviation and the power and SOC(State Of Charge) of HESS in a period of time. On the basis of the optimization results of upper layer,in the lower layer,the real-time control strategy of HESS based on SOC is applied to allocate the real-time power of SC and BS coordinately,so as to further reduce the impact of real-time power fluctuations of distributed generations and loads on tracking effect. A simulation example is given to verify the proposed control strategy. The results show that the proposed strategy not only achieves good control effect of real-time tracking scheduling plan,but also optimizes the SOC of SC and BS.
