The development of energy storage devices encourages the sustainability of research on basic materials of supercapacitor technology. SrTiO3 is one of metal oxide called as titanate alkali metal ATiO3 (A = Ba, Sr, Ca). This material shows an excellent dielectric constant, thus expected to be potential as raw material of supercapacitor. In this work, boron was used as a dopant on the SrTiO3 system to modify its local structure and enhance the electrical properties. Synthesis SrTi1-xBxO3 was carried out using a solid-state reaction method followed by the sintering process in various molar ratio. The microstructure of SrTi1-xBxO3 compound was identified by X-ray Diffraction with Cu-Kα. XRD pattern identified the presence of SrTi1-xBxO3 phase with a slight change in the lattice parameters. I-V measurement confirmed that the electrical conductivity increased gradually up to 16.04 Ω-1cm-1. For investigating their application for electrode materials, CV was employed and it presents that the specific capacitance and energy density of x = 0.08 were 5.488 Fg-1 and 0.110 Jg-1.
