The paper is devoted to the estimation of technical and economic efficiency of using the supercapacitors in the frequency-controlled electric drives, which are used in hoisting applications. In the article the frequency-controlled electric drives of passenger elevator and bridge crane are described in detail. The simulation and experimental results, energy consumption, calculation of economic efficiency and payback period of using electric drive with supercapacitors for these mechanisms are shown.
