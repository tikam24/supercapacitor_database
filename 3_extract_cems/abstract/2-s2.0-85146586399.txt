This paper presents a wireless measuring and data acquisition system for a hydro-generator's stator and rotor which are part of the subsystem for monitoring, analysis, and diagnosis of the hydropower unit (hydraulic turbine and hydro-generator) for the production of electricity from hydroelectric power plants [1]. The system aims to measure the air gap, the magnetic field and the rotor pole temperature. The advantage over other existing devices is the immunity to EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interferences) of the air gap readings and the fact that there is no fixed power supply, no battery, but a supercapacitor for energy storage. The reading / transmission of information from the sensors is done multiplexed in order to rationalize the power consumption.
