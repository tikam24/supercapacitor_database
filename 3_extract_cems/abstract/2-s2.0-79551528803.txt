An asymmetric electrochemical capacitor with an enhanced energy density has been constructed by using carbon fabric electrodes modified with complementary functionality; anthraquinone for the negative electrode and 1,2- dihydroxybenezene for the positive electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current discharging were used to evaluate the performance of a supercapacitor with 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and a Nafion separator. Energy densities were found to be double the values obtained for a symmetric device with two unmodified carbon fabric electrodes. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.
