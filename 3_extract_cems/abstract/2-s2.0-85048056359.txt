Brick-shaped zinc tungstate nanoparticles have been synthesized by ecofriendly solvent-free process using molten salts. Zinc tungstate nanobricks (ZnWO4 Nbs) were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), FTIR, Raman, energy dispersive and electron microscopic studies. ZnWO4 Nbs are used as the multifunctional electrode materials to oxygen generation reactions (OGR), oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) and supercapacitors (SCs) as well as photo-catalysts in the waste-water treatment by the degradation of organic dyes. Low overpotential (ƞ10 = 0.475 V), low tafel slope (140 mV/dec), high current density (~70 mA/cm2) and good stability of the electrodes are the key results of the present studies for water electrolysis (OGR/ORR). ZnWO4 Nbs have also shown great interest in supercapacitors with efficient charge–discharge activities in 1 M KOH. The specific capacitance and energy density of ZnWO4 Nbs were found to be 250 F/g and 80 Wh/kg, respectively, at 5 mV/s, these values are relatively higher than that of previously reported specific capacitance and energy density value of metal tungstate nanoparticles. ZnWO4 Nbs as the photo-catalysts work very significantly for photocatalytic degradation of aqueous MB dye solution (~85 % in 3 h) in neutral medium. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
