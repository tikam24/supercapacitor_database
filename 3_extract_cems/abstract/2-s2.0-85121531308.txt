The electrochemical performance of an electrode in a supercapacitor primarily depends on the electrolyte composition. Herein, the effect of electrolyte composition on the electrode performance of copper hydroxide [Cu(OH)2] nanosheets thin film is investigated. Cu(OH)2 nanosheets thin film is synthesized by facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The structural and morphological properties are investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The pure phase Cu(OH)2 nanosheet thin film is effectively used as an electrode for supercapacitor. The electrochemical performance of Cu(OH)2 nanosheets thin film is investigated using various 1 M aqueous electrolytes such as KOH, NaOH, and Na2SO4. Among all other electrolytes, Cu(OH)2 nanosheets thin film shows the highest specific capacitance of 467 Fg–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 in 1 M KOH. Further, cyclic stability for 2000 cycles shows capacitance retention of 93%.
