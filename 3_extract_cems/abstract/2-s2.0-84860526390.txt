This work reports the pulsed laser reactive deposition of the NiO thin film by ablating nickel targets in low-pressure O 2 atmosphere at room temperature. The electrode exhibits a porous structure, which facilitates ion transport in the electrode/electrolyte. When applied as an electrode, the porous NiO film exhibits the high specific capacitance (835 F g - 1 at 1 A g - 1). Meanwhile, the film exhibits a superb rate capability. At a very high current density of 40 A g - 1 there is more than 59% retention in the capacitance relative to 1 A g - 1. Furthermore, the excellent cycling performance (94% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) is achieved for the film electrode. These results demonstrate that pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a very promising technique for making the film electrodes for applications in electrochemical energy storage. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
