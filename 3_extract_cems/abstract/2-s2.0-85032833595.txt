A high charge-carrier transport is an important aim in the synthesis of nanostructures for an effective supercapacitor. This article describes a methodology to prepare mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) wrapped with graphene oxide (GO) together with conducting polyaniline (PANI) wires. The morphology and chemical structure of the prepared samples have been tested by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), whereas the stability and electrostatic interaction of the structures have been verified by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The supercapacitive behaviour of these nanocomposites has been analysed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge–discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared with pristine MSNs and PANI, the 20%-GO@MSNs/PANI nanocomposite had the highest specific capacitance, reaching 412 F g−1. The nanocomposite structure maximizes the synergy between mesoporous metal oxide, conducting PANI, and GO, yielding a significantly enhanced specific capacitance, rapid charge–discharge rates, and good cycling stability of the resulting device. The wrapping with GO prevents the structural breakdown and acts as a highly conductive pathway by bridging the individual particles, whereas the MSNs nanoparticles greatly enlarge the specific surface area to facilitate ion transport and charge transfer throughout the cycling performance of supercapacitor. The approach adopted in this article can be applied for preparing similar novel functional materials in future for electrochemical applications.
