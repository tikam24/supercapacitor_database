In this study, the active use of bloedite-type material in many different areas has revealed the idea that it can also be used in capacitors as the aqueous electrolyte. In this context, aqueous electrolyte properties of bloedite Na2X(SO4)2·(4H2O) (X = Mg, Ni) samples were investigated. In electrochemical measurements, it has been determined that Ni and Mg-bloedite structures have “rectangular shape” cyclic voltammetry (C–V) characteristics. Ni-bloedite capacitors reached 2.35 F g−1, and Mg-bloedite capacitors reached 2.09 F g−1 capacitance values. As a result of cycle-life studies, Ni-bloedite structure provides higher performance than Mg-bloedite structure with a difference of 0.24 F g−1 at the end of 100 cycles. The research results have shown that Ni and Mg-bloedite materials can be used in supercapacitors as an alternative high-performance aqueous electrolyte. This study could also provide an idea to researchers of using different types of materials in energy storage systems, and helps to produce alternative materials for energy storage systems.
