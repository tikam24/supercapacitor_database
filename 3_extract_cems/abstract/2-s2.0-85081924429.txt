Three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques bring the possibility of making electronic devices in any desired shape and dimensions. Here, we report on a printable black phosphorous nanosheet/polypyrrole composite ink for constructing a high-performance supercapacitor (SC) electrode. The printed BPNS/PPy electrode shows a good energy storage performance with a specific capacitance of up to 417 F g-1 and an excellent cycling stability.
