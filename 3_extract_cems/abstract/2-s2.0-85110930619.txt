The effect of aqueous electrolyte to the supercapacitor electrode performance made from Sugar palm (Arenga pinnata) fronds waste has been successfully analyzed. The preparation of the activated carbon was used a combination of chemical and physical activation methods. The chemical activation was conducted using potassium hydroxide with 0.5 M of concentration and the physical activation using CO2 gas. The electrochemical performance of the sugar palm fronds (SPFs) electrode was tested using the cyclic voltammetry method with two-electrode configuration. The 1.0 M H2SO4, 6.0 M KOH, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 were used as aqueous electrolytic solutions in this study. The specific capacitance of the SPFs electrodes obtained are 130 F/g for 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte, 110 F/g for 6.0 M KOH electrolyte, and 79 F/g for 0.5 M Na2SO4, respectively. In addition, the physical properties of the SPFs electrode were also analyzed. The physical parameter of the SPFs electrode indicated a shrinkage after the physical activation processes. Based on the XRD pattern, the SPFs electrode has a semicrystalline structure. The characteristic peaks of the SPFs electrode for the pre-carbonization and after physical activation based on the FTIR spectra show slightly different.
