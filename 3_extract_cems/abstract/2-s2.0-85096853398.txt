For an efficient energy storage system, effective material is to be used. In the present work, novel poly(vinylidene fluoride)/titanium oxide (PVdF/TiO2) composite membranes were developed using electrospinning technique, as separator for supercapacitors. Different weight percentages of TiO2 nanoparticle (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) were mixed with 20 wt% of PVdF in a 50:50 wt% of tetrahydrofuran and dimethylacetamide solvent. Various physical and electrochemical properties including fiber diameter, thermal stability, crystallinity, porosity, and electrolytic uptake were studied to identify the best membrane with optimum TiO2 wt% exhibiting superior characteristics. SEM and TGA studies revealed that the developed PVdF/TiO2 composite membrane with 10 wt% showed improved properties with a lower average diameter of about 66 ± 8 nm, enhanced thermal stability up to 513.15°C and higher porosity of 89%, respectively compared to other membranes. The crystallinity, ionic conductivity, and specific capacitance of the nonwoven separator membranes were determined using X-ray diffraction technique, electrolytic uptake, and charge–discharge studies, respectively. The present study revealed that the addition of TiO2 nanoparticles improved the physical and thermochemical properties of the separator membrane substantially and PVdF/TiO2 composite membrane with 10 wt% displayed superior performance compared to other membranes.
