When a voltage sag fault occurs in the grid, in order to improve the low voltage ride-through capability and prevent the doubly-fed pumped storage unit from disconnecting from the grid, the 2 MW pumped storage prototype is proposed based on the transient analysis of the system. The super-capacitor branch is introduced on the DC bus side in the joint control strategy, and through the bidirectional DC/DC control, the instantaneous large current caused by the fault is absorbed, so as to maintain the voltage stability of the DC bus, protect the converter, and improve the low voltage ride-through capability. At the same time, this method is also based on the stator flux transient state compensation, cutting from the perspective of the impedance of the rotor side port, using virtual inductance technology to give full play to the potential of the converter.
