In recent years, the fuel cell electric vehicles have been attracting attentions for their zero emission of greenhouse gases. In the vehicle applications the most promising fuel cell is the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell because of its relatively small size, lightweight nature, and low reaction temperature. However, a pure fuel cell vehicle has several disadvantages. Therefore the fuel cell systems are always combined with other energy storage systems such as batteries and supercapacitors. This paper proposes a rule-based energy management strategy based on power prediction of the lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor. The case conditions of different operation modes have been discussed. The hydrogen consumptions of 10%, 30%, and 50% state-of-charge (SOC) thresholds are 1.154 kg, 1.273 kg and 1.382 kg. However, the fuel cell has relatively small power fluctuation when the expected SOC threshold is set to 30%.
