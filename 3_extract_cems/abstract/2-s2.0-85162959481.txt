The electrodeposition technique was used to create Prussian blue (PB), binary: rGO/PB, PANI/PB, rGO/PANI, and ternary: rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposites. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) methods were used to describe the samples. The results demonstrated the covering of PB by the rGO and PANI. The electrochemical characteristics of the studied materials were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 2 M Na2SO4. The specific capacitance follows the order: rGO/PANI/PB > rGO/PB > PANI/PB > rGO/PANI> PANI > rGO > PB. The rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposite electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 336 F. g−1 in 2 M Na2SO4 at a discharge current density of 1 A. g−1 with 92 % retention of its original capacitance after 3000 cycles. The remarkable electrochemical performance of the ternary rGO/PANI/PB nanocomposite is attributed to its synergistic effects among individual components. The ternary electrode's high electrochemical performance indicates that it might be employed as an electrode for commercial supercapacitors. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was built using a positive electrode of rGO/PANI/PB and a negative electrode of activated carbon (AC). The arranged (ASC) operates continuously within the potential range of 0–1.8 V and delivers a high energy density of 56.3 Wh. kg−1 at a power density of 8804 W. kg−1, as well as 92 % retention of its original capacitance after 3000 cycles.
