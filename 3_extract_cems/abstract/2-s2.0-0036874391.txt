This paper presents a new approach of modeling the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors using impedance spectroscopy. The new Matlab/Simulink model can be used in simulating the voltage response and energy efficiency, e.g., for automotive power systems. The model in the frequency domain, the parameter calculation, as well as the inverse transformation into the time domain are discussed. Furthermore, simulation results are compared with experimental data. As application example, the new model is used to analyze the energy dissipation of a supercapacitor module installed in a 42-V mild-hybrid vehicle.
