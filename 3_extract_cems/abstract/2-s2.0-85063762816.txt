A novel electrode material, NiCo phosphate, was prepared by a facile surfactant assisted self-assembly method at room temperature. The as-prepared transition metal phosphate (SDBS-Ni 2 Co 1 PO 4 ) with amorphous and mesopores morphology exhibits superior electrochemical capacitive behaviors. The specific capacitance was 191.6 mAh g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and it maintained 142.5 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 . More importantly, the material possessed superior cyclic stability (77% of retention after 2000 times charge-discharge at 10 A g −1 ). Moreover, the SDBS-Ni 2 Co 1 PO 4 //Graphene asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled in aqueous KOH electrolyte, and possessed high energy density (36.5 Wh kg −1 at 150 W kg −1 ). This work provides a simple and green way to prepare cheap transition metal phosphate as efficient electrode material in pseudocapacitor.
