Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have attracted widespread attention due to the high electrochemical activity as energy reserves. Nevertheless, the problems of the self-stacking and low conductivity of LDHs limit their development on supercapacitor. In this paper, the NiAl-LDH (NA-LDH) with the large specific capacitance is embedded on the MXene (Ti3C2Tx) with excellent conductivity by facile electrostatic self-assembly process. The composite electrode shows a high specific capacitance (Cs,1276.83 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, when the mass ratio of MXene to NA-LDH is 3:7 (M3L7). Besides, M3L7 emerges a quite marvelous rate capability at 10 A g−1. The capacitance retention rate reaches 92.3%, which is far higher of pristine NA-LDH material (27.7%). After 4000 cycles, M3L7 electrode represents outstanding capacitance retention of 81.16% at 6 A g−1, which is superior to pure NA-LDH (58.1%). The enhanced electrochemical performance of this composite could be attributed to the combination of NA-LDH with large specific capacitance and wrinkled MXene, which increases the interfacial charge transfer performance. Furthermore, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with M3L7 anode and activated carbon cathode shows a high energy density of 37.86 Wh kg−1 at 1056.55 W kg−1 and displays outstanding cycle stability with 86% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles and the morphology changes slightly. This electrode material has wide application prospects in the high-performance energy storage field.
