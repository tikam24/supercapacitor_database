At present, electric toys belong to high-end consumer electronic toys. Due to the popularity of supercapacitors, the use of supercapacitors as electrical energy storage units is more practical, reliable and convenient than the early nickel-hydrogen rechargeable batteries. Therefore, many toys have adopted the 'rechargeable' function, which plays an important role in promoting the grade and quality of toys. However, how to design in the actual charging power management system for toys with 'electricity' brings difficulties to toy design engineers. In this paper, three typical designs of constant current charging power supply, constant voltage charging power supply and constant current and constant voltage charging power supply are analyzed, and a more reasonable power management system design of three types of circuits is given based on the application of the current most mainstream new power management chip.
