Catalyst-free carbon nanospheres were synthesized using simple one-step pyrolysis techniques where biowaste sago bark is used as a carbon precursor. Obtained carbon nanospheres showed a porous nature and revealed that more than 95% carbon is present in the synthesized carbon nanospheres with particle size ranging from 40 to 70 nm. An electrochemical study showed a specific capacitance value of 180 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 2 mV s<sup>-1</sup> and the cycling stability up to 1700 cycles. Obtained carbon nanospheres are useful in supercapacitor applications. The presented study revealed a waste to wealth approach thereby reducing waste in the environment. (Graph Presented).
