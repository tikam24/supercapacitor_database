Abstract: Large-scale lightweight hierarchical porous carbon materials (LHPCM) were synthesized using weakly acidic cation exchange resin by a chemical activation method. The synthesized carbon materials possessed a hierarchical pore structure, i.e., macropores, mesopores, and micropores. In particular, the morphological structure and porosity parameters can be controlled by the change of the sodium hydroxide ratio. The largest Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and porosity of 3D-PGM were 813m2/g and 90.83%, respectively. Especially, such materials also possessed a packing density of 0.064g/cm3, which belonged to the LHPCM. The four-phase probe method was used to measure the conductivity of the LHPCM, and the electrical conductivity was around 146.8 S/m. The LHPCM exhibited a specific capacitance of 120.8 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and achieved 87.86% capacity retention after 5000 cycles tested at 1 A/g. We believe that the LHPCM with a low cost and satisfactory conductivity and electrochemical performance can be used as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors.
