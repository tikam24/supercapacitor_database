This paper reports the electrochemical properties of various silver-manganese oxide carbon nanofiber-based composites (AgOx-MnOx/CNF). The various polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based solutions; PAN, AgNO3/PAN, Mn(NO3)2/PAN, and AgNO3- Mn(NO3)2/PAN were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as the precursors. The four-nozzle electrospinning system was employed to obtain nanofibers. The electrospun precursors were calcined using a tubular quartz furnace including stabilization, carbonization, and activation under air, argon, and CO2 atmosphere, respectively. The calcined samples were named as CNF, AgOx/CNF, MnOx/CNF, AgOx- MnOx/CNF dependent on each composite. Morphological, structural, textural properties were characterized, and supercapacitor performances were studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The calcined fibers were obtained as a paper-like sheet thickness of ∼30-60 μm, they had several diameters of ∼237-643 nm depending on each composite. Among the samples, the AgOx-MnOx/CNF which had a high specific surface area of 812 m2 g-1 expressed the highest specific capacitance of nearly 204 F g-1 and energy density of ∼28 mW h g-1 at a power density of ∼250 mW g-1. Moreover, it also displayed imposing cycling capability of more than 99% after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. In addition, the other remarkable results have been also discussed.
