This paper presents modeling, active power management strategy, and implementation of a fuel cell, pbotovoltaic, and super-capacitor power conversion system in MATLAB. The micro-grid includes two distributed generation (DG) units. Each DG unit consists of a fuel cell (FC), photovoltaic unit (PV) and super-capacitor (SC). The super-capacitor energy storage compensates the shortage power of FC stack, PV unit and the load demand. The output of DG unit is connected to grid using inverter. Load changes are applied for balanced conditions. The frequency deviation is fed to adaptive proportional resonance controller which adapts to the changes in frequency. This results in eliminating steady state error and output impedance of DG unit is decreased thereby reducing low frequency oscillations in the power components of the DG units. The system is modeled and simulated using software. The dynamic response of the DG units to balanced load changes is investigated using software.
