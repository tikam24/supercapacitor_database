Titanium dioxide (TiO2) shows excellent pseudocapacitive properties. However, the low internal conductivity of TiO2 limits its use in supercapacitor applications. Therefore, an efficient surface engineering process was developed to enhance the overall pseudocapacitive performance of rutile TiO2 nanorods. Specifically, surface-engineered TiO2 nanorod arrays coordinated on carbon cloth were established through the Kapton tape-assisted hydrothermal route. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a tetragonal TiO2 rutile phase. Morphological analysis revealed the formation of uniform nanorods with an apparent high surface-to-volume aspect ratio. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the TiO2 synthesized in the presence of Kapton tape and annealed under air had high content of hydroxyl groups and Ti3+, which is favorable for supercapacitor performance. Surface treatment of the samples led to significantly enhanced conductivity and electrochemical behavior of TiO2. The surface-engineered TiO2 nanorod arrays show specific capacitance of about 57.62 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s in 2 M KOH, with excellent rate capability of about 83% at 200 mV/s, and also exhibit long cycle life, retaining 91% of their original capacitance after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles, which is among the highest values reported for TiO2-based supercapacitors.
