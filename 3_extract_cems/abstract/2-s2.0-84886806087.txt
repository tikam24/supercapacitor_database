Porous single-crystalline nanosheet (NS) arrays of Co3S 4 have been synthesized via a simple shape and phase transformation route, which exhibits high specific capacitance (1081 F g-1 at 1.61 A g-1) and areal capacitance (2.69 F cm-2 at 4 mA cm -2 and 2.33 F cm-2 at 12 mA cm-2) with good cycling performance (96.2% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles).
