Biodegradable polymer electrolyte comprising the blend of chitosan (CS) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) plasticized with ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate, as host polymer, and lithium perchlorate (LiClO4), as a dopant, was prepared by solution casting technique. The ionic conductivity has been calculated using the bulk impedance obtained through impedance spectroscopy. The variation of conductivity and dielectric properties has been investigated as a function of polymer blend ratio, plasticizer content and LiClO4 concentration at temperature range of 298-343 K. The DSC thermograms show two broad peaks for CS/PEG blend and increased with increase in the LiClO4 content. The maximum conductivity has been found to be 1. 1 × 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature for 70:30 (CS/PEG) concentration. The electric modulus of the electrolyte film exhibits a long tail feature indicative of good capacitance. The activation energy of all samples was calculated using the Arrhenius plot, and it has been found to be 0. 12 to 0. 38 eV. A carbon-carbon supercapacitor has been fabricated using this electrolyte, and its electrochemical characteristics and performance have been studied. The supercapacitor showed a fairly good specific capacitance of 47 F g-1. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
