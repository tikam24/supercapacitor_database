In this paper, nitrogen-doped activated carbon was prepared with Chinese fir sawdust as raw materials, and zinc chloride and urea as eutectic solvents after carbon activation. The influences of impregnation ratio, activation temperature and activation time on the electrochemical performance of activated carbon were investigated by orthogonal experiment design. Specific surface area (BET), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatical charge/discharge (GCD) and other characterization methods were used to study the pore structure, surface chemical elements and electrochemical performance of sample. The study results showed that the impregnation ratio of 4, the activation temperature of 750â„ƒ and the holding time of 3h were the best process conditions. By analyzing the pore structure of activated carbon, it can be found that the activated carbon activated by eutectic solvent was beneficial to the formation of micropores and the specific surface area can reach 797.82m2/g with nitrogen content of 11.55%, where the main combined states of nitrogen were pyridine type N, pyrrole type N and graphite type N. In the 6mol/L KOH electrolyte, the specific capacitance can reach 233.85F/g when the current density was 1A/g. When the current density increased to 20A/g, the specific capacitance can still be maintained at 159.6F/g.
