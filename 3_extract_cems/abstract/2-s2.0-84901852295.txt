In this paper, behaviour of supercapacitor connected to a power element are derived for an arbitrary power profile, given either in analytical or statistical distribution form. The analytical derivation is based on simple RC model with parameters taken from a manufacturer datasheet. A simplified quick non-iterative sizing procedure is proposed at the expense of a slightly oversized supercapacitor. An example is provided in order to reinforce the proposed method of analysing supercapacitor performance and demonstrate sizing procedure.
