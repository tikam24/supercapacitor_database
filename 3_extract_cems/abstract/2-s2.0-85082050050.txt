Fiber-shaped supercapacitors (FSSCs) show great potential in portable and wearable electronics due to their unique advantages of high safety, environmental friendliness, high performances, outstanding flexibility and integrability. They can directly act as the power sources or be easily integrated with other flexible devices to constitute self-powered and sustainable energy suppliers, providing excellent adaptability to irregular surfaces. This review mainly summarizes the recently reported works of FSSCs including preparation methods of various fiber electrodes, construction strategies of FSSCs and multi-functional device integrations, exploration of reaction mechanisms and strategies to improve the electrochemical performance and provision of suggestions on further designing and optimization of FSSCs. Meanwhile, it shares our perspectives on challenges and opportunities in this field, shedding light on the development of high-performance fiber-shaped supercapacitors with multi-functions.
