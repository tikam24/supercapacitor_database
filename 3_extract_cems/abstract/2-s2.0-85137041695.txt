This chapter explored the recent, state-of-the-art research on TiO2-based nanomaterials for energy harvesting and storage. The chapter is organized as follows: at first this chapter provides an introduction to TiO2 nanomaterials in energy harvesting applications followed by introduction to storage applications in the next section. Then, a detailed summary of energy storage applications using TiO2-based nanomaterials as supercapacitor is presented with primary focus on nanostructures of TiO2 and its polymorphs. The next section is focused on analysis and summary of polymorphs of TiO2 and its nanostructures in batteries. The hydrogen storage and other forms of energy storage using TiO2 nanomaterials are discussed in the following two sections. Finally it concludes with an overall summary of the chapter. Future perspectives and research scenario in TiO2 nanomaterials is also elaborated.
