Nanoporous carbons (NPCs) have been successfully prepared from poplar catkins (PCs) as a sustainable and renewable carbon source by a facile carbonization and subsequent KOH activation procedure. The KOH-activated NPCs at 800 °C (NPC800) exhibits a hierarchical porous structure containing macroporous frameworks and microporous textures, with a high specific surface area of 1251.5 m2 g−1 and a large pore volume up to 0.85 cm3 g−1. In addition, a novel redox-active electrolyte through introducing a redox-mediator (p-phenylenediamine, PPD) into KOH electrolytes was used to improve the electrochemical performance of the NPCs-based supercapacitors. The NPC800 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 557 F g-1 at 0.1 A g−1, a good rate capability of 254 F g-1 at 10 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability with 77.4% capacitance retention after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1. With a favorable capacitive performance, the waste biomass PCs could be a new source of carbonaceous materials for high performance and low-cost supercapacitors.
