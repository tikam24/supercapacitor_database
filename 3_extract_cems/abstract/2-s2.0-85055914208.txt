In this work, we report a facile method via electric field-assisted assembly of graphene oxide sheets to produce 3D graphene network. As expected, high specific capacitance (∼238 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and well rate capability (the specific capacitance retained 60% at 10 A g −1 ) have been achieved in 3D graphene network-based supercapacitor. The significantly improved performances are due to large electrolyte accessible surface (257 m 2 g −1 ) and high electrical conductivity (12.58 S cm −1 ). Furthermore, the electric field-assisted assembly method is a simple and promising way to fabricate 3D graphene network, compared to chemical vapor deposition, freeze drying, etc., which could efficiently reduce the production cost and promote its industrial production.
