A new type of integrated power fiber that incorporates a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and a supercapacitor (SC), which can be used for energy conversation and storage, was introduced for the first time. A stainless steel wire coated with polyaniline via anodic deposition is jointly used as the electrode of the fiber DSSC and fiber SC. The overall energy conversion efficiency of the integrated power fiber is as high as 2.1%. Compared with traditional integrated power systems, our integrated power fiber is lightweight, flexible, inexpensive, suitable for special applications, and capable of integrating with cloth.
