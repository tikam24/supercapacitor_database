Hierarchical flower-like V2O5growth on graphene and nickel foam electrodes was fabricated by using chemical vapor deposition and hydrothermal methods for electrochemical capacitors. Taking advantages of the high conductivity of graphene, high capacitance of well-defined V2O5flower-like structure and open framework of three-dimensional nickel foam, the resulting electrodes exhibited rapid electron and ion transport, large electroactive surface area, and excellent structural stability. The specific capacitance was as high as 1235 F gâˆ’1at a current density of 2 A g-1, suggesting its potential as a high performance electrode for supercapacitors.
