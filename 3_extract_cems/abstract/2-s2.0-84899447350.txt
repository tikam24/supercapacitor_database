Amorphous mesoporous Ni(OH)2 nanoboxes are synthesized by template-engaged routes. The nanoboxes are characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, XPS and BET methods. The nanoboxes have uniform morphology of 450-500 nm, high surface area of 214.6 m2 g-1 and mesoporous structure of 4-20 nm. Electrochemical characterization are tested using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy, respectively. These amorphous mesoporous Ni(OH)2 hollow nanoboxes shows high specific capacitance of 2495, 2378, 2197, 1993 F g-1 at discharge current of 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g-1 respectively. The property tests demonstrate the high specific capacitance and excellent cycling of the amorphous Ni(OH)2 nanoboxes material for high-performance electrochemical pseudocapacitors.
