A coherent polyaniline (PANI)/graphene oxides (GOs)/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) composite was prepared by in-situ solution polymerization as a positive electrode of supercapacitors. The orderly growth of PANI nano-dots on GOs led to the formation of the nano-ravines that can enhance ions diffusion efficiency. MWCNTs surrounded by PANI connected all components, and thus the conductivity with the increasing electron transfer rate was improved. The results showed that the electrode exhibited the outstanding electrochemical performances with the specific capacitance up to 696 F g-1 at 20 mV s-1. The KOH-activated GOs/MWCNTs were used as a negative electrode to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The ASC possessed an extended working potential (1.6 V), a good rate capability (58% capacitance retention even after the current density being increased by 10 times), an excellent cycling stability (89% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles), and a decent average energy and power density (69 W h/kg and 6.4 kW/kg).
