Potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs) shrewdly combine a battery-type anode and a capacitor-type cathode, exhibiting an energy density close to that of potassium ion batteries and a comparable power density of supercapacitors. However, the rosy scenario is compromised by the sluggish kinetics in the PIHCs device. Herein, the kinetics enhanced nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous hollow carbon spheres (NHCS) are synthesized and successfully applied to PIHCs. As for the K half-cell, NHCS anchored with sodium alginate delivers excellent electrochemical performance. Further evaluation shows that the binder can significantly affect the potassium storage performance of NHCS by adjusting the coatability and ionic conductivity of the NHCS anode. Moreover, kinetic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal the origin of the superior electrochemical properties of NHCS. As expected, an advanced PIHC device is assembled with a NHCS anode and an activated NHCS cathode, demonstrating an exceptionally high energy/power density (114.2 Wh kg−1 and 8203 W kg−1), along with a long-life capability. The successful construction of high-performance PIHCs in this work opens a new avenue for the development and application of PIHCs in the future.
