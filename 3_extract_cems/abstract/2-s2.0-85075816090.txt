Uniformly lamellar MoS2 nanoflowers have successfully grown on the surface of cornstalks with biocarbon based template. The as-formed biocarbon based composite materials (MoS2/C) were used in lithium-ion battery and supercapacitors. It showed outstanding electrochemical properties as anode materials in LIBs, the discharge capacity was 1129 mAh g−1 (or 339 mAh g−1) after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 (or 1 A g−1). Furthermore, the composites possessed a high specific capacitance of 338.3 F g−1 and good cycling stability as negative electrode in supercapacitors. BET and XPS results confirmed the large specific surface areas and heterogeneous structures of the composite materials, which endowed them more active sites and excellent conductance properties conducive to improve the energy storage properties. So, biocarbon based template method and this composite material had great application prospects in the field of energy.
