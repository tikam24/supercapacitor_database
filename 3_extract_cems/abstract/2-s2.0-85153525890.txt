With the increasing complexity of the application scenarios of nanomaterials, transition metal oxides (TMOs) have shown excellent development potential. However, the synthesis of TMOs with customized morphologies for different application environments is still challenging. Herein, an acid-alcohol treatment based on the different intensities of the redox reactions between nitric acid and ethanol was developed to prepare different carbon templates. Through impregnation and annealing of the templates, NiCo2O4 (NCO) materials with hollow spherical (NCO-HS), multi-shell spherical (NCO-MS), and lamellar (NCO-L) morphologies were obtained. The characterization was performed through different analytical methods, which revealed various structures, morphologies, and surface chemistry of the materials. NCO-HS, NCO-MS, and NCO-L were tested for supercapacitor applications and exhibited a high specific capacitance of 402.6, 1037.1, and 531.4 F gâˆ’1, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be used to customize the synthesis of functional materials with various morphologies for future advanced applications.
