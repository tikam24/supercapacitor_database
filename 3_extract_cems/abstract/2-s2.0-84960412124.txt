An accumulator can store energy in high capacity, and a super capacitor can charge and discharge high power. The mixed power source composed by an accumulator and a super capacitor can meet the high-power requirements of high capacity and peak value. How to perform equalized charging for multiple power packs is currently an emphasis in industry. On the basis of analysis for multiple equalizing charging methods, a new type of design scheme based on a DC/DC and a switch matrix is raised in this project. An intermittent charging mode was adopted, and four BCAP0350 served as the charging sample to perform the charging and discharging experiment as well as to verify the provided composite charging design scheme was feasible.
