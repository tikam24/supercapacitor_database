This paper deals with the performances fading of ultracapacitors under calendar life and power cycling tests. The used impedance model is analytical and based on physical quantities as double layer capacitance, specific area and electrolyte conductivity but also on elementary electrodes dispersion. This model is validated in frequency domain using the initial state of the tested ultracapacitor. Then, the two types of tests are presented and specified. A periodic characterization based on impedance spectroscopy is done in order to quantify the impedance changes during ageing tests. The obtained results confirm that impedance real part is increasing and the capacitance is decreasing during the two ageing tests, nevertheless the way they change is different. Indeed the impedance real part increase is independent of the frequency in calendar life test while, in power cycling test, this increase is accentuated at low frequencies. This difference will be explained thanks to impedance model parameters evolution. This study confirms that the two ageing tests affect differently the ultracapacitor performances.
