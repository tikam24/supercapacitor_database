This work describes the fabrication of high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors based on covalently-anchored reduced graphene oxide (RGO)@polyaniline (PANI) composites via an inkjet printing method. Morphological and chemical characterization data show that PANI nanoparticles are immobilized on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets via covalent bonds. Sandwich-structured and interdigitated supercapacitors are fabricated by printing the as-prepared GO@PANI composites on flexible substrates, followed by a chemical reduction. The devices display high volumetric capacitances (258.5 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1 for sandwich-structured ones and 554 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1 for interdigitated ones) and excellent cycling retention (2000 cycles >90%). Moreover, at the bending state, there are no significant changes on the device capacitances, indicating their great flexibility. The high-performance devices can be further designed to produce special geometries and patterns. The work may provide a novel strategy to fabricate RGO@PANI composite-based supercapacitors, which allows the end users to precisely deposit active materials according to their designs, for miniature and wearable electronics.
