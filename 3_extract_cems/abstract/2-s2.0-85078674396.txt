The rational design of advanced structures consisting of multiple components with excellent electrochemical capacitive properties is one of the crucial hindrances to be overcome for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, a superfast and facile synthesis of flower-like NiMn-layered double hydroxides (NiMn-LDH) with high SC performance using an electrodeposition process on nickel foam is proposed. Oxygen vacancies are then modulated via mild H2O2 treatment for the first time, significantly promoting the electrochemical energy storage performance. The oxygen-vacancy abundant NiMn-LDH (Ov-LDH) reaches a maximum specific capacity of 1183 C g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and retains a high capacity retention of 835 C g−1 even at a current density of up to 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric SC device achieves a high specific energy density of 46.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.7 kW kg−1. Oxygen vacancies are proven to play a vital role in the improvement of electrochemistry performance of LDH based on experimental and theoretical studies. This vacancy engineering strategy provides a new insight into SC active materials and should be beneficial for the design of the next generation of energy storage devices.
