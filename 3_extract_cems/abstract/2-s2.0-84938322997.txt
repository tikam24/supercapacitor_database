Abstract In this work, we present a simple but efficient template carbonization method to convert 1,4-dichlorobenzene (p-DCB) into nanoporous carbon materials, using commercial available Mg(OH)<inf>2</inf> as template. The resulting carbon exhibits a large BET surface area of 1204.5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, and high pore volume of 2.03 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. More importantly, a novel redox active electrolyte of p-phenylenediamine (PPD) with quick reversible Faradaic process is introduced into the KOH electrolyte, forming PPD-KOH mixture electrolyte, to largely improve the electrochemical performance. As a result, the specific capacitance of the carbon sample obtained by adding 12 mmol PPD into 6 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH can reach up to 501.4 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 3 A g<sup>-1</sup>, which is almost 4.21 times than that of the pristine one (âˆ¼119.2 F g<sup>-1</sup>). Besides, it revealed that the PPD concentration in KOH electrolyte also plays a crucial role in determining the supercapacitor performance. The present redox active electrolyte of PPD is highly promising for producing superior electrochemical performance of supercapacitors.
