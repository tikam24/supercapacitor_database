In this work, we are reporting the synthesis of MoS2 nanoparticles prepared using hydrothermal method at 180 Â°C. We have characterized the phase, morphology, composition, using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy techniques. We have fabricated two electrodes for electrochemical testing by loading MoS2 nanoparticles onto (i) bare carbon paper, and (ii) Cu electrodeposited carbon paper. We found that copper interlayer addition increases the electronic conductivity which, in turns, increases the surface energy of the electrocatalyst, leading to an increase in cycle life. Further, the copper interlayer increases the number of active sites via increase of Mo3+ at the catalyst surface.
