Graphene(RGO)/MnO2/[N-butyl-3,6-carbazolevinylene-alt-(2,5-dioctyloxy)-p-phenylenevinylene] (PPH-CAR) ternary nanocomposite is fabricated by a simple two-step method, which includes electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) and oxidation of Mn(CH3COO)2 simultaneously and an ultrathin PPH-CAR layer coated on the RGO/MnO2 surface. The structure of the composite is investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The results suggest that the composite is correctly synthesized and each component has good dispersion. Cycle voltammetry (CV), charge and discharge measurements and cycle stability test are used to evaluate its electrochemical performance. Because of the synergistic effect of each component, the composite exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with specific capacitance of 175 F/g, which is a 46% increase compared with RGO/MnO2. Moreover, it reveals outstanding cycling performance with more than 90% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles. Such ternary composite is a candidate for high performance supercapacitors with great promise. Â© 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.
