The realization of future energy based on safe, clean, sustainable, and economically viable technologies is one of the grand challenges faced by modern society. Electrochemical energy technologies underpin the potential success of this effort to divert energy sources away from fossil fuels, whether one considers alternative energy conversion strategies through photoelectrochemical (PEC) production of chemical fuels or fuel cells run with sustainable hydrogen, or energy storage strategies, such as in batteries and supercapacitors. This dissertation builds on recent advances in nanomaterials design, synthesis, and characterization to develop novel electrodes that can electrochemically convert and store energy. With the improvement of global economy, the fatigue of energy becomes inevitable in the twenty-first century. It is expected that the increase in world energy requirements will be triple at the end of this century. Thus, there is an imperative need for the development of renewable energy sources and storage systems.
