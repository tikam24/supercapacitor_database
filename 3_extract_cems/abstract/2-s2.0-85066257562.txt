Wood is an ideal type of support material whose porous structure and surface functional groups are beneficial for deposition of various guest substances for different applications. In this paper, wood is employed as a porous support, combined with two kinds of conductive polymers (i.e., polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole (PPy)) using an easy and fast liquid polymerization method. Scanning electron microscope observations indicate that the PANI-PPy complex consists of nanoparticles with a size of ~20 nm. The interactions between oxygencontaining groups of the wood and the nitrogen composition of PANI-PPy were verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The self-supported PANI-PPy/ wood composite is capable of acting as a free-standing supercapacitor electrode, which delivers a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 360 F·g-1 at 0.2 A·g-1.
