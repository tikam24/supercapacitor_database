A simple, effective, eco-friendly, and scalable reduced graphene oxide embedding strategy is developed to construct self-supported carbon electrode material networks for supercapacitors from a naturally occurring biomaterialâˆ’bacterial cellulose. The thus-engineered self-supported carbon nanofibril networks exhibit superior supercapacitive performance compared to their counterparts, thus opening up an avenue to design self-supported high-capacitance carbon electrode materials toward high-class supercapacitors.
