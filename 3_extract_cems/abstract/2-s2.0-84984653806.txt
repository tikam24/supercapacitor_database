This paper studies the electrochemical behaviors of symmetric supercapacitors with the porous carbon obtained from chestnut shells as active materials and ionic liquids as electrolytes, including 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide (EMImTF2N), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4) and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMImBF4). Experimental data observed at a current density of 0.1 A/g showed that symmetric supercapacitor using EMImBF4 as the electrolyte had the maximum specific capacitance of 208.7 F/g, while 180.8 F/g for EMImTF2N and 134.6 F/g for BMImBF4. However, specific capacitance of supercapacitors assembled with EMImBF4, EMImTF2N and BMImBF4 respectively retained 62.9%, 94.5% and 71.5% of the initial values after 2000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The relationship between the molecular structure of ionic liquids and electrochemical properties of the supercapacitors was discussed based on the experimental data.
