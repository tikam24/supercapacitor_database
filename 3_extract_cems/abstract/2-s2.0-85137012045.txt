Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) feature high surface area, diverse functional sites and ultra-high porosity, offering great opportunities as multifunctional platforms for the development of MOF-derived heteroatom-doped nanoarchitectures. The designable functionality of MOF-derived heteroatom-doped nanoarchitectures hold particular promise for electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, the underlying mechanism and selection criteria for MOF-derived heteroatom-doped nanoarchitectures remain unclear in EES applications, hindering further development of new MOF-derived chemistries. Here, instead of simply summarizing recent progress, we critically summarize the research progress of MOF-derived heteroatom-doped nanoarchitectures for EES since 2014, including heteroatom-doped metal compound nanoarchitectures and heteroatom-doped carbon nanoarchitectures. Their applications in supercapacitors (SCs), alkali (Li, Na, K)-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs), and zinc–air batteries (ZABs) are discussed in detail, with special attention to their structure–performance relationships and existing issues. Moreover, some representative design strategies are highlighted, which provide new routes for overcoming existing limitations. Finally, the challenges and prospects of MOF-derived heteroatom-doped nanoarchitectures for EES are presented.
