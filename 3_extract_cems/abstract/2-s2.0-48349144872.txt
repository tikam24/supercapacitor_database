How to distribute the power between battery bank and supercapacitor modules to obtain good performance is a vital problem in dual-source electric vehicles. Traditional fuzzy controller design for energy management relies too much on the expert experience, and is easy to get the sub-optimal performance. In order to overcome this drawback, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is introduced for energy management fuzzy controller design in dual-source propelled electric vehicles. In the paper, based on the systemic analysis of the power in energy storage system (ESS), the drag power the vehicle encounters and the constraints the ESS should obey, the mathematic model of energy management problem is established. Then, different operation modes of dual-source ESS are presented and so is the design of conventional fuzzy controller. Followingly, we show how to use PSO method to better the fuzzy control. Finally, compared to the traditional fuzzy control strategy, we carry on some simulations in ADVISOR software. The results show the validity of the proposed strategy. Â© 2007 IEEE.
