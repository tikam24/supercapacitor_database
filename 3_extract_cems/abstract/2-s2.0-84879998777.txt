The power generated by wave energy has the problem of variable amplitude and frequency which makes it impossible to connect to power grid directly. The paper presents a wave power generation which connected to grid composed of permanent magnetic linear generator(PMLG), generator side converter, grid side converter, controller and grid. Control strategies basing on back to back converter structure was proposed: vector decoupling control was used to generator side converter aiming at maximum power extraction from wave energy; Grid voltage oriented control is used to grid side converter in order to make the current sinusoidal and realize unit power factor control. Since the DC link voltage has fluctuation using traditional method, a method with power feed forward was proposed to keep the DC link voltage stable and improve the dynamic response of the system. A simulation model was built for the whole system and simulation results verify that the proposed power electronic converter structure and control strategy are feasible and effective.
