Two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks and nanoflowers of the MoS2 form a composite structure as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor application. MoS2 expands in the accordion-type Ni-MOF layers, and -S- joins the two materials to form a Ni-MOF coating MoS2 composite structure. The composite material MoS2@Ni-MOF combines the structural characteristics of the Ni-MOF and MoS2, and effectively improves the electrochemical performance. The basic skeleton structure of the MoS2@Ni-MOF material remains unchanged, showing a remarkable specific capacitance of 1590.24 F·g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A·g−1 and an excellent cycle stability (retention rate of 87.97% after 20,000 cycles at current of 5.0 A·g−1). Due to the special composite structure of MoS2@Ni-MOF, the as-assembled MoS2@Ni-MOF//AC assymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device exhibits a maximum energy density of 72.93 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 375 W·Kg−1. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that the MoS2@Ni-MOF has potential applications in energy storage devices.
