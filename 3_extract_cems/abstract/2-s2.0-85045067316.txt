We report supercapacitors based on thiolated-graphene (T-graphene) with stable charging and discharging performance at high current density. The T-graphene was synthesized using low cost NaSH as a reducing agent to reduce graphene oxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies reveal that NaSH is an effective reducing agent in removing oxygen containing groups from graphene oxide. The highly reduced T-graphene with a C/O ratio of 28 was used as the supercapacitor electrode material. At a current density of 2.5 Ag-1, the T-graphene supercapacitor exhibited an electrochemical capacitance of 195 Fg-1, a power density of 4.3 kWkg−1and an energy density of 83.4 Whkg−1. The time required to discharge 83.4Whkg−1 at 2.5 Ag-1 is around 69 s. At a current density of 7.5 Ag-1, the cell exhibited a specific capacitance of about 137 Fg-1 and retained 98% of its initial capacitance value after 10,000 cycles. This superior performance of supercapacitor can be ascribed to highly reduced and porous T-graphene with minimum restacking due to its crumpled nature. The resulting supercapacitors having stable performance at high current density are suitable for fast charging-discharging applications.
