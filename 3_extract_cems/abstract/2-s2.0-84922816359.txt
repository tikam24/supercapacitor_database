A conventional but simple fabrication technique of activated carbon/graphene (AC/G) supercapacitor electrode will be presented in this work. The AC/G electrode was prepared using slurry technique from the mixture of AC and graphene powders, polytetrafluoroethylene as binder and N-methylpyrrolidone as solvent. The AC/G electrode was dried at 120°C in vacuum oven for 6 h followed by immersing in 1M lithium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte for another 6 h. The specific gravimetric capacitance of the electrode was calculated to be 19·45 F g-1 using cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1. Electrochemical behaviour including charge discharge and impedance characteristics confirmed the electrode's ability as a possible active material for use in carbon based supercapacitor.
