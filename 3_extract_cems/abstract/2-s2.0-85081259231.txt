Carbonaceous architectures are ideal candidates for sustainable energy applications, in which the major concern is how to cost-efficiently construct high-quality carbon products with remarkable electroactivity. Herein, we demonstrate a universal hybrid strategy using boric acid crystals as an intercalator, template, and boron dopant to conveniently regulate the morphology/structure/component toward layered carbon materials (copolymer-, glucose-, and lignosulfonate-based carbons). Compared with the other two carbon materials, the copolymer derived B/N codoped carbon (LDC) exhibits competitive overall performance (255.5 and 206.1 F g-1 at 0.5 and 100 A g-1, 91.2% retention over 10â€»000 cycles). To highlight, the LDC-based quasi-solid symmetric supercapacitor (SC) using neutral gel electrolyte delivers a quite high energy density of 19.8 Wh kg-1 (â&circ;¼2.8 times that of LDC//PVA/KOH (gel)//LDC SC, 7.2 Wh kg-1), and long durability over 10â€»000 cycles. This study provides a universal strategy to prepare high-activity layered carbons and highlights that the synergy between the advanced electrode material and suitable electrolyte may give a new perspective on clean electrochemical energy.
