Aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) display excellent promise in energy storage technologies due to their integration merits with batteries and supercapacitors and their intrinsic safety. However, it is an important task to develop high-performance cathode materials for ZHSCs. Herein, we assembled a ZHSC by using N-doped porous carbon derived from a zinc-based metal–organic framework (MOF, ZIF-8) as the cathode and zinc as the anode. The assembled ZHSC could deliver a maximum energy density of 121.2 W h kg−1 and excellent power density of 16 kW kg−1, and long-term cycling life with 75% capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles at the current density of 1A g−1. Impressively, the assembled flexible ZHSCs could withstand various angle deformations and drive LED indicators lightning, exhibiting an application promising in wearable electronics.
