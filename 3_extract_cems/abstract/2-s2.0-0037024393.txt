A novel class of electrochemical supercapacitor electrode material has been electrochemically synthesized from a manganese halide complex in water-containing acetonitrile electrolyte at room temperature. This material has been physically and chemically characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), FT-Raman microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. XPS and FT-Raman characterization suggest that this material is composed of manganese oxide with a chemical composition of Mn3O4 and containing a moderate amount of carbon. Cyclic voltammetric characterization indicates that this material has higher electronic conductivity than usually seen for manganese oxide and that it shows fast kinetics for the charge-discharge process in both aqueous and acetonitrile electrolytes. The material provides a large pseudocapacitance over a potential window of about 1 V in aqueous electrolyte and about 2 V in acetonitrile electrolyte. It is therefore a good candidate as a material for an electrochemical supercapacitor electrode. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
