The proceedings contain 27 papers. The topics discussed include: deposition of Au/TiO2 nanocomposite on ITO surface by seed-mediated liquid phase deposition method; surface compositional, structural and optical properties of nanohybrid TiO2/ZnO coated silicone surface; supercapacitor electrodes from activated carbon monoliths and carbon nanotubes; performance enhancement of hybrid solar cells via surface modification with diluted P3HT; electrochemical effect of different modified glassy carbon electrodes on the values of diffusion coefficient for some heavy metal ions; immobilization of silver-based bimetallic nanoparticles on titania-support for photocatalysis; analysis of nanoparticle additive couple stress fluids in three-layered journal bearing; guided modes in uniaxial chiral waveguide of circular cross-section under PEC boundary; and a theoretical model of all-optical switching induced by a soliton pulse in nano-waveguide ring resonator.
