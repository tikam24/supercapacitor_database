A composite material, Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3(OH)2, is synthesized by chemical precipitation method for supercapacitors' electrode material. Physical characterizations using x-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive x-ray, and scanning electron microscopy show that Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3(OH)2 possesses an amorphous structure and higher specific surface area (268. 5 m2 g-1), which lead to a high initial specific capacitance of 1,403 F g-1 in the potential window of 0-1. 5 V. It may be a potential electrode material for future supercapacitor when its cycling stability and rate performance are addressed. Â© 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
