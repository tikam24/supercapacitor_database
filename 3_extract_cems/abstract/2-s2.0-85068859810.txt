The current work presents a hybrid type of energy storage device composed of both graphene foam and zinc oxide electrodes, which exhibits both the electrochemical performance of a supercapacitor with a relatively higher power density, and a battery with a relatively higher energy density as compared to each individual component as single devices. Te hybrid's improved performance was correlated to the defective structure of the electrodes. To enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, it is necessary to have a well-defined mass, shape, and surface area of electrode materials. Here, we present an original design of a mounting device that enabled precisely determining all the critical parameters of electrode materials for a particular mass and surface area. With the aid of our original setup, we produced a supercapacitor device that could also act as a battery due to its high energy density values, hence we named it as superbat. In this work, 3D graphene foam was used as the first electrode due to its large surface, while for the second electrode, ZnO nanocrystals were used due its defective structure. Paramagnetic resonance Raman and impedance spectroscopy were performed in order to understand the origin of the performance of the hybrid capacitor in more depth. In particular, we obtained a high specific capacitance value (C = 448 F g-1), which was exceptionally related not only to the quality of the synthesis but also the choice of electrode and electrolyte materials. Moreover, each component used in the construction of the hybrid supercapacitor also played a key role in to achieving high capacitance value. The results demonstrated the remarkable performance and stability of the superbat.
