In this paper, criteria for better selection of a supercapacitor through EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) experiments are presented. The performance characteristics of a supercapacitor are thoroughly analyzed in terms of losses and available energy to select the optimal product. The validity of the proposed criteria is demonstrated through the computer simulations and experiments on a fuel cell vehicle using a supercapacitor module with the FTP-72 urban dynamometer driving schedule.
