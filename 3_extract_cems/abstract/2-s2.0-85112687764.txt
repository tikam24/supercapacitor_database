Nanostructured cobalt oxide films have been prepared by a simple and cost-effective chemical spray pyrolysis. The effect of the quantity of the spraying solution for various film properties has been studied. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that Co3O4 thin films are cubic in nature with strong (311) orientation. SEM images show a porous morphology. Optical band gap energies are between 1.41 and 1.48 eV in the lower and 1.84–2.02 eV in the higher energy regions, respectively. Specific capacitance is 565 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1. Specific energy 57.50 Whkg−1, specific power 1.8 kWkg−1 and columbic efficiency 89.15% are found from galvanostatic charge/discharge studies. Such unique nanostructures delivered adequate active sites for redox reaction resulting in enhanced electrochemical behaviour. These findings suggest a favourable route towards the fabrication of electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
