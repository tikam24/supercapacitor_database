The development approach for an energy storage system with supercapacitors in the DC link of the drive unit in machine tools is focused on its optimal sizing in consideration of peak power reducing and energy efficiency improvement. The required change of parameters for the DC link voltage control was taken into account. The energy consumption of an electric drive with and without the energy storage system was investigated by means of experimental energy measurements and simulations of the energy consumption in Matlab/SimPowerSystem.
