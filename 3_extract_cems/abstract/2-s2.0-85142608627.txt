The enhanced application performance of hollow-structured materials is attributed to their large surface area with more active sites. In this work, the hollow CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes with increased surface area and mesopores were derived from dense CoSn(OH)6 nanocube precursors by alkaline etching. As a result, the hollow CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes-based cathode electrode exhibited a higher area-specific capacitance of 85.56 µF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2 and a mass-specific capacitance of 5.35 mF g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2, which was more extensive than that of the dense precursor. Meanwhile, the current density was increased 4-fold with good rate capability for hollow CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes.
