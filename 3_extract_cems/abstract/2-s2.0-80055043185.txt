A self-assembly approach is used to fabricate a hierarchical nanostructure using functionalized carbon spheres as nano-spacers to separate graphene nanosheets. The nanostructure significantly enhances capacitance of a graphene supercapacitor by more than 70%, while providing a universal method to self-assembling various carbons into hierarchical structures for energy conversion/storage systems.
