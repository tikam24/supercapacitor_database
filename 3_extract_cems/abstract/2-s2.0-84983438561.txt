Nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) nanorods with different aspect ratios have been successfully prepared by facile synthetic method from nickel-cobalt-oxalato complex as a single-source precursor without using any template. The as-prepared complex itself exhibits nanorod morphology due to its polymeric chain-like structure, which under calcination process converted into nickel cobaltite retaining its one-dimensional morphology. The growth of nanorods has a major dependence upon factors such as molar ratios of Ni- and Co-salts, reaction temperature, duration and pH of the medium. The nanorod morphology is expected to provide better electronic transportation in compared to zerodimensional nanomaterials. Accordingly, NiCo2O4 nanorods upon exploitation as electrode material in supercapacitor and lithium ion battery applications showed good electrochemical performances. As supercapacitor, they exhibited large charge storage capacity with the specific capacitance value of ∼200 F g-1 at a current rate of 1 A g-1 and good cyclic stability. The material also demonstrated a capacity as high as ∼600 mAh g-1 and a progressive capacity 400 mAh g-1 after 25 cycles while deployed as an anode material in lithium ion battery applications.
