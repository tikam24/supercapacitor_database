Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in order to modify it physico-chemical properties in an effort to improve its electrochemical performance. In this study, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS was controlled through post-solvent treatment in DMSO for various dipping times. The maximum conductivity of the DMSO-treated PEDOT:PSS electrode was ∼1890 S cm-1. The electrical conductivity, PEDOT to PSS ratio, chemical compositions, wettability, and surface roughness are correlated and suitably explained. The supercapacitive performance of the DMSO-treated PEDOT:PSS electrodes was studied in 1 M H2SO4 within an optimized potential window of 0 to -0.6 V versus Ag/AgCl. The maximum specific capacitance of the PEDOT:PSS electrode treated in DMSO for 60 min was found to be ∼153 F g-1 at a 1 mA cm-2 discharge current density (∼145 F g-1 at a 10 mV s-1 scan rate), along with an energy density of 93 W h kg-1 and a power density of 4.6 kW kg-1.
