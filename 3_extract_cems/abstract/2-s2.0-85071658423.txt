With the increasingly widespread use of supercapacitor energy storage system for urban rail transit, its life expectancy has attracted great attention. Since the lifetime of the supercapacitor (SC) is closely related to the voltage, current, and temperature it withstands, a new state of health (SOH) estimation model of SC is proposed based on the electric and thermal models of the SC and accelerated life testing at high temperatures. First, the SC was charged and discharged by a constant current through the Arbin instrument to identify parameters of electrical and thermal models. Based on the current curve under a typical condition of a Beijing subway line, an accelerated cycle life test was performed on the SC in a temperature chamber at 80℃ and the capacity C was monitored. After 587 cycles, the capacity C is reduced to 96.02% of the initial value. The parameters of the SOH estimation model are calculated according to the testing results. The equivalent circuit model and the thermal model are used to simulate the SOH of the SC. Meanwhile, the capacity C and equivalent series resistance (ESR) are fed back in real-time to correct the model parameters. Finally, a high temperature accelerated life test was conducted in a temperature chamber at 90℃. The maximum error of capacity C between the experimental results and the simulation results is less than 2%, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed SOH estimation model.
