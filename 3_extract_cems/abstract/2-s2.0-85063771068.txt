The ever-increasing demand for flexible/wearable electronic devices has stimulated the rapid development of flexible supercapacitors with enhanced electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility. Graphene-based materials are promising candidates for high-performance flexible supercapacitor electrodes due to their large surface area, high conductivity, low weight and superior mechanical flexibility. In this review, after a brief introduction, we mainly discuss different strategies to enhance performances of graphene-based electrode in recent years. Their fabrication process and electrochemical performances are discussed and compared. Then two types of flexible supercapacitors, namely, fiber-type supercapacitor and micro-supercapacitor, are also discussed in detail. We also present our point of view in our discussion.
