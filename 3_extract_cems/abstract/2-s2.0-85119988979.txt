Based on the preparation principle of self-supporting electrodes, a self-supporting electrode based on carbon fiber surface Cu(OH)2 nanostructures was prepared by electrochemical deposition combined with (NH4)2S2O8 and NaOH deposition solution for surface treatment. The electrochemical performance of the electrochemical substance MnO2 attached to its surface was analyzed by the hydrothermal reaction. The microscopic morphology of the carbon fiber surface, the composition and distribution of surface elements and the crystalline form of the surface substance were tested. It was found that when the concentration of (NH4)2S2O8 is 0.43 g/L, the concentration of NaOH is 30.48 g/L and the treatment time is 12 min, the diameter, length and quantity of Cu(OH)2 nano-fibers on the surface of the carbon fiber are more suitable for SEM observation; The test results of XPS, XRD and EDS show that the elemental copper on the surface of the carbon fiber is converted to Cu(OH)2 after being treated by the deposition solution; Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) test results show that the electrode material has extremely fast charge and discharge speed. The structure is very conducive to the loading of electrochemical substances, and results in the open, high-performance electrode material with a core-shell structure. The Cu(OH)2 nanofibers are successfully grown on the surface of copper layer on the surface of carbon fiber for the first time, which opens up a new electrode preparation method for the performance improvement and commercial application of energy equipment represented by supercapacitors in the future.
