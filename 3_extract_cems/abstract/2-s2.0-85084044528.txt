Supercapacitor (SC) assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) is a very low-frequency DC-DC converter technique, with high end-to-end efficiency, where the load receives a high slew rate capable low noise output of a linear regulator. This technique can be easily extended with a transformer isolated input stage to achieve the 48-V DC rack power architecture proposed by Google recently. One specific advantage of this new design approach is the two-stage DC-UPS capability by over-sizing the SC bank. In this new SCALDO-derived technique with transformer isolation, by inserting an SC in the input side of the converter, energy transfer towards the load side occurs at a higher frequency, in a combination of forward and flyback modes to reduce the overall volume of the converter. The paper details the magnetics design aspects of the technique providing experimental results of a proof of concept prototype.
