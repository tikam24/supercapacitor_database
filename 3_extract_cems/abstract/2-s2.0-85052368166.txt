A Mn3O4 nanocrystals@reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (MRNC) is prepared using a hydrothermal method. Structural analysis of the synthesized MRNC shows the formation of tetragonal hausmannite phase of Mn3O4 nanocrystals and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheet/scrolls. As electrode material for supercapacitors, MRNC reaches a specific capacitance of 611 F g−1 with excellent stability showing a cycling stability of 95 % after 3000 cycles. In addition, polypyrrole (PPy) films with various thicknesses are deposited on flexible carbon fiber via electrodeposition method. A solid state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on MRNC as positive and PPy as negative electrode was assembled. The assembled ASC delivers a maximum energy density and power density of 32 Wh kg−1 and 833 W kg−1, respectively, with excellent cycling stability (90 % capacitance retention after 6000 cycles). The result reveals that the MRNC is a promising candidate as superior electrode material for supercapacitors.
