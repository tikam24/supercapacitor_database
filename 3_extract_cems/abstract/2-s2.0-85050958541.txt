Based on high power density and fast charging and discharging rate of Supercapacitor, the hybrid power system of lithium battery and Supercapacitor dual power source is proposed and designed. And the energy management strategy based on fuzzy PID algorithm is studied to realize the power distribution between Supercapacitor and lithium battery. The results of simulation show that power allocation is reasonable, and Supercapacitor can satisfy the demand of the instantaneous dynamic loading, at the same time it undertakes most of the current fluctuations, thus protecting the lithium battery.
