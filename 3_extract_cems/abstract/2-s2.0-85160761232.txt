This chapter discusses and elaborates on the current progress and development of ceramics-based electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. A supercapacitor (SC) is considered one of the best energy storage devices because of its rapid charge storage capability, long cycle life, elevated power density, and ecological affability. Major research has been focused on the development of nanoscale electrode materials to make cost-effective, efficient, and stable electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Ceramic electrode materials are one of the suitable candidates for SC electrodes. The small surface area and comparatively stumpy surface action are the main parameters, which rigorously obstruct the SC performance of ceramic-based electrode materials. Thus, optimization of the methods used and in-depth investigations of ceramic electrodes are crucial factors in facilitating excellent electrical conductivity and charge transfer capability in them. This chapter discusses the latest developments of ceramic-based electrodes for SCs including transition metal oxide-based ceramics, multielemental metal oxide ceramics, metal hydroxide ceramics, metal sulfide ceramics, carbon-based ceramics, and transition metal carbide and nitride ceramics. Further, factors that influence the basic structural design of ceramic-based electrodes are elaborated. The present technological and methodological confronts, and perceptions of ceramic materials for SC devices are also explained in this chapter.
