This study presents an undoped and Ag doped Polyaniline (PANI) thin films deposited on stainless steel substrates by a sonochemical method via dip coating technique. In order to study the doping effect on the specific capacitance of PANI the concentration of Ag is varied from 0.3 to 1.2 weight percent. Energy dispersion X-ray techniques are used for the phase identification and determination of the doping content in the PANI films. Surface morphology of the films is examined by Field Emission scanning electron microscopy which revealed nanofiber like structure for undoped PANI and well distributed nanofibers with bright spots of Ag particles for the Ag doped PANI films. There is decrease in room temperature electrical resistivity of the Ag doped PANI films of the order of 102 with increasing Ag concentration. The supercapacitive behavior of the electrodes is tested in a three electrode system using 1.0 M H 2SO4 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance value of 512 Fg-1 is observed for the 0.9 weight percent Ag doped PANI film owing to the synergic effect of PANI and silver nanoparticles.
