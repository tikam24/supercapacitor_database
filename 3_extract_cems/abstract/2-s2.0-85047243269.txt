Carbon materials derived from pollen for supercapacitor electrode are feasibly prepared through a hydrothermal process with controlled content of ammonium borofruoride (NH4BF4) and subsequent carbonization. The effect of NH4BF4 on the morphology, microstructure, chemical state, texture structure and the electrochemical performance of the products are studied. It is found that the sample treated by 0.015 g ml−1 NH4BF4 during the hydrothermal process shows the highest specific surface area of 526 m2 g−1 as well as the largest specific capacitance of 205 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH solution [128% of the sample hydrothermal treated without NH4BF4 (161 F g−1) at the same specific current]. The cycle measurement demonstrates the excellent cycling stability of CH-0.015, while 96.2% of its initial capacitance can be retained after 10000 cycles. Furthermore, the contribution of electrical double-layer capacitance and the pseudocapacitance of the samples is uncovered.
