The composites of NiCo 2 O 4 /graphene oxide nanosheets(NiCo 2 O 4 /GO) were prepared through a facile hydrothermal route followed by calcination. The morphology and microstructure of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that the composite materials showed a sea urchin-like structure. Electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. In comparison with pure NiCo 2 O 4 , the specific capacity and rate performance of the as-made NiCo 2 O 4 /GO composites were significantly improved. This is mainly attributed to the high-density porous structures of the NiCo 2 O 4 /GO nanocomposites that were formed during the fabrication process. The NiCo 2 O 4 /GO composites showed good cyclic performance and coulomb efficiency with a specific capacitance over 650 F/g at a current density of 0.5 to 3.0 A/g,therefore they can be considered as a fine electrode material for surpercapactiors.
