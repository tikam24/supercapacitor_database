MnO2 nanosheets were prepared by hydrothermal deposition method, and supported on biomass-derived crosslinked carbon nanosheets to form a composite material (MnO2@R). First, rambutan peels were synthesized into porous carbon by pyrolysis and activation, and then MnO2 was fixed on the carbon nanosheets by hydrothermal deposition method. The MnO2@R composite material and nitrogen-doped porous carbon were assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor. Among them, MnO2@R composite material and nitrogen-doped rambutan peel-derived porous carbon were used as positive electrode and negative electrode. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor has excellent cycle stability. After 5000 cycles under 0.5 A gâˆ’1, its capacitance loss is only 12%. The asymmetric supercapacitors found in these studies have excellent energy and power density characteristics, which opens up application prospects for biomass carbon-derived composite materials.
