Herein, a flexible, durable, and high-performance cotton-based electrode was fabricated by in-situ polymerized polyaniline (PANI) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) coating. MXene, as a conductive material, improved the conductivity of the PANI/Cotton composites significantly, which could promote electrochemical performance. The fabricated MXene/PANI@Cotton electrode displays a high capacitance of 1027.5 mF cm−2 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2 and stable capacitance retention. At the same time, the flexible supercapacitor based on the MXene/PANI@Cotton electrodes shows high electrochemical performance and excellent stability under bending.
