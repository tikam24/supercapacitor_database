Business costs, environmental and energy concerns have increased interest in biomass materials for the production of porous carbon materials, especially as solid-state adsorbents for CO2 capture or as electrode materials for supercapacitors. We put forward an efficient and scalable approach to convert mangosteen peel (MP) waste into three-dimensional microporous carbon frameworks (3D-MP-CFW) for effective CO2 capture and supercapacitors. The MP waste is first subjected to a controllable hydrothermal treatment in alkaline solution and then a carbonization process. The resultant optimal carbon sample possesses a high surface area up to 1270 m2 g-1 and abundant micropores with fine micropore sizes below 1 nm. The typical sample has a well-tailored open 3D macroporous interconnected network structure, exhibiting an outstanding CO2 capture recyclability and high CO2 capture capacities of 6.93 and 4.77 mmol g-1 at 0 °C and 25 °C (1 bar), respectively. Simultaneously, benefiting from its high surface area and 3D interconnected porous structure, this optimal sample also exhibits a good supercapacitance performance with the specific capacitance of 240 F g-1 (in 6 M KOH, at 1 A g-1) in a three-electrode system. Our simple preparation method presents an efficient way to make promising carbon materials for high-performance CO2 capture and supercapacitors.
