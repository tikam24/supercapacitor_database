The large amount of graphene oxide was prepared by modified Hummers method, and which was then characterized by FT-Raman, FT-IR spectroscopy. Also the supercapacitor behavior of graphene oxide was studied ionic liquid. Here we observed that the graphene oxide shows best supercapacitor behavior in ionic liquid. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
