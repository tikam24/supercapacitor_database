Hydrogen peroxide was used as oxidizing agent in the preparation of graphite oxide to improve the Hummers method. The aim is to support and increase the reactivity without affecting the yield product. The graphite oxide was exposed to microwave to get a microwave reduced graphite oxide (MrGO) usually contains some functional groups containing oxygen. Both cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties. Results show a maximum specific capacitance of 302 F/g at scan rate of 1 mV/s and exhibit excellent cycling retention 120.8% after 1000 cycles at 200 mV/s by using aqueous electrolyte (1 M H2SO4) at room temperature. In addition, the energy density could reach 25.94 Wh/kg and power density 1.734 kW/kg at a current density of 3 A/g. The supercapacitor electrode prepared from MrGO material shows a pseudocapactive performance attributed to the redox reactions between the protons form the acidic electrolyte and the remaining oxygen-functional groups.
