Hydrogen is often used as the abundant and pollution-free power source for the future. Hydrogen fuel cells are efficient to solve the problem of intermittency that plagues electricity generation from renewable sources such as wind and solar. The electricity is efficient in producing hydrogen and generating electricity from renewables is expensive. The prototype Bora has an electric motor powered by a hydrogen fuel cell and incorporates a supercapacitor that recovers efficiently the energy used in braking in order to overcome the problem of poor acceleration associated with electric vehicles. In electric motors the torque reaches its maximum advance as soon as the motor is switched on, the car also offers good performance at lower speeds.
