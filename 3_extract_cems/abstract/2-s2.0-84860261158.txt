Graphene nanosheets-poly(o-aminophenol) (POAP/GNS) nanocomposite was fabricated on a platinum surface by potential cycling. Voltammograms of the POAP/GNS/Pt electrode showed an excellent capacitive behavior accompanied with a redox transition with a mid-peak potential of 295 mV. The POAP/GNS nanocomposite displayed a specific capacitance as high as 281.1 F g -1 at 0.1 A g -1 which is almost three times higher than that of pure graphene. The specific energy and power of the nanocomposite material were 25.0 Wh kg -1 and 34.8 W kg -1, respectively. The nanocomposite retained more than 99% of the initial capacitance after 1200 charge/discharge cycles. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
