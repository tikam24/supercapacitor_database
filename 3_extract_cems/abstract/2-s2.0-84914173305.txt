Graphene oxide-V2O5 composite nanofibers were synthesized for potential application in supercapacitors. Graphene oxide was prepared by the modified Hummers method and the synthesized graphene oxide was washed with acid and base to reduce the agglomeration. The graphene oxide/vanadium pentoxide nanofibers were prepared by the electrospinning technique. The synthesized nanofibers were characterized with XRD, SEM, TGA and FTIR. The electrochemical characteristics of the nanofibers were investigated through electrochemical cyclic voltammetry test. The results showed that graphene oxide-V2O5 composite nanofibers exhibit the better capacitive behavior with better reversible charging/discharging ability and higher capacitance values, compared to pure V2O5 electrodes.
