The area of conductive/electroactive polymers, pioneered in a large part by Prof. Lenz, has both realized successes and tremendous future potential application. In the first part of the talk, the 12-year history of a project that involved the replacement of Chromium VI with a electroactive polymeric material, Poly(bis-N-hexyl, N-methyl amino-(phenylene vinylene)) (BAMPPV) for aluminum conversion coatings will be reviewed. Results from first small scale synthesis up through and including current field testing will be presented, as well as other applications of this material. In the second part of the talk, the current state-of-the-art of electroactive polymer supercapacitors will be examined and discussed. The design parameters and potential output (peak power and energy) of a hybrid battery/supercapacitor system will be evaluated in terms of the duty cycle for several battery systems. The power and energy output limits of a hybrid device will be presented.
