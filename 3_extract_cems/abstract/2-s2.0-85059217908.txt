The electrochemical performance of carbon cloth directly relates to its surface area and porosity, and the functional groups of the primary carbon fibers. In this study, after rationally functionalizing a carbon cloth fiber surface with 3D porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber layers, the resultant 3D hierarchical porous nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers/carbon cloth negative electrode exhibits superior supercapacitive performance due to its large surface area, suitable porosity, nitrogen-doped carbon surface and fast electron transportation. This electrode delivers high areal capacitance of 608 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and good cycle life (capacitance retention of 99% after the 5000th cycle). An asymmetric supercapacitor device is also assembled by using NiO@carbon nanofibers/carbon cloth as the positive electrode and nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers/carbon cloth as the negative electrode, which exhibits high energy density of 19.5 W h kg−1 at 4.1 kW kg−1
