Graphene oxide hydrogel is used as a reactive template to prepare nanoporous materials with a 3D microstructure. The as-prepared porous MnO2 shows a capacitance retention of ∼70.6% at a current density as high as 15 A g−1, resulting from the 3D interconnected ion transport channel replicated from the graphene oxide hydrogel. © 2013 Royal Society of Chemistry.
