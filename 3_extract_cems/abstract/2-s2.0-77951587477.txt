Paper describes a novel supercapacitor based approach to recover the wasted energy in linear regulators. In this US patent pending technique, a single supercapacitor or an array of supercapacitors could be coupled with a linear series or shunt regulator, where the supercapacitors are charged by the input current of the regulator. This supercapacitor technique, by maintaining the dropout voltage limit before a new capacitor is placed in the series path, recovers the energy and does not use the supercapacitors for voltage conversion. Average efficiency of the overall circuit is improved by a significant amount, while maintaining the useful hall marks of a linear regulator. An example of a 12 to 5 volt proof of concept circuit is detailed with an overall efficiency improvement from 42% to over 78%. The technique is versatile, and, can be developed further to compete with the higher efficiency switching power supplies. Â©2009 IEEE.
