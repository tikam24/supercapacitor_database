Binder-free PANI-g-MWCNT/VOGN/Graphite sheet electrode with very high surface area and excellent capacitive behavior was fabricated through the anodizing of the graphite Followed by electrodeposition and polymerization. The prepared samples were investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, Dispersive Raman Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller). SEM and AFM images showed that the polyaniline was successfully grafted onto the MWCNTs. The BET test represented that created VOGN increased the surface area of the graphite sheet. The energy storage performance of the fabricated electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The PANI-g-MWCNT/VOGN/Graphite sheet electrodes showed a very high capacitance of about 880 F g−1 at a current density of 1.5 A g−1, an excellent energy density of 68.4 mWh g−1, the power density of 895.4 mW g−1, and stable capacity of about 80.6% after 10,000 cycles in the charge/discharge process. To show the fabricated supercapacitor device's practical application, we made a solid-state supercapacitor separated by PVA/H2SO4 that exhibited high electrochemical performance. The observed superior capacity of the fabricated PANI-g-MWCNT/VOGN/Graphite sheet electrode can be attributed to the increased surface area by the VOGN layer and the synergistic effect of PANI-grafted-MWCNT.
