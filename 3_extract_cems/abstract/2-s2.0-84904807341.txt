In this study, a simple and cost effective one-pot hydrothermal process has been carried out for the synthesis of 1D CoMoO4·0.75H 2O nanorods. A binary composite of CoMoO4·0. 75H2O/PANI has also been synthesized by the in situ oxidative polymerization of aniline with virgin CoMoO4·0.75H 2O. Two types of PANI morphologies have been demonstrated: amorphous nanodimensional PANI uniformly coated on CoMoO4·0.75H 2O nanorods, and interconnected hollow spheres like PANI inside the bulk material. The prepared CoMoO4·0.75H2O/PANI composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for the phase and formation, respectively. The surface morphology was investigated by using FESEM and TEM, which revealed the formation of the CoMoO4·0.75H2O/PANI composite. The electrochemical characterization of the pseudocapacitive CoMoO 4·0.75H2O and CoMoO4·0.75H 2O/PANI composites in 1 M Na2SO4 showed the highest specific capacitances of 285 F g-1 and 380 F g-1, respectively, at a current density of 1 A g-1. The cyclic stability test demonstrated the specific capacitance retention of about 90.4% after 1000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles at a constant current density of 1 A g -1, which is also higher than that of virgin CoMoO 4·0.75H2O - 86.3% retention of specific capacitance. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.
