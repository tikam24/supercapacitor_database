A promising biomass carbon material, manufactured by the carbonation of Physalis peruviana L. calyx at 700 Â°C, is presented in this work. Morphology characterization shows that the carbon material possesses long microtubule bundling and above 30% natural O-atom component on the surface. After KOH chemical etching, the materials maintain the oxygen content but exhibit more micropores and higher specific surface area up to 1732.6 m2/g. Using as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the active carbon material exhibits high specific capacitance up to 339.7 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 3 mol/L KOH aqueous solution through three-electrode system. The active carbon material also exhibits excellent cycling stability (97% retention) by 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g. The outstanding electrochemical performances are attributing to the unique long microtubule bundling with much more pores and the abundant O element on the surface. This biomass carbon material with excellent electrochemical properties could be a useful material for multiple applications.
