Three-dimensional flowerlike NixCo9-xS8 nanosheets with polyvinyl pyrrolidone as the agent dictating the material morphology have been synthesized by means of a one-step solvothermal synthesis procedure. The synthetically facile 3D NixCo9-xS8 nanosheets (P-NixCo9-xS8) achieve high specific surface area and outstanding electrochemical performance. When applied as an electrode material, it demonstrates excellent specific capacitance of 1319.76 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and good rate performance of 1040.4 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. Also, the material achieves remarkable cycling stability that still retains 93.7 % of max capacity after 1500 cycles at the high current density of 10 A g−1. Even after 4000 cycles, a maximum capacity of 71.2 % is retained. Additionally, the P-NixCo9-xS8//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) prepared exhibits excellent capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance (119.9 F g−1), high energy density (43.80 Wh kg−1 at 821.25 W kg−1) and high power density (30.30 Wh kg−1 at 15.58 kW kg−1).
