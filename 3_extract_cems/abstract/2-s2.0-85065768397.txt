Polyoxovanadate-based MOFs microsphere electrode material, [Ni 2 (4,4΄-bipyri-dine) 3 (H 2 O) 2 V 4 O 12 ]·2.5H 2 O, was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method, and then characterized through FT-IR, XRD and SEM. Electrochemical properties of the sample as supercapacitor electrodes in aqueous electrolyte were developed and studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. Results showed that a high specific capacitance of 152.36 F g -1 at current density of 1 A g -1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte, and 97.62% retention after 2500 charge-discharge cycles at current density of 4 A g -1 , which is promising for applications in supercapacitors.
