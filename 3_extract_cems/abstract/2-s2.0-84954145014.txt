To enhance the cycling stability and conductivity of manganese dioxide (MnO2) electrodes for supercapacitors, yttrium (Y) doped zirconia (ZrO2) (denoted as Y/ZrO2) is coated on MnO2 supercapacitor electrodes (Y/ZrO2@MnO2 electrodes), so protecting the MnO2 electrodes in the electrolytes and enhancing the electrochemical performance of MnO2 electrodes in sodium sulfate electrolytes. The Y/ZrO2@MnO2 electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and XRD analysis. The electrochemical properties of the electrodes are tested and analyzed by galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Y/ZrO2@MnO2 electrodes achieve a specific capacity of 282.1 F g-1 with a specific capacity loss of only 6.3% after 100 cycles at the current density of 50 mA g-1. The results show that MnO2 particles are successfully deposited by Y-doped ZrO2 while the Y/ZrO2@MnO2 electrodes display better cycling stability and capacity performance. Therefore, this Y-doped ZrO2 coating is a potential choice to improve the cycling stability and conductivity of MnO2 electrodes.
