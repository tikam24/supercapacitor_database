The hierarchical NiCo2O4 array structure/Ni foam (NiCo2O4/NF) is prepared by a soft-template-assisted hydrothermal approach for application in supercapacitors. Furthermore, the micro-structure of porous NiCo2O4 nanoarray on Ni foam can be easily tuned by reaction time under assistance of quaternary ammonium gemini surfactant. The electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4 array on Ni foam with various morphologies are also investigated and compared. Among them, the NiCo2O4 nanofiber array shows the better performance comparing to other counterparts, such as a larger area capacitance of 2.89 F cm-2 and excellent cycling stability, maintaining ca. 87.9% of its initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. This work provides a facile way to prepare hierarchical porous NiCo2O4 array grown on Ni foam for various applications
