In this paper we design robust control strategies for a hybrid solid oxide fuel cell ultra-capacitor system. Fuel cell control is established by using an invariant property of fuel utilization within an input-shaping framework. Two control strategies are developed. The first design uses a nonlinear control approach for which we prove the stability of the closed-loop system in presence of system uncertainties. The second uses a standard H∞ robust control approach. Both strategies enforce the control of State of Charge (SOC) of the ultra-capacitor to a desired level. A hardware-in-the-loop test-stand is developed and experimental results are provided. © 2010 AACC.
