By changing the mass ratio of resorcinol, formaldehyde and sodium carbonate, the pore structure of carbon aerogel was controlled and by changing the highest temperature of CO2 activation, the effects of activation temperature on the pore structure and electrochemical performance were studied. The pore structures and morphologies of carbon aerogel were investigated by using N2 adsorption isotherms (BET) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical performances of carbon aerogel were characterized by virtue of the cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge-discharge test. The results show that the increase of activation temperature is helpful to improve the materials' structure and performance. When the highest temperature of CO2 activation reaches 1 000 â„ƒ, carbon aerogel will have the highest specific surface area (2 201 m2/g), and the specific capacitance of the corresponding electrode in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte will be about 190 F/g with a current density of 1 A/g.
