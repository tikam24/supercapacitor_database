Graphene is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors mainly because of its large specific surface area and high conductivity. In practice, however, several fabrication issues need refinement. The restacking of graphene flakes upon being packed into supercapacitor electrodes has become a critical challenge in the full utilization of graphene's large specific surface area to further improve the device performance. In this review, a variety of recent techniques and strategies are overviewed for the prevention of graphene restacking. They have been classified into several categories to improve and facilitate the discussion on the underlying ideas. Based on the overview of the existing techniques, we discuss the trends of future research in the fields. Â© 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.
