The excellent stability of CeO2 coupled with the high-level conductivity of CeS2 and enhanced electrochemical performance of rGO prove to be a workable nanocomposite electrode for supercapacitor applications. Here in this work, we synthesized mesoporous Ce-BTC metal-organic framework (MOF) derived CeO2/rGO composite, which was then subjected to sulfidation to prepare CeO2/rGO/CeS2 nanocomposite, which was characterized by XRD, SEM, EDS, and TGA to find out its crystalline nature, material composition, morphology, and thermal stability. The electrochemical behavior of the metal oxide/sulfide composite was studied by making use of the cyclic voltammetry analysis (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The as-produced porous CeO2/rGO/CeS2 composite demonstrated the highest specific capacitance of 720 Fg−1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte, with the specific energy and specific power of 23.5 Whkg−1, and 2917.2 Wkg−1 correspondingly, at a current density of 2.5 Ag−1. The electrode demonstrated exceptional cyclic stability over 3000 cycles at a 100mVs−1 scan rate. The brilliant electrochemical efficacy of the synthesized material was ascribed to its tiered structure. The obtained results show that the CeO2/rGO/CeS2 composite opens new possibilities of metal sulfide composites as efficient electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
