This paper reviewed recent developments on rare earth elements used in electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage, i.e., lithium ion batteries and supercapacitors, electrochemical reaction mechanism of rare earth element ions, and the utilization forms of rare earth element ions for enhancing electrochemical performance. The effect of rare earth element ions on the stabilization of the electrode materials structure, the improvement of the electronic conductivity and the ion diffusion was represented. The electronegativity and ionic size of rare earth elements are two important parameters to affect the structure, activity, reactivity of traditional electrode materials because that the ionic sizes of rare earth element ions are greater than those of the transition metal ions, while the electronegativity of rare earth element ions is lower than that of transition metal ions. Moreover, the ionic electronegativity can affect the electrostatic interactions between ions, while the ionic radius can control steric effect between ions. Rare earth element ion doping and coating are two important routes to construct rare earth element modified transition metal oxide materials, which are often used in composite electrode materials.
