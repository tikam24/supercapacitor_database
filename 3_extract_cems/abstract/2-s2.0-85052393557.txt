In this paper, an energy management strategy (EMS) based on the enhanced mixed droop control strategy is proposed for a battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is usually used in autonomous DC microgrid, to achieve the energy management in a decentralized way. By applying a virtual resistance droop (VRD) scheme to the SC converter and a virtual inductance droop (VID) scheme to the battery converter, the SC is able to buffer the fast-changing or pulsating load power flow, leaving the battery only providing the average load power. Since this method is fully decentralized, it features high flexibility and scalability. The operational principle of the proposed control strategy and the system design are elaborated, followed by which Matlab/Simulink is conducted to verify theoretical analyses.
