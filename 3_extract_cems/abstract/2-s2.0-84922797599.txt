In this paper, we demonstrate that by simple laser induction, commercial polyimide films can be readily transformed into porous graphene for the fabrication of flexible, solid-state supercapacitors. Two different solid-state electrolyte supercapacitors are described, namely vertically stacked graphene supercapacitors and in-plane graphene microsupercapacitors, each with enhanced electrochemical performance, cyclability, and flexibility. Devices with a solid-state polymeric electrolyte exhibit areal capacitance of >9 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.02 mA/cm2, more than twice that of conventional aqueous electrolytes. Moreover, laser induction on both sides of polyimide sheets enables the fabrication of vertically stacked supercapacitors to multiply its electrochemical performance while preserving device flexibility.
