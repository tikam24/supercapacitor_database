A power dense DC-DC converter is required to interface a supercapacitor energy buffer with a higher voltage traction drive in a small electric vehicle application. A converter design and component selection process is described for a bidirectional, 18 kW, dual interleaved boost converter with interphase transformer. The physical construction of the converter is optimised to increase volumetric and gravimetric power density and simplify assembly. The prototype converter achieves a power density of 6.5 kW/kg and 7.9 kW/l. Converter efficiency and thermal results are presented and component mass and loss audits are included.
