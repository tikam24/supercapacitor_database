Fe2O3 supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe 2O3/N-rGO) hydrogel was prepared by a facial one-pot hydrothermal method. The efficient Fe2O3 loading and nitrogen doping of graphene was realized with this method. The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis, Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction, and nitrogen isothermal adsorption-desorption. The chemical environment of the surface composition of the samples was recorded by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance was tested with a three-electrode system in the aqueous electrolyte of 1 M KOH. The electrochemical measurement demonstrated that Fe2O3/N-rGO shows a specific capacitance as high as 618 F g-1 at a discharge current density of 0.5 A g-1. Even at the current density of 10 A g-1, the specific capacitance is still as high as 350 F g -1. After 5000 cycles, the capacity retention is still maintained at 56.7%.
