Polyaniline salt doped with dual dopants such as β-naphthalene sulfonic acid and dodecyl hydrogen sulfate was synthesized directly in one step for the first time via inverted emulsion polymerization pathway Polyaniline salt was purified using solvents. Polyaniline salt was dedoped to polyaniline base. Polyaniline base was converted to polyaniline salt with β-naphthalene sulfonic acid by redoping process. These four polyaniline materials were used as electrode material in supercapacitor and studied their electrochemical performance. Among the four polyaniline electrode materials, as-synthesized polyaniline salt showed better specific capacitance (140 F/g) and energy density (35 Wh/Kg). Supercapacitor was subjected to higher showing capacitance initially 30 to 18 F/g at 15,000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency (100-96 %). The advantages of the polyaniline electrode material are easy synthesis, easy fabrication, low cost material, more cycles, good capacitative behavior and comparable capacitance, energy & power density. © 2011, Advanced Engineering Solutions.
