Developing a bi-functional material which can meet both electrochemical water splitting and supercapacitors (SCs) is a hot spot in current research. In this study, hierarchical zigzag-like phosphorus doped CuCo2O4 nanosheets based 3D electrode materials were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method and followed by thermal treatment. Since the unique morphology of 2D nanosheets with zigzag-like edges could provide more reactive sites, which is not only conducive to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but also conducive to the electrochemical energy storage. Meanwhile, the doping of phosphorus was adopted to improve the conductivity, which would further enhance the electrochemical properties of CuCo2O4. Thereafter, its performance for HER and SCs in 1 M KOH were systematically investigated. As an electrode for HER, it only required a low overpotential of 152 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 with a Tafel slope of 115.7 mV dec−1. Furthermore, I-t test result showed an excellent stability. As an electrode for SCs, it exhibited a high specific capacity of 896.9C g−1 at 1 A g−1 in three-electrode system. All in all, the obtained hierarchical zigzag-like phosphorus doped CuCo2O4 nanosheets provided a feasible route for the design of bi-functional electrode materials both for energy conversion and storage.
