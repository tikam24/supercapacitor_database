Dendritic nanoporous nickel oxide and tube-like nickel-tin oxide electrodes were prepared by a galvanic displacement reaction in an aqueous electrolyte containing chlorine ions which dramatically accelerated the reaction. The nanoporous nickel oxide showed a capacitance of 1242 F g-1, 97.4% of which was retained even after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
