Ni(OH)2/C composites were synthesized by solvothermal carbonization method using iodine as catalyst, ethanol as solvent and carbon source. The influence of the catalyst amount on the morphology and electrochemical performance of the materials were investigated. The results indicate that the composites are non-spherical particles, and the one obtained by using I2/Ni (OH)2 = 3/5 (mass ratio) shows the smallest crystallite size (16.3 nm) and the best electrochemical performance. The as synthesized composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1 200.0 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, and 937.5 F/g at 5 A/g, i.e. a retention rate of ca. 78%.
