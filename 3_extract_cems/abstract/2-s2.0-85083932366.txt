Current hybrid and micro-hybrid vehicles often deploy multiple storage systems to handle all power and energy requirements. •Supercapacitorsdeliver very high power, but have low energy. •They may be designed in parallel to support a low power battery, but this adds to cost and complexity with two storage devices and controller required. •A single battery capable of delivering both high power and the required energy is proposed: LMO/LTO Li-Imide™.
