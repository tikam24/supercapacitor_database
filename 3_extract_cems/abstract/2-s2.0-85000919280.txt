Supercapacitors are energy storage elements, which could generally replace, or hybridized with electrochemical batteries. However, considering the properties of state-of-the-art devices, a designer could look at them as more useful components in a multitude of other applications. General properties of supercapacitors are very large capacitance, low equivalent series resistance and long time constant devices. Long time constant property gives the ability to absorb short duration high voltage transients. This paper summarizes the broad achievements of a supercapacitor applications research group, which could directly assist in renewable energy areas and sustainable development.
