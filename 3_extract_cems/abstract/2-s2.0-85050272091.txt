In this study, NiS2 nanocubes were successfully synthesized by a novel facile solvothermal method using NiC2O4·2H2O microstructures and used as an electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of the prepared NiS2 electrode were studied using galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. Its maximum specific capacitance was 2077 F g−1 at a constant current density of about 0.65 A g−1. Further, the EIS results confirmed the pseudocapacitive nature of the NiS2 electrode. The experimental results suggested that the NiS2 electro-active material demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance, low resistance, and excellent cycling stability.
