Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) fabricated Mn+2 doped CoS2 was prepared by wet-chemical approach and deposited on Nickel foam (NF) to be applied for supercapacitor application. Effect of CNTs on Mn–CoS2 was investigated through X-rays diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, Current-Voltage probe and electrochemical measurements. Mn–CoS2 integrated with CNTs showed high electrical conductivity (6.3 × 10−2 S cm−1) than unsupported Mn–CoS2 (3.42 × 10−2 S cm−1) due the generation of significant contacts among Mn–CoS2 and CNTs. Mn–CoS2/CNTs@NF exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 603 Fg-1 at 5 mVs−1. Rate capability tests indicated 82.2% capacitance retention. When applied for consecutive 3000 cyclic runs at 200 mVs−1, Mn–CoS2/CNTs@NF retained 89.9% of its initial capacitance. After the addition of CNTs, values of RES (17.87 Ω) and RCT (25.63 Ω) were remarkably reduced for Mn–CoS2/CNTs@NF. Superior electrochemical response of Mn–CoS2/CNTs@NF can be accredited to synergistic effects from Mn–CoS2, CNTs and NF substrate.
