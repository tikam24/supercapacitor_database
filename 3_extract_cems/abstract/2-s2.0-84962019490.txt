Large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and abundant channels have been recognized to favor faradic capacitors, but their realization at the same time by a facile preparation process is still a great challenge. Here, we synthesized porous cadmium sulphide freely standing on nickel foam (CdS/NF) via a one-step hydrothermal method which possesses high specific capacitance, good rate capability and outstanding cycling stability. The CdS/NF microspheres present pores with a mean size of âˆ¼3 nm, resulting in fast diffusion of ions, facile transportation of electrons and high activity, which make great synergistic contributions to reversible redox reactions. In the resulting supercapacitors, a specific capacitance of 909 F g-1 is achieved at a current density of 2 mA cm-2 with excellent rate capability that 88% of the original capacitance is retained at 50 mA cm-2. After 5000 charge-discharge cycles at current densities as large as 50 mA cm-2, 104% of initial capacitance is maintained. Finally, asymmetric supercapacitors with a high energy density of 28 W h kg-1 at a power density of 160 W kg-1 were obtained.
