The present paper emphasizes the benefits of using supercapacitors in vehicle applications. The paper basically presents the supercapacitor technology and the advantages of using such novel devices in automotive applications. A comparative image of two implementations is described: (i) Start/Stop system implemented on a diesel locomotive, which illustrates an optimal hybrid storage solution and (ii) a regenerative braking system implemented on a reduced scale electric vehicle demonstrator, as an illustration of a dynamic storage multi-element adapting topology. The hardware architectures and implementations, the control systems and data acquisition systems are detailed. The experimental results are interpreted and the corresponding electrical parameters are determined in order to emphasize the increase in energy efficiency. Also, the advantages of using hybrid storage systems and dynamic adapting topologies for vehicle applications are emphasized. Â© 2012 IEEE.
