Nano-manganese dioxide electrode materials for supercapacitor applications were synthesized by sol-gel method and characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that the dominant phase is Î³-MnO2 and the particle had a uniform size distribution of about 20 nm. In 2 mol/L(NH4)2SO4 solution, cyclic voltammograms with the potential window range from 0.1 to 0.8 V (vs. SCE) indicated a fairly good capacitance performance.
