Several microporous carbons were prepared by polyfurfuryl alcohol-impregnation and impregnation-acetonitrile chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using zeolite HY as a template, denoted as PFA carbons and AN carbons, respectively. These were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns show that the structural regularity of the zeolite was well-replicated by the carbon structures prepared by impregnation-CVD. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed that the AN carbons possess abundant nitrogen-containing groups because of the CVD of acetonitrile. The prepared carbons were typical microporous materials as determined by N2 adsorption/desorption test and they had a high BET surface area and narrow pore size distribution. Electrochemical tests showed that the AN carbons had higher capacitance because of their evident pseudo-capacitance from the nitrogencontaining groups. AN8 had a high capacitance up to 210 F·g-1. The capacitance retention ratio of the AN carbons were determined to its electric conductivity and mesoporosity. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
