With the development of power supplies for wearable devices, electrode materials with dual functions have received extensive attention. Herein, we report a strategy of preparing stylophora coral-like Ni/Co bimetal metal organic framework (MOF) with furan-based derivatives as ligands through the simple solvothermal method, which can be utilized as a dual-function electrode material to build supercapacitors and non-enzymatic glucose sensing. It can be found that the high molecular stacking properties of the rigid furan ring skeleton combined with the unique stylophora coral-like morphology can greatly improve the charge transfer efficiency of the electrode reaction process, and the structure of the bimetallic node can effectively adjust the three-dimensional electronic structure, making high capacitive performance during charge storage. The specific capacitance of the furan-based bimetallic MOF material is as high as 531 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with a high capacitance retention rate of 83.4% after 5000 cycles. In addition, the glucose sensing performance is analyzed and an outstanding sensitivity value of 366 µA mM−1 cm−2 is achieved with a low limit of detection (2 μM). The as-synthesized furan-based bimetallic MOF material is a promising candidate for electrochemical supercapacitors and efficient glucose detection.
