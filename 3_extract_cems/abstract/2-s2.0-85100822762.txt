The recent developments in the field of energy storage made a significant impact on in transportation, industry and domestic applications. This review aims to develop comparative understanding on high energy density storage system called supercapacitor for various materials and methods explored recently. The different parameters addressed in this review are performance variables of supercapacitor and different material-method framework explored recently. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation, waste minimization and green technologies are need of hour for the planet blue. Conclusively environment protection is essential now for sustainability of life. This review focuses on how effectively environmental wastes have been used to develop green energy storage device for renewable applications.
