The integration of several DC sources with varying voltage levels, bidirectional power flow capability is proposed using a multi-input - bidirectional DC-DC converter (MIBC) and a bidirectional boost DC-DC converter, which is easier to design. Energy storage devices include batteries and ultra-capacitors elements. Furthermore, integrating suitable energy sources eliminates the problem of the slower action of sources of renewable energy. The input source, a photovoltaic panel whose voltage is delivered to the inverter, CUK converter and stepped up before delivering it to the inverter, which in turn supplies to the three-phase induction motor propulsion system. With correct control mechanisms, the multi-input bidirectional converter may deal with ultra-capacitor and battery separately or simultaneously. The charging and discharging of the battery is best regulated through a comprehensive regulation in the bidirectional converter during boost mode, through a strategy for power management and control. This is based on the PV/ultra-capacitor operation status. The simulation findings of this paper validates the proposed circuit.
