Herein, we offer the study on the conductive polymer of polypyrrole and iron oxide (Fe2O3@PPy) nanocomposites, which are prepared via a simple chemical oxidation method for energy storage applications. The synthesized nanocomposites are confirmed by the physico-chemical properties through Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) results along with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and stability analyses. The surface morphological studies of SEM and high TEM images substantiated the formation of Fe2O3@PPy nanocomposite via the polymerization process. The prepared Fe2O3@PPy nanocomposites deliver at a specific capacity of 395.45 C g-1 at 5 mV s-1 scan rate. Moreover, Fe2O3@PPy nanocomposite shows outstanding cycling stability of capacity 94.3% even after 10000 cycles of charge-discharge at the highest current density value of 10 A g-1. The remarkable electrochemical energy storage manner of as-synthesized Fe2O3@PPy nanocomposite is considered a potential electrode for supercapacitor application. The higher electrochemical performance of this Fe2O3@PPy nanocomposite it's suitable for numerous applications like batteries, sensors, photocatalysts, solar cells and commercial requirements.
