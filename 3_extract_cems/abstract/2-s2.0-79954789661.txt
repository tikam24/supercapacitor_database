For the construction of an all-electric race car, all aspects from engineering design over cost estimation up to the road capability are illuminated. From the most promising batteries for electric vehicle propulsion, the state-of-the art and commercial availability of lithium-ion secondary batteries is critically discussed with respect to cycle-life and unfavorable charge-discharge conditions. A market-overview is given with respect to a small electric car. Different combinations of electric motors and a recuperation system have been investigated. Weight aspects of central drive systems were considered and compared with decentralized wheel-hub drives. As a result, a centralized high-speed drive train based on a permanent-magnet synchronous engine with high-energy magnets seems to be superior due to limited space for assembly. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.
