Nowadays, the flexibility of energy devices acquired more attention due to various portable electronic devices. Here we report a rapid, facile and cost-effective route to synthesize binder-free Polyaniline (PANI) electrode via a simple potentiostatic method to fabricate stable supercapacitor (SCs). The deposition time was varied to optimize the properties and performance of SCs. The formation of PANI thin films confirmed by XRD, FTIR and Raman analysis. The resulting binder-free PANI electrode exhibits porous nanofibers morphology, which provides a high specific surface area confirmed by BET measurement and high specific capacitance (Cs). Benefited from the porosity and high specific surface area of PANI electrodes, maximum Cs observed 473 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate and 76% cyclic retention showed after the 2000th cycles. Furthermore, the resulting symmetric PANI energy storage device exploits 161 F/g Cs at a 5 mV/s scan rate with 47% cyclic retention after the 2000th cycles.
