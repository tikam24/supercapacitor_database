Hydrothermally-synthesized, size and shape-controlled SnO2 nanospheres were electrostatically self-assembled over the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The control over decoration of SnO2 nanospheres on rGO was studied by microscopic analysis and the crystallographic structure of SnO2 hybrid nanocomposites (SnO2: rGO) was determined from X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Hybrid nanocomposite in 1:3 ratio exhibited (i) excellent methylene blue degradation capability within 3 min under visible light condition and (ii) high specific capacitance of 337.52 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte with 89% of retention after 5000 cycles.
