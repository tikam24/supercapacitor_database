Photo-supercapacitors, devices that integrate solar cells and supercapacitors, can convert and store solar energy simultaneously, which is ideal for utilizing solar energy to reduce the consume of fossil fuels. Herein, we designed and fabricated a photo-supercapacitor based on a CdS/CdSe quantum dots co-sensitized solar cell and an active carbon-based supercapacitor with a shared electrode and separate aqueous electrolytes. The device achieved a 2.66% overall efficiency when being photo-charged and galvanostatic discharged at 1 mA/cm2, with an areal capacitance of 132.83 mF/cm2 and an energy density of 23.9 mJ/cm2. The device also showed good stability, remaining 76.7% of its initial overall efficiency after 100 cycles. The properties make the device suitable for miniaturized and self-powered electronic devices.
