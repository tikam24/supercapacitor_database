Hearing aids are devices used to solve the problems associated with hearing loss which are neither curable nor reversible. Near about 6% of the world's population has disabling hearing loss as per the World Health Organizations latest reports. This advancement in recent technology has helped the society to overcome hearing problems and has provided efficient way of communication. These efforts take into account both power and charging time., and todays most popular solutions rely on rechargeable lithium-ion battery and zinc air battery. However, using the supercapacitor instead of re-chargeable batteries is a budding substitute technology, as it is cost effective and the charging time is also very less compared to otherbatteries. This is the innovation presented in this paper. This will lead to the development of a more cost-effective hearing aid so that more and more people can use it. In order to meet societal and medical sector demands, it can thus create a market niche for the deployment and commercialization of novel supercapacitor-based hearing aids.
