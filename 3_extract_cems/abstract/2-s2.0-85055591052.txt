NiFe2 O4 powders were successfully synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method at 180ºC followed by a thermal treatment at 300ºC. Phase composition and morphology were characterizedby X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), respectively. Results showed that the NiFe2 O4 powders, possessing a particle size in the range of 50-100 nm, were well-crystallized. The electrochemical property was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge method. Encouragingly, the obtained NiFe2 O4 powders with small particle size had an excellent electrochemical property, whose specific capacitance reached 266.84F/g at the electric current density of 1A/g. Compared with other Fe-based metal compound oxides, NiFe2 O4 with a better electrochemical performance could be widely used in the supercapacitor electrode materials.
