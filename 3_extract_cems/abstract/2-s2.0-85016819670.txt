This paper describes the design of a system that converts wasted heat energy, during cooking, into electrical energy to charge a cell phone. A Thermoelectric Module (TEG) is used for converting the heat into electrical energy and the output is amplified to at least 5 Volts (minimum voltage required to charge up a cell phone.) This paper discusses extensively how this system functions and what are the components used to design it. It also covers the theory behind the function of the system and the possibility of implementing this design in the third world countries. The impact that this growing technology can have in the third-world countries is ground-breaking. It involves the renewal and recycling of wasted heat into additional electric power. This is a growing technology and this paper describes the future scopes of this design being implemented at the industrial scale as well as the option of storing the electrical energy from the wasted heat and therefore making it portable.
