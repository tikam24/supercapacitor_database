The conversion of crumpled graphene materials to planar graphene sheets was performed through hydrogen gas treatment of graphene oxide at various temperatures. The resulting graphene materials were incorporated into supercapacitors and systematically examined. Up to 500 °C, a monotonically increasing relationship between the specific capacitance and treatment temperature was identified. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
