In the reported work, ZnxFe2O4:Cu2+1−x nanoparticle (CZF NPs) was successfully synthesized from fabrication of copper (Cu2+) doped ZnFe2O4 NPs by a facile one-pot green (Aegle Marmelos extract) assisted combustion approach. The structural characterizations were investigated by specific spectral techniques; Powder X-Ray diffractometer (PXRD) confirms the formation of spinel cubic nanocrystalline structure with crystallite size in the range 20–25 nm. The porous with spongy like structure morphology was noticed by Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The photocatalytic performance of CZF NPs (7 mol%) was examined by observing their potential role in photodegradation of Rhodamine B (Rh-B) dye (94%) under irradiation of UV–Visible light. Electrochemical study was conducted by graphite assisted with CZF electrode paste in 0.1 M KCl electrolyte and performed as an excellent mechanism of charge–discharge supercapacitor nature with high responses towards the electrochemical sensor action for Mifepristone-Misoprostol.
