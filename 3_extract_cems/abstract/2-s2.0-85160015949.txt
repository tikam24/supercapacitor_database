Rapid and full recovery is the major challenge for the commercialization and further growth of textile-based wearable supercapacitors. Herein, reversibly stretchable and rapidly reboundable textile supercapacitors (TSCs) are developed via the utilization of NiCu2Se3/Cu-Ni alloy-plated cotton cloth (CNAPCC) textile as the cathode and Fe2CuSe3/CNAPCC textile as the anode. Both NiCu2Se3/CNAPCC and Fe2CuSe3/CNAPCC are obtained by a simple in situ oxidation reaction, followed by an ion exchange strategy. Meanwhile, a stable double-network (DN) structure is constructed, covering the knitted cotton cloth (KCC) and Cu-Ni alloy-plated layer (CNAPL). The DN textile structure significantly endows the NiCu2Se3/CNAPCC stretchable electrode with superior mechanical properties, exhibiting high elongation at a break of 470% with a stress of 7.19 MPa and full recovery after 100% strain with almost no residual deformation left after merely 0.2 s. Moreover, the assembled TSC provides a large energy density of 82 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 750 W kg-1. Besides, 50,000 charge/discharge cycle tests under static stretching are performed. The supercapacitor exhibits rapid recovery and excellent cycling stability of 92.2% capacitance retention under different strains (from 0 to 200%).
