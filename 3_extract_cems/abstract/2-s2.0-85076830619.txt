In this work, we report on a unique design of bilayer nanostructure composed of a layer of nickel cobalt hydroxide (NCH) nanosheets anchored on carbon nanowires (CNWs) for high-performance supercapacitors. This bilayer nanostructure can be constructed on Ni foam by a facile electrochemical deposition method. Compared with pristine NCH nanosheets, the bilayer CNWs@NCHs nanostructure obviously exhibits enhanced performance with an ultrahigh capacitance over 2100 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, along with good rate capability and cycling stability. These promising results can be attributed the unique design of the electrode structure with several structural advantages.
