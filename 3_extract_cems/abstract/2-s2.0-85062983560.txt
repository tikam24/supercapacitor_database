Cobalt hydroxide nanosheets have been synthesized via facile and affordable simple chemistry route without any additives for structure design. Co(OH) 2 nanosheets exhibit a maximum specific capacity of 111 C g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Asymmetric supercapacitor (Co(OH) 2 //AC) has been fabricated and it delivers the specific capacitance of 34 F g −1 with the power density of 300 W kg −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 . These profitable features of cobalt hydroxide nanosheets prepared in the present work are quite promising electrode material for high-performance supercapatteries.
