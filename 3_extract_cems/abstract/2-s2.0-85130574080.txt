In this work, we have prepared a nanocomposite of NiCo2O4 and reduced graphene oxide (NC-RGO) by the hydrothermal synthesis technique using ammonia as the reducing agent. We have used ammonia solution as the reducing agent for GO reduction in aqueous solvent as it is more environmentally friendly in comparison to hydrazine hydrate or other poisonous reducing agents. Thermo-gravimetric analysis of the prepared precursor has been done to find the decomposition temperature. X-ray diffraction has been done to verify the phases present in the material. The optical properties have also been studied by UV-Vis and Photoluminescence spectroscopy. The electrochemical behaviour has been studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge curves in two electrolytic solutions (1 M Na2SO4 and 1 M KOH aqueous solutions). It has been observed that a higher value of energy density has been obtained in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolytic solution than in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The work presented in this article is related to sustainable development goals (SDGs) to transform our world regarding affordable and clean energy.
