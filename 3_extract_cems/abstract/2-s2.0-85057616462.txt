Rod-like zinc cobalt sulfide (ZCS) with controlled uniform structure was synthesized using a single-step hydrothermal method and its growth mechanism was investigated. A ZCS-based electrode showed an ultrahigh capacitance of 2,418 F g−1 (967 C g−1) at 1 A g−1 with a good cycling stability of 83% after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric ZCS-12//activated carbon supercapacitor, exhibited a high capacitance of 142 F g−1 (227 C g−1) at 0.5 A g−1 and a high energy density of 51 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 8 kW kg−1, highlighting the next generation high performance supercapacitors.
