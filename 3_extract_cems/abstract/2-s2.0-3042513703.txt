Nano-fibrous polyaniline (PANI) film was synthesized by pulse galvanostatic method (PGM) and the electrodes of the nano-fibrous PANI film were used to construct electrochemical capacitor in this paper. The scanning electron microscopy result shows that the nano-fibrous PANI has a diameter of about 100 nm and a length of several micrometers. The PANI electrochemical capacitor was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and ac impedance in NaClO4 + HClO4 mixed electrolyte. The results show that, the supercapacitor constructed by nano-fibrous PANI contains larger capacitance than capacitors constructed by granular PANI, which is prepared by galvanostatic method (GM) with the same deposited charge as PGM. From charge/ discharge studies of nano-fibrous polyaniline capacitor, a specific capacitance of 699 F·g-1 and a specific energy density of 54.6 Wh·kg-1 have been obtained at discharge current density of 3.5 mA·cm-2. The PANI supercapacitor also shows little degradation of capacitance after long cycles. All results suggest that the nano-fibrous PANI is a prospect material for supercapacitor.
