Nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped porous carbon(N/P-PC) was prepared via a simple direct pyrolysis method using rice husks as the carbon source and H3PO4 as the phosphorus source and activator. The acquired products are typical hierarchical porous carbons with a multiple-peaked pore size distribution of microporous and mesoporous structure, which has a high surface area and pore volume. The N2 adsorption-desorption results show that the mesoporous distribution of N/P-PC can be adjusted in the range of 2-10 nm and the meso-porosity can be varied by changing the H3PO4 content. In particular, among the N/P-PC samples, N/P-PC-1:5 has the highest surface area of 2188 m2/g, pore volume of 3.025 cm3/g, and pore diameter of 5.537 nm. Electrochemical measurements also indicate that the assembled symmetric cell of N/P-PC-1:5 displays the highest specific capacitance of 236 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and 130 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g; it also has an excellent capacity retention of 100 % after 6000 cycles. The hierarchical porous structure and the synergistic action of nitrogen and phosphorus contribute to the advantageous electrochemical performance of the carbon material. The proposed strategy provides a facile method for preparing porous carbon from biomass waste.
