It is a strategy with many benefits to adsorb transition metal ions in sewage and then prepare composite electrode materials. This method prepared a three-dimensional bulk-phase core-shell composite activated carbon@Ni(OH)2. Activated carbon (AC) adsorbed nickel ions and precipitant in simulation nickel sewage and then was hydrothermally treated. Nickel hydroxide grew from the hole and surface of AC to form a core-shell structure composite material. The adsorption amount of the AC depends on the mixed solution concentration of nickel ions and urea and the soaking time AC immersed in the solution. Compared with AC, when the solution concentration is 3 mol Lâˆ’1 and the soaking time is 48h, the specific capacitance of the synthesized sample is 12.8 times higher, and its capacitance retention after 5000 charge/discharge cycles is 12.3 times higher. This method synthesizes electrode materials, is simple and suitable for macro preparation, and can purify polluted water.
