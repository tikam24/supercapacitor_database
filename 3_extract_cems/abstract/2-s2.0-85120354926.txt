As inspired by the surging demand for high performance energy storage systems, researchers have been designing and exploring advanced electrode materials exhibiting higher energy and power densities. In this study, a novel combination of nickel-cobalt sulfide and oxide was reported for high performance supercapacitors. The porous α-Ni(Co)S@NiCoO2 composites with core–shell structure were derived from the well-designed precursor with Ni2CoS4 and ZIF-67 serving as the self-sacrificing templates through a two-step calcination process at elevated temperatures. Such a heterostructure exhibited an ultra-high specific capacity of 502.4 mA h g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1, which was attributed to the unique porous core–shell structure and the ingenious combination of bimetallic sulfide and oxide. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor based on the α-Ni(Co)S@NiCoO2 composite and commercial activated carbon achieved a high energy density of 82.4 Wh kg–1 at a power density of 847.5 W kg–1. The prominent electrochemical performance exhibited by the α-Ni(Co)S@NiCoO2 heterostructure in this study was demonstrated to be promising to practically serve as advanced electrode materials in supercapacitors.
