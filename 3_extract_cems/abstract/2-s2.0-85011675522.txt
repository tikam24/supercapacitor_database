In this work, we have used microemulsion method for synthesis of MnO x /C nanocomposite and investigated its electrochemical properties via fabrication of supercapacitor and non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) sensor. In-situ inclusion of conducting carbon in manganese oxide (MnO x /C) enhances the network conductivity facilitating the charge transfer process which is beneficial for supercapacitor and sensing applications. MnO x /C provides high energy and power density, 31.6 Wh kg −1 and 3.8 kW kg −1 respectively and short relaxation time ∼3 ms for fabricated cell (MnO x /C//MnO x /C) endowing excellent power delivery capacity. Furthermore, MnO x /C as sensor, exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the oxidation of H 2 O 2 and shows high sensitivity (0.37 mA mM −1 cm −2 ) with low detection limit (0.5 μM at an S/N of 3). Hence, this study provides new avenue for high performance supercapacitor and H 2 O 2 detection.
