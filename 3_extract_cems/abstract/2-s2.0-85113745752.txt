Graphene based sulfonated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel was synthesized and its performance as nanocomposite gel polymer electrolyte was investigated for application in quasi solid-state flexible supercapacitors. Hydrothermally reduced graphene (HRG) was synthesized through hydrothermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Sulfonated PVA hydrogel (SPVA) was synthesized with predetermined quantities of HRG to obtain nanocomposite gel polymer electrolytes coded as SPVA-HRG-x (x = content (wt.%) of HRG). The amorphous nature of SPVA-HRG-x was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The electrochemical performance of SPVA-HRG-x was evaluated using techniques like cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical spectroscopy (EIS) studies of a lab scale supercapacitor cell, fabricated using hydrothermally reduced carbon cloth (CCHy) current collectors coated with HRG (HRG-CCHy). In SPVA-HRG-0.5 electrolyte, HRG-CCHy exhibited specific capacitance of 200 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and specific energy of 6.1 Wh kg-1 at specific power of 1 kW kg-1 and retained 93 % of its initial capacitance even after 5000 GCD cycles. The incorporation of SPVA with 0.5 wt.% of HRG-CCHy can be attributed to the increase in amorphous nature of SPVA-HRG-0.5, which in-turn lowers its impedance. This contributed to the remarkable supercapacitive behaviour of HRG-CCHy, demonstrating its potential as gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) for application in quasi solid-state flexible supercapacitors.
