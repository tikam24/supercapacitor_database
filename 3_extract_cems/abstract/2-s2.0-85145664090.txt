In this study, we prepared titanium dioxide by a simple, cost-effective, and solâ€“gel method. The maximum specific capacitance value was attained by the TiO2 nanosphere modified electrode, which measured 810F/g at 0.5 A/g in 2 M KOH. The stability of the TiO2 nanosphere coated electrode was demonstrated to be significantly higher than that of other commercially available electrodes for 10,000 cycles at 1.0 A/g. The TiO2 nanosphere is suitable as a high-efficienct electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
