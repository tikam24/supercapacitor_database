The adoption of hybrid powertrain technology brings a bright prospective to improve the economy and environmental friendliness of traditional oil-fueled automotive and solve the range anxiety problem of battery electric vehicle. However, the concern of the battery aging cost is the main reason that keeps plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) from being popular. To improve the total economy of PHEV, this paper proposes a win-win energy management strategy (EMS) for Engine-Battery-Supercapacitor hybrid powertrains to reduce energy consumption and battery degradation cost at the same time. First of all, a novel hierarchical optimization energy management framework is developed, where the power of internal combustion engine (ICE), battery and super capacitor (SC) can be gradationally scheduled. Then, an adaptive constraint updating rule is developed to improve vehicle efficiency and mitigate battery aging costs. Additionally, a control-oriented cost analyzing model is established to evaluate the total economy of PHEV. The quantified operation cost is further designed as a feedback signal to improve the performance of the power distribution algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is verified by Hardware-in-the-loop experiment. The results indicate that the developed EMS method coordinates the operation of ICE, driving motor (DM) and energy storage system effectively with the fuel cost and battery aging cost reduced by 6.1% and 28.6% respectively compared to traditional PHEV. Overall, the introduction of SC and the hierarchical energy management strategy improve the total economy of PHEV effectively. The results from this paper justify the effectiveness and economic performance of the proposed method as compared to conventional ones, which will further encourage the promotion of PHEVs.
