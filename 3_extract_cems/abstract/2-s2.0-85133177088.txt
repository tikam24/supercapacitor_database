Massive use of IC engine vehicles has made an adverse effect on environment and also depleted fuel reservoirs hence rising the fuel prices over these years. Due to the inefficiency of traditional drivetrains, the car industry has shifted its focus to vehicle electrification. In electric cars, propulsion is supplied entirely or in part by electric motors that are powered by an on-board energy storage device. This article analyses a hybrid energy storage system that includes ultra-capacitor units and a battery to overcome the current limits of energy storage devices.
