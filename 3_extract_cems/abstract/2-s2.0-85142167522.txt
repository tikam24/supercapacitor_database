Hierarchical porous carbon materials have received considerable attention in multifarious applications due to their large pore volume, high surface area, and unique multimodal porous structures. In this work, cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), phenol-urea-formaldehyde resin, and KOH were used as templates, carbon sources, and activators, respectively, to prepare hierarchically porous carbon materials. The rodlike CNC used were 15–45 nm wide and 50–450 nm long, and the carbon residue rate of which at 800 °C was only 5.18 wt%, indicating that CNC were excellent templates for mesoporous materials. The degradation of CNC in the resin could form mesopores corresponding to their diameters in carbon materials, and KOH activation could introduce a large number of micropores and macropores in carbon materials, as well as small mesopores around 4 nm, leading to a typical hierarchical porous carbon material. The specific capacitance of the carbon material reached 194.9 F/g at a current density of 1.0 A/g, and the capacitance retention rate of which still exceeded 74% as the current density further increased to 40.0 A/g. The supercapacitor assembled with the electrode material showed a capacitance retention rate over 95% after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A/g.
