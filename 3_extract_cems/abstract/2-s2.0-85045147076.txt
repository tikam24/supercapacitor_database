Novel structural supercapacitors have been fabricated which can simultaneously carry mechanical loads as well as store electrochemical energy. Structural supercapacitors are fabricated by impregnating activated carbon fibre mat electrodes and glass fibre mat separator with crosslinked polymer electrolytes using the resin infusion under flexible tooling method. Mesoporous silica particles are also used as reinforcements to further improve the electrochemical and mechanical performance of structural supercapacitors. The fabricated structural supercapacitors have been characterised through chronoamperometry method and impedance spectroscopy to evaluate the electrochemical performance and in-plane shear properties to evaluate the mechanical performance. A multifunctional structural supercapacitor, exhibiting simultaneously a power density of 34 W kg−1, an energy density of 0.12 Wh kg−1 and a shear modulus of 1.75 GPa, has been fabricated.
