In recent years, the demand for economic multifunctional materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and supercapacitors increased tremendously. The present study focuses on the synthesis of mesoporous molybdenum disulfide nanosheets using a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal technique. The influence of acidic, alkaline, and neutral pH conditions on structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of MoS2 has been studied in detail. The intense (0 0 2) diffraction peak evidence the growth of MoS2 along the c axis of hexagonal crystal structure. The MoS2 prepared in acidic pH condition exhibit less stacking of MoS2 layers. The pH 3 MoS2 sample possesses high specific surface area and hence affords abundant electroactive sites. The electrochemical measurements were carried out using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, linear sweep voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the high specific capacitance of 857 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate was achieved for the MoS2 prepared under acidic pH conditions. Further, the electrode exhibits cyclic stability of 78% even after 1000 cycles. Also, in oxygen evolution reaction, MoS2 electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 299 mV to deliver a current of 25 mA/cm2. These results suggest that MoS2 nanosheets can serve as a potential candidate as an electrode for OER and supercapacitors.
