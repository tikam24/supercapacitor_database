Three dimensional (3D) graphene-based architectures such as 3D graphene-based hydrogels, aerogels, foams, and sponges have attracted huge attention owing to the combination of the structural interconnectivities and the outstanding properties of graphene which offer these interesting structures with low density, high porosity, large surface area, stable mechanical properties, fast mass and electron transport. They have been extensively studied for a wide range of applications including capacitors, batteries, sensors, catalyst, etc. There are several reviews focusing on the 3D graphene-based architectures and their applications. In this work, we only summarise the latest development on the preparation of 3D graphene-based architectures and their applications in supercapacitors, with emphasis on the preparation strategies.
