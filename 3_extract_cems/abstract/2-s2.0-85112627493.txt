Commercial Chinese ink was employed to disperse pristine vapor-grown carbon nanofibers (VGCNFs) in aqueous suspensions via horizontal ball milling. The obtained suspension was used to fabricate conductive paper-based composites through filtration-deposition onto filter paper. It was found that the carbon black particles from the Chinese ink helped separate VGCNFs and acted as connection points between the VGCNFs, while the glue reinforced the conduction network. Thus, the VGCNF-ink/paper ternary composite showed sufficiently low sheet resistance. With merely 2.5 mg·cm−2 VGCNFs, the sheet resistance could be reduced to 4.5 Ω·sq−1. As a proof of concept, these paper-based composites were directly used as electrodes of solid-state symmetric electronic double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and the substrate for the electrodeposition of MnO2 to achieve higher electrochemical performances. The EDLCs fabricated with 2.5 mg·cm−2 VGCNFs showed a specific capacitance of 224 mF·cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA·cm−2, which was retained by 86.4% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, thanks to the high electrical conductivity and the porous structure, the MnO2 decorated paper-based composites exhibited dramatically enhanced specific capacitance. It is believed that our finding offers an idea to directly utilize commercial Chinese ink for the fabrication of electrode materials.
