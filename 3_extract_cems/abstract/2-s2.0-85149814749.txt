MXenes have shown great potential as an emerging two-dimensional (2D) material for micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) due to their high conductivity, rich surface chemistry, and high capacity. However, MXene sheets inherently tend to lay flat on the substrate during film formation to assemble into compact stacked structures, which hinders ion accessibility and prolongs ion transport paths, leading to highly dependent electrochemical properties on the thickness of the film. Here, we demonstrate a vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene based micro-supercapacitor with an excellent electrochemical performance by a liquid nitrogen-assisted freeze-drying method. The vertical arrangement of the 2D MXene sheets allows for directional ion transport, enabling the vertical-MXene based MSCs to exhibit thickness-independent electrochemical properties even in thick films. In addition, the MSCs displayed a high areal capacitance of 87 mF cm-2 at 10 mV s-1 along with an excellent stability of âˆ¼87.4% after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, the vertical-MXene approach proposed here is scalable and can be extended to other systems involving directional transport.
