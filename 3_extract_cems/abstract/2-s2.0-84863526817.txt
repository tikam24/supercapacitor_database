As an energy storage device of green energy, supercapacitor has been made considerable progress in the areas such as pulsed power system in recent years. One of the designing indicators of the pulsed power system is the energy density of the power supply; hence the best way to increase the energy density is to enhance supercapacitor unit voltage. A hybrid supercapacitor, which consists of the anode of tantalum electrolytic capacitor and the cathode of supercapacitor, is developed and energy storage mechanism is discussed in this paper. At the same time, the model of hybrid super-capacitor is established based on its physical structure, the electric field distribution of the hybrid super-capacitor and porous electrode is analyzed as well. From the results of the analysis, the relationship between voltage and electrical capacity is available. Therefore, the measures of improving the electric field distribution and operating voltage of the hybrid super-capacitor are proposed, and an experimental study that aimed at the developed hybrid super-capacitor sample is implemented. The results indicated that the unit operating voltage of the hybrid super-capacitor can reach above 100V, and energy storage can achieve 3kJ. A conclusion can be drawn that a higher energy storage density can be achieved if the hybrid super-capacitors are used in pulse power systems.
