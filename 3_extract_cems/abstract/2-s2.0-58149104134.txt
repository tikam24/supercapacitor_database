Amorphous and porous ruthenium oxide thin films have been deposited from aqueous Ru(III)Cl 3 solution on stainless steel substrates using electrodeposition method. Cyclic voltammetry study of a film showed a maximum specific capacitance of 650 F g -1 in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The surface treatments such as air annealing, anodization and ultrasonic weltering affected surface morphology. The supercapacitance of ruthenium oxide electrode is found to be dependent on the surface morphology. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
