The paper represents the mathematical model for diagnostics of supercapacitors. The research objectives are the problem of determining a supercapacitor technical condition during its operation. The general reliability of diagnostics is described as the methodological and instrumental reliabilities of diagnostics. The instrumental diagnostic reliability of supercapacitor includes the probabilities of errors of the first and second kind, α and β respectively. The methodological approach to increasing the reliability of supercapacitor diagnostic has been proposed, in terms of multi-parameter supercapacitor diagnostic by applying nonlinear, frequency dependent mathematical models of supercapacitors that take into account nonlinearity, frequency dispersion of parameters and the effect of transient processes in supercapacitors. The more frequencies, operating voltages and currents are applied in the supercapacitor diagnostics, the more methodological reliability of diagnostics will increase in relation to the methodological reliability of supercapacitor diagnostics when only one frequency, voltage and current are applied.
