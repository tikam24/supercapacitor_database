The emerging wire-shaped supercapacitors (WSSs) have motivated tremendous research interests in energy storage devices. However, challenges still exist in the pursuit of high-rate performance WSS. Here, a graphene fiber made from chemical vapor deposition grown laminated graphene sheet is adopted to form a WSS which exhibits an exceptional rate capability with a relaxation time constant of 1.4 ms, smallest among WSSs reported to date. Furthermore, the resulting WSS can be charged-discharged at a high scan rate of 100 V s−1 while maintaining good capacitive behavior. When the scan rate increased by 5000 times, from 20 mV s−1 to 100 V s−1, the graphene fiber based WSS maintains 38.6% of its original capacitance. After 10,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, the specific capacitance retains over 105%, demonstrating a long cycle stability.
