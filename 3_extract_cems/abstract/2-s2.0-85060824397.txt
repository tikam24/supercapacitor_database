NiSe rods coated with cotton-like Ni3S2 were directly grown on nickel foam through a two-step process, comprising selenization and electrodeposition. The as-obtained NiSe/Ni3S2 composite electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical properties, with a high specific capacitance of 8.81 F cm-2 (1259.3 F g-1) at a current density of 4 mA cm-2, which was better than the value of pure NiSe electrode (5.17 F cm-2; 861.8 F g-1) at the same current density. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated using NiSe/Ni3S2 electrode and AC electrode as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. This ASC extended the potential window to 1.6 V and was possessed of a superior energy density of 38.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 192 W kg-1, with outstanding cycling stability (85.9% retention after 10000 cycles).
