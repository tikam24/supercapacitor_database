Abstract: Si nanostructures have drawn considerable attention in the field of Micro-supercapacitors. In this work, a hybrid electrode based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coated silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs) is prepared via a two-step process. The SiNWs are synthesized by metal-assisted electroless etching method and treated by the tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution. Then, the porous PEDOT film is electrodeposited from the ionic liquid electrolyte. The influence of SiNWs and the oligomers in the electrolyte on the morphology of the hybrid electrode and/or on the contact/adhesin between PEDOT and SiNWs are systematically investigated for the first time. Additionally, the storage mechanism of the hybrid electrode is also investigated. After optimization, the hybrid electrode delivers a specific capacitance as high as 115 mF/cm2 at the current density of 0.5 mA/cm2, comparing to the top values of previously reported Si nanostructure electrodes. These preliminary results demonstrate that each component provides unique and crucial function to achieve optimized electrochemical properties, benefiting to fabricate high capacitive performance of Si nanostructure Micro-supercapacitors with simple and low-cost approaches.
