Parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are suitable for heavy-duty applications like trucks. Yet there is an issue of this power configuration that the electrical drives have to work with many fluctuations which can degrade the batteries. Supercapacitors (SCs) can be added to save the batteries life-time. However, it also adds more losses to the system which can increase the engine fuel consumption. This paper aims to study the impact of SCs subsystem on fuel consumption and batteries life-time of a hybrid truck. Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used to deal with the complexity of the studied system. A fair comparison is achieved by using dynamic programming due to its global optimal solutions. Simulation results figure out that the SCs subsystem causes 14% decrease of the maximum optimal saved fuel but can reduce up to 49% of batteries rms current for a specific hybrid truck. A positive effect of using hybrid energy storage subsystems for HEVs can be therefore concluded.
