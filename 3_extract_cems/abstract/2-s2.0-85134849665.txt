Recent progress has been made toward high-performance electrochemical energy storage and energy conversion devices to overcome the energy crisis. This article highlights the performance enhancement parameter of energy storage devices such as a symmetric supercapacitor and energy conversion such as methanol oxidation and water splitting studies for the generation of efficient oxygen and hydrogen. We have prepared a dense cerium molybdate microspherical architecture by the hydrothermal route, and further physical characterization has been performed to evaluate the structural parameters. Charge storage contributions, external surface charge, and internal surface-accumulated charge are calculated by Dunn's and Trassati's approaches. A solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device has been assembled, which exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with a device capacity of 198 C g-1 at 1 A g-1, a large electrochemical potential window of 2.2 V, an enormous cyclic retention of 89.5% after 10,000 cycles, a maximum specific energy of 60.5 W h kg-1, and a maximum specific power of 10.6 kW kg-1. Furthermore, the prepared microspherical architectures were evaluated for oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions and methanol oxidation. The prepared electrode exhibits excellent oxygen evolution performance, while keeping the lowest overpotential as 316 mV, and for hydrogen evolution reaction, the overpotential was obtained as 178 mV. The microspherical architecture electrode also exhibits attractive catalytic performance for methanol oxidation and exhibits a maximum current density of 157 mA cm-2, while having an onset potential of 1.314 V (versus RHE). Thus, the prepared nanocluster-aggregated microspherical architecture of Ce2(MoO4)3 can efficiently serve as the next-generation multifunction materials for energy storage and energy conversion applications.
