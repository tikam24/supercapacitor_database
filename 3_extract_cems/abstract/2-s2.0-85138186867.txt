Polydiphenylamine (PDPA) finds many applications as a conducting polymer due to its unique properties. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of PDPA nanoparticles (PDPA NPs) and PDPA nanorods (PDPA NRs) via microwave and ultrasonication approach towards energy storage application. The morphology of synthesized PDPA nanostructures was captured through scanning electron microscope. The crystallinity and molecular vibrational studies of synthesized PDPA nanostructures was analysed through X-ray diffraction studies and Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopic technique. Also, the electrochemical properties of the fabricated PDPA nanoelectrodes were characterized through cyclic voltammetry, impedance and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies. The specific capacitance of PDPA-NPs and PDPA-NRs using cyclic voltammetry curves and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies was found to be 97 F/g and 156 F/g at 25 mV/s scan rate and 166 F/g and 194 F/g at 10 mA/g current density, respectively. PDPA-NPs and PDPA-NRs exhibit remarkable cyclic retention and stability over 1000 cycles (83% and 85%, respectively). The columbic efficiency of PDPA-NPs and PDPA-NRs was found to be 96% and 98%, respectively. These results indicate that the synthesized PDPA nanostructures are potentially worthy to be used as an electrode material and would be used in future energy storage systems.
