Bimetallic oxides ABO x (x = 2, 3, and 4) with multiple lattice sites have shown numerous properties, blossoming into diverse applications, while regulating the valence state at the A or B site usually causes a dramatic change in the crystal structure, giving rise to uncertainties in comprehending the structure-property relationships. Herein, we synthesized bimetallic layered crednerite CuMnO 2 with double-coordinate Cu cations at the A site and hexa-coordinate Mn cations at the B site via a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) modified hydrothermal method. By controlling the crystal growth temperature, valence states tailoring was implemented along with the stabilization of the monoclinic layered structure. The regulation process was followed by morphology changes of the CuMnO 2 crystal in a sequence: triangular sheets (140 째C), nanowires (160 째C), hexagonal prisms (180 째C), and octahedrons (over 200 째C). Interestingly, the oxidation states of Cu 2+ and Mn 2+ were found for triangular sheets, which transformed to the mixed valency Cu + /Cu 2+ and Mn 3+ /Mn 2+ for nanowires, and then to the dominant Cu + and Mn 3+ oxidation states for hexagonal prisms and octahedrons. Among all morphologies, nanowires showed a higher aspect ratio, preferentially growing along the (002) plane, which when first applied to a supercapacitor, exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 921 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. The synergistic effect between the special redox equilibrium and controlled one-dimensional crystal architecture is uncovered to optimize the electrochemical energy storage. The methodology reported in this work creates a new path of functional bimetallic oxides ABO x with tailored valence states, controllable crystal growth, and stable crystal structure for optimum energy storage applications.
