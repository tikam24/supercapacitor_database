To develop materials with enhanced electrochemical properties, an original synthesis strategy based on the exfoliation and restacking of manganese and cobalt layered transition metal oxides has been explored. Successful exfoliation yielded "building nanoblocks", which were further reassembled in mixed nanocomposites, by modifications of electrostatic interactions in solution. Three methods were tested, differing by the acidification procedure and time of mixing. The restacking conditions play a key role on the microstructural homogeneity of the nanocomposites. Such a nanocomposite approach marrying a good electronic conductor (cobalt oxyhydroxide) with a pseudocapacitive material (manganese oxide) should thus be very beneficial for development of highly efficient pseudocapacitors.
