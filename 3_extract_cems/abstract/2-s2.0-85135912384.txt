We report the effect of mechanical alloying on the chemically synthesized NiCo2O4 nanowire for better electrochemical performance. The nickel cobaltite nanowires (NC) were successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal method without any surfactant. Then they were milled for 1 h (NC1) and 2 h (NC2) to boost the electrochemical performance. The structural and microstructural parameters, shape, size, and morphology of these samples are revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) characterization and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model reveal that the NC1 sample offers the highest specific surface area among all three samples with its one-dimensional mesoporous structure (pore diameter, âˆ¼7 nm). The NC1 sample displays an excellent specific capacitance and rate capability (1234 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1). However, upon further milling (2 h) the electrochemical performance of the sample decays rapidly due to an increase in particle size and reduction in specific surface area. A remarkable specific capacity of 1196 F g-1 is achieved in the 1 h milled sample at the lowest current density of 12 A g-1, and at 40 A g-1 and 129.2 F g-1 specific capacitance can be retained. We further demonstrate an asymmetric device based on the NC1 sample as a positive electrode, which produces an excellent energy density of 59.221 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 1065.4 W kg-1. The assembled device can attain an outstanding power density of 10.992 kW kg-1 at an enormous high current density of 13.33 A g-1 and demonstrates an excellent cyclic performance of 91.7% retention after 5000 cycles.
