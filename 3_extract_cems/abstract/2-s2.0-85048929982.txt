The ever-growing global energy demand and rapid depletion of fossil fuels on day-to-day life drive researchers to think about an alternate and efficient storage system. Supercapacitors have drawn considerable attention due to their moderate energy and power densities than batteries and capacitors respectively. Seeking to the high energy delivery with large power for prolonged cycle life, the material with excellent electrochemical behavior and extended structural stability got tremendous attraction towards the stable and sustainable storage system. Here the metal oxide of large theoretical capacitance (Mn3O4) compositing with structurally more stable perovskite oxide (LaMnO3) through a one-pot synthesis route to form LaMnO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposite of high electrochemical performance. The one-pot synthesize method provides a unique combination of Mn3O4 and LaMnO3, which brings out a remarkable synergetic effect and enhanced electrochemical behavior such as high energy density, large power density and long-lasting cycle life. The composite electrode exhibits a maximum energy density of 75 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1000 W kg−1 and the electrode could deliver a colossal power density of 15 k W kg−1 without compromising much in energy density (41.6 Wh kg−1) by symmetric cell design. From these findings, we strongly propose the one-pot synthesized LaMnO3/Mn3O4 nanocomposite as a promising candidate for high energy supercapacitor electrode application.
