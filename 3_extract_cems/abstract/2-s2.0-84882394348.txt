We report a facile strategy to synthesize polyaniline/molybdenum disulfide (PANI/MoS2) nanocompositeby in situ polymerization to achieve excellent electrochemical properties for application as supercapaci-tor electrodes. MoS2nanocomposite with graphene-like subunits structure is prepared by a hydrothermalmethod and serves as an excellent 2D conductive skeleton that supports a highly electrolytic accessiblesurface area of redox-active PANI and provides a direct path for electrons. The layered nanostructure ofPANI/MoS2composites provides a larger contact surface area for the intercalation/deintercalation of pro-tons into/out of active materials and shortens the path length for electrolyte ion transport. The structureof the composite is characterized by scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis, and theelectrochemical performances of the composites are evaluated by cyclic voltammogram and galvanostaticcharge-discharge. The maximum specific capacitance of 575 F g -1at 1 A g-1is observed at the PANI/MoS2electrodes. The energy density of 265 W h kg-1is obtained at a power density of 18.0 kW kg-1. In addition,the PANI/MoS2composite electrode shows excellent long-term cyclic stability (less than 2% decrease inspecific capacitance after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1), indicating a positive synergistic effectof MoS2and PANI for the improvement of electrochemical performance.
