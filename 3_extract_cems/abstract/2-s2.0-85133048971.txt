The growing demand for mobile electrical devices such as electric vehicles has led to more extensive and in-depth research on alkali metal ion batteries and supercapacitors. Various metal phosphides have the advantages of large natural reserves of raw materials and low pollution. More importantly, metal phosphides have high theoretical capacity as alkali metal ion batteries and exhibit extremely high capacitance as pseudocapacitive electrode materials, making them potential electrode materials for next-generation alkali metal ion batteries and supercapacitors. In this paper, the recent research on metal phosphide-based electrode materials for alkali metal ion batteries and supercapacitors is reviewed. First, the basic principles of alkali metal ion batteries and supercapacitors are introduced. Then, various modification strategies and effects for metal phosphides are summarized. Finally, the problems and prospects of metal phosphide electrode materials are put forward.
