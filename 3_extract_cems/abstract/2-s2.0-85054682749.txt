The development of advanced electrode materials for various energy-storage systems, especially the fabrication of designed structures and morphologies of electrode materials, has attracted intense interest in both the academic and industrial fields. Among the various synthesis methods, electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) is a simple but versatile approach, by which materials can be fabricated with various morphologies, such as granular, dense, and porous, in an easily controllable manner. Herein, motivated by the rapid advancements of the given technology, a comprehensive introduction of ESD is provided, with emphasis on the kinds of materials and the types of morphology that can be obtained, along with the important control parameters. The progress on electrode materials, which are applied in a great variety of energy-storage systems, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, supercapacitors, Li–S batteries, and Li–O2 batteries, prepared by ESD is also summarized. How the specific morphologies designed by ESD improve the electrochemical performance for different types of electrode materials is also discussed. The aim is to promote the collaborative efforts among different communities to optimize and develop the ESD technique and to explore advanced electrode materials for energy storage.
