The Divertor Tokamak Test (DTT) facility is expected to provide relevant contribution to the nuclear fusion research, in particular to the first fusion reactor DEMO. Even though the main scope of DTT is the study of the fusion power exhaust, DTT is a complete last-generation tokamak with many power supply (PS) systems. The PSs controlling the poloidal magnetic fields are particularly challenging not only due to the extremely high current amplitude, but also because the field must be continuously changed. Moreover, the PS system must be able to rapidly discharge the superconducting coils without interrupting the current flow. The benefits expected by the technologies adopted for the DTT poloidal PSs are described in this paper, in particular focusing on the impact on the external grid and on the energy consumption.
