Rapid and efficient green synthesis of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) material has been carried out (by the reduction of graphite oxide (GO)) with tulasi (Holy Basil) green tea extract followed by microwave irradiation technique in 1 min. As prepared rGO material shows outstanding multifunctional performance as electrodes for supercapacitors and efficient adsorption of toxic organic dyes from aqueous solutions. The electrochemical performance of rGO electrode for supercapacitor showed that, it exhibits high specific capacitance of 164.6 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 under aqueous 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution, good rate capability (59.6% retention when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g-1). After 3000 cycles, the attenuation of the specific capacitance is less than 5%, indicating excellent electrochemical stability. Moreover, the maximum adsorption capacity of rGO reaches 416.7 mg/g for malachite green dyes at equilibrium under aqueous solutions.
