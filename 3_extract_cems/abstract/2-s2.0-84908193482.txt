Aligned spinel Mn-Ni-Co ternary oxide (MNCO) nanowires are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. As an electrode of supercapacitors, the MNCO nanowire array on nickel foam shows an outstanding specific capacitance of 638 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability. This exceptional performance benefits from its nanowire architecture, which can provide large reaction surface area, fast ion and electron transfer, and good structural stability. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with high energy density is assembled successfully by employing the MNCO nanowire array as positive electrode and carbon black as negative electrode. The excellent electrochemical performances indicate the promising potential application of the ASC device in the energy storage field.
