Cobalt-iron oxides have attracted much attention as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Graphene loaded with cobalt ferrite (CoFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles can exhibit enhanced specific capacitance. Here, we present three-dimensional (3D) crumpled graphene (CGR) loaded with CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles. The CoFe 2 O 4 -graphene composites were synthesized from a colloidal mixture of GO, FeCl 3 ⋅6H 2 O, and CoCl 2 ⋅6H 2 O by one step aerosol spray pyrolysis. The CoFe 2 O 4 -GR composites displayed a morphology resembling a crumpled paper ball, and the size of the CoFe 2 O 4 and CGR in the composites was around 5 nm and 500 nm, respectively. The highest specific capacitance of the CoFe 2 O 4 -graphene composites was 253 F g –1 .
