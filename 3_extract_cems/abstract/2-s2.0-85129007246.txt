The paper studies the innovative control application of sliding mode control (SMC) for hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) in on-grid and off-grid operation modes. The proposed HRES contains a photovoltaic (PV) system as the principal energy source which is coupled to DC bus using DC-DC boost converter. This converter is controlled by MPPT algorithm depending to Perturb and Observe (P&O) method managed by SMC to extract MPP of PV modules. Therefore, the battery and supercapacitor are interfaced by a bidirectional DC-DC converters that can be charged and discharged depending on the energy production of the system. However, the voltage source converter (VSC) that is controlled by SMC was used for controlling the amplitude and the frequency of the output voltage delivered to the AC load and injected into the grid. To better appreciate the advantages of the proposed SMC approach, we have proposed a series of comparative tests with the conventional PI control in the operating grid modes (connected and standalone) under different scenarios. To conclude, the proposed control strategy for HRES have shown so many advantages such as the control effectiveness, performance and deliver low THD values compared with the conventional PI control. Besides that, it has shown an increase of the HRES stability and quality.
