In this paper, we designed a novel multicolor electrochromic (EC) device having hybrid capacitor electrochromic device based on 4, 4 '-biphenyl dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester and phenothiazine molecule with carbon electrode. The EC properties of the device were analyzed and discussed for the possibility to multicolor representation.
