Carbon materials and their diverse allotropes have played important roles in our daily lives and the advancement of material science. After 0D “Carbon 60” and 1D “carbon-nanotube,” 2D-graphene nanomaterials have attracted significant attention since 2004 because of their unique and exciting properties. Over the last decade, 3D-graphene nanomaterials have been developed to efficiently use 2D-graphene nanosheets in applications like energy storage, environmental remediation, and electrochemical catalysis. We describe 3D graphene materials, classify them, briefly discuss their history, and cover this review's basic synthesis chemical procedures. Special attention is given to their bibliometric analysis, advancement, synthesis, technical applications of energy storage devices, environmental applications, and supercapacitor-based applications. The CiteSpace (6.1. R3) software is used for the bibliometric analysis findings from 2012 to 2023 for keywords, countries, journals, co-occurrence, and co-author networks. Data were taken from 1142 papers, 71 review articles, and 1071 article proceedings over 12 years, from 2012 to 2023. The date of retrieval, November 10, 2022, was the latest.
