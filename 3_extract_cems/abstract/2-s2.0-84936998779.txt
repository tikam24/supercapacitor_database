The electrochemical properties of composite films prepared from electrically conducting polypyrrole (PPy) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated for supercapacitor applications. The Ppy coatings for obtaining hybrid PPy-CNTs electrodes were achieved by cyclic voltammetry under the following conditions: 50 successive cycles in the potential domain of 0.2- 0.85 V/SCE, at a scan rate of 20 mV/s, using aqueous solutions of either 0.1 M pyrrole in 0.2 M H2SO4 or 0.3 M pyrrole in 0.2 M oxalic acid as electrolytes. The CNTs were grown on the oxidized Si substrate by the chemical vapour deposition and PPy was subsequently coated on them by electrochemical polymerization. The large surface area and high conductivity of the CNTs on the Si/Fe catalyst substrate enhance the energy storage capacity. PPy provides additional capacitance as an active material. Furthermore, PPy acts as a conducting binder for connecting every individual CNT to increase the capacitance. The morphology of composite films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical capacitance properties of the composite films in 0.2 M H2SO4 or 0.2 M oxalic acid aqueous solutions were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique.
