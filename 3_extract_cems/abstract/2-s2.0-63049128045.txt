Supercapacitor can be used for energy storage and peak power control in order to increase the efficiency and the life cycle of the system. Recent developments in the field of supercapacitors have led to the achievement of high specific energy and high specific power devices. Due to the capacitances of several hundred farads and serial resistances of less than one milliohm, these new components are suitable for energy storage in high power electronic applications, especially in the field of management of embarked electrical power (hybrid power sources, energy recovery). This paper presents a method to identify the equivalent circuit parameters of supercapacitor by the experimental results. In order to validate this method, parameters of a Maxwell BCAP 3000F are extracted from the experiment and then the equivalent circuit model using parameters is implemented by using the PSiM software. Finally, experimental and simulation results are compared to verify the electric modeling of some supercapacitors. Â©2008 IEEE.
