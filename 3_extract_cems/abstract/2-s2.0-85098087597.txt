Boosting practical capacitance of anodes is one of keys to the development of aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Herein, 3D interconnected Fe-Co-S nanosheets network with plenty of wrinkles grown on graphene coated Ni foam (GNF) is obtained by rationally controlling the micro-morphology of Fe-Co-S. Such a unique structure forms abundant pores and creates large accessible surface area and high porosity to favor high capacitance while the wrinkles netting with each other is favorable for charge transfer in the active materials. Meanwhile, energy storage mechanism of the Fe-Co-S anode reveals that both Fe and Co elements contribute capacitance via Fe0/Fe2+/Fe3+ and Co0/Co2+ reversible redox reactions during charging and discharging processes. As a result, the prepared Fe-Co-S/GNF delivers a high specific capacitance of 1.7 F/cm2 (850 F/g) at a current density of 1 mA/cm2. Coupled with a Ni-Bi-S/NF cathode, a specific capacitance of 7.54 F/cm3 and a remarkable energy density of 2.68 mWh/cm3 at a high current density of 16.67 mA/cm2 are obtained for the Ni-Bi-S/NF//Fe-Co-S/GNF aqueous ASC. Even at a super-high current density of 83.33 mA/cm2, those values still keep at 2.99 F/cm3 and 1.06 mWh/cm3, respectively. These findings display the huge application potential of the Fe-Co-S/GNF anode for ASCs.
