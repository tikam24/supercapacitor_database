Hot trends have always been the successful production of green energies and the promotion of the added value of agricultural goods. In this research, we introduced a new type of porous carbon material which, after extracting oil from the Yellowhorn for high-performance supercapacitors, uses H3PO4 as an activator and is made from biomass waste. To date, experiments on nitrogen adsorption/desorption indicate that H3PO4-activated bio-carbon has strong pore-forming potential, while the basic surface area is 1530.18 m2 /g. The average pore volume of is 0.97 cm3 /g. In contrast, carbon content electrochemical efficiency demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 246.5 F / g in 6 M KOH aqueous solution at 1A/g. However, a high energy density of 34.24Wh/kg is also provided by the proposed symmetrical supercapacitor. at a density of 500 W/kg of power. The above results thus suggest that the by-product of biomass waste is an outstanding substitute material for highperformance supercapacitor preparation.
