A great deal of researches have been dedicated to achieve thin, lightweight, and flexible energy storage devices for wearable electronics. However, the electrodes used for flexible supercapacitors usually have poor electronic and ionic conductivities, resulting in their limited performance in power density and cycling stability. Herein, we developed a flexible, high-performance and low-cost electrode based on PEDOT:PSS wrapped MWNT/MnO2 composite for the high performance supercapacitor applications. Triton X-100 was used to improve the wettability of the MWNT surface and achieve better dispersion effect in the solution. PEDOT:PSS can further penetrate into the Triton X-100 wrapped MWNTs with enhanced electric conductivity and electrochemical stability. A high specific capacitance of 428.2 F/g, with a high energy density of 63.8 Wh kgâˆ’1 and good cycle stability can be obtained. These results demonstrated the great potential of the as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS wrapped MWCNT/MnO2 composite for flexible, low-cost, high-performance energy storage devices.
