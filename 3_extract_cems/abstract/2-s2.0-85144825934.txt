Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has always been the ideal electrode material for supercapacitors due to its non-toxic nature and high theoretical capacity (1370 F gâˆ’1). Over the past few years, significant progress has been made in the development of high performance MnO2-based electrode materials. This review summarizes recent research progress in experimental, simulation and theoretical studies for the modification of MnO2-based electrode materials from different perspectives of morphology engineering, defect engineering and heterojunction engineering. Several main approaches to achieve enhanced electrochemical performance are summarized, respectively increasing the effective active site, intrinsic conductivity and structural stability. On this basis, the future problems and research directions of electrode materials are further envisaged, which provide theoretical guidance for the adequate design and synthesis of MnO2-based electrode materials for use in supercapacitors.
