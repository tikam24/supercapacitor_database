A hybrid energy storage system has been proposed using supercapacitor and compressed air [1] in order to store energy from photovoltaic panels. A simulation model is developed using Energetic Macroscopic Representation. Such a description can be used to deduce new control laws of the hybrid storage system using specific inversion rules. The simulation model is validated by comparison with experimental results. Â©2007 IEEE.
