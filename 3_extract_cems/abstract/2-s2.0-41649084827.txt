Hydrothermal method was used to prepare MnO2 powders with two diverse morphologies of urchin sphere and nanowire. The microstructure and supercapacitor properties of MnO2 powders were characterized by XRD, SEM, CV, AC impedance. The results show that MnO2 powders prepared using different reacted agents have different morphologies under the same condition; the pure γ-MnO2 phase shows urchin sphere morphology with the diameters from 1 to 10μm, while the pure α-MnO2 shows nanowire morphology with the diameter of 50 nm and the length more than 1μm. MnO2 powders with two different morphologies have excellent capacitance behaviors in 2 mol/L (NH4) 2SO4 solution. The specific capacitance is 244 F/g for urchin sphere-structured MnO2, and 159 F/g for nanowire-structured MnO2 at the current of 2 mA/cm2. The results of AC impedance indicate that urchin sphere-structured MnO2 has better capacitive properties than nanowire-structured MnO2.
