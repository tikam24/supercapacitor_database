Although nickel–cobalt bimetallic sulfides have been widely studied for supercapacitor electrodes, how to obtain high specific capacity and cycle stability is still an important challenge. Here, an efficient chemical redox method is used to adjust the crystal and electronic structure of cobalt–nickel sulfide (NCS) via B doping, combined with electrospinning technology and conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy) coating to facilitate faraday redox reactions and obtain high energy density electrode materials. The resulting composite with boron-doped nickel–cobalt sulfide on electrospinned carbon nanofibers with polypyrrole-coating (PPy@B-NCS/CNF) has a high specific capacity (751.61C/g at 1 A/g) and good cycle stability (82.49 % retention after 4000 cycles at 5 A/g). With PPy@B-NCS/CNF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is prepared. It has excellent electrochemical properties with a power density of 65.58 Wh kg−1 and an energy density of 819.72 W kg−1. The low-temperature performance test shows high reversibility, which provides the possibility for the development of low-temperature electrolytes. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) explains that B-doped NCS has better electrochemical properties from the energy band and state density.
