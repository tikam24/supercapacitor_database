Wearable electronics have attracted much attention in recent years, and textiles have been considered as the desirable substrate. However, it remains a critical challenge to fabricate electronic textiles that are multifunctional, breathable, highly conductive, and elastic. Herein, we develop a novel chemical polymerization and coating strategy to construct interconnected networks of polyaniline (PANI) nanoarrays and MXene on the fiber surface. The fabricated PANI nanoarrays/MXene modified rib knitting fabric exhibit low electrical resistance and good elasticity. The all-solid-state PANI/MXene fabric-based supercapacitors show a high specific capacitance and energy density of 647 mF/cm2 and 8.08 μWh/cm2, respectively, which is higher than most MXene-based textiles. Moreover, the PANI/MXene fabrics demonstrate anisotropic yet exceptional strain sensing performance, including high sensitivity (gauge factor, 435.0), linearity (>0.9), and wide range (0–40.8%), which enables them as wearable sensors to detect large human motions accurately. This work provides a new approach to accomplishing high-performance textile-based wearable electronics.
