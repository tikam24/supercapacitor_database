Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) and hybrid zeolite imidazole framework (HZ) are an emerging biomaterial and a porous carbonous material, respectively. The composite of these two materials could have versatile physiochemical characteristics. A cellulose nanofiber and cobalt-containing zeolite framework-based composite was prepared using an in-situ and eco-friendly chemical method followed by pyrolysis. The composite was comprised of cobalt nanoparticles decorated on highly graphitized N-doped nanoporous carbons (NPC) wrapped with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) produced from the direct carbonization of HZ. By varying the ratio of CNF in the composite, we de-termined the optimal concentration and characterized the derived samples using sophisticated techniques. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the functionalization of CNF in the metallic cobalt-covered N-doped NPC wrapped with CNTs. The CNF–HZNPC composite electrodes show superior electrochemical performance, which is suitable for supercapacitor applications; its specific capacitance is 146 F/g at 1 A/g. Furthermore, the composite electrodes retain a cycling stability of about 90% over charge–discharge cycles at 10 A/g. The superior electrochemical properties of the cellulose make it a promising candidate for developing electrodes for energy storage applications.
