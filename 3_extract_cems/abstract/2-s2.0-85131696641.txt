Natural wood has been physically or chemically modified to create new hierarchical structures for vast applications. We report herein the facile methods to synthesize porous flexible conductive wood for high-performance energy storage. Our delignification and densification increase micro-mesopores for higher surface area but decrease macropores to improve the scaffold's density, thus leading to ultra-high flexibility and excellent mechanical strength. Such hydroxyl-enriched flexible wood scaffolds (FW-RC) are readily chemically deposited with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to promote fast electron/ion transport and a lower internal resistance (ca. 2.1 Ï‰). Interestingly, the as-prepared CNT@FW-RC electrode exhibited organic redox reactions originating from oxygen-containing groups on the wood surface. The electrode showed an areal specific capacitance of 640 mF cm-2 at a 0.1 mA cm-2 scan rate and over 93% capacitance retention for 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles, outperforming most reported carbonized wood electrodes. Asymmetric supercapacitors demonstrated a maximum energy density of 108 mW h L-1 at the power density of 2.06 W L-1, which retains a value of 36 mW h L-1 at the highest volumetric power density of 20.5 W L-1. Further in situ electrodeposition of conducting polymers on the CNTs@wood electrodes was explored for scalable energy storage devices. The design strategies surely provide guidance on constructing porous flexible wood-based hierarchical nanostructures for emerging applications, utilizing surface functional groups of the wood surface for organic redox reactions.
