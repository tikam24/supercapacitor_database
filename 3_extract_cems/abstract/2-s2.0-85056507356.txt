Paper presents comparison of two Energy Storage Devices: Based on Flywheel and based on Supercapacitor. Units were designed for LINTE^2 power system laboratory owned by Gdansk University of Technology in Poland. Both Storage Devices are based on bi-directional IGBT Power Converters and Functional Unit Controller comprising Simulink Real-Time platform and control system model designed and parametrized in Simulink. In the first paragraph introductory information about the LINTE^2 laboratory project and Power System Functional Units is provided. In the second paragraph parameters and control functions assignment of both devices are listed. Communication interfaces, Simulink Real-Time platform and other implementation details are described in the third chapter. In the fourth chapter experimental results from both devices are presented and compared.
