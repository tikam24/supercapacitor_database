Conducting polymer-based nanofibers possesses not only the electrical and optical properties of metal and non-polar semiconductors but also the flexible mechanical properties and machinability of organic polymers, as well as electrochemical redox activity. Due to the unique characteristics of nanoscale and linear morphology, conducting polymer-based nanofibers are manifested in surface trait, small size effect, quantum size effect, and macroscopic quantum positive tunnel effect, especially in high sensitivity through the doping of metal nanoparticles, which are in line with the development trend of wearable devices with miniaturization, multi-function, flexibility, and intelligence. Therefore, conducting polymer-based nanofibers have potential applications in energy, optoelectronic devices, sensors, molecular conductors, and other fields. This chapter mainly introduces the properties, synthesis methods, and applications of conductive polymer nanofibers for electrochemical energy storage.
