The replacement of a conventional synchronous generator (SG) with higher wind penetration greatly reduces the inertial support available for the system. Therefore, a new consideration – the dynamic frequency changes in a wind energy system using a super-capacitor (SC) – is proposed here to provide faster, limitless, inertial response during load disturbances. By considering the dynamic frequency change in defining the power exchange between SC and network, this proposed method not only provides inertial and primary frequency response but is also able to avoid a second frequency dip. To avoid deep charge and discharge of SC, a simple energy management system (EMS) which considers the system frequency deviation and the state of charge (SOC) of SC is adopted in this technique. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is modelled in MATLAB/Simulink software. Comparative analyses between the proposed virtual inertial support (VIS)-based SC and existing VIS control strategies are performed. The simulation results obtained prove that the proposed VIS greatly reduces the frequency nadir and peak frequency of the system during sudden load increase and decrease, respectively.
