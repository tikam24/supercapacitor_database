MXenes, a novel family of 2D materials, have shown promise in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and energy storage. Among the many structures composed of MXenes, MXene films with ultra-thin thickness and high flexibility show great advantages in the field of EMI shielding and energy storage. Herein, an insight into the progress made towards the application of MXene films for EMI shielding and capacitive energy storage is provided, with a special focus on advances in general strategies. Recent progress in the fabrication of MXene films is presented. The factors that directly influence EMI shielding and capacitive performance are discussed. Furthermore, the future challenge, research orientation, and prospect for these EMI shielding and energy storage materials are also highlighted and discussed.
