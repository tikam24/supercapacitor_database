In line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the world is witnessing a phenomenal shift toward renewable energy. With this, the demand for energy storage devices has gained immense attention from researchers worldwide over the past decades and so have concerns pertaining to the disposal and management of material and energy wastes from various energy resources. Because of their unique features such as high power density, long cycling stability, and high capacitance, supercapacitors have emerged as a promising technology for storing energy. This review focuses on some of the recent advances in supercapacitors in the wake of solid waste and energy management. First, the utilization of a range of solid waste materials in the fabrication of supercapacitors is summarized. Thereafter, the roles of some of the recently developed “green” electrolytes in curbing the detrimental effects of waste generation from supercapacitors are discussed. Furthermore, different applications of supercapacitors in the field of energy management are highlighted. The strategies for the management of waste generated on account of a supercapacitor's end of life are also reported. The review is concluded by outlining some of the unarticulated challenges as well as the personal outlook of the authors in this area.
