Polyaniline is one of the most studied conductive polymers used for fabricating pseudo-capacitors, but its low cycling stability impedes its application. This low cycling stability is closely related to the degradation of PANI, in which water plays an important role. To address this problem, non-aqueous solution (LiClO4/propylene carbonate or LiClO 4/propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate) is used as the supporting electrolyte to test the capacitive performance of PANI on graphite electrodes (PANI/GR). Experimental results show that the PANI/GR electrodes can maintain stable for 30,000 cycles without any decrease in specific capacitance values. Furthermore, the degradation of PANI can be avoided even when the upper limit potential is increased to 1.00 V vs. SCE. Consequently, this non-aqueous system is beneficial in improving both the cycling stability and energy density of PANI based pseudo-capacitors, which shows great promising application in sustainable and environmentally friendly energy storage devices.
