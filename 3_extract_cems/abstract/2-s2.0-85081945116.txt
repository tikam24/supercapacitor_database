Kinetic energy is an ideal energy source for powering wearable devices or internet of things (IoTs) because of its abundant availability. Currently, most kinetic energy harvesting systems are based on friction or deformation, which require high-frequency motion or high material durability for sustainable energy harvesting. Here, we introduce selective ion sweeping in a hybrid cell consisting of an ion-adsorbing activated carbon and an ion-hosting Prussian blue analogue nanoparticle for electrochemical kinetic energy harvesting. The flow of electrolyte induced by kinetic motion of the cell causes ion sweeping only on the surface of the supercapacitor and induces current flow between the supercapacitor and the battery electrode. This method exhibits 24.9 μW cm-2 as maximum power of system with 34 ω load in half-cell test, which is several thousand times smaller than the load used in conventional methods. In a long-term test with full cell, this method supplies a continuous current flow 6 μA cm-2 at the flow of 40 mL min-1 for 500 cycles without performance decay. The prototype of the hybrid cell demonstrated kinetic energy harvesting from bare hand press with the various flow speeds from 0.41 to 1.39 cm s-1 as well as walking, running, and door closing, which are representative examples of low-frequency kinetic motions in daily life. We believe that the simple structure of the hybrid cell will enable power supply to various applications from miniaturized systems (e.g., IoTs and wearables) to large-scale systems (e.g., ocean wave energy harvesting).
