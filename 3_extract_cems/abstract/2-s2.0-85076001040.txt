This paper deals with an ultracapacitor (UC) model and its identification procedure. To take UC’s fractional characteristic into account, two constant phase elements (CPEs) are used to construct a model structure according to impedance spectrum analysis. The different behaviors of UC such as capacitance, resistance, and charge distribution dynamics are simulated by the corresponding part in the model. The resistance under different voltages is calculated through the voltage rebound method to explore its non-linear characteristics and create a look-up table. A nonlinear fractional model around an operation voltage is then deduced by applying the resistance table. This time identification is carried by a proposed hybrid optimization algorithm: Nelder-Mead seeker algorithm (NMSA), which embeds the Nelder–Mead Simplex (NMS) method into the seeker optimization algorithm (SOA). Its time behavior has been compared with the linear fractional model for charging and discharging current profiles at different levels.
