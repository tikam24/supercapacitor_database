This paper reports a novel silicon three-dimensional (3D) micro supercapacitor, featured by a high-aspect-ratio structure and nano porous composite electrode material. Electrochemical characterization results of the prototype with NaNO3 electrolyte demonstrate that the 3D supercapacitor exhibits both large capacitance (90.7mF/cm2) and fast power delivery (51.5mW/cm2) per unit area. A very robust stability and high charge/discharge efficiencies (more than 93%) are also observed. As such, it is believed that this work presents a promising approach to achieve micro supercapacitors that are applicable in various energy systems such as micro power suppliers and energy storage devices.
