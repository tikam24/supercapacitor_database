3D porous carbonaceous materials were prepared by combining pre-carbonization and KOH activation with sakura petals as raw materials. The prepared porous sakura carbon (SAC-4) exhibits a high specific surface area, a suitable pore size distribution, a low proportion of oxygen-rich groups and N functional groups, and a partially graphitized phase, which are very beneficial for the electrochemical performance of the material as a supercapacitor electrode. In the activation step, when the mass ratio of KOH to sakura carbon (SC) is 4, a supercapacitor is prepared. A maximal specific capacitance of 265.8 F g -1 is obtained when the current density is 0.2 A g -1 . When the current density is 1 A g -1 , after 2000 cycles in succession, the capacitance retention rate is excellent and the cycling stability can reach as high as 90.2%. The obtained results indicate that porous carbon prepared with sakura blossom as the raw material is an effective and environmentally friendly electrode material for energy storage.
