Morphological engineering is an efficient approach for enhancing the performance of materials. Herein, the synthesis of 2D Cu2WS4 possesses a nanoflakes structure is reported. The obtained materials have been characterized by various techniques to explore their phase formation, electronic properties, and surface morphology. The first-principles density functional theory-based calculations predict the structural properties of the materials. Benefiting from the architectures of Cu2WS4 nanoflakes, excellent electrochemical performances such as a wide potential range (-0.8 to 0.4 V), a high specific capacitance of 928.8 Fg−1, and prolonged cycling stability have been attained. Furthermore, a novel combination of all-solid-state supercapacitor was proposed with Cu2WS4 nanoflakes as cathode and activated carbon as the anode which delivered a high energy density of 25.77 Wh kg−1 and power density of 4590 W kg−1 with capacitive retention of 94 % over 5000 cycles. These properties ensure that the Cu2WS4 nanoflakes are a promising negative electrode material for energy storage applications.
