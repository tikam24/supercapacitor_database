Hybrid materials PPy/Ni-Co LDH based on polypyrrole nanotubes and Ni-Co LDH from ZIF-67 templates were employed as electrode materials for supercapacitors, where Ni-Co LDH possesses a hollow structure. With the help of appreciative composition and a hollow structure, the optimum PPy/Ni-Co LDH shows an excellent performance with high specific capacitances (4.4 C cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and 3.35 C cm-2 at 20 mA cm-2).
