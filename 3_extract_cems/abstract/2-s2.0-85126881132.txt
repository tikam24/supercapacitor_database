This work reports the supercapacitor performance of Z-type barium hexaferrite (Ba3Co2Fe24O41) nanoplatelets prepared by citrate-nitrate auto combustion approach. The single-phase Z-Type hexagonal structure was confirmed through structural investigation using XRD results. Metal oxygen stretching bands in various environments such as tetragonal and octahedral coordinates has been confirmed using FTIR spectra. Hexagonal plate-like shaped grains were clearly seen from the morphological studies. The magnetic characteristics of Ba3Co2Fe24O41 sample were calibrated with VSM instrument at room temperature. The maximum saturation magnetization of 52.72 emu/g, retentivity of 29.88 emu/g and a coercivity of 124.97 Oe were obtained for Ba3Co2Fe24O41 nanoplatelets. The electrochemical (EC) performance of the Ba3Co2Fe24O41 nanoplatelets was studied for the first time with CV, GCD and EIS analysis. There is no report in the literature on studying the electrochemical performance of such important Ba3Co2Fe24O41 hexaferrites. The electrochemical GCD studies exhibited non-symmetrical discharge curves and a significant specific capacitance of 126 F g−1 was attained at constant discharge current density (0.5 A g−1). The cyclic stability observation exposed 93% of capacitance retention after 1000 cycles, recommending the potential utilization of Ba3Co2Fe24O41 hexaferrites in energy-storable devices.
