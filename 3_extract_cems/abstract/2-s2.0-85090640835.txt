The cellulose/graphene oxide (GO) networks as the scaffold of free-standing aerogel electrodes are developed by using lithium bromide aqueous solution, as the solvent, to ensure the complete dissolution of cotton linter pulp and well dispersion/reduction of GO nanosheets. Polyaniline (PANI) nanoclusters are then coated onto cellulose/GO networks via in-situ polymerization of aniline monomers. By optimized weight ratio of GO and PANI, the ternary cellulose/GO3.5 /PANI aerogel film exhibits well-defined three-dimensional porous structures and high conductivity of 1.15 S/cm, which contributes to its high areal specific capacitance of 1218 mF/cm2 at the current density of 1.0 mA/cm2. Utilizing this cellulose/GO3.5 /PANI aerogel film as electrodes in a symmetric configuration supercapacitor can result in an outstanding energy density as high as 258.2 µWh/cm2 at a power density of 1201.4 µW/cm2. Moreover, the device can maintain nearly constant capacitance under different bending deformations, suggesting its promising applications in flexible electronics.
