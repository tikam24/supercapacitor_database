Polyaniline (PANI) manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanocomposites were prepared by polymer coating and grafting approaches. The nanocomposites were fully characterized by XRD, TEM, ATR-IR and TG analyses. The PANI-grafted MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 417F/g at scan rate 5 mV/s−1. It showed the specific energy of 11.4 Wh/kg at specific power of 875 W/kg. Instead, the PANI-coated MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 271F/g at scan rate 5 mV/s−1. It showed the specific energy of 7.2 Wh/kg at specific power of 280 W/kg. The comparative analysis clearly demonstrated the superior performance of the polymer grafted nanocomposite.
