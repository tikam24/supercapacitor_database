A composite electrode based on polyaniline (PANI) and hydrous RuO 2 is prepared by electrochemical deposition of PANI onto hydrous RuO 2 (PANI/ RuO 2) and its supercapacitive properties are investigated using cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitances of PANI/RuO 2 and hydrous RuO 2 electrodes are determined to be 708 and 517 F g -1 at 5 mV s -1, respectively. Simple electrodeposition of PANI on the hydrous RuO 2 can achieve comparatively greater capacitance values. Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.
