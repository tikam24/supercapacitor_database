This paper presents a methodology for optimizing the size of energy storage system (ESS) for maximizing the capture of energy regenerated by a train. Besides, minimization of energy consumption from the substation, in order to obtain a return on investment, has also been explored. A standard structure of rail transit system has been used here for analysis. The optimization process takes into account the limitations of the transit system, such as catenary (third-rail voltage), and limitations in battery chemistry. The optimum size has been obtained using Genetic Algorithm and the results have been validated by developing a control strategy in MATLAB Simulink.
