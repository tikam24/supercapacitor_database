Herein, we report nanocomposite of titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods decorated reduced graphene oxide (TiO2/RGO) nanocomposite prepared using the simple, one-pot hydrothermal route for electrode material in supercapacitor applications. A systematic comparison study was carried out for the TiO2 nanorods coated on graphite foil in presence of alkaline media 3 M KOH, NaCl, and Na2SO4 using the three-electrode method. The TiO2/RGO composite shows an excellent specific capacitance (Csp) of 330 Fg-1 at the discharge current density 0.5 Ag-1 in presence of 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. The obtained highest specific capacitance values in order by various electrolytes are observed as KOH > NaCl > Na2SO4. The long-term cycle stability of charge and discharge cycle at current density 0.5 Ag-1 over 1000 cycles and only 8% decay in the specific capacitance of TiO2/RGO nanocomposite was observed in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The improved electrochemical performance TiO2/RGOcomposite in presence of KOH electrolyte is shown to be the most suitable electrode for the supercapacitors.
