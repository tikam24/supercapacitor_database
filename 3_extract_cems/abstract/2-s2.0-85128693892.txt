In this chapter some practical applications of electrochemically generated polymers are described. This chapter is focused on the utilization of electrochemically generated organic polymeric electrodes in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Electropolymerization is a very versatile procedure that can be used to construct organic films over metallic contacts or transparent conducting oxides. By selecting the correct polymerization group and the correct desired functionality, a significant number of monomers can be designed and synthesized to generate polymers. Some examples of devices based on electrogenerated organic polymers are solar cells, supercapacitors, and electrochromic devices. Solar cells convert sunlight into electric energy. Light absorption by the photoactive material produces electronâ€“hole pairs, which are later separated, and they travel to the electronic contacts generating an electric work. Supercapacitors can store the energy generated by other energy sources with the ability to transform it into electric energy for its utilization when it is necessary. Electrochromic devices can modulate the light intensity and spectral distribution that go through them by modifications in their optical properties when their redox properties are changed.
