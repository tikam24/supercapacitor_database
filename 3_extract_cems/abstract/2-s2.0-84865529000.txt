In this study, the polypyrrole-titania nanotube hybrid has been synthesized for an electrochemical supercapacitor application. The highly ordered and independent titania nanotube array is fabricated by an electro-oxidation of titanium sheet through an electrochemical anodization process in an aqueous solution containing ammonium fluoride, phosphoric acid and ethylene glycol. The polypyrrole- titania nanotube hybrid is then prepared by electrodepositing the conducting polypyrrole into well-aligned titania nanotubes through a normal pulse voltammetry deposition process in an organic acetonitrile solution containing pyrrole monomer and lithium perchlorate. The morphology and microstructure of polypyrrole-titania nanotube hybrid are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical capacitance performance is determined by cyclic voltammetry and charge/discharge measurement. It indicates that the polypyrrole film can been uniformly deposited on both surfaces of titania nanotube walls, demonstrating a heterogeneous coaxial nanotube structure. The specific capacitance of polypyrrole-titania nanotube hybrid is determined to be 179 Fg -1 based on the polypyrrole mass. The specific energy and specific power are 7.8 Wh kg -1 and 2.8 kW kg -1 at a constant charge/discharge current of 1.85 mA cm -2, respectively. The retained specific capacitance still keeps 85% of the initial capacity even after 200 cycle numbers. This result demonstrates the satisfying stability and durability of PPy-TiO 2 nanotube hybrid electrode in a cyclic charge/discharge process. Such a composite electrode material with highly ordered and coaxial nanotube hybrid structure can contribute high energy storage for supercapacitor applications. Â© Springer-Verlag 2012.
