In this paper, modular multilevel converter (MMC) based super capacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is employed as the front end of electrical energy router (EER) to access medium voltage distribution network. Utilization of energy storage capacity is limited by the state of charge (SOC) of each energy sub-module (ESM). To solve SOC balancing control issues, the concept of SOC equalization factor is introduced into the mathematical model. Then a modified SOC equalization control strategy among phase legs, upper and lower arms and ESMs in the same arm is obtained. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy improves robustness and dynamic performance of the system, especially suitable for EER applications in future energy system.
