Vesicular polyaniline (VPANI) has been fabricated for the first time via a facile two-step method, which uses high-quality multilamellar vesicular SiO2 as hard templates. The graphene-wrapped VPANI (VPANI@RGO) composites were prepared by self-assembling graphene oxide onto VPANI and subsequently conducting the hydrothermal reduction process. The morphological characterization of the composites confirms the uniform wrapping of the graphene sheets on the VPANI. The structural characterization of the composites reveals a strong π–π electron and hydrogen bond interaction in the composites. The VPANI@RGO composites exhibit an excellent supercapacitor performance with an enhanced specific capacitance (573 F g−1) and a good cycling stability, which maintains its capacity of up to 85.7 % over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1.
