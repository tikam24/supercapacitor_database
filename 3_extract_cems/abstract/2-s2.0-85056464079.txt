In the present work, we report the synthesis of Nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles employing hydrothermal technique. The surface morphology, crystal structure, porosity and vibrational response were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area and pore size analyzer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy. FESEM images confirm flower-like morphology of as-synthesized sample. XRD result reveal its polycrystalline nature and cubic structure of as-prepared NiO nanoparticles. FTIR results identified the surface functional groups attached with the molecules while Raman peaks show the characteristic vibrational mode and magnon excitation. Pore size and surface area analysis reveal the porosity in the synthesized sample and indicates its suitability use for electrochemical and photovoltaic devices. It was found that the NiO sample offered specific capacitance as high as 47.6 F g−1 (at scan rate of 10 mV s−1), when employed as working electrode in two-electrode assembly. Also, the synthesized sample provided efficiency of 0.92%, when employed to fabricate dye-sensitized solar cell. It is therefore a worthy candidate for further research.
