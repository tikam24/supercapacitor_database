Cobalt pyrophosphate (Co2P2O7) nano/microstructures (oblong plate, microplate, microflower, and hierarchical architectures) have been successfully synthesized through calcination of NH 4CoPO4·H2O nano/microstructures. More importantly, supercapacitive performances of Co2P2O 7 nano/microstructures were studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods in 3.0 M KOH solution. These results show that Co 2P2O7 hierarchical architecture electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance of 367 F g-1 at current density of 0.625 A g-1 in aqueous KOH solution. Co2P 2O7 hierarchical architecture electrodes remain 96.2 % of the initial specific capacitance after 3,000 charge/discharge cycles. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
