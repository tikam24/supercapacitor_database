Mesoporous NiCo 2 S 4 particles deposited on reduced graphite oxide (RGO) sheets using the co-polymer Pluronic F127 as a structure-directing agent have been successfully prepared as a supercapacitor electrode. The formation of F127 micelles alleviated the aggregation of the RGO sheets and generated NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles through hydrophilic affinity of ethylene oxide (EO) ends to produce porous channels during the hydrothermal process. This resulted in a large specific area of the prepared material, and superior electrochemical performance in terms of outstanding rate capability of 85.6% (from 1 A g −1 to 20 A g −1 ) and cycling stability (92.7% retention after 6500 cycles), features that are crucial for supercapacitors in practical application.
