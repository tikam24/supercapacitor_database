The search of low-cost, earth-abundant and high electro-capacitive electrode materials is significant for the practical application of supercapacitors. Here we introduce a simple and cost-effective strategy for one-step synthesis of self-supported NixP nanowires/Ni hybrid foam electrodes from commercially available Ni foams via low-temperature thermal phosphorization. This electrode exhibits superior electrochemical capacitive performance featured by an ultrahigh-rate performance (0.36 C cm−2 at 100 mA cm−2) and long cycling stability (a stable capacitance of 0.74 C cm−2 at 20 mA cm−2 for 5000 cycles), which benefits from the good electrical conductivity of NixP nanowires active materials on Ni foam and one-dimensional structure for NixP. This work demonstrates a facile and effective avenue to prepare a cheap and efficient super-capacitive electrode for the practical application of supercapacitors.
