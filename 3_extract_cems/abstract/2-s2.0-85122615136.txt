The pure and Zn doped CdS nanoparticles were synthesized using a simple method of co-precipitation. The structural, functional group and morphological analysis were carried through XRD, FTIR and SEM analysis. For supercapacitor applications, cyclic voltammetry analysis was studied for pure and Zn doped CdS nanostructures. From the XRD analysis all the samples were formed as a hexagonal crystal structure. SEM images show that the prepared Zn doped CdS formed like form as the flaks. The supercapacitor characterization (CV analysis) suggest that CdS and CdS-Zn electrodes are exhibit pseudocapacitive nature and it delivered the specific capacitance of 302 and 277 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1
