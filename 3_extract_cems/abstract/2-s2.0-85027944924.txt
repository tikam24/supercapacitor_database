A novel rambutan-like composite of MoS 2 /mesoporous carbon spheres were synthesized by a simple two-step hydrothermal and post-annealing approach via using glucose as C source and Na 2 MoO 4 ·2H 2 O and thiourea as Mo and S sources. It is found that the morphology and electrochemical properties can be effectively controlled by the change of the weight ratio of coated MoS 2 sheets to carbon spheres. When used as electrode material for supercapacitor, the hybrid MoS 2 /carbon spheres show a high specific capacity of 411 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and 272 F/g at a high discharge current density of 10 A/g. The annealing treatment at 700 °C transformed the core carbon spheres into mesoporous ones, which served as the conduction network and favor the enhancement of the specific capacitance. In addition, the strain released during the charge/discharge process can be accommodated and the structural integrity can be kept, improving the cycling life. After 1000 cycles, the capacitance retention of the hybrid MoS 2 /carbon spheres is 93.2%.
