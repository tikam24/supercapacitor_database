In this study, a reaction temperature-controlled synthesis of γ-MnOOH, Mn3O4and MnCO3(and also their mixture) on carbon clothviaa hydrothermal method is investigated, and the formation mechanism is discussed. The experiments demonstrate that the reducing ability of the carbon cloth tuned by the reaction temperature dominates the compositions and morphologies of the final products. A clear conversion process from Mn7O13·5H2O to MnCO3viaγ-MnOOH and Mn3O4on carbon cloth with an increase in the reaction temperature from 100 °C to 220 °C is confirmed. The electrochemical performance of γ-MnOOH on carbon cloth synthesized at 140 °C and MnCO3as the main component on carbon cloth synthesized at 220 °C are investigated and both show high performance.
