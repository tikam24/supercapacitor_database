Conductive inks for the future printed electronics should have the following merits: high conductivity, flexibility, low cost, and compatibility with wide range of substrates. However, the state-of-the-art conductive inks based on metal nanoparticles are high in cost and poor in flexibility. Herein, we reported a highly conductive, low cost, and super flexible ink based on graphene nanoplatelets. The graphene ink has been screen-printed on plastic and paper substrates. Combined with postprinting treatments including thermal annealing and compression rolling, the printed graphene pattern shows a high conductivity of 8.81 Ã— 104 S m-1 and good flexibility without significant conductivity loss after 1000 bending cycles. We further demonstrate that the printed highly conductive graphene patterns can act as current collectors for supercapacitors. The supercapacitor with the printed graphene pattern as the current collector and printed activated carbon as the active material shows a good rate capability of up to 200 mV s-1. This work potentially provides a promising route toward the large-scale fabrication of low cost yet flexible printed electronic devices.
