Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (NMCS) have been fabricated from zinc-based microporous metal–organic frameworks (ZIF-8) by pyrolysis in a molten salt medium. The as-prepared NMCS exhibit significantly improved specific capacitance (NMCS-8: 232 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and capacitance retention ratio (75.9 % at 50 A g−1) compared with the micropore-dominant nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedrons (NPCP-5: 178 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 15.9 % at 20 A g−1) obtained by direct pyrolysis of nanocrystalline ZIF-8. The excellent capacitive performance and high rate performance of the NMCS can be attributed to their unique combination of structure and composition, that is, the two-dimensional and hierarchically porous structure provides a short ion-transport pathway and facilitates the supply of electrolyte ions, and the nitrogen-doped polar surface improves the interface wettability when used as an electrode.
