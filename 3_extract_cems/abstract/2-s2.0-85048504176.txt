In the present paper, we deal with an analysis of hybrid structure of electrical vehicle. Power supply is obtained by managing electricity using a fuel cell system as principal source and supporting it with an ultra-capacitor stack as a secondary source. An energy management strategy based on frequency distribution which is developed to coordinate the hybrid power supply system dedicated to vehicular applications is presented in this paper. The strategy principle is based on attributing the low-frequency component of the load to the fuel cell and the high-frequency one to the ultracapacitor stack. Finally, the proposed method performances are evaluated through simulation under Matlab-Simulink and the results are presented for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).
