This study demonstrates the effect of power in microwave irradiation for providing sago waste based activated carbon. The physical characterization was performed for the carbon electrode and electrochemical properties was elucidate for the supercapacitor cells. The preparation of carbon electrodes begins by pre-carbonized, grinding and followed by sifting. The improvement of the pore properties of the carbon sample was carried out by chemical activation using KOH activating agent at a concentration of 0.2 M followed by microwave irradiation at a power variation of 200, 400, 600, 800 watts for 20 minutes. Carbon pellets were formed at a pressure of 8 tons and carbonized at 600 C in an N 2 gas environment followed by physical activation using water steam at a temperature of 850 Â°C. The physical properties testing showed 400 watt is the optimum of irradiation power in production of carbon electrode made from sago waste material. This optimum condition shown by the minimum condition on the density and microcrystalline height and maximum condition on the surface area and carbon content. This excellent physical properties caused the optimum electrochemical properties was found in the supercapacitor cell. The optimum specific capacitance is obtained as high as 95 F g -1 . As an addition it has also been analyzed the appearance of the surface morphology of the electrode sample.
