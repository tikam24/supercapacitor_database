This paper proposes a digital control scheme to control operation of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell module of 1.2 kW and a supercapacitor through a DC/DC hybrid converter. A FC is proposed as a primary source of energy along with a SC as an auxiliary source of energy. A control scheme is proposed for control of the proposed system. An experimental setup of the proposed system is implemented in the laboratory, and several scenarios have been defined for tests to verify that the proposed system achieves an excellent output voltage regulation and SC voltage control, under disturbances from FC voltage, load voltage and other perturbations described in results analysis.
