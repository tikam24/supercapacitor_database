Carbon-based hybrid structures have attracted much attention due to their superior chemical, thermal, mechanical and electrical properties. A 3D sponge-like structure based on reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotubes decorated with zinc sulfide synthetized by a hydrothermal micro-wave assisted synthesis (MHS) was produced and its chemical, structural, morphological and electrochemical properties evaluated as electrodes for supercapacitor devices. XRD confirmed the structure of the nanocomposite, XPS was performed to examine the chemical state of the compounds. The morphology analysis realized by FESEM confirmed the success of the proposed methodology to produce the rGO/MWCNTf-ZnS nanocomposites revealing good homogeneity. The electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge. It was observed that the increase of MWCNTf-ZnS content increased the specific capacitance and reduced the resistivity of the 3D hybrid structure, reaching 95 F gâˆ’1, thus, approaching the ideal electric double layer storage capacitor behavior in samples containing MWCNTf-ZnS.
