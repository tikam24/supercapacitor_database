The quench for the unremitting energy demand can be gratified by finding various substitute renewable energy sources and consequently safekeeping of these energies by energy storage devices. A variety of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials are being explored for the application of water splitting and supercapacitor among which MoWS2 has gained its spot with potential tunable properties. Herein, the synthesis of MoWS2 and its nanocomposite with Ti3C2Tx MXene sheets is carried out by a simplistic hydrothermal method involving two steps. The structural and morphological characteristics were investigated through several characterization tools like powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The MXene sheets act as a template for the growth of MoWS2 (MWS) nanosheets and could exhibit extraordinary supercapacitive and electrocatalytic activity. The highest specific capacitance achieved by the pseudocapacitive MoWS2@MXene (MWSM) was 259 F/g @0.2 A/g. Then the above-mentioned negative electrode was again taken for asymmetric studies where CoSe2@CNT@rGO was preferred as a positive site electrode and the asymmetric device showed a specific energy of 14 Wh/kg at a specific power of 8 KW/kg with an excellent cycling stability and coulombic efficiency of 93% and 96% which was measured for 6000 cycles. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies displayed that only 186 mV of overpotential was required to attain 10 mA/cm2 of current density. The electrocatalyst also achieved a small Tafel slope of 52 mV/dec along with exceptional stability upto 12 hours. High porosity, ample electrochemical active sites, rapid charge transfer kinetics and barrier-free passage for ion transfer resulted in the enhanced electrochemical activity of MoWS2@MXene electrode/electrocatalyst.
