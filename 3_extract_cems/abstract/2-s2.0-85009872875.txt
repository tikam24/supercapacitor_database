The effect of dip time variations on electrochemical performance of polypyrrole (PPy)-copper hydroxide hybrid thin-film electrodes was studied well in depth. Synthesis was carried out using a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method via an aqueous route, using 0.1 M pyrrole, 0.1 M Cu(NO3)2, and H2O2. The electrochemical analysis was made by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of optimized electrode shows nanolamellae-like structures. The characteristic peak observed in Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis at 1558 cm−1 validates the existence of PPy in hybrid electrode material, while the peaks observed at 21.5° and 44.5° in X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are evidence for triclinic Cu(OH)2. The observed maximum values of specific capacitance (SC), specific power (SP), specific energy (SE), and coulombic efficiency (η) of the optimized electrode are 56.05 F/g, 10.48 Wh/kg, 11.11 kW/kg, and 46.47%, respectively. For originality and value, the SILAR synthesis of PPy-Cu(OH)2 hybrid thin-film electrodes was carried out for the very first time. Synthesized electrodes showed improved surface structures and electrochemical stability than the pristine PPy electrodes which are necessary for the supercapacitive applications.
