Short circuit fault is one of the severe problems in the power system. This problem causes sag until it gets cleared. This paper proposes an optimization based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimal placement and sizing of Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) for voltage sag mitigation in the distribution system. Optimization is conducted with an objective function of minimizing the system losses. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 33-bus radial distribution system using Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results show that different energy sources have different characteristics to respond voltage sag. Economical cost for investment on the type of energy storage for DVR is also being considered. The optimal result was obtained by combining both battery and supercapacitor as the source for DVR.
