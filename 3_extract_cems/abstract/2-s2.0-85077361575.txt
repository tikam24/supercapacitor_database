Ni/Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles with a large charge storage capacity were synthesized on the nanoporous copper via electrodeposition method. Nanoporous copper was obtained from Zr50Cu50 amorphous ribbon by dealloying. This experiment is different from the traditional method in that NiCl2â‹…6H2O was used as the nickel source. Ni/Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles with different quantities and distributions can be obtained with different deposition times. This nanocomposite structure combines the high capacity of Ni/Ni(OH)2 with the good electron conduction performance of nanoporous copper, which can be applied to the positive faradaic electrode in a hybrid device. The electrochemical measurements show a high capacity of 1011.0 F/g and good multiplier performance at different current densities, indicating the direction for the development of supercapacitors in the future.
