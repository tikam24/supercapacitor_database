Polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a heat resistant, mechanically robust, and chemically resistant heterocyclic thermoplastic polymer. Incorporation of nanofiller in PBI matrix has motivated extensive research progress in the field of nanocomposite. This treatise is devoted to updating the development, processing, and physicochemical characterizations of polybenzimidazole-based nanocomposite. The nanocomposite has been essentially focused in three categories i.e. PBI/carbon nanotube, PBI/graphene, and PBI/graphene oxide. Moreover, this article offers concise perception of polybenzimidazole-based nanocomposite relevance for supercapacitor, gas separation, strengthened materials, and fuel cell. Design of polybenzimidazole/nanocarbon-based architectures may facilitate appropriate tailoring of overall performance of the resulting PBI nanocomposite for advance technical applications.
