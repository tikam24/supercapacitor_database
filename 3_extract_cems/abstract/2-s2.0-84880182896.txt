Porous graphitic carbons (PGC) are synthesized to be used in internal parallel hybrid devices. The hybrid devices are assembled with a LiFePO4 cathode, and an anode based on a mixture of PGC and Li4Ti 5O12. Then the hybrid devices are characterized by galvanostatic charge/discharge, rate charge/discharge and cycle performance testing. The results show that PGC hybrid devices possess better performance than the commercial activated carbon hybrid device. Moreover, the internal parallel hybrid device with 25% PGC, denoted as T3P1F, exhibits an optimal performance with high energy density, high power density and stable cycling performance.
