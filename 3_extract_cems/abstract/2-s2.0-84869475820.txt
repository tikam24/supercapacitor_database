To design a supervisory plan for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV), different methods are presented in the literature. In many of these controllers, there are a few parameters that must be tuned according to future driving conditions. To address this issue, a novel feedback controller is introduced in this paper that serves as the supervisory plan of a series HEV, and does not require the exact knowledge of the drive cycle. To find this controller, first a mathematical model of the hybrid drivetrain is developed, then Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is applied assuming that the drive cycle is known in advance. Based on the mechanism of the optimal control, a set of mathematical rules is extracted, and an optimal feedback controller is designed. It is also shown that a priori knowledge of the future drive cycle is not required; it is possible to tune the controller parameters, knowing only the cruise time and the available negative energy during braking.
