Comprehensive observations of science, technology, and research policy transactions are important for developing an innovation strategy. We propose a new method that combines the academic landscape and matrix analysis to understand the relationships among activities of three aspects of the technological landscape: science, technology, and research policy. First, we divided academic research into 28 knowledge domains by clustering a citation network of scientific papers. Next, we developed a new matrix classifying them into three groups: “mature technology,” “intermediate technology,” and “emerging technology.” The results showed that research domains in “emerging technology” showed a high rate of patent increase, indicating that they were commercializing rapidly. Finally, we identified the group that each country focused on, and this result reflected the countries' research policies. China and Singapore showed high rates, whereas Japan, France, and Germany had low values. This result reflects countries’ research policies and implies that specialty research areas differed by country. As above, our research result implies that academia, industry, and government have paid attention to knowledge domains in “emerging technology” and these are important for creating innovation. A supercapacitor, also known as an electric double layer capacitor or ultracapacitor, was selected as an example in our method. This research could help academic researchers, industrial companies, and policymakers in developing innovation strategies.
