The CoMoO4 microspheres constructed from ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized by means of a simple chemical precipitation using urotropin (C6H12N4) as a soft template, which were used as the electrode materials for supercapacitors. It was found that the CoMoO4 sample with 3 mmol of added urotropin (vs 1 mmol CoCl2) exhibits the uppermost specific capacity value of 89 mAh/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g due to its unique mesoporous structure and large specific surface area. In addition, a hybrid supercapacitor was established by the CoMoO4 microspheres (positive electrode) and activated carbon (AC, negative electrode). The obtained CoMoO4//AC hybrid supercapacitor possesses a specific energy value of 34 Wh/kg at 375 W/kg. Most importantly, this device owns excellent cycle stability with no capacity decay observed after 10 000 cycles. These good electrochemical properties of CoMoO4 microspheres are promising in the practical use fields.
