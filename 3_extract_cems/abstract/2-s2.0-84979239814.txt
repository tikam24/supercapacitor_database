The paper suggests utilizing a recursive-least-squares identification algorithm for online supercapacitor parameters estimation in order to calculate its state of energy (SOE). The SOE is used as a fuel gauge of the supercapacitor instead of the commonly adopted state of charge (SOC). The proposed method allows to precisely estimate the remaining energy capacity of a supercapacitor utilized e.g. as backup energy device or primary energy storage.
