The activated carbon (AC) is treated by vacuum impregnation using the non-ionic, cation and anionic fluorinated surfactant (FS). The AC treated with FS (FS-AC) is characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravity analytical, scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical measurements. The AC electrode supercapacitor treated with anionic FS exhibits the best electrochemical performance. Specifically, its specific capacity is 194·8 F g-1, and its internal impedance is 1·55 Ω. The charging-discharging efficiency is 98·4% after 2000 charging/discharging tests in 0·8M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate-propylene carbonate electrolyte. © 2013 W. S. Maney & Son Ltd.
