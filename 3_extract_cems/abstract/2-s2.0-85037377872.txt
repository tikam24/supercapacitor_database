Fossil fuels have been used as one of the essential energy sources for centuries. Considering the rapid depletion of fossil fuels and increase in environmental pollution, caused by vast fossil-fuel consumption, it is essential to minimize the use of energy wisely and efficiently and, therefore, rapid exploration of green and sustainable energy sources is warranted. In this context, the element boron plays an important role in the area of sustainable energy due to its unique physical and chemical properties. Thus, the boron-enriched composites have proved to be unique materials for a number of applications. This mini-review summarizes the most advanced progress in the area of boron-based nanostructured and macromolecular compounds for energy applications, particularly for its conversions, and as carriers and storage materials.
