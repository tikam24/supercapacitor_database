Supercapacitors have attracted lots of attentions for energy storage because of their outstanding electrochemical properties, and various kinds of carbon materials have been used to improve the performance. In this work, we innovatively elevate a natural rose-based continuous 3D porous carbon skeleton. The as-prepared carbon skeleton is graphited to some extent and possesses hierarchical interconnected 3D porous structures, providing a high electrical conductive and electrolyte easy-infiltrated substrate for the fabrication of ideal monolithic composite electrodes. Then, we utilized it as scaffold to prepare mesoporous CoO nanocubes @ continuous 3D porous carbon skeleton of rose composite-based electrode for supercapacitor via hydrothermal approach. The obtained material exhibits a noticeable pseudocapacitive performance with a brilliant capacitance of 1672 F/g at 1 A/g and as high as 521 F/g at 40 A/g. It also should be noted that ∼82% of the capacitance was maintained after 3000 cycles at 5 A/g, and only 40% capacitance loss after 1500 cycles at a relatively high current density of 10 A/g. © 2014 American Chemical Society.
