Functional floating bead (F-FB), prepared by anchoring the organic sulfonic acid on the surface of the blackberry-like structural FB, was used as both the inorganic substrate and the in situ dopant for the in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of pyrrole to obtain the polypyrrole/functional floating bead (PPy/F-FB) composites. The encapsulating morphologies were revealed with the scanning electron microscopy technique. The PPy/F-FB composites were characterized with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Based on the cyclic voltammetry of the composites, it was found that the composites performed typical electrochemical supercapacitor behavior. Â© (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
