Polythiophene (Pth) and polyparafluorophenylthiophene (PFPT) have been chemically synthesized for use as active materials in supercapacitor electrodes. Electrochemical characterization has been performed by cyclic voltammetry and an electrode study has been achieved to get the maximum capacity out of the polymers and give good cyclability. Specific capacity values of 7 mAh g-1 and 40 mAh g-1 were obtained for PFPT and polythiophene, respectively. Supercapacitors have been built to characterize this type of system. Energy storage levels of 260 F g-1 were obtained with Pth and 110 F g-1 with PFPT.
