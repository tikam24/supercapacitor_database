Mechanical energy generated by self-powered catalytic motors encourages researchers to explore whether their dynamics can be harnessed in developing inexpensive and efficient energy transduction and storage platforms. Herein, we present a non-Faradaic electrochemical energy transduction strategy using buoyancy-driven self-propelled catalytic motors within an electrochemical setup containing a fluorinated tin oxide working electrode and a sustained salt gradient. During propulsion, the motors facilitated advective transfer of ions from the bottom of the fuel solution to the electrode and subsequent formation of an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) over it. The magnitude of EDLC charging was estimated using open circuit potential (OCP) measurements, which was found to increase with the number of motors in solution. We also observed instantaneous potential spikes over the OCP signal profile, when a motor struck the electrode surface, the frequency of which gets enhanced with the increase in motor speed through the solution. We quantify the OCP generated as a function of number of motors and composition of the fuel solution and also offer an explanation of the energy transduction mechanism in the system. It is expected that catalytic motor-assisted non-Faradaic energy generation will establish itself as an important energy harvesting pathway and when miniaturized, will open up avenues for fabricating autonomous power sources for smart sensors and other devices.
