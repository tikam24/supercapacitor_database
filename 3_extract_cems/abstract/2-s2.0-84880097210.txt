In the present work, polypyrrole (PPY) thin films were synthesized by simple and inexpensive successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method using ammonium peroxidisulphate as an oxidant. The prepared PPY thin films were characterized using UV-VIS, SEM and cyclic voltammetry studies. From the UV-VIS spectrum optical band gap of 1.9 eV was observed. The SEM reveals the nanostructured morphology of PPY thin film. The specific capacitance (SC) of the PPY electrode was calculated using cyclic voltammetry technique. A high specific capacitance of 736 Fg-1 was obtained within the potential range of -0.4 to +0.6 V/SCE in 1M H2SO4 electrolyte. Hence, the PPY thin film is found to be suitable electrode material for redox supercapacitor. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
