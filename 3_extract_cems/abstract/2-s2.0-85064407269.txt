Ultra-small Mn3O4 nanoparticles are formed in the shell of hollow carbon spheres (HCS[sbnd]Mn3O4)via nanoconfinement growth. The HCS with special cylindrical channels (about 2 nm)provides the limited space for growth of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and serves as a conductive substrate in electrochemical applications. The unique hollow structure shortens the distance for electrolytes to access Mn3O4 during the charging/discharging process. In the hybrid HCS-Mn3O4 structure, the interaction between Mn3O4 nanoparticles and HCS was enhanced resulting in good conductivity and electrochemical properties. The two-electrode supercapacitor cell composed of HCS-Mn3O4 shows high capacitance and energy density. The highest specific capacitance of 430 F g−1 is achieved at a scanning rate of 1 mV s−1 and the largest energy density of 13.5 Wh kg−1 is observed at a power density of 0.3 kW kg−1 by HCS-Mn3O4-5 with 93.15% retention after 10,000 cycles in 5 M LiCl. Symmetric HCS-Mn3O4-5//HCS-Mn3O4-5 shows higher energy density of 22.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.4 kW kg−1 and power density of 3.3 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 16 Wh kg−1 with 1 M Li2SO4. The technique to prepare the HCS-Mn3O4 hybrid materials is simple and readily scalable to satisfy industrial demand.
