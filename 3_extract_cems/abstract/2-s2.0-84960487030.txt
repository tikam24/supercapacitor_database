Multiscale porous activate carbon with appropriate pore-size distribution for supercapacitor electrode was prepared from ultra-pure lignite with only 0.3wt% ash through the synergistic effect of microwave irradiation, the activation of KOH and ZnCl2, ultra-fine grinding and surface modification with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate(SDBS) on active carbon. The active carbon sample was characterized using laser particle size analyzer and specific surface area and pore size analyzer. Electrochemical properties of active carbon were investigated using cyclic voltammogram(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge test with the electrolyte of 6M KOH solution.. The results show that the active carbon obtained at the conditions of microwave irradiation power of 700W, microwave irradiation time of 6minutes and weight ratio of 1:2:3(Lignite/ZnCl2/KOH) has high specific surface area(1536m2·g-1) and large percentage of micropores (59.05%). When the active carbon is ultra-fine grinded to an average size of 2.1μm, the specific surface area will be improved to 1696m2.g-1. Active carbon treated with ultra-fine grinded and surface modification using SDBS presents a high specific capacitance of 189F·g-1 and good cycle stability in KOH electrolytes.
