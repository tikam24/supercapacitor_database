Abstract: Mixed metal sulphides have attracted the attention of researchers working in the development of electroactive materials for high-energy supercapacitors. Mesoporous CoNi2S4 nanostructures have been grown on Ni-foam via an efficient single-step hydrothermal process. The performance of CoNi2S4 nanostructures was compared with pristine Ni3S4 and Co3S4-CoS nanostructures which has been prepared using the same approach. The CoNi2S4 nanostructures with diverse morphology reveal a high surface area (87.8 m2 g−1), large specific capacity (1117 C g−1) and low charge transfer resistance (0.3 Ω). The admirable features enable shortening of electrolyte ion diffusion pathway and quick electron transport and increase effective electroactive sites facilitating improved energy storage. The CoNi2S4 electrode-based asymmetric supercapacitor yields a large energy density of 87.4 W h kg−1 with a power density of 1250 W kg−1 and retains 80% of capacity at the end of 5000 cycles.
