Integrating semiconducting functional materials is a way to enlarge the photoexcitation, energy range, and charge separation, greatly elongating the photocatalytic efficiency to enhance the chemical and physical properties of the materials. This work depicts and investigates the impact of cuprous oxide (CuO) and tin dioxide (SnO2)-based catalysts with various CuO concentrations on photocatalytic and supercapacitor applications. Moreover, three distinct composites were made with varied ratios of CuO (5, 10, and 15% wt. Are designated as AT-1, AT-2, and AT-3) with SnO2 to get an optimized performance. The photocatalytic properties indicate that the CuO/SnO2 nanocomposite outperformed its bulk equivalents in photocatalysis using Methyl blue (MB) dye in a photoreactor. The results were monitored using a UVâ€“visible spectrometer. The AT-1 ratio nanocomposite displayed 96% photocatalytic degradation compared to pure SnO2 and CuO. CV analysis reveals a pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism from 0.0 to 0.7 V in a potential window in an aqueous medium. The capacitive performance was also investigated for all electrodes, and we observed that a high capacitance of 260/155 F/g at 1/10 A/g was attained for the AT-1 electrode compared to others, specifying good rate performance.
