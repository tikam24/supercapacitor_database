This paper presents a model of a fuel cell-supercapacitor system which represents the electric power supply device of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The fuel cell and the supercapacitors are coupled with a DC bus and a common cooling system. The first part of this paper deals with the modeling of the elements of the system (fuel cell system (FCS), supercapacitors, power electronics, and temperature regulation system). The second part deals with the design of a control structure which regulates the DC bus voltage, the fuel cell power, and the power source temperature. Simulation and experimental results are provided and analyzed. Â©2007 IEEE.
