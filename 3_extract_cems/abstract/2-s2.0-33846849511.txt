Birnessite-type layered manganese oxides were prepared using various approaches for the design and fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes: (i) Oxidized carbon-MnO2 nanocomposites were obtained from birnessite precipitated in the presence of the oxidized forms of four different carbon types: graphite, acetylene black, high surface area active carbon and fullerene. (ii) films were anodically deposited at the surface of inexpensive stainless steel foils. MnSO4 plating solutions were electrolyzed at various potentials and for various durations. Preparation conditions are shown to affect the oxide structure, morphology (surface area), and chemical composition (content of Mn3+, Mn4+). Consequently, they also greatly affect the electrochemical capacitance performances of the prepared electrode materials. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
