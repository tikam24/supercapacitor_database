A novel graphitized porous carbon nanosphere (GPCNS) material obtained by a convenient simultaneous activation and graphitization route, which was realized by heating resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin nanospheres immersed with ZnCl<inf>2</inf> and FeCl<inf>3</inf> in an inert atmosphere, has been reported. A high graphitization level was achieved through the catalytic graphitization by reduced Fe metal, and the hierarchically micro/mesoporous structure was produced in a controlled fashion by tuning the mass ratio of the activating agent ZnCl<inf>2</inf> and a carbon precursor. An optimal sample of GPCNS-2 was prepared with a FeCl<inf>3</inf>/ZnCl<inf>2</inf>/RF mass ratio of 0.5 : 2 : 1, exhibiting a highly graphitized framework and uniform spherical morphology with an average diameter of âˆ¼500 nm, as well as well-interconnected micro/mesoporous structure with a large surface area of 1664.8 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. Acting as an electrode material for a supercapacitor application in 6 M KOH electrolyte, GPCNS-2 displayed excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 402.5 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy test demonstrated that the low internal electrical resistance of GPCNS-2 contributed a superior rate capability of above 75% retention rate even at 50 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the GPCNS-2 electrode possessed an outstanding cycling stability, and about 96% of its initial specific capacitance at 5 A g<sup>-1</sup> was maintained after 5000 cycles.
