Facile one-step electrochemical synthesis of a novel graphitic oxide/polypyrrole/2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid composite on carbon fabric were described for development of an efficient positive electrode for supercapacitor applications. The 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate monomers behave as dopant in 3D polypyrrole network formed by synergetic coupling with graphitic oxide. Their free acrylic groups interact with each other to form polymer-hydrogel-layer on the external surface that facilitate transport of aqueous electrolyte ions inside of the electrode. The most efficient electrode material was synthesized by tuning dopant concentration at 0.01 M. The full-cell assembled using the composite electrode and graphite counter electrode works at 2.2 V in 3 M NaCl solution that equals to the highest values achieved yet for aqueous supercapacitors. This cell has a capacitance as high as 698.8 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and preserves its initial value even after 10 000 continuous CV cycles at 1000 mV s−1. It also exhibits a high-energy density of 446.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 366.7 W kg−1, and it is still 65.2 W h kg−1 at 18.3 kW kg−1. The asymmetric capacitor with 1 × 1 cm2 area successfully lit a red light-emitting diode.
