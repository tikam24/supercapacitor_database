The low energy density issue raises serious concerns for the large-scale application of supercapacitors. However, the development and utilization of new electrode materials with a high specific capacity to improve the energy density of supercapacitors remain challenging. Herein, an LaMnO3@NiCo2O4/carbon cloth (LMO@NCO/CC) composed of a multilayer flower-like nanochip array is prepared for the first time using an efficient electrodeposition method. This novel structure exploits the high conductivity of LaMnO3/carbon cloth (LMO@CC) to provide an efficient electron transport path for the outer layer of the NiCo2O4/carbon cloth (NCO@CC) nanoarrays, broadening the potential window. Due to the unique nanostructure configuration and the strong synergistic effect of the developed LMO@NCO/CC, the prepared electrodes show excellent supercapacitor performance. At a current density of 1 A g-1, LMO@NCO/CC has a higher specific capacitance value of 942 F g-1. The application value is extended through the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitors with a maximum energy density of 49 Wh kg-1 and excellent cycle stability (the initial capacitance value remains 106 % after 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging at a high current density of 10 A g-1). Our work paves the way for the development of next-generation electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
