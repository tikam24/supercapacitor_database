High specific power density and longer cycle life features made the supercapacitors as the most prominent option in managing the transient demands of the pulsed power loads. However, the discharging characteristics of supercapacitors confine them from the utilisation of their entire energy. Reflecting on these concerns, this study aims to provide an extensive review of various bank switching circuits of supercapacitors to enhance their energy utilisation. Also, a comprehensive analysis of these switching circuits in terms of power delivery duration, SC cell energy utilisation, terminal voltage variations, system efficiency, and total cost is carried out for the constant resistor, constant power, and constant current loads.
