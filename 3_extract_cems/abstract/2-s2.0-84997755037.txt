A one dimensional core-shell hierarchical MnO2@NiMoO4 nanostructure is rationally designed and prepared by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. This hybrid, along with porous carbon, is employed as an active material to fabricate flexible asymmetric supercapacitors, exhibiting a high capacitance of 186.8 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, super-long cycling life with a 132.7% retention rate after 20 000 cycles, and super flexibility with no obvious changes of specific capacitance after bending to 30° to 150° (the corresponding radius of curvature is 4.5 mm to as small as 1.0 mm). Moreover, the supercapacitor is fabricated into a power system, in combination with a solar cell, to successfully supply electricity to light emitting diodes, showing its practical applications in portable energy storage devices.
