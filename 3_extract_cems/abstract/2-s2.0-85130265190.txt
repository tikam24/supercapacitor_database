The graphitization degree of carbon material is an important factor for supercapacitor electrode. The three-dimensional high graphitic porous biomass carbon (HGPBC) derived from dandelion flower stem was synthesized by one step using potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) as an activator. The Raman results of HGBPC exhibited lower value of ID/IG (0.906) than pristine carbon (0.954) with no activation, and TEM results showed obvious local microcrystalline, improving conductivity of materials. The obtained HGPBC with a specific surface area of 780.4 m2 g−1, reached a high specific capacitance of 309 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and high energy density of 14.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 218.8 W kg−1. This approach holds great promise to achieve low-cost, green and industrial-grade production of renewable biomass-derived carbon materials for advanced energy storage applications in the future.
