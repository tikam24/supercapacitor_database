This article offers a way to implement the control system of two boost converters connected between energy storage elements (batteries or ultracapacitors) and designed to balance the voltages on the elements. The monitoring and control system has been studied by computer simulation with PSim program, and the results at different voltage ratios are presented. The practical realization of the entire device is described.
