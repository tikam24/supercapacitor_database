Researchers have concentrated in developing manganese dioxide (MnO2) based supercapacitor-electrode-material. Various synthetic methods for the preparation of different crystal structure of MnO2-based electrodes are highlighted and summarized. The cation insertion/deinsertion and oxidation change of manganese in MnO2 during charge/discharge processes is discussed and possible engineering approach for electrochemical performance improvement is emphasized. The future scope and challenges towards improvement of high-performance MnO2-based supercapacitors are also described.
