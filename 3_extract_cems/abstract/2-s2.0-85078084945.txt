Electroactive FeS2-modified MoS2 (FeS2/MoS2) nanosheet grown on Mo foil is designed as supercapacitor electrode material. FeS2/MoS2 nanosheet is crosslinked to form nanoporous microstructure. Density functional theory calculation reveals FeS2/MoS2 exhibits much narrowed bandgap and high density of states at the Fermi level, suggesting highly improved conductivity. The charge transfers resistance decreases from 1.375 Ω of MoS2 to 0.4167 Ω of FeS2/MoS2. FeS2/MoS2 exhibits higher specific capacity (495 and 394 mF cm−2) than MoS2 (132 and 218.1 mF cm−2) and FeS2 (315 and 286.5 mF cm−2) at 1.0 mA cm−2 in 3.0 M KOH and 0.5 M Na2SO4. The rate capacity retention is enhanced from 57.8% of MoS2 and 73.3% of FeS2 to 76.14% of FeS2/MoS2 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 when current density increases from 1 to 10 mA cm−2, indicating its improved rate capability. The cycling capacity retention keeps 100.2% of MoS2 and 100.7% of FeS2/MoS2 for 5000 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 in 0.5 M Na2SO4, indicating the similar cycling stability. An asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor using FeS2/MoS2 anode, exfoliated graphite carbon paper cathode and NaMoO4–Na2SO4-PVA gel electrolyte achieves specific capacity of 1.88 F cm−3 (112.8 mF cm−2) at 1.0 mA cm−2, energy density of 0.936 mWh cm−3 (56.56 mWh cm−2), capacity retention of 97.8% after 5000 cycles at 5.0 mA cm−2 and 1.9 V output voltage.
