Diverse carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with controlled structures and graphene hybrid nanostructures were synthesized for supercapacitor electrode applications. Three-dimensional multilayer graphene foams were synthesized via thermal chemical vapor deposition (TCVD). The diameter and density of the synthesized CNTs were controlled through the use of two different CVD systems in addition to adjusting the thickness of the Fe catalyst used in the production of these nanomaterials. We thereby fabricated single-walled CNTs/graphene, multi-walled CNTs/graphene, and vertically aligned CNTs/graphene hybrid nanostructures, which was confirmed via scanning electron microscopy and resonant Raman spectroscopy. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of the CNTs/graphene hybrid nanostructures were studied by cyclic voltammetry.
