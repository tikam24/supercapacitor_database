Stretchable energy storage materials are considered as essential component of fully stretchable and flexible electronics devices. Among the various stretchable/flexible electronic device and flexible super-capacitors are considered good because its power density is high, and it's long lasting, durable and safe. Super-capacitors have drawn more attention because they have a high capacity to store energy because it can deliver high peak current and store large amount of energy in less time with very less power loss. The present work the fabrication and characteristics of ultra-flexible super capacitor based on VLSI technology. The super-capacitor consist of PVdf(Poly Vinyledene Fluoride) unit it acts both substrate well as dielectric and gold as electrode. We have made a characterization of the fabricated ultra-flexible supercapacitor which exhibited high capacitance using impedance analyzer. We also analyzed the charging and discharging value of the super capacitor using cyclic voltammetry. Using PVdf as both substrate and dielectric the super-capacitor is made more economical.
