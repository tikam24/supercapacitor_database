We report a facile synthesis of the core/shell-like NiCo2O4 decorated-multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) prepared by a dry synthesis technique and its supercapacitive property. The synthesized NiCo2O4/MWCNTs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and selected area energy dispersive spectrum. The electrochemical performances of NiCo2O4/MWCNTs were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry. The NiCo2O4 nanoparticles with the average size of 6Â±2 nm was formed on the surface of MWCNTs to produce the core/shell-like nanostructures. The NiCo2O4-decorated MWCNTs electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 822 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5.0 mV/s.
