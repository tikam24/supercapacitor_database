With the development of the MEMS technology and the more widely-used micro-systems, micro-power devices are developed for portable consumer electronics. [1] The MEMS supercapacitor is one of the most important parts for micro-powers. In this paper, a micro-supercapacitor was designed and fabricated with three-dimensional microelectrode arrays configuration. It has been tested by scanning electron microscopy, Cyclic Voltammeter, Galvanostatical charge/discharge curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These posts were 50 μm in diameter and 100 μm tall; with foot print area of 2×2mm2. The capacitance is 89.52mF/cm2. The biggest feature in this paper is that the two plates of the supercapacitor are both three-dimensional microelectrode arrays which are shown to offer significant advantages. © 2013 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.
