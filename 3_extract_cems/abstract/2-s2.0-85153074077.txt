In this research, we report unique hierarchical structures of SnO2 hexagonal interconnected nanolayered arrays (HINLA) fabricated on the carbon cloth (SnO2 HINLA@CC) by a facile electrochemical deposition technique. The structural, morphological evolution and electrochemical properties of as prepared SnO2 HINLA@CC are explored as negative electrode of SCs. SnO2 HINLA@CC has been tested in negative potential widow of −1.0-0 V and demonstrated the high specific capacitance of 325 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, much superior when compared to the previously reported data for SnO2. The EIS analysis confirmed the charge transfer kinetics of SnO2 HINLA@CC, with significant stability due to favorable morphology for swift response. Capacitance retention plot confirmed no structural degradation or pulverization for negative electrode even after 5000 galvanostatic charge with 88.6% capacitance retention. Such high performances of SnO2 HINLA@CC as negative electrode make it an ideal candidate to be useful in ASCs. Moreover, a 2.2 V aqueous ASC has been constructed by employing Na0·5MnO2 nanowall arrays (NWAs) as cathode and SnO2 HINLA@CC as anode. In particular, the 2.2 V Na0·5MnO2 NWAs@CC//SnO2 HINLA@CC ASC has demonstrated the superior energy density of ∼73 Wh kg−1, significant rate capability and excellent cycling ability, outperforming the previously reported SnO2-based ASCs. Present work provides new opportunities for developing promising high-voltage aqueous ASCs with excellent energy density.
