The ternary reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyaniline (PANI)@NiMoS4 composite with the three-dimensional hierarchical structure was constructed by the in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline on GO surface, followed by the hydrothermal treatment. The grafted PANI cannot only provide the additional Faradaic redox reaction, but also support the rGO and NiMoS4, alleviating the self-stacking phenomenon for many ion transfer channels. The optimized rGO/PANI@NiMoS4 exhibits the high specific capacity of 194 mAh/g at 0.75 A/g. Meanwhile, the corresponding rGO/PANI@NiMoS4//AC asymmetric supercapacitor also exhibits the high energy density of 30.75 Wh/kg at 1500 W/kg, and good cycle stability with capacity retention of 93 % after 6000 cycles. These satisfactorily electrochemical performances of rGO/PANI@NiMoS4 composites reveal the potential supercapacitor application. This work provides an efficient way to increase the capacity of NiMoS4 related electrode materials.
