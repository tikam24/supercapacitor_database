Polyaniline and its composites at different wt. % of Copper oxide nano (PCC1 and PCC5) were prepared by in-situ chemical reaction method. The composites were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and the impedance measurement was carried out at different temperature. FTIR and SEM image reveals the presence of copper metal ions uniformly embedded into PANI. The dc electrical conductivity increases with increasing nano concentration in PANI and achieved high conductivity for PCC5. These results are suggesting PCC composite is a prominent candidate for supercapacitor properties and optoelectronics devices applications.
