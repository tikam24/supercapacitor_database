2D multilayered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has received enormous research interest as a potential electrode material for flexible supercapacitor (FSC), owing to its excellent electrochemical and mechanical properties. However, rGO suffers from the restacking of graphene (GN) layers, lower electrical conductivity resulting from the residual oxygen functional groups and the relatively poor real-time electrochemical performance. One of the finest ways overcoming the drawbacks of rGO by doping heteroatom into GN network and surface modification to enhance its electrochemical properties. In this work, a simple and robust approach for designing an efficient and high-performance flexible electrode with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) framework coupled with surface modification through in situ chemical polymerization with aniline to form a long-range interconnected polyaniline (PANI) nanostructure is presented. In a two-electrode system, PANI/N-rGO flexible electrode has delivered a higher specific capacitance of 322 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Further, the composite exhibited notable cyclic stability over 1000 charge–discharge cycles. Surface-modified in-situ grown PANI nanostructures on N-rGO nanosheets prevent the volume changes that occur in PANI during the charge–discharge process, and offer a higher charge transportation rate throughout the surface area. As a result of enhanced electrochemical properties, PANI/N-rGO composites provide a feasible route for designing FSCs.
