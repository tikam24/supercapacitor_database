Nowadays, achieving powerful electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices is a major challenge of our society. Wood is a biodegradable and renewable material that naturally has a hierarchical porous structure, excellent mechanical performance, and versatile physicochemical properties. Wood-based materials and its derivatives are endowed with great potential as resources to fabricate advanced materials for energy storage, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Herein, we comprehensively overview the methodologies applied for the synthesis of various electrochemical energy storage systems and devices (e.g., supercapacitor, battery, catalytic hydrogen evolution, etc.), the strategies for tailoring the structures and conductivity, as well as their impact on electrochemical performance (energy and power density and long-term durability). Finally, an outlook of future opportunities and prospects in the synthesis and application of electrochemical energy storage is also presented.
