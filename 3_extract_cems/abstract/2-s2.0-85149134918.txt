On the proposed ammonia-powered PEM fuel cell hybrid electric mini-bus, ammonia can be converted into hydrogen, which is consumed immediately instead of hydrogen storage onboard. Consequently, there are no hazardous issues related to hydrogen storage, distribution, and safe operations. To predict the performances of an ammonia-powered PEM fuel cell hybrid electric mini-bus, a group of dynamic equations of the powertrain and the energy management strategy based on the state machine control and frequency decoupling control are proposed in this study. The hybrid energy storage system consists of the ammonia-powered PEM fuel cell, the Li-ion battery, and the super-capacitor. The simulated results under the low-power New European Driving Cycle illustrate the changes in the powertrain parameters in detail. Furthermore, the predicted performances show that the designed ammonia-powered fuel cell hybrid electric mini-bus can accomplish the driving range of 500 km per battery discharging cycle.
