In this paper, the preparation and electrochemical capacitive performance of hollow urchin-like Ni2P/CoP (HU Ni2P/CoP) bimetallic phosphides have been reported. Electrochemical measurements deliver a high specific capacity of 1038 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and achieve the good capacitance retention of 91% after 3000 cycles at 20 A g−1, indicating HU Ni2P/CoP bimetallic phosphides can be used as the novel electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
