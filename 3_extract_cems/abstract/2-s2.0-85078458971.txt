Metal sulfide-graphene hybrid materials have attracted increased attention as promising supercapacitor electrode materials. Herein, three-dimensional multi-layered graphene (3D GR) is prepared by chemical vapor deposition using nickel nanowires (Ni NWs) as the template and then, indium sulfide nanosheet arrays (In2S3 NSAs) were grown on the 3D GR by hydrothermal synthesis to obtain In2S3 NSA/3D GR composite. The hybrid is characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman scattering. The electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 530.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, the electrode possesses an excellent cycle life with 84% capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles at 1 A g−1.
