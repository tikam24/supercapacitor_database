Polyaniline (PANI)/graphene composites have been widely investigated as supercapacitor electrode materials. However, the electrochemical performances of PANI/graphene in laboratory were much lower than the theoretical value and still far from the actual needs because the microstructure of the composite was not very uniform and contained defects such as cracks, voids and dislocation. In this paper, PANI/graphene composites were synthesized by a modified method that involved a continuous in situ polymerization-hydrothermal reduction process. The chemical microenvironment of aniline was modified with the introduction of isopropanol as an adjusting agent for PANI polymerization, resulting in the fine microstructures of PANI/graphene composites and the better effect of N-doping. The specific capacitance of these PANI/rGO composites is enhanced from 537.9 to 729.4F g1 in comparison with the control sample synthesized in aqueous solution. The cycle stability is also improved from 45.1% to 68.1% capacitance retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 10A g-1. These intriguing features make it a suitable method to improve the electrochemical performance of PANI/graphene composites for electrochemical supercapacitors.
