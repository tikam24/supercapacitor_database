Pseudocapacitive type supercapacitor electrode material based on nanocomposites has been made from a mixture of NiO nanoparticles, Co3O4 nanoparticles, and reduced rGO through coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods with calcination process at 900oC with variations in the composition of NiCo2O4/rGO nanocomposites at a mass ratio of nickel: cobalt: rGO, namely 2:2:2, 2:3:2, 3:2:2, 3:0:3, 0:3:3, 0:10:0 and 10:0:0. Sampling was carried out in two steps. The first step was the synthesis of NiO and CO3O4 nanoparticles using NiS.5H2O and Co2SO4.7H2O precursors based on the coprecipitation method and reduced rGO derived from graphite oxide (pencil stick) using a modified hummer method. The second stage is mixing NiO, Co3O4, and rGO nanoparticles using coprecipitation and hydrothermal methods to form NiCo2O4/rGO nanocomposites which are then characterized including: physical properties with SEM, BET, and XRD, chemical properties with FTIR, thermal properties with TG/DTA, and electrical properties with CV meter. The characterization results showed that the most optimum composition was NiCo2O4/rGO nanocomposite on S2 with a mass ratio of 2:3:2 producing a hexahedron micrograph image with a spinel crystal structure with a crystalline diameter of 0.454 nm composed of the main group -OH and C=C with a wave number of 3448.51 cm-1, 1627.77 cm-1, crystallization point 468oC, mass decomposition 63.84%, specific surface area 12.75 m2/g, average pore radius 9.534 nm and pore volume 0.06404 cm3/g with its electrical performance namely electrical conductivity of 6.08 S/m and specific capacitance of 289.93 F/g which was applied as electrode candidates for pseudocapacitor type supercapacitor.
