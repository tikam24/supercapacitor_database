This paper describes selected issues concerning realization of energy storage system (ESS) designed to operate in power distribution system. In order to achieve scalability of the system a modular approach is proposed. In addition to this different configuration of the system are analyzed, where depending on requirements and application a scalability in power, in energy capacity of energy storage resource and both in power and capacity are analyzed. This paper presents results of operation of the simulation model for 250kW of rated power for classical two level converter and neutral point clamped (NPC) three level converter. According to the simulation results a new, full scale and modular, 250 kW prototype of ESS is presented, which enables to operate with various energy storage resources such as superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and supercapacitor energy storage (SES), which is a product of presented analysis.
