Meso-/macropores have been induced as additional second-order structures by the assembly of particles of a microporous zeolitic imidazolate framework, ZIF-8, prepared by ultrasonication. Simple carbonization of ZIF-8 affords a 3-dimensional hierarchically porous carbon framework with micro-, meso- and macropores, which exhibits the best performance ever reported as a supercapacitor electrode.
