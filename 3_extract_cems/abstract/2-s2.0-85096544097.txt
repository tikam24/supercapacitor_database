Supercapacitors (SC) are widely used power sources in electric vehicular applications to achieve a quick dynamic response by absorbing and delivering high-level surge currents in shorter periods. However, SCs lack in specific energy density that restricts them from using their full energy during discharge. This paper proposes a novel bank-switching configuration of SCs to enhance their energy utilization and power delivery time for an electrified transportation. The proposed switching circuit comprises of primary and secondary SC banks with a switching circuity to make transition series and parallel combinations of SC cells as per the load requirements. A simple switching control scheme is implemented to regulate the SC bank voltage for longer duration during discharge. The performance of the proposed circuitry is validated through PLECS simulations and compared with the conventional control strategies in terms of energy utilization, power delivery duration and switching intervals.
