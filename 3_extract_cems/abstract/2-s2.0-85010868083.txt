Rechargeable aluminum based batteries and supercapacitors have been regarded as promising sustainable energy storage candidates, because aluminum metal is the most abundant metal element in the earth crust, and it delivers very high volumetric capacity and acceptable gravimetric capacity. This mini review presents the brief development of Al-based primary batteries, and introduces the latest advances of rechargeable Al-based energy storage systems with both nonaqueous and aqueous electrolytes.
