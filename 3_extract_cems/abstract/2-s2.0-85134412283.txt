Vanadium pentoxide has the most exciting oxidation states, but, Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) has low capacitance due to poor electrical conductivity and ionic diffusivity. So, encapsulating pentoxide in carbonaceous materials or metals, shrinking it to the nanoscale, or changing its morphology can improve capacitance performance. Herein, we describe a green synthesis of V2O5NPs with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) that typically acts as a reducing and stabilizing agent using the -COOH and -OH group. The physicochemical characterization of prepared samples reveals the prominent peak in UV–vis spectra at 265 nm confirming the formation of V2O5NPs with particle sizes between 200 and 220 nm. The theoretical surface area for the nanocomposite was 76.5 m2/g. The calcination temperature is essential to determine a material's specific capacitance. Due to decreased oxide agglomeration, the V2O5-green modified electrode exhibits superior electrochemical performance around 223 F g−1 than Ac alone (160 F g−1). The finding demonstrated excellent cyclic stability with reduced fluctuation in capacitance. Because of its exceptional electrochemical performance and simplicity of access, this AC/V2O5 nanocomposite can be helpful as an electrode for energy storage applications.
