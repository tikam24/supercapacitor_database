In recent years, the applicability of these DG units to electrical Microgrids (MGs) has grown rapidly, enabling them to contribute a large percentage of the installed generating capacity. However, the fluctuating and intermittent nature of renewable generation can adversely affect electric grid stability and operations. Conventionally, to overcome these problems, batteries are employed. Nevertheless, the quick charging and discharging cycle reduces the battery life span, resulting in an economic burden and environmental damage. To resolve these problems, short-term Distributed Energy Storage (DES) systems based on advanced technologies, such as Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) and Supercapacitor Energy Storage (SCES), are emerging as potential alternatives. A supplementary regulator which includes storing energy as well as a flexible AC transmission system is designed to boost the minute signal reliability. The precise optimization of multiple energy device characteristics is needed for efficient performance. The artificial intelligence methods and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are used to obtain the optimum parameters in the micro-hydro system. This research examines the many Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in power systems, particularly microgrids, and demonstrates their critical role in improving the quality of electrical systems. As a result, the ESSs were divided into several technologies based on the energy storage form and the most important technological features. In this review paper, the most common classifications are introduced/presented, summarized, and compared according to their characteristics.
