PAN/PVDF-HFP composite nanofiber membranes are prepared by electrospinning. The PAN/PVDF-HFP com?posite nanofiber membranes with 3 layer structure are treated by hot pressing and their mechanical properties are analyzed and evaluated. finally a button-type supercapacitor is assembled and its electrochemical performance is determined. The results show that the best ratio of DMF/acetone in electro-spun PAN spinning solution is 7 : 3;the optimum hot composite temperature and time for PAN/PVDF-HFP are 120 ? and 60 s, respectively, the fracture strength of the composite membrane is 13.5 MPa. PAN/PVDF-HFP composite membrane as separator in supercapacitor, its ESR is 0.57 O which is less than 0.64 O of commercial film Celgard2400,CV curve remains better rectangle features at 5 mV/s scan rate, GCD curve shows capacitances of 79.55 F/g at 0.05 A/g current density which is higher than 62.78 F/g of commercial film Celgard2400.
