Polyaniline (PANI) nanobelts were successfully synthesized by a low temperature induced polymerization method. Morphology results confirmed that p-phenylenediamine and low temperature were vital for the formation of PANI nanobelts. Comparative study between a rotating packed bed (RPB) and a stirring tank reactor demonstrated that high mixing degree of raw materials was beneficial for the growth of uniformly shaped PANI nanobelts. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the PANI nanobelts obtained in RPB possessed a specific capacitance of 304.4F/g at 0.5 A/g and a capacitance retention of 40.65% after 1000 cycles, respectively.
