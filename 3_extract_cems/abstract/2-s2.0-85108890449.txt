Hydrated ammonium metal phosphates (AMPs) with numerous electractive sites and intercalated water are the current research focus in the field of supercapacitors. Herein, we have developed a novel approach where Co-MOF(ZIF-67) as a precursor was introduced into the confined space of an MXene layer, and the as-prepared MOF/Ti3C2Txwas subsequently etchedin situin a solution of (NH4)2HPO4to transform into NH4CoPO4·H2O nanoparticles with a uniform distribution on the surface of Ti3C2Tx. NH4CoPO4nanoparticles were embedded into MXene nanosheets, while the Ti3C2TxMXene endowed AMPs with high electronic conductivity. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of NH4CoPO4·H2O and MXene, this material showed good rate performance (601 F g−1at 1.0 A g−1and 535 F g−1at 20.0 A g−1) and long cycle life (87% capacitance retention up to 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1) in a three-electrode system, which can be ascribed to excellent electronic conductivity and short ion transport path. When NH4CoPO4·H2O/Ti3C2Txand activated carbon are used as the positive and negative electrodes of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), the ASC simultaneously shows high energy density (47 W h kg−1at 1350 W kg−1) and power density (18 W h kg−1at 5000 W kg−1), which can be considered as a potential candidate for next-generation energy storage devices.
