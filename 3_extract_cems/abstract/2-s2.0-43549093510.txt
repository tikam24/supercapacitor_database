The supercapacitor is a high efficient and green energy storage component that offers intensive charging and discharging current and performs a perfect reliability and cycling ability. In this paper, three topics are discussed for supercapacitor-based system research and application. Firstly, a comparison among several parameter models of the supercapacitor is presented. In the same time, the characteristics of ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) and EPR (Equivalent Parallel Resistance) are described and studied. Secondly, the methods of voltage sharing and overvoltage protection for series connected supercapacitors are discussed, and their advantages and disadvantages are compared with each other. Thirdly, a radiation experiment is taken to examine the supercapacitor in its anti-radiation ability for spaceflight application. Â© 2006 IEEE.
