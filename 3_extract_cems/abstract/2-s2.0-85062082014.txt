This paper presents a computationally efficient design algorithm for a DC/DC converter, optimized for power density. Interleaving and series-connecting of several converter cells is included in the analysis. The choice of the converter design parameters, such as the semiconductor devices or the number of interleaved converter cells may have unpredictable impacts on the resulting power density. Therefore, fully analytical models of the operating waveforms, the converter losses and also the converter weight are introduced. Using those models, an algorithm is developed to optimize a 2 kW DC/DC converter for an aircraft supercapacitors energy storage system.
