Hybridization of the homogeneous battery-only energy storage system (ESS) with supercapacitor (SC) has proved to be an effective solution for extending the battery lifetime and increasing the power capability of the ESS [1, 2]. However, the addition of the SC and associated DC/DC converter will increase the system weight and cost, thus nullifying the monetary gain resulting from the extension of battery lifetime. Consequently, system design needs to be revamped, whereby a single device is used to perform more than one function to reduce the overall cost. This paper presents a bidirectional integrated onboard battery charger scheme for EVs featuring a battery-supercapacitor Hybrid ESS (HESS). The integrated charger utilizes the traction motor inverter and the DC/DC converter of HESS to realize the AC/DC and DC/DC conversion stages of a standard onboard charger. As a result, the need for a standalone onboard charger is eliminated, yielding significant cost reduction and promoting the adoption of the battery-supercapacitor HESS in EVs.
