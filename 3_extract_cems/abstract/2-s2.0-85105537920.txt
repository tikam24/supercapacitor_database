A computerized chemical spray pyrolysis technique has been used for the preparation of cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) thin film for supercapacitor application from the aqueous medium at a constant temperature of 475 C. The CoFe2O4 thin film was characterized by X-ray diffraction study, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The electrochemical properties of CoFe2O4 thin film were studied by using the cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. XRD study confirms the cubic phase formation of polycrystalline CoFe2O4 thin film with crystalline size of 22 nm. FESEM shows crack free, uniform, well-grown mesoporous grain like surface morphology of the thin film. EDAX study endorses that the film was stoichiometric and homogeneous. Bandgap energy value of CoFe2O4 thin film was found to be 2.42 eV. From cyclic voltammetry, the specific capacitance of CoFe2O4 thin film was found to be 369 Fg1 at a scan rate of 2 mVs1 in 1 MKOH electrolyte with a wide potential window of 1.2 to + 0.5 V. The chronopotentiometry of CoFe2O4 thin film shows nonlinear, charge/discharge curve which confirms the pseudocapacitive behaviour. Specific power and specific energy of CoFe2O4 thin film was 27.14 Wh kg1 and 28.74 kWkg1 at current density of 2 mAg1.
