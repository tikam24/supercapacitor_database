To exploit the synergistic advantage of increased electro-active sites between the interfaces and enhanced surface area, we have synthesized self-assembled van der Waals heterostructures of protonated graphitic carbon nitride (pg-CN) and negatively charged graphene oxide reduced latter to reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Polypyrrole nanotubes (PPyNTs) are introduced by in-situ polymerization of pyrrole in presence of rGO-pg-CN to form the ternary rGO-pg-CN/PPyNTs nanocomposite. The formation of self-assembled rGO-pg-CN heterostructures is suggested by the increasing binding energy of C 1s orbital in XPS. Mesoporous ternary rGO-pg-CN/PPyNTs nanocomposite, with BET specific surface area of 158 m2/g, exhibits specific capacitance of 803 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density with 61% capacitive retention at 7-fold current density in 1 M KCl electrolyte. Ternary rGO-pg-CN/PPyNTs/ITO electrode possesses cycling stability of 82% after 5000 GCD cycles at 7-fold current density. Additionally, we have assembled a symmetric supercapacitor using rGO-pg-CN/PPyNTs as the electrode. The symmetric supercapacitor delivers energy density of 8.063 Wh/kg at power density of 125.002 W/kg, with excellent specific capacitance of 232.21 F/g at 0.5 A/g current density. This specific capacitance remains 71.52 F/g even after 4-fold of current density, which makes rGO-pg-CN/PPyNTs a stable supercapacitor electrode.
