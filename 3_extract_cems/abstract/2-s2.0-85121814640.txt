The MnO/C composites were obtained by co-precipitation method, which used Mn3O4 nanomaterials as precursors and dopamine solution after ultrasonic mixing and calcination under N2 atmosphere at different temperatures. By studying the difference of MnO/C nanomaterials formed at different temperatures, it was found that with the increase of calcination temperature, the materials appear obvious agglomeration. The optimal calcination temperature is 400 Â°C, and the resulting MnO/C is a uniformly dispersed slender nanowire structure. The specific capacitance of MnO/C nanowires can reach 356 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. In the meantime, the initial capacitance of MnO/C nanowires remains 106% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor was installed, which displays a tremendous energy density of 30.944 Wh kg-1 along with a high power density of 10 kW kg-1. The composite material reveals a promising prospect in the application of supercapacitors.
