The surfaces of nanoporous metals are easy to be oxidized under normal ambient condition. This usual attribute permits the exploration of metal-core oxide-shell structure that would be used for supercapacitors (SCs). However, the large-scale application of such electrodes is still limited by the intrinsically low ion diffusion coefficient, poor electronic conductivity and frustrating structural stability. Here we design a defect decorated hierarchical nanoporous CuMn2O4/Cu0.2Ni0.8O/CuxOy @ alloy electrode (HNP-TMO) by dealloying-coarsening-dealloying a sandwich-like NiCuMn/Ni/NiCuMn alloy and followed by self-combusting (2.1 mm s−1). The sandwiched Ni can synergy with unoxidized alloy to provide excellent mechanical stability and electronic conductivity, while the hierarchically porous structure with robust defects can ensure rapid electron/ion transportation. Benefiting from these merits, the HNP-TMO electrode with high mass loading of 7.8 mg cm−2 delivers an ultrahigh area capacity of 6.78 mAh cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, good rate capability (maintaining 3.33 mAh cm−2 at ultra-high current density of 100 mA cm−2) and outstanding cycling performance with capacity retention of 92.7% after 12000 cycles. Full symmetric supercapacitor also demonstrates high energy and power density of 0.17 mWh cm−2 and 40.15 mW cm−2, respectively, indicating the promise for practical energy storage applications.
