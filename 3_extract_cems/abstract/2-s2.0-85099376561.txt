Transition metal oxide NiCoO4 can be used as electrode material in energy storage devices because of its high theoretical specific capacitance, rich in resources, and environmental friendliness. However, pure NiCoO4 has obvious drawbacks because of the damaging in faraday reaction, such as smaller rate capability and shorter cycle life. Therefore, to solve these problems, the design and fabrication of NiCoO4-based composite is extremely entailed. Graphene with desirable chemical stability and remarkable conductivity is a suitable material to solve the defects of pure NiCoO4. In this paper, graphene oxide is reduced by nickel foam directly in its aqueous suspension, and then NiCoO4 grows on the surface of graphene through chemical bath deposition and calcination processes. When used as an electrode, the specific capacitance of Graphene/NiCoO4 composite is as high as 809.5 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and still keeps 647.6 F/g at 16 A/g. Furthermore, it also exhibits good cycling stability, such as 83.7% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. It is believed that the Graphene/NiCoO4 composite will have a great potential for application in supercapacitors.
