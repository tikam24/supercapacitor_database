We for the first time report a novel kind of supercapacitor using hierarchical MoS2/Mn3O4 hybrid architectures as electrodes based on layered MoS2 and Mn3O4 nanoparticles via a simple and low-cost hydrothermal and chemical precipitation route. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles are homogeneously incorporated into thin layers of MoS2 hierarchical architectures. The cycle stability of MoS2/Mn3O4 nanostructure is greatly improved, still reserves a capacity of 119.3 F g-1 after 2000 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g-1, about 69.3% reservation of the initial capacitance, more than two times higher than that of pure layered MoS2 electrode. The good performance is due to the synergistic effect between the layered MoS2 and Mn3O4 nanoparticles. The layered hybrid displays a larger specific surface to provide enough active sites for the redox reaction and shorten the distance of charge transfer for ions and electrons. While Mn3O4 acts as a holder to enhance the stability of the MoS2 framework and provides additional capacity. The Mn3O4 nanoparticles can serve as a holder and prevent MoS2 nanosheets from restacking. Moreover, the MoS2 sheets act as subtracts to improve to the conductivity of Mn3O4. The layered MoS2/Mn3O4 hybrid inspires a new way of designing high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
