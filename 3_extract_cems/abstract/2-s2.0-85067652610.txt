We report a quick 10-min route to synthesize a reduced graphene oxide/tungsten oxide (rGO/WO3) nanocomposite with impressive capacitive properties. The developed reaction was based on a nascent hydrogen reduction, a strong agent that allows the simultaneous reduction of components, leading to a material with synergic features. The rGO/WO3 nanocomposite was extensively characterized by various techniques confirming the obtainment through the proposed route. The supercapacitive properties of rGO/WO3 electrode were evaluated and the results showed a specific capacitance of 287 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1, with more than 70% of stability even after 3000 cycles, 2.4 times higher than WO3 itself. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports of such simple and fast synthesis of rGO/WO3-based materials, along with promising performance as electrode for supercapacitors. Besides, the development of this work had no dependence on hydrazine and sodium borohydride, highly hazardous chemicals commonly employed for rGO-based nanocomposites, or any expensive equipment.
