The electrochemical deposition of the composites polyaniline (PANI):polypyrrole (PPy)/ activated carbon (AC) and polyaniline (PANI): 3, 4-polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)/AC films is carried out in this work. The electrochemical character of the fabricated samples is investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) using a three-electrode setup. The values of the specific capacitance of the composites PANI:PPy/AC and PANI:PEDOT/AC at a current density of 1 Ag−1 are evaluated as 586 Fg−1 and 611 Fg−1, respectively. The values of energy density are 40 Whkg−1 and 2094 Wkg−1, whereas power density is recorded as 44 Whkg−1 and 2160 Wkg−1 for respective composites PANI:PPy/AC and PANI:PEDOT/AC. Moreover, the respective composites appeared to retain cyclic stabilities of 92% and 90%. This study points to the potential of the prepared composites for application as electrodes in supercapacitors.
