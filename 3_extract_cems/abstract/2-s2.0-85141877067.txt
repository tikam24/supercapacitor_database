Layered two-dimensional (2D) materials demonstrate exceptional performance as supercapacitor electrodes due to their unique intrinsic properties. A hybrid 2D/2D heterostructured electrode material can synergize the individual energy storage features of each of the layered 2D materials. Ti3C2 MXene is an emergent 2D material with enriched energy storage capabilities but suffers from certain vulnerabilities during the charge storage process. Vanadium ditelluride (VTe2) is an interesting yet unexplored layered material within the 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family. Owing to the unique structural features, VTe2 showcases certain advantages in energy storage. The formation of the VTe2/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure for energy storage applications has not been reported until now. Herein, we report a facile and simple hydrothermal synthesis approach to prepare bare VTe2 and the VTe2/MXene heterostructure for supercapacitor applications. The energy storage mechanism in the heterostructure is systematically analyzed. The synergistically induced interplaying effects enhance the specific capacitance of the heterostructure to 250 F g−1 along with excellent durability during long cycle operation. Consequently, an asymmetric system is constructed with VTe2/MXene as the positive electrode and MoS2/MXene as the negative electrode. The 2D/2D heterostructure-based asymmetric supercapacitor delivers excellent performance with an energy density of 46.3 W h kg−1 and a highest power density of 6400 W kg−1. Furthermore, the density functional theory calculations predict that the enhancement of electronic Te 5P states near the Fermi level due to MXene leads to improved performance of the VTe2/Ti3C2 hybrid for supercapacitor applications.
