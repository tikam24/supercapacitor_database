Auto rickshaws, a three wheeled vehicle used as taxi is a popular choice for public transportation in Indian sub-continent and south-east Asian countries due to its compact size and cost of travel. The shooting price of petroleum and environmental concerns has accelerated electrification of auto rickshaws along with other vehicles. Battery operated electric rickshaws are already available in different cities of India but faces issues like driving range, battery cost, charging facility, battery replacement/disposal, etc. In order to tackle these issues a hybrid energy source comprising of battery and ultracapacitor is proposed in this chapter. Introduction of ultracapacitor will reduce the burden of battery and also increases its life. The resulting lower rated battery can fulfil the system requirements thereby reducing size and cost of the vehicle. In this chapter an electric rickshaw with battery and ultracapacitor as energy sources was modelled in Matlab- SimulinkÂ® for two different driving cycles namely the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) and the Urban Artemis Drive cycle (ArtUrban). It was observed that the addition of ultracapacitor has enhanced vehicle performance.
