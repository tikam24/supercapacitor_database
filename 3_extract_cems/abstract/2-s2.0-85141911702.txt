Porous carbon nanofibers combine the superiorities such as good electrical conductivity, intrinsic and structural flexibility, as well as potential mass production, rendering it an important material for flexible and wearable electronics. Nonetheless, the influence of porous carbon nanofiber's nanostructure on electrochemical performances and mechanical flexibility remains an important open question in the design of high-performance and flexible supercapacitors. To address this matter, herein, we report a systematic study to fabricate the porous carbon nanofibers cloth with both high electrical conductivity and flexibility. Our results indicate that the stress concentration during the bending of porous carbon nanofibers can be efficiently relieved through reducing the size of graphite microcrystals and introducing pores between graphite microcrystals, resulting in good flexibility. Meanwhile, the fabricated porous carbon nanofiber achieves high electrical conductivity (Max. 1600 S/m), which can be directly used as flexible supercapacitor electrode material without introducing a conductive agent and binder. Finally, the flexible supercapacitor electrode based on this porous carbon nanofiber exhibits a high specific capacitance of 184 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. Our win-win strategy provides new insight into the fabrication of flexible porous carbon nanofiber materials, showing great application prospects in the field of flexible supercapacitors.
