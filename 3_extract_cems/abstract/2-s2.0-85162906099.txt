Half-electrolysis runs one desirable half-cell reaction with the aid of a counter supercapacitor electrode which replaces the other unwanted half-cell reaction occurred inevitably in conventional electrolysis. Herein, it is developed to complete the whole cell reaction of water electrolysis, in alternative steps, with a capacitive activated carbon (AC) electrode and an electrolysis Pt electrode. When positively charging the AC electrode, a hydrogen evolution reaction occurs at the Pt electrode. By reversing the current, the charge stored in the AC electrode is discharged to assist the oxygen evolution reaction on the same Pt electrode. Consecutive completion of the two processes realizes the overall reaction of water electrolysis. This strategy leads to stepwise production of H2 and O2 without the need of a diaphragm in the cell and hence results in a lower energy consumption compared with the practical conventional electrolysis.
