A new type of mesoporous silica (MS) with high surface area and large pore volume has been synthesised by employing a rapid sol-gel based inverse micelle method and electrochemically active metal center, manganese, has been incorporated into it. The MnO2decorated silica composites are obtained through the wet impregnation technique using KMnO4followed by their reduction under neutral conditions. The structure and surface area of the samples have been characterised by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), BET surface area and pore size analysis, transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and FE-SEM), FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical techniques,i.e.cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), have been used to evaluate the electrochemical properties of the composites. The resultant compositeMS/MnO2-3with a significantly high surface area (453 m2g−1) is found to exhibit a superior specific capacitance of 1158.50 F g−1at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1which is very close to the theoretical value and retains 87.8% of its capacitance up to 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1current density. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the composite can be attributed to the high surface area and uniform pore size distribution of the novel silica host which simultaneously increases the electrochemically active centres, promotes electrolyte penetration and enhances electron transport. The simplicity of the synthesis process developed here is interesting for wide-scale production of MnO2-based electro-active materials.
