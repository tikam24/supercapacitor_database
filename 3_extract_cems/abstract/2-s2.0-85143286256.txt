MnO2@GO, NiO@GO and MnO2@NiO@GO electrodes were hydrothermally fabricated for applications in supercapacitor energy storage devices. Because of its large surface area and low electrical resistance, graphene oxide (GO) was added to the nanocomposites during electrode fabrication. The mutual co-operation of diverse components and composites with GO increased the performance, longevity, and hardness of electrodes. The greatest specific capacitance measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 10 ​mV/s scan rates and GCD at 1.0 A/g current density for MnO2@GO, NiO@GO, and MnO2@NiO@GO, respectively, was 652, 425, 985 and 773, 487, 1141 ​F/g for MnO2@GO, NiO@GO, and MnO2@NiO@GO. Performances of various electrodes clearly show that composites of two transition metal oxides/GO had better performance when compared to single transition metal oxide/GO and the addition of graphene oxide enhanced the supercapacitive performances of the electrodes.
