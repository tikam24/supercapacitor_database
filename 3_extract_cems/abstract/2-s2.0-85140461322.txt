Silver nano-colloids have been generated via Laser Ablation Synthesis in Solution (LASiS) system. Nanoparticle formation with particle size below 50 nm in DI water was confirmed using UV-VIS spectroscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Supercapacitor structure, having dimension 11 mm x 10 mm, was successfully Aerosol Jet printed on an untreated polymer substrate using as produced LASiS silver nano-colloid.
