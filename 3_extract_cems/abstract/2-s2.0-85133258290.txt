Hydrogel has a similar structure and modulus to human tissue, making it an ideal material for use as artificial skin or robotic electronic skin. CuS/Ti3C2Tx homostructures were prepared using an one-pot hydrothermal method for the conductive hydrogel electrodes. The homostructures material improves the electron transport from the active material to the collector and contributes more effectively to the pseudocapacitance. With the improved electrochemical performance of the hydrogel electrode material, the specific capacitance value is as high as 33.48F/g at a current density of 10 mA/g. The capacitance retention rate was 88.54% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 150 mA/g. Moreover, the multiple hydrogen bonding interaction between CuS/Ti3C2Tx and the hydrogel substrate gives the hydrogel electrode excellent mechanical properties with an elongation at break of 663.5%. This provides a way to construct conductive hydrogel electrode materials as flexible electronic energy storage devices.
