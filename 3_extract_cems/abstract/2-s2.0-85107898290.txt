The wide use of manganese dioxide (MnO2) as an electrode in all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) remains challenging because of its low electrical conductivity. This complication can be circumvented by introducing trivalent gadolinium (Gd) ions into the MnO2. Herein, we describe the successful hydrothermal synthesis of crystalline Gd-doped MnO2 nanorods with Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as cathode, which we combined with Fe3O4/GO nanospheres as anode for all-solid-state ASCs. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that Gd doping significantly affected the electrochemical activities of the MnO2, which was further enhanced by introducing Ni(OH)2. The GdMnO2/Ni(OH)2 electrode offers sufficient surface electrochemical activity and exhibits excellent specific capacity of 121.8 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1, appealing rate performance, and ultralong lifetime stability (99.3% retention after 10,000 discharge tests). Furthermore, the GdMnO2/Ni(OH)2//PVA/KOH//Fe3O4/GO solid-state ASC device offers an impressive specific energy density (60.25 W h kg−1) at a high power density (2332 W kg−1). This investigation thus shows its large potential in developing novel approaches to energy storage devices.
