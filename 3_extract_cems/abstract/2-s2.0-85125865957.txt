We report cathodic deposition of birnessite oxide from permanganate alkaline solutions into porous flexible cloth consisting from carbon nanotubes. Oxide distribution in the pores is studied by means of electron microscopy, including transmission microscopy of microtom cross-sections and local elemental analysis. Oxide distribution depends on applied deposition mode. The intermittent potentiostatic mode favors the penetration of permanganate reagent into the pores of CNT cloth and allows us to fabricate more homogeneous hybrid material. We demonstrate a number of advantages of hybrid materials with oxide located mostly inside the cloth pores as compared to oxide located at external surface of the cloth.
