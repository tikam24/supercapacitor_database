Triangular Ni(HCO3)2 nanosheets were synthesized via a template-free solvothermal method. The phase transition and formation mechanism were explored systematically. Further investigation indicated that the reaction time and pH have significant effects on the morphology and size distribution of the triangular Ni(HCO3)2 nanosheets. More interestingly, the resulting product had an ultra-thin structure and high specific surface area, which can effectively accelerate the charge transport during charge–discharge processes. As a result, the triangular Ni(HCO3)2 nanosheets not only exhibited high specific capacitance (1,797 F·g-1 at 5 A·g-1 and 1,060 F·g-1 at 50 A·g-1), but also showed excellent cycling stability with a high current density (~80% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles at the current density of 20 A·g-1).
