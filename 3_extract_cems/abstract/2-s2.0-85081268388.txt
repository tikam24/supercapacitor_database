Supercapacitors with good electrochemical performance and flexibility are in great demand. In this paper, the concept of preparing 3D porous carbon monoliths via direct calcination of melamine sponge is presented. This preparation method is simple and has good control of the structure. Porous carbon composite nickel-manganese oxides can be obtained by hydrothermal method followed with calcination. The electrochemical performances were tested and porous carbon monoliths with NiMn oxides exhibited a specific capacitance of 870 F/g in 1 mol/L KOH at a charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A/g and a capacity retention of 89.9% after 5000 times charge and discharge
