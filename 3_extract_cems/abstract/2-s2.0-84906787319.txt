We report on a non-covalent functionalization of graphene foam (GF) synthesized via chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The GF was treated with pyrene carboxylic acid (PCA) which acted as a source of oxygen and/or hydroxyl groups attached to the surface of the graphene foam for its electrochemical performance improvement. The modified graphene surface enabled a high pseudocapacitive effect on the GF. A specific capacitance of 133.3 F g-1, power density ∼ 145.3 kW kg-1 and energy density ∼ 4.7 W h kg -1 were achieved based on the functionalized foam in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The results suggest that non-covalent functionalization might be an effective approach to overcome the restacking problem associated with graphene electrodes and also signify the importance of surface functionalities in graphene-based electrode materials. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
