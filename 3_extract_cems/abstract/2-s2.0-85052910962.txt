Due to its 2D-layered structure, MoS2 has drawn a lot of attention in energy storage device. Herein, yolk–shell MoS2 (YS-MoS2) microspheres were fabricated through a facile hydrothermal method with the presence of PEG-800. Both the shell and the core of the microsphere are composed of numerous self-assembly ultrathin nanosheets. In addition, the interlayer spacing of the synthesized YS-MoS2 is larger than the standard value of MoS2. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the YS-MoS2 showed high specific capacitance (343.0 F·g−1 at 0.25 A·g−1) and excellent cyclic stability (120% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A·g−1). The excellent electrochemical performances of synthesized YS-MoS2 may be ascribed to its yolk-shell structure, hierarchical porous structure and expanded interlayer spacing.
