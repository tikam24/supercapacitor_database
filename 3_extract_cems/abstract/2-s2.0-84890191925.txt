Emission-like manganese dioxide was controlled synthesized by using the hydrothermal method in the different reaction time for supercapacitor electrode. The structures were characterized by XRD and SEM, and the supercapacitive behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge tests, and ac impedance spectroscopy, respectively. The results suggested that the as-prepared manganese dioxides indexed tetragonal cryptomelane phase and the morphology of which was emission-like nanoclusters. Crystallinity and structure dimension became larger and the nanostab structure of every single branch was changed into nanorod structure followed with the time. The specific capacitance values of manganese dioxide electrode was 448 F/g corresponding to the charge/discharge current densities of 5mA/cm2. With the prolonging of reaction time, the specific capacitance tended to raise first and then declined.
