The task of developing hybrid nanostructured materials to enhance the energy and power density of energy storage devices has assumed greater significance in the past decade. The present research work demonstrates the hydrothermal preparation of graphene-blended Co3S4-CoS nanostructures (CSG) and the fabrication of a symmetric supercapacitor device. The CSG was examined through structural, morphological, surface area and electrochemical characterization. The CSG nanostructures yielded a maximum specific capacitance of 1003 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 with excellent rate capacitance (43%) at 50 A g−1. The CSG nanostructure shows 97% cycling stability over 2600 cycles. The well-blended structure, high conductivity and large surface area of CSG contribute to the best capacitive performance. A CSG-based symmetric supercapacitor device offered a great energy density of 26.7 W h kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The device exhibits good cyclic stability even after 5000 cycles. Three devices connected in series (4.5 V) were charged for 141 s at a current of 10 A could power up red and green LEDs for over 600 s and 480 s, respectively. The obtained electrochemical results and exceptional performance of symmetric devices endorse CSG to be a promising material for energy storage applications.
