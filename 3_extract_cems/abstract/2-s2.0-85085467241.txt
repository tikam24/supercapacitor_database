Plasma treated nitrogen-doped graphite oxide is synthesized by using melamine and solution plasma for supercapacitor applications. Nitrogen of 12.8 wt% was obtained, and electrochemical surface area increased by almost three times compared to precursor graphite oxide, resulting that electrochemical impedance dramatically decreased from 221 to 17 Ω at 100 Hz. The composite exhibits high specific capacitance of 336 Fg−1, which is more than four times higher than that of precursor graphite oxide (81 Fg−1) at the current density of 0.5 Ag−1 in the aqueous medium, originating from the high nitrogen content by melamine as well as the increased surface area by the plasma treatment. The high specific energy of 18 Whkg−1 with the specific power of 199 Wkg−1 was obtained from the full cell of the composite, and excellent capacitance retention of 92% and coulombic efficiency of 91% after 10,000 cycles proved high cyclic stability and reliability.
