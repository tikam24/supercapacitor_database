Fabrication of miniature-integrated devices combining energy harvester, energy storage, and various sensors via simple, fast, and efficient ways is strongly desired for the practical application of integrated smart systems. Herein, this work presents a simple one-step laser scribing method to prepare an all MXene-based seamlessly integrated system with integrated wireless charging coil, micro-supercapacitor, and photodetector in a small area of only 1.78 cm2. All the three modules in the integrated system are composed entirely of Ti3C2Tx MXene and are connected with highly conductive MXene wires without additional welding or assembling operation. The energy is first received by the wireless charging coil and then stored in the Zn-ion micro-supercapacitor, which is subsequently used to drive the surface-modified (dodecyl triethoxysilane) DCTES-MXene-based photodetector, thus realizing the complete energy cycles. This work conceptually illustrates a simple method for designing and preparing integrated multifunctional wearable devices.
