CuxO@polypyrrole nanofibre (PpyNF) composites were synthesized by a simple and fast microwave method. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy; galvanostatic charge–discharge tests, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were also conducted. The PpyNF composites showed a maximum specific capacitance of 464.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with excellent cyclability (95.6% capacitance retention after 2,000 cycles at 1 A g−1), thereby demonstrating their excellent potential for application to supercapacitors. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on CuxO@PpyNF//active carbon revealed a maximum gravimetric energy density of 12.50 Wh kg−1 and power density of 0.38 kW kg −1.
