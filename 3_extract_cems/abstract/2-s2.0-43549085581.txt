The purpose of this paper is to present Solectria's approach to the design and realization of a high power, nonisolated DC-to-DC power converter for supercapacitors. The study focuses on supercapacitor specific design rules and on how to integrate the unit into a system with other energy storage devices and converters. Two applications are presented to illustrate the validity of the suggested approach: an electric vehicle with supercapacitor load leveling, and a 50 kW pulsed power source. Â© 2001 IEEE.
