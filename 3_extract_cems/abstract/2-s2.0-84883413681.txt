Wireless power transmission (WPT) is an emerging side in every sector of science and technology. In our paper we proposed a model of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging by the help of renewable energy sources using this WPT. Through this wireless function EVs get charged by microwave beam from transmitter and then receiver will capture this microwave beam which is transferred into DC power and finally stored in various electrochemical storages (e.g. Lithium ion cell, Supercapacitors). For environmental safety the beam emission zone will be protected by barrier which surrounds the vehicle charging area so that it doesn't cause any hazard on humans. Here, Li-ion battery replaces traditional fossil fuel system of automotive vehicles. Because now-a-days Li-ion batteries are considered as the dominant power source for EVs due to its high energy density, good cycle life, and good power performance. Besides it, super-capacitors have been proposed as a supplement of Li-ion batteries to support at the time of high power demand of EVs. Â© 2013 IEEE.
