Carbon/nano Ru composites were obtained by silica templating of dichlorobis(μ-chloro)bis[(1-3-η: 6-8-η)-2,7-dimethyloctadienediyl] diruthenium(IV), followed by pyrolysis. Carbon/RuO2·xH2O composites were obtained by electro-oxidation of carbon/nano Ru composites. It was found that the carbon/Ru composites had homogeneously dispersed Ru nanoparticles in the hierarchical pore structures and carbon matrix. The carbon/RuO2·xH2O composites displayed improved capacitive properties (229F/g at 10mV/s ) as electrodes of supercapacitors in H2SO4 electrolyte.
