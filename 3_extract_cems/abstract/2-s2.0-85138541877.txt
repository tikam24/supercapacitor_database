The restacking of MXene nanosheets resulted in poor ion accessibility to absorption sites, preventing MXene from high energy density and power density. Herein, 0D/2D composite Ti3 C2 Tx MXene was prepared by hydrothermal method to alleviate the restacking problem. The quantum dot ⁃- interspersed Ti3 C2 Tx nanosheets (QDT) structure was confirmed by X ⁃- ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The free ⁃- standing film electrodes assembled by QDT showed prominently improved electrochemical properties compared to the pristine Ti3 C2 Tx nanosheets. In three⁃-electrode system, the mass specific capacitance reached 338 F·g-1 under a scan rate of 5 mV·s-1 . The capacitance retention reached 46% as the scan rate was 2 000 mV·s-1 . In two⁃-electrode system, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivered a discharge capacitance of 216 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g-1 . The capacitance retention rate was 87% after 10 000 cycles. The above electrochemical properties of QDT film electrodes were ascribed to the increased ion absorption sites from quantum dots and shortened ion pathway resulted from reduced nanosheet sizes.
