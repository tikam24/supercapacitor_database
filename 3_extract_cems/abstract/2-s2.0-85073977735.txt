Abstract: In this research work, copolyimides (PIa,b) were synthesized by chemical routs. We used perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and synthesized diamines (DAa,b) containing thiazole ring as monomers to obtain PIa,b which were characterized by 1HNMR and FTIR spectroscopies. We prepared POAP/PIa and POAP/PIb by depositing poly ortho amino phenol (POAP) as conductive polymer on the surface of PIa,b via in situ electropolymerization. To evaluate the effect of the PIa,b in terms of the electrochemical performance of composites, we used galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of 207.2 and 322.4 F/g are obtained for POAP/PIa and POAP/PIb, respectively. All these evidences prove that POAP/PI composites have long cycle life as well as high specific capacitance, which are indicative for being a good candidate in terms of application in supercapacitors.
