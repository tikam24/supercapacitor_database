MXene, a kind of booming two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, has exhibited a promising application on free-standing high-performance supercapacitors. However, researches on MXene-based cathodes are still under development because its susceptibility to oxidation. Herein, a flexible free-standing polyaniline@MXene-carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film was prepared by a delicately-designed solvent-assisted self-assembly method followed with a vacuum filtration process. The zero-dimensional (0D) polyaniline (PANI) nanoparticle, which is often used as a cathode nanomaterial, was coated on the surface of 2D MXene nanosheets by solvent-assisted self-assembly to prevent MXene from oxidation and provide high specific capacitance simultaneously. The one-dimensional (1D) CNTs were introduced to endow the composite with well mechanical strength and flexibility. The ternary composite film delivers an excellent mechanical performance with a tensile strength of 99.4 MPa, a high specific capacitance of 463 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, and good cyclic stability with 92 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled with the ternary composite film as cathode and the prepared free-standing MXene-CNTs as anode achieves a high energy density of 10 Wh kg−1 and an exceptional power density of 2808 W kg−1.
