A novel concept of structural supercapacitors based on CF reinforced composites has been introduced that can simultaneously act as a structural component and an electrical energy storing device. Supercapacitors consisting of woven carbon fibre mat based electrodes; filter paper insulator and PEGDGE/DGEBA based polymer electrolyte were fabricated. BET surface area analysis and tensile tests were conducted on the asreceived and activated carbon fibre reinforcements. Compression tests and ionic conductivity measurements were conducted on the polymer electrolyte whilst charge/discharge electrochemical tests were done on the structural supercapacitors. This was to investigate the implications of increased DGEBA loading in PEGDGE polymer electrolyte and carbon fibre activation on the multifunctionality of structural supercapacitors. The addition of DGEBA increased the compressive stiffness, although the ionic conductivity was compromised. Specific capacitance of the structural supercapacitor was increased with the chemical activation of CF based electrodes. Carbon fibre activation led to improved specific capacitance of the structural supercapacitors and the addition of DGEBA increased the compressive stiffness, although the ionic conductivity was compromised.
