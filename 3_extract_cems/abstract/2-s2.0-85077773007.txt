Supercapacitors are useful in peak power applications to suppress and compensate transient effects that significantly affect batteries. Unfortunately, they suffer from self-discharge due to the redox reactions process in porous electrodes. This study aims at investigating into the effect of Alumina (Al2O3) as insulating layer (blocking layer) on the supercapacitors' performance during the self-discharge phenomenon. Two models of supercapacitors were developed, and implemented in the Matlab/Simulink software. The first model is without, and the second one with Al2O3 coating. Some simulations are performed. The results demonstrate that an application of an ultra-Thin insulating layer of Al2O3 with a thickness about 0.5 nm on the electrodes of supercapacitors may reduce the faradic reactions rate by 17% and the leakage current by 77.73%. However, the specific capacitance of the electrical double layer may decrease by 45.35% and the voltage drop is about 50% for devices without Al2O3 compared to 0.02% with Al2O3.
