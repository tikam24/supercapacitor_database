Electromagnetic pollution and electrochemical energy consumption have driven enormous endeavors in electromagnetic wave absorption materials and energy storage devices, however, designing versatile composites for addressing the issue remains a huge challenge. Herein, a versatile honeycomb-like N-doped carbon/bimetallic sulfide and oxide (N–CoFe2O4-CoxSy/FexSy@C) composites aerogel was designed via a simple mechanical mixing, freeze-drying and heat treatment method. As-prepared N–CoFe2O4-CoxSy/FexSy@C composites exhibited excellent electromagnetic wave absorption and electrochemical performances. The minimum RL can reach −51.9 dB at 15.5 GHz, with an effective frequency bandwidth (RL < −10 dB) of 4.01 GHz (13.73–17.74 GHz) at a thickness of 1.5 mm, these remarkable properties were originated from the abundance dipole/interfacial polarization along with multiple magnetic attenuation process. More importantly, an outstanding specific capacitance of 2883 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 89.5% after 5000 cycles were also achieved, which is ascribed to the affluent active sites and well-defined hetero-architecture. Considering the novel N–CoFe2O4-CoxSy/FexSy@C composites aerogel possessing a unique blend of excellent electromagnetic wave absorber and supercapacitors electrodes, these multifunctional features would be highly promising for the next-generation environmental remediating materials.
