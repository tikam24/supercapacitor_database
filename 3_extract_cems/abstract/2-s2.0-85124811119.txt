Polypyrrole (PPy) has higher conductivity than other conducting polymers. As the cost is lower than carbon-based electrodes, PPy is the commonly used polymer. Synthesized pure PPy and doped n-Ag2OPPy were characterized by instrumentation techniques such as Fourier Transform-Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and UltraViolet Visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis). Further, electrical properties were determined from A.C. Electrical conductivity measurements by two-probe methods. FT-IR spectra confirm the presence of the nano silver oxide-doped polypyrrole. Polypyrrole composite shows a crystalline structure identified by XRD analysis with a crystalline size of 46.15 nm. EDX analysis confirms the presence of Ag & O in n-Ag2OPPy and SEM studies show the non-uniform distribution of Ag in n-Ag2OPPy. The optical property was studied by UV–Vis Spectroscopy. A.C Electrical conductivity of nano silver oxide-doped PPy was enhanced by two orders than pure PPy. The increase in A.C electrical conductivity is due to the additional effect of conductivity from the interfacial capacitive region. The specific capacitance for n-Ag2OPPy was calculated by Cyclic voltammetry (CV) which is found to be 293 Fg−1.
