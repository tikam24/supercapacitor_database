Rose-like Bi2MoO6 microsphere has been successfully prepared by a typical hydrothermal method, and it is the first time that the material of this morphology has been studied for its electrochemistry properties. The rose-like microsphere with a mean a hierarchical structure is composed of plenty of nanoplates [1], and possesses an excellent specific surface area (SBET) of 63 m2/g and total pore volume (Ttot) of 0.2336 cm3/g. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, it delivers a large specific capacitance of 828 F/g at 1 A/g, and displays a good rate performance which the 84% capacitance can be hold as the current density increases tenfold [2], exhibits good cycle stability with the capacitance retention of about 57.04% over 1000 repeated charging/discharging process at 10 A/g. The desirable electrochemical performance may be related to the synergistic effect of rose-like microsphere structure and porous structure. These results demonstrate that rose-like Bi2MoO6 microsphere is a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitor [2].
