A high-performance paper electrode is fabricated through coating polypyrrole (PPy) on ordinary laboratory filter paper via a traditional interfacial polymerization method with perchloric acid (HClO4) as a dopant. Owing to the superior mechanical flexibility and environmental stability of the free standing PPy paper, the robust electrode displays an ultrahigh capacitance of 1650 mF cm−2 and remarkable cyclic stability of losing 11.66% after cycling for 10000 times in a three-electrode system. More importantly, the areal specific capacitance has only decreased by 0.08% after five months. Furthermore, by employing the synthesized PPy papers as electrodes and the PVA-H2SO4 gel as electrolyte, the assembled all-solid-state supercapacitor with an areal specific capacitance of 566.5 mF cm−2 is achieved, corresponding to an areal energy density of 38.55 μW h cm−2 and power density of 0.17 mW cm−2. These results suggest that the simple synthesis of PPy paper electrode pave a promising way to exploit flexible and durable energy storage applications.
