Vanadate nanomaterials with unique amorphous phase possess more active sites and isotropic nature, which is in favor of facilitating the diffusion of electrolyte ions into the electrode materials during the charge/discharge process and providing high capacitance for samples. Hereby, we report the preparation of the amorphous NiCozVxOy(NCVO) nanosphere as electrode materials for supercapacitors via a facile method using ethanol as the agent for assembly materials. The NCVO delivers a specific capacitance of 1449.3 F/g at 2 A/g with excellent rate capability. And the asymmetric supercapacitor devices achieve a high energy density of 45 Wh/kg at 1 A/g, a power density of 8000 W/kg at 10 A/g and good capacitance retention of 91.4% after 2000 cycles compared with its initial value under the voltage window of 1.6 V. The amorphous NCVO nanosphere prepared by the facile route exhibits attractive electrochemical properties and provides a potential candidate as energy storage materials for supercapacitors.
