This study proposes the integration of a supercapacitor (SC) with the DC link of a three-phase four-wire active power filter (APF) by using an interfaced three-level bidirectional buck-boost converter controlled by the fuzzy control approach. APF is a flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) device that enhances power quality in the electrical network by reducing the load current harmonics and compensating the reactive power. Regulating the DC voltage of the APF's DC link and absorbing fluctuations in compensated reactive power during disturbances are the major objectives of the integration of an SC circuit to APF. The studied model is a wind farm of Gabal El-Zeit with a total capacity of 580 MW, connected to unbalanced nonlinear loads. The Gabal El-Zeit wind farm is divided into three projects with a capacity of 240 MW, 220 MW, and 120 MW. The model is simulated by the MATLAB/SIMULINK program, and the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is proved by applying different types of faults such as single-line-to-ground, double-line-to-ground, and three-line-to-ground faults. In addition, an additional SC circuit with a two-level converter is connected to the generators coupled to the wind turbines to enhance the performance of the wind farm during disturbances. The results show that SC-integrated APF can reduce the harmonic distortion and compensate the reactive power for high or low inductive loads. Also, it can regulate the DC voltage and absorb the fluctuations in the reactive power during faults. Finally, the performance and the stability of the overall electric system are improved.
