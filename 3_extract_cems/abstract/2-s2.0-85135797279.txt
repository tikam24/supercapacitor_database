The inherent electrochemical performance of the electrode material is mainly decided by its morphology and architecture. Therefore, to address the issues of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials with low electrical conductivity and easy aggregation. Herein, we successfully in-situ grow Zn-Co MOF and zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) on the three-dimensional (3D) network structure of graphene aerogel (GA) to prepare 3D ZnCo2O4/GA cathode and 3D ZIF-8-derived N-doped active carbon/GA (N-AC/GA) anode for an alkaline battery-supercapacitor hybrid device, respectively. As a result, the 3D ZnCo2O4/GA delivers a high specific capacity of 241.1 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and even retains 156 mAh g−1 under 20 A g−1, indicating an outstanding rate capability and capacity retention (∼65%). Furthermore, the 3D N-AC/GA shows a high capacitance of 408.5 F g−1 (corresponding to a specific capacity of 112.9 mAh g−1) at 0.5 A g−1 and exhibits an excellent rate capability with ∼56% capacitance retention (∼228 F g−1) even at 20 A g−1. Then, the 3D ZnCo2O4/GA//3D N-AC/GA device achieves a maximum energy density of 30.5 Wh kg−1, a maximum power density of 6.5 kW kg−1, and good cycle stability with ∼76.9% capacity retaining capability over 10,000 cycles under 10 A g−1. Besides, our samples can be easily coated on conductive polypyrrole-modified commercial printing paper to construct flexible electrodes.
