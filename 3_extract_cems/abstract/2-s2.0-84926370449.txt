Abstract Chemical vapor deposition routes are attractive for the production of coatings, since they generally result in tough, durable layers in which their stoichiometry may cost-effectively be controlled. In addition, the simplicity of this technique, when performed at atmospheric pressure, would make such a process compatible with high-volume, in-line glass manufacturing processes. This review aims to give a brief overview of the APCVD technology and demonstrate the use of the grown coatings in thermochromics and in electrodes for electrochromics, lithium batteries and supercapacitors towards the advancement of their performance. The useful CVD parameters of vanadium dioxide, vanadium pentoxide, tungsten trioxide and carbon materials with desired qualities are identified.
