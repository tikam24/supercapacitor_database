Amorphous carbon derived from biomass unusually combines the merits of large specific surface area and abundant micropores, offering massive anchoring points for ion adsorption in electrolyte. Nevertheless, the short-range ordered structure in amorphous carbon hinders the fast electron transfer. Conversely, graphitic carbon with long-range ordered structure is beneficial for electron transfer. Thus, a low-cost strategy is required to marry hierarchical porous structure with long-range ordered structure, resulting in a long/short-range interconnected porous carbon and then leading to fast ion and electron transfer. Herein, we modified the solid-phase conversion process of biomass by employing the features of liquid-phase carbonization for petroleum asphalt. With the assistance of asphalt, the large specific surface area (>2,000 m2·g−1), high ratio of mesopores (ca. 60%) together with long-range ordered structure are in-situ created in as-made porous carbon. Thanks to the well configured structure in small scale, the as-made co-converted carbon can be operated in high-viscosity EMIMBF4 electrolyte with a superior capacitance (315 F·g−1@1 A·g−1). Besides, the as-assembled symmetric supercapacitor can deliver a super-high specific energy of 174 Wh·kg−1@2.0 kW·kg−1. This work provides a new version for designing highly porous biomass-derived carbon with long/short-range alternating structure at molecular level. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
