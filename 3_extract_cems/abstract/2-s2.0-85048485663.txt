All-round utilization of resources is proposed for maximizing environmental and economic benefits. Herein, the concept of all-round utilization on biomass derivations applying to carbon-based supercapacitors is demonstrated. Orange peel is used for all subassemblies of supercapacitor, including electrodes, separator and electrolyte. A monolithic porous carbon (OPHPC) is prepared by one-step carbonization of orange peel and another composite electrode is further synthesized by a simple hydrothermal process, based on sufficient utilization of natural structure and chemical components. OPHPC exhibits a high specific surface area of 860 m2 g−1 and naturally doped nitrogen. The composite electrode shows the homogeneous and high mass loading of MnO2. Orange peel also affords the role of separator benefited from the natural porous channel structure and high porosity of 74.6%. Orange peel juice is exploited to produce the electrolyte, and exhibits the best retention in natural separator. All-orange peel all-solid-state supercapacitor shows the high areal capacitance of 3987 mF cm−2. Furthermore, the flexibility of orange peel is also utilized to achieve the shape-tailored monolithic porous carbon electrode and device, which further extends the utilized dimensionality in biomass applying to supercapacitors. The work starts with all dimensional utilization for biomass derived supercapacitor.
