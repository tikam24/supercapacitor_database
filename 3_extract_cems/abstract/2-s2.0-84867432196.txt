Three kinds of activated carbon materials(named AC1, AC2 and AC3) used for supercapacitor electrode were successfully prepared by using KOH activation method. The precursors for the preparation were Shenmu bituminous coal, wheat stalk and their mixture, respectively. The pore structure and surface wettability of the as-prepared activated carbon materials were characterized by N 2 adsorption and contact angle measurement. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitors with activated carbon materials as electrodes were studied by using galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry, leakage current and electrochemical impedance techniques. The results show that the specific area of AC3 is as high as that of AC1 and its wettability is similar to that of AC2. In 3 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the supercapacitor with the sample AC3 as electrode has a higher specific capacitance of 270 F/g, better rechargeability, samller electrochemical impedance, and lower leakage current of 0.01 mA. It indicates that there is some synergistic effect in the process of co-activation of coal and wheat stalk.
