Facile hydrothermally synthesized PbSnS2nanosheets with various morphologies were developed to obtain high performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. A precipitation-dissolution mechanism was proposed to demonstrate the growth process of PbSnS2. The as-prepared nanosheets exhibited superior capacitance (678.8 F g-1at 50 mV s-1) and a long cycle life (95.5% capacitance retention after 100?000 cycles at 5 A g-1).
