Recently, battery-type electrode materials, such as transition metal oxides/molybdates, have attracted extensive attention in the development of high-performance supercapacitors (SCs), owing to their rich redox chemistry, high theoretical capacity and superior electrochemical activity. Herein, we prepared battery-type redox behavior-enabled tricopper dimolybdate (Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 ) with versatile morphologies of nanoflakes (NFs) and nanoparticles (NPs) by a facile hydrothermal method for SCs. With different reactants, the shape of Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 was altered under constant growth conditions. The morphological and structural characteristics of the prepared samples were investigated by FE-SEM, XRD and XPS analyses. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of the Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 nanostructures were evaluated in 1 M KOH electrolyte. From these results, the Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 NF sample exhibited a high areal capacity of 29.6 Î¼Ah/cm 2 at 1 mA/cm 2 with good rate capability of 61.1% at 20 mA/cm 2 , which are higher compared to the NP sample. Furthermore, the capacity retention of 131.3% (after 2000 cycles) was observed without any capacity fading for the Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 NFs, indicating the great cycling durability of the material. Such remarkable durability of the Cu 3 Mo 2 O 9 nanostructures could be served as an efficient electrode in energy storage devices.
