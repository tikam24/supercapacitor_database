NaxCo2O4 (x=1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0) samples were prepared by sol-gel method, and applied to the supercapacitor as electrode materials for the first time. The synthesized NaxCo2O4 crystals were performed using XRD, SEM. Results indicated that they were all layered structure. The capacitance performance of NaxCo2O4 (x=1.6) sample was the greatest and its specific discharge capacitance was 413 F/g between 0.25 and 0.7 V potential at 50 mA/g current density in 6 mol/L NaOH solution.
