A new, symmetrical, high rate, solid-state EDLC (electrical double layer capacitor) has been fabricated employing a plastic crystal SN (succinonitrile) based GPE (gel polymer electrolyte) and GNPs (graphene nano-platelets) as electrodes. The free-standing GPE film containing poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVdF-HFP) exhibits the excellent suitability as electrolyte in EDLC due to its high ionic conductivity (~2×10-3Scm-1 at 20°C), thermal stability (from-30 to 80°C), electrochemical stability window (~3.5V vs. Ag), and excellent mechanical properties. The high rate capability of the EDLC has been observed from the impedance analysis in terms of high knee frequency (~58Hz), low response time (~791ms) and high pulse power (~16.4kWkg-1). The cyclic voltammetric response indicates the capacitive performance up to a substantially high scan rate of 1000mVs-1, which further confirms the high rate performance of the EDLC. Though the specific energy of the solid-state EDLC is observed to be low (Emax~8.2Whkg-1), its power density is substantially high (Pmax4kWkg-1). After ~20% decrement in specific capacitance during the initial charge-discharge cycles, the EDLC offers almost stable performance up to ~3500cycles.
