Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been considered to be one of the most promising and worthy hot-spot materials to develop advanced catalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution and energy storage because of their abundant diversity in structure and excellent properties. However, the design of heterogeneous structure is usually an effective tactic for the construction of efficient photocatalysts because it is difficult for a single material to meet the requirements of wide spectral light response and efficient charge separation. Here, the NiV LDH@ZIF-67 p-n heterojunction was synthesized by “bottle around ship” method and served as prominent photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and excellent supercapacitor electrode as well. Delightedly, the prepared NiV LDH@ZIF-67 hybrid shows the most excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate with 9.5 and 5.9 times more than ZIF-67 and NiV LDH, respectively. Furthermore, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with active carbon exhibits a high energy density of 42.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 520.6 W kg−1 and 120% of energy storage retention after 5000 cycles (81.4% of NiV LDH//AC). This study demonstrates the promising potential of NiV LDH@ZIF-67 p-n junction for both the fields of photocatalysis and energy storage.
