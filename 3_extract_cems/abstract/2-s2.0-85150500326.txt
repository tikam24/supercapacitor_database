Now a days transition metal oxides (TMOs) have been expanded much more responsiveness as potential applicants for supercapacitors (SCs) applications due to their remarkable properties for example huge abundance, greater the value of theoretical specific capacitance, simply convenience. And environmentally safe nature. The different phase and morphology of the MnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and nanorods (NRs) were synthesized through the co-precipitation and hydrothermal method respectively. The temperature effect was changed the morphology of the MnO2. The prepared MnO2 NPs and NRs structural, optical, morphological and elemental studies were analyzed by XRD, UVâ€“Vis spectra, SEM, HR-TEM and EDAX. The electrochemical performance of the MnO2 NPs and NRs analyzed by CV, GCD and EIS spectra. This single phase and different morphology of the MnO2 NPs and NRs were tested for SC application in 3 M KOH and 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution on different substrates such as the nickel foam (NF) and graphite foil (GF) respectively. The MnO2 NRs exposed better specific capacitance results than the MnO2 NPs in both substrates and electrolyte solutions. The cyclic stability performance of MnO2 NPs and NRs better performance on the NF substrate.
