Hierarchical porous carbons with granular shape were prepared from waste biomass poplar anthers (PA) by pre-carbonization and following KOH activation. The pore structure and surface chemistry of PA-derived carbon can be controlled by adjusting the activation temperature. The material activated at 800 °C possesses a high surface area of 3639 m2 g−1, abundant mesopores, and appropriate amounts of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing species. As a result, it exhibits excellent electrochemical performances as a supercapacitor electrode. The specific capacitance reaches 361.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. In addition, it shows an impressive energy density of 60.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 10416.7 W kg−1 in the ionic liquid BMIMBF4. Particularly, a high electrochemical stability and an excellent reversibility were observed in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes.
