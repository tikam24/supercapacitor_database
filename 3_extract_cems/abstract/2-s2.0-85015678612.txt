In the present work, we have synthesized three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO NSs) containing iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) hybrids (3D Fe3O4/rGO) by one-pot microwave approach. Structural and morphological studies reveal that the as-synthesized Fe3O4/rGO hybrids were composed of faceted Fe3O4 NPs induced into the interconnected network of rGO NSs. The morphologies and structures of the 3D hybrids have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS). The electrochemical studies were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which demonstrate superior electrochemical performance as supercapacitors electrode application. The specific capacitances of 3D hybrid materials was 455 F g-1 at the scan rate of 8 mV s-1, which is superior to that of bare Fe3O4 NPs. Additionally, the 3D hybrid shows good cycling stability with a retention ratio of 91.4 after starting from âˆ¼190 cycles up to 9600 cycles. These attractive results suggest that this 3D Fe3O4/rGO hybrid shows better performance as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
