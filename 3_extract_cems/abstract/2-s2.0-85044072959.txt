A flexible film electrode of NiCo2O4 grown on Co/C hybrid nanofibers (NCCNF) was synthesized through electrospinning combining with carbonization and hydrothermal reaction. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and N2 adsorption/desorption measurement were employed to characterize the composition, microstructure and morphology. The as-prepared flexible NCCNF film was used as a binder-free working electrode in three-electrode system and its electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge and discharge test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The resulting flexible film shows excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of up to 1710 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1, making it a potentially practical electrode material for flexible supercapacitors.
