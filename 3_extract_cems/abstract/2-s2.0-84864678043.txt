This paper introduces the use of a STATCOM with Supercapacitor energy storage (SES) to aid frequency control in a weak power supply network. The control of the fast response energy storage is coordinated with the slow response generator to ensure power matching within the power system at all times. Simulation and Experimental results are presented to show the improved frequency control in the presence of large load steps.
