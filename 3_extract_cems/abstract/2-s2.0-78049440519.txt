Cost-effective electrical storage is a critical need for markets as varied as portable electronics, transportation, and renewable energy. In all these markets, improvements in energy density and power density are desired, as is longer cycling lifetime. One technology Battelle has been actively investigating is hybrid supercapacitors which consist of a high surface area electrode with an aqueous or non-aqueous electrolyte. Control of both the electrode composition and electrolyte allows the performance to be tuned to meet specific application targets. One target has been high energy density with extended cycling lifetime, for use with photovoltaic energy sources. We demonstrate energy density of 50 Wh/kg with stable performance over hundreds of charge/discharge cycles. Another target has been increased power and energy densities with charge/discharge time on the order of one second. We demonstrate energy density during discharge of 10 Wh/kg at power density of 10 kW/kg.
