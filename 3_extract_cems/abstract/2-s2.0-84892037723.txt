This chapter deals with analysis of energy storage technologies and its application inpower electronics. With the increase of installations of renewable sources, especiallyphotovoltaic plants, the problems with power grid stability arise. It should be caused byunexpected and irregular massive energy production. The negative impact of thisphenomenon should be limited by using energy storage, which distributes energyproduction into time periods where electricity is most required. One application is theutilization of energy storage in transportation systems. The chapter also contains anoverview of future development in energy consumption. Â©2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.
