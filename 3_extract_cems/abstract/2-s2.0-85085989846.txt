Metal-organic frameworks as a novel class of porous coordination polymers are favored in the field of supercapacitors due to their adjustable composition, high devisable structures, super-large surface area, and governable porosity. However, the low electrical conductivity and poor cycling stability restrict the utilization of MOFs as electrode material. Recently, a serious of MOF-derived nanoporous material has been applied for supercapacitor, including mono-, binary- and ternary- metal and metal matric carbon composites. In this review, the recent achievement of MOF-derived nanoporous material and their synthetic method, morphology, electrochemical performance has been discussed. The effective strategies for MOF-derived material have also been proposed, and the application and development trend have been viewed.
