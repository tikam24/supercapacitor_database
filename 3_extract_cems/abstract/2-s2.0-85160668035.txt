The growing demand for sustainable and efficient energy harvesting and storage technologies has spurred interest in the integration of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with supercapacitors (SCs). This combination offers a promising solution for powering Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other low−power applications by utilizing ambient mechanical energy. Cellular materials, featuring unique structural characteristics such as high surface−to−volume ratios, mechanical compliance, and customizable properties, have emerged as essential components in this integration, enabling the improved performance and efficiency of TENG−SC systems. In this paper, we discuss the key role of cellular materials in enhancing TENG−SC systems’ performance through their influence on contact area, mechanical compliance, weight, and energy absorption. We highlight the benefits of cellular materials, including increased charge generation, optimized energy conversion efficiency, and adaptability to various mechanical sources. Furthermore, we explore the potential for lightweight, low−cost, and customizable cellular materials to expand the applicability of TENG−SC systems in wearable and portable devices. Finally, we examine the dual effect of cellular materials’ damping and energy absorption properties, emphasizing their potential to protect TENGs from damage and increase overall system efficiency. This comprehensive overview of the role of cellular materials in the integration of TENG−SC aims to provide insights into the development of next−generation sustainable energy harvesting and storage solutions for IoT and other low−power applications.
