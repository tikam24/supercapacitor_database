Ordered mesoporous carbons with different pore symmetries were synthesized by a template method using asphaltene as carbon source. The microstructures of the OMCs were characterized by X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption techniques. Their electrochemical performance as electrode materials of a supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostactic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques, and the ion transfer behavior and charge storage capacity in different mesopore structures were further discussed. Electrochemical results indicate that all of asphaltene-base OMCs exhibit electric double layer behavior. OMCs with different mesopore structures demonstrate various charge storage ability and ion transfer behaviors. In terms of the ion transfer kinetic process, OMC with 2D hexagonal symmetry presents the best ionic diffusion behavior and lowest impedance for the long-ranged pore channels. While, in the case of charge storage mechanism, OMC with 3D bicontinuous cubic symmetry exhibits the best charge storage ability for the tortuosity of mesostructure.
