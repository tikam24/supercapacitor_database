Membrane separation has emerged as a promising technology in the last decade because of its low cost, ease of operation, and high throughput over the other commercial separation techniques. Polymer-graphene nanocomposites have gained remarkable attention in the progress of membrane research with the advancements in synthesizing graphene-based 2D carbon fillers and other functionalized graphenes. This chapter highlights an overview of the present scenario of polymer-graphene nanocomposite membranes in diverse technological applications. Graphene families, such as single/multi-layered graphene, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, functionalized graphene, have been exploited together with a large variety of polymers, for example, thermosets and thermoplastics for the membrane configuration. Graphene-based nanocomposites are found to exhibit exceptional electrical, mechanical, thermal, and barrier properties. These properties are essential for developing highly efficient membranes for separation and fabricating highly efficient energy storage devices. Significant application areas of these nanocomposite membranes include filtration, gas separation, dialysis as well as energy storage applications such as fuel cell, supercapacitor, etc. A brief overview of these applications is included in this chapter.
