The few-layered transitional sulphide/oxide nanosheets and graphene composites attract increasingly interest as electrode materials although facing the significant preparation challenge such as low quantities and uncontrollable homogeneity. Using MoS 2 and graphene oxide (GO) bulk materials as the raw materials, we demonstrate a novel solvent-free and one-step ball-milling approach to prepare massive sandwiched MoS 2 /reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites. The reduction of GO to rGO, the exfoliation of bulk layered materials and assembly of the obtained MoS 2 and rGO nanosheets are achieved all together in the ball-milling process. The orderly assembled MoS 2 /rGO composite as electrode material used in supercapacitor delivers a high specific capacitance of 306 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 and approximately two times higher than that of the pure MoS 2 . Besides, it exhibits nearly no discharge capacity decay used both in lithium-ion batteries (0.2 A g −1 after 100 cycles) and supercapacitor (4 A g −1 after 5000 cycles). This work has developed an encouraging approach for preparation of this series of graphene-based hybrid electrode materials with ideal performance for potential application in energy storage devices.
