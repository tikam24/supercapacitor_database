Ternary organic-inorganic complex of polypyrrole/manganese dioxide/carbon nanotubes (PPy/MnO2/CNTs) composite was prepared by in situ chemical oxidation polymerization of pyrrole in the host of inorganic matrix of MnO 2 and CNTs, using complex of methyl orange (MO)/FeCl3 was used as a reactive self-degraded soft-template. The morphological structures of the composite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. All the results indicate that the PPy/MnO 2/CNTs composite possesses the typical tube-in-tube nanostructures: the inner tubules are CNTs and the outer tubules are template-synthesized PPy. MnO2 nanoparticles may either sandwich the space between the inner and outer tubules or directly latch onto the wall of the PPy tubes. The composite yields a good electrochemical reversibility through 1000 cycles' cyclic voltammogram (CV) test in the potential range of -0.6 to 0.4 V and its specific capacitance was up to 402.7 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in galvanostatic charge-discharge experiment.
