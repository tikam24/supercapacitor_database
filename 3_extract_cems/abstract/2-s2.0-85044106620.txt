New three-dimensional grids based on graphene oxide and 3,3’,4,4’-tetraaminodiphenyl oxide were obtained using a one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The formation of benzimidazole rings was confirmed by IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis, and the nitrogen content was 13.8 wt%. Because of the redox activity of benzimidazole rings, the specific capacitance was 330 F g–1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s–1.
