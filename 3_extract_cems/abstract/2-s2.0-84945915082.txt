Poly(5-cyanoindole)/carbon fiber composite material (P5CIn/CF) was prepared via a simple electrodeposition method. The CF core and the P5CIn shell formed a 3-D P5CIn/CF core/shell structure composite. The P5CIn/CF was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscope, and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. The specific capacitance of P5CIn/CF was 302 F g-1 at the scan rate of 1 A g-1. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor based on P5CIn/CF showed a specific capacitance of 94 F g-1 at 7.5 mV s-1 and its energy density reached 16 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 0.6 kW kg-1. Additionally, the capacitance retention of P5CIn/CF was 78% after 2000 cycles. These results suggested that the P5CIn/CF was a hopeful electrode material for the flexible supercapacitors application.
