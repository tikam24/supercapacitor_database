Due to the dire energy needs and the unavailability of energy storage devices, supercapacitors have become an inescapable substitute for energy storage systems. As a high energy density electrode material, we offer rGO/PANI/ZnO ternary nanocomposite designed via the polymerization method and are characterized by various analytical techniques. The results show that rGO/PANI/ZnO has the best capacitive behavior, with a specific capacity of 1546 F/g at 2 mV/s on the eggshell membrane electrode (ESME). The nanocomposite rGO/PANI/ZnO, on the other hand, presented the best cycling stability, retaining 97% of capacity after 3000 cycles. This is due to the fast transfer of electrons between rGO/ZnO and PANI in an electrochemical charge storage device. This research encompasses an enhanced flexible PANI-based electrode to become viable innovative wearable sensor alternative.
