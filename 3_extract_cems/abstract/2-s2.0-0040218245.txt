The principal findings of the amide-electrolyte mixtures, and in particular acetamide-CF3COONa, are reviewed in order to propose a model for these systems. The most suitable model is a microheterogeneous one, where charged domains exist, formed by aggregation. The most outstanding property is the megavalue of the dielectric constant. The liquid mixture 8.02 mole/kg of CF3COONa in CH3CONH2 is then studied as dielectric in capacitors, in order to test possible applications in supercapacitor technology. Â© 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
