Wearable energy storage system must maintain robust electrochemical performance under severe mechanical and chemical deformations. Here, we demonstrate wearable supercapacitor system assembled with electrodes composed of one-step carbonized plant epidermis and gelatin based hydrogel electrolyte which possesses high electrochemical performance and superior reliability under ambient condition. The carbonized mulberry paper (MP) was used as an electrode to achieve improved volumetric energy density as well as mechanical-chemical reliability (e.g. mechanical toughness and acid resistance). Rationally designed active materials composed of vertically grown WO3 NRs and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) anchored on MP, were employed for developing organism epidermis based supercapacitor. Such electrode exhibits high volumetric energy and power densities of 30.28 mWh cm−3 and 7.67 W cm−3, retaining the volumetric capacitance of 96.0% even after 110,000 charge-discharge cycles. As the final step, we employed the gelatin based electrolyte with high ionic conductivity to solve evaporation and leakage problems of conventional electrolytes. Organism epidermis based supercapacitor integrated with hydrogel electrolyte showed high electrochemical performance and long-term stability under ambient condition even after exposure to acid, demonstrating its gareat suitability as a large-scale wearable energy storage system.
