Abstract Cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) nanorods were synthesized by fast hydrothermal process for supercapacitor electrodes. The structural and morphological studies revealed the formation of CoOOH with hexagonal rhomb-centered crystal structure and excellent rod like morphology of âˆ¼5-10 nm diameter. The electrochemical characterization was performed for both half cell and symmetric full cell configuration using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge test and impedance spectroscopy in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The fabricated CoOOH electrodes showed maximum specific capacitance value of 198 F g-1 for a half cell and 94 F g-1 for a symmetric capacitor of 10 mg cm-2 active material per electrode and showed better energy and power densities. Moreover, the CoOOH electrode exhibits good capacitance retention (83%) after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
