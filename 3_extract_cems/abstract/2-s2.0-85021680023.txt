The formation of a large quantity of waste after processing of agricultural products requiring disposal was showed. One of the promising methods of recycling is to use them as a raw material for activated carbon, the use of which in the industry has rapidly increased in recent years. The problems of modern energy systems can be solved by supercapacitors, electrodes of which are made of highly porous activated carbon materials. The primary objective of this study was to probe and compare carbonization of waste corn and sugar beet pulp with follow activation of carbon. The substantial content of micropores in obtained activated carbon was established by the method of small-angle X-ray scattering. The proportion of hydrophilic pores was determined by the amount of water absorbed by the pressed sample of activated carbon with a long maceration. Electric double layer capacitors electrodes were made of 40-63 um fractions of both activated carbon materials. Electrolytes for electric double layer capacitors served 30 % of the aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide. Electrochemical studies of derived activated carbons were conducted in three-electrode cell with a silver chloride reference electrode. The specific capacity of the electrodes of supercapacitors with activated carbon obtained from corn was 120 F/g. The specific capacity of the electrodes of supercapacitors with activated carbon obtained from sugar beet pulp was 72 F/g. Both of activated carbon materials can be modified to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Modifying of obtained activated carbon by ultrasonic irradiation to improve the supercapacitors characteristic was proposed. This method of modification is environmentally friendly because it does not require the use of chemicals and energy intensive equipment.
