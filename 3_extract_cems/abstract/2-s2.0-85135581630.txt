In recent years, two-dimensional MXene have attracted more attentions owing to their excellent electrochemical performance, resulting their widely used in electrochemical energy storage field. However, traditional electrodes fabrication processes may result in the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets, which may lead to the low electrochemical performance of MXene based electrode materials. It is effective to design a three-dimensional aerogel to suppress the self-restacking of MXene nanosheets and develop high-performance MXene based electrode materials. Ti3C2Tx/rGO hybrid aerogel (A-TGA) with bidirectionally aligned structure through the bidirectional freeze casting and freeze drying method was prepared in this paper, and the mechanical performance of the hybrid aerogel was improved by the mild reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The A-TGA shows excellent mechanical properties and electrical conductivity, so it can be used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, the unique bidirectionally aligned structure provides barrier-free transport channels for electrolyte ions, which can greatly improve the electrochemical properties of A-TGA. The A-TGA shows a specific capacitance of 370 F•g-1 at 1 A•g-1 and delivers an outstanding cycling performance with a capacitance retention up to 94% over 5 000 cycles at 100 mV•s-1 scanning speed.
