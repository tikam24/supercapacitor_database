Proton Motor Fuel Cell GmbH has developed a prototype triple-hybrid forklift that combines a fuel cell, battery, and a supercapacitor. The hybrid power system is designed to integrate hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors that provide optimal performance and fuel efficiency. Proton Motor also has developed its own fuel cells and combined them with other components for the creation of integration-ready fuel cell and hybrid systems. PM Basic is a complete, integration-ready fuel cell system with Proton Motor fuel cell stacks, which has dedicated components such as gas, air, and water management. The company is also targeting its products at back-to-base applications, which are compatible with more markets as they do not need an extensive network of filling stations.
