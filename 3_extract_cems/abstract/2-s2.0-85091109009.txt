Herein, the flexible and highly conductive polypyrrole/polyamide 6 (PPy/PA 6) nanocomposite film with unique core-shell architecture has been prepared via a facile chemical oxidative polymerization method. By optimizing the parameters included feed ratio, ferric ions concentration and reaction time, the PPy coating was observed to in-situ growth on the electrospun PA 6 nanofiber surface, leading to a thick shell layer and maximum conductivity of 78.2 S cm−1. Furthermore, the all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor is assembled, exhibiting high specific capacitance (760 mF cm−2), power density (11 W m−2), energy density (0.68 Wh m−2) and cycling stability. Thus, considering the ideal flexible characteristics and excellent electrochemical performance, the fabricated nanocomposite film shows great potential applications in the wearable electronic system especially for high-performance supercapacitor.
