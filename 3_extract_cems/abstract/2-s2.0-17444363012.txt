Mesoporous carbons prepared by an inverse replica technique have been used as electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. Such well-sized carbons were prepared from mesostructured SBA-16 silica materials that served as templates whereas polyfurfuryl alcohol was the carbon precursor. Two highly mesoporous carbons characterized by 3 and 8 nm average pore diameter were tested in various electrolytic solutions (acidic, alkaline and aprotic). It can be concluded that templated mesoporous carbons with tailored pore size distribution are very promising materials to be used as electrodes in supercapacitors. The design of their pore size allows suiting the dimensions of electrolyte ions and efficient charging of the electrical double layer is achieved especially at high current load. Definitively better capacitance performance has been found for carbon with 3 nm pores range, however, cycling performance depends not only on the pore size. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
