A Layer-by-Layer (LbL) approach is used to form ultra-thin films from functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to serve as porous electrodes in electrochemical energy storage devices like supercapacitors. The MWNT-membrane-MWNT assemblies are tested in aqueous electrolyte, ionic liquid and polymer electrolyte for evaluation purposes. The deposition parameters of the MWNT layers greatly influence the properties of the thin film electrodes and can be easily tailored to specific requirements. This allows a maximum flexibility for the characteristics of the supercapacitors, demonstrating the great potential of this approach.
