This article presents a novel energy management strategy (EMS) for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) considering the exact identification of movement conditions, optimal power sharing, fuel consumption minimization, and reduction of battery power fluctuations. The vehicle's hybrid power source structure consists of a fuel cell, battery, ultracapacitor, and photovoltaic array, which is installed on the roof of FCHEV. Also, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is presented to fast tracking of various conditions, such as fast changes in the intensity of irradiation, temperature, and vehicle movement in various conditions. The proposed online multimode EMS is based on fuzzy logic control, equivalent consumption minimization, as well as operational mode control that can increase total energy efficiency and reduce power fluctuations of the battery. This study presents a classification of the vehicle's various movement conditions, separation of battery state of charge, and ultracapacitor voltage discharge ratio regions based on combined efficiency. Moreover, fuel cell power is classified based on efficiency to run the operational mode control strategy. Simulation results indicate a reduction in fuel consumption and fluctuations of the battery power compared to the other methods. Besides, increasing daily driving mileage and fast-tracking MPPT method results verified in the discussion of installed photovoltaic.
