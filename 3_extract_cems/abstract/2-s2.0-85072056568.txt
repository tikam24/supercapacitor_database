Laser-induced graphene (LIG) emerged as one of the most promising materials for flexible functional devices. However, the attempts to obtain LIG onto elastomeric substrates never succeed, hindering its full exploitation for stretchable electronics. Herein, a novel polymeric composite is reported as a starting material for the fabrication of graphene-based electrodes by direct laser writing. A polyimide (PI) powder is dispersed into the poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix to achieve an easily processable and functional elastomeric substrate, allowing the conversion of the polymeric surface into laser-induced graphene (LIG). The mechanical and electrical properties of the proposed material can be easily tuned by acting on the polyimide powder concentration. The reported procedure takes advantage from the simple casting process, typical of silicone elastomer, allowing to produce electrodes conformable to any kind of shape and surface as well as complex three-dimensional structures. Electrochemical capacitors and strain gauges are selected as flexible prototypes to demonstrate the multifunctional properties of the obtained LIG on the PDMS/PI composite substrate.
