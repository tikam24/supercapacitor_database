Efforts have been put forth to grow HgS with cauliflower like surface architecture through simple and low-cost successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method at room temperature for supercapacitive electrode application. Such a unique morphology facilitates the electrolyte ions to penetrate during electrochemical activities. Maximum specific capacitance of 446 F/g was obtained from cyclic voltammetry measurement at 2 mV/s scan rate in 1 M KCl electrolyte. After initial drop of capacitance up to 500 cycles, reduction was relatively slow up to 2000 cycles during stability analysis. Most importantly, the revealed specific energy of 15.45 Wh/kg of electrode has promised as decent electrode in energy storage field for future scope.
