Hierarchical NiCo2O4/PANI/CNTs hybrid composites were designed and fabricated having a layer of NiCo2O4on the surface of PANI encapsulated CNTs with different morphologies. Physicochemical attributes of the synthesized composites were examined by FTIR, UVâ€“visible and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Morphological aspects were evaluated by field-emission scanning microscopy (FESEM), electron diffraction spectroscopy (EDS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) studies. Electrochemical measurements revealed an improved specific capacitance of 2250 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and 2000 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with good rate capability using a three-electrode system. These enhanced features are achieved from the well designed nanostructure and the synergistic contributions of individual components in the electrode material.
