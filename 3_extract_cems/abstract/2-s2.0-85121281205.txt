A route in this study has opened up by a successful transformation of Prosopis juliflora into N, S-dual doped activated carbon (AC) enhances biomass for supercapacitor applications. The method of restoration has opened up the possibility of sustainable development. This attempt explored the handling of biowaste and transforming into AC by simple hydrothermal method. The suitable amount of raw material with KOH, the activation state and the influence of thiourea content in the precursor are the important metrics in this translation method. The surface morphology and chemical mapping were examined. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra and Brunaeur-Emmet-Teller (BET) are also examined. The proportion of 30 wt% of KOH activated with the temperature range of 400 °C, 500 °C, and 600 °C. The optimal PJ3 sample present surface area of 570.54 m2/g, benefiting at 1 A/g, the maximum specific capacitance of 246 F/g. The excellent stability of the sample over 3000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles with 96.74% capacitance retention shows the possibilities of using invasive plant Prosopis juliflora for supercapacitor application and a viable management strategy.
