Hyper coal (HPC) was used to prepare porous carbon(PC) by KOH activation method. Then the PC was modified by different concentrations of HNO3. N2 adsorption instrument, scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS) were used to characterize the pore structure. Galvanostatic charge/discharge(GC), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analyses were used to test the electrochemical properties of PC. The results show that BET surface area of porous carbon decrease and wettability improved with the increase of HNO3 concentration. The contents of N-5, C-O and O-C〖FY=,1〗O increase significantly when the PC was modified by 1% HNO3. Specific capacitance of PC is 273 F/g at a current density of 50 mA/g with the concentrations of 1%, which is 22.4% higher than that of the unmodified PC. It still maintains 80.4% at a current density of 5 000 mA/g. Even after 1 000 cycles, it is clear that the specific capacitance still remains at about 95.4%, demonstrating good electrochemical performance.
