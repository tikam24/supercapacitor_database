This paper aims at comparing three different configurations of energy storage systems (ESS) for a fuel cell hybrid vehicle. This study is applied on an off-road vehicle, a new concept of hybrid electric mini-excavator. The power supply system (PSS) is composed of a predefined fuel cell system and one or two energy storage systems. In this paper, the sizing and the configuration of energy storage components is explored and cost considerations are taken into account for optimal design. Â© 2014 IEEE.
