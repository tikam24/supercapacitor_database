Self-supported metallic nanopore arrays with highly oriented nanoporous structures are fabricated and applied as ideally nanostructured electrodes for supercapacitor applications. Their large specific surface area can ensure a high capacitance, and their highly oriented and stable nanoporous structure can facilitate ion transport. (Chemical Equation Presented).
