A technique that combines Inductively Coupled Power Transfer (ICPT) and Super-Capacitor (SC) technologies to transfer power with dynamic isolation with in built protection for both common and differential modes transients, is described. The technique uses the ICPT technology to transfer power with no physical contacts and three or more banks of SCs to provide dynamic isolation with surge protection. To achieve dynamic isolation with surge protection, two different systems are investigated by computer simulation and the results are discussed. A prototype version of one such system is built and the experimental results obtained using a surge simulator are presented to show the validity of the proposed concept and its suitability for UPSs and emergency power supplies.
