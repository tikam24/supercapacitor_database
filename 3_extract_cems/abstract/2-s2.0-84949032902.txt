This article describes the synthesis and characterization of ZnO nanoring embedded graphene nanoribbons. Patterned holes (mesopore dia.) in graphene nanoribbons are chemically generated, leading to a high density of the edge planes. These planes carry negatively charged surface groups (like -COOH and -OH) and therefore anchor the metal ions in a cordial fashion forming a string of metal ions along the edge planes. These strings of imbibed metal ions precipitate as tiny ZnO nanorings over lacey graphene nanoribbons. The thus obtained graphene nanoribbon (GNR) based hierarchical ZnO mesoporous structures are three dimensionally accessible to the electrolyte and demonstrate high performance in capacitive energy storage. The ZnO/GNR nanocomposite electrode in an asymmetric supercapacitor device with lacey reduced graphene oxide nanoribbons (LRGONRs) as a negative electrode exhibits a 2.0 V potential window in the aqueous electrolyte and an ultra-short time constant (0.08 s). The wide potential window consequently increased the energy density from 6.8 Wh kg-1 (ZnO/GNR symmetric) to 9.4 Wh kg-1 (ZnO/GNR-LRGONR asymmetric). The relaxation time constant obtained for the asymmetric supercapacitor device was three orders of magnitude less compared to the ZnO (symmetric, 33 s) supercapacitor device. The high cycling stability of ZnO/GNR-LRGONR up to 96.7% capacitance retention, after 5000 GCD cycles at 2 mA cm-2, paves the way to a high performance aqueous electrochemical supercapacitive energy storage.
