One of the existing challenges toward the electrification of military vehicles is the selection of the most suitable energy storage device. Moreover, a single energy storage technology might not provide the most benefit out of powertrain electrification. In this paper, a generalized framework for the simultaneous selection of the optimal energy storage device, in the form of a standalone or hybrid solution, and online energy management is presented. This paper investigates the cooperation of energy-dense Li-ion batteries and power-dense supercapacitors to assist engine operation in a series hybrid electric military truck. Pontryagin's minimum principle is adopted as the energy management strategy in a forward-looking vehicle simulator, in which the optimal design and control parameters are found using particle swarm optimization. Simulation results show that adopting a hybrid energy storage system reduces fuel consumption by 13% compared to the case of battery-only hybridized powertrain.
