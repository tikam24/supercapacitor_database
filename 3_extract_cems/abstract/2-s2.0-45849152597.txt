DAAQ(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone)/MWCNT composites were prepared by chemical polymerization of DAAQ onto MWCNT and their capacitance was evaluated by means of cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge cycling in 1M H2SO 4 electrolyte. The performances of such cells have been compared with pure MWCNT and DAAQ based electrodes. The SEM image shows that DAAQ was coated onto MWCNT during polymerization. The highest specific capacitance values of 210 F/g were observed. DAAQ/MWCNT composites also showed long cyclic stability in charge-discharge test. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
