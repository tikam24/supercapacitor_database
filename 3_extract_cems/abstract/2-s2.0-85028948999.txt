In this work, nano-structured Mn3O4 particles with spongy-morphology were synthesized through vesicle templating, where hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were used as cationic-anionic surfactants. The Mn3O4 electrode materials exhibited a high specific capacitance (451 F g−1) at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 1 mol L−1 Na2SO4 electrolyte, and retained 333 F g−1 when the current density was increased to 5 A g−1. Its capacitance retention is also high (up to 92%) after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1.
