Organic–inorganic hybrid materials with nanoscale morphologies gain significant attention as a potential candidate for energy storage applications. Herein, nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) and benzo[2,1,3]selenadiazole (BSe)-capped dipeptide amphiphiles are electrodeposited over flexible nickel foam (NF) substrates to fabricate organic–inorganic nanohybrids. The in situ electrochemical deposition of organic–inorganic nanohybrids is investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy dispersive-electron microscopy, and elemental mapping. The nanostructured morphology of the nanohybrid material is investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance and supercapacitor properties are examined in 1 m KOH aqueous solution. Aromatic diphenylalanine (FF)-based nanohybrid BSeFF/Ni(OH)2 deposited on the NF electrode exhibit a specific capacitance of 1250 F g−1, whereas dileucine (LL)-based nanohybrids BSeLL/Ni(OH)2 show a specific capacitance of 689 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1.
