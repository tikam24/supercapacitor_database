Titanium nitride (TiN)- graphene (G)nanocomposites are promising for electrochemical charge storage where a high content of Ti species is desired. Herein, we propose an effective method for the preparation of TiN-G nanocomposites with a high concentration of Ti species. These nanocomposites can be successfully achieved through a further deposition of Ti on Ti-graphene oxide (GO)or a thermally exfoliated Ti-GO. Depending on the annealing condition employed (NH3 and N2), two types of TiN-G nanocomposites (NH3 annealing for TiN/G and TiN/G-TE, TE: thermal exfoliation)and a TiO2-G nanocomposite (N2 annealing for TiO2/G-TE)were prepared. These nanocomposites were then investigated for potential application as an electrochemical supercapacitor. Compare with TiO2/G-TE, the TiN-G nanocomposites both exhibited a higher specific capacitance, although one of these nanocomposites had a lower surface area than TiO2/G-TE. Among the nanocomposites prepared, TiN/G-TE delivered the best electrochemical performance. The relationship between the physical properties and the capacitive performance of the nanocomposites were systematically evaluated.
