In this work, supercapacitors have been fabricated using Pd4S electrode material which is highly conducting and chemically robust to the acid and alkali media. The synthesis strategy is simple and involves a single step thermolysis of palladium octanethiolate film in the H2 atmosphere at 250°C for 1 h. Besides its conducting nature, its porous morphology makes it a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of the Pd4S were examined in harsh alkali media (30 M KOH). Typically, in the literature, only lower electrolyte concentration (1–6 M KOH) is preferred as the electrode may not withstand higher concentrations. Using the prepared Pd4S film as supercapacitor electrode, a specific capacitance of 570 F g−1 with energy and power densities of 28 Wh kg−1 and 1.5 kW kg−1, respectively, were achieved with 30 M KOH electrolyte. After 1500 cycles of charging and discharging with a constant current density of 1.75 A g−1, more than 98% capacitance retention was observed. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
