Engineering novel transition metal oxide materials with micro/nanostructures has endowed unusual electrochemical properties. Herein, we reported the MoV2O8/MoO3 microclusters (MVO/MO MCs) synthesized by a simple and facile hydrothermal process. Furthermore, the MVO/MO MC-based electroactive materials were studied at various annealing temperatures of 300, 400, and 500 °C. The prepared materials wrere characterized via different analysis methods for the investigation of phase, morphology, surface area, and oxidation states. The optimized MVO/MO MC electrode revealed a superior specific capacity of 392.58 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 (2844 F g−1) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The MVO/MO MC electrode also exhibited excellent capacity retention of 101% with a corresponding coulombic efficiency of 99%. Accordingly, the fabricated pouch-like asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with the MVO/MO MCs and activated carbon materials delivered maximum power and energy densities of 2306.95 W Kg−1 and 37.06 Wh kg−1, respectively. Additionally, the ASC showed superior capacity retention of 128% with 97% of coulombic efficiency. Also, the ASC devices were employed to test the practical application by powering electronic gadgets.
