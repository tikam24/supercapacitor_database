Herein, molybdenum sulfide-nickel sulfide (MoS2-Ni3 S2) core shell nanowires were directly grown on nickel foam by one step hydrothermal process. The MoS2-Ni3S2 was employed as electrode for supercapacitor electrode and methanol oxidation. The MoS2-Ni3S2 electrode exhibited the specific capacitance of 792 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in a three electrode cell configuration in 1 M KOH electrolyte and maintained the current density up to 168.7 A g-1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte mixes with 0.5 M methanol. This work confirmed the suitability of the transition metal sulfides for energy storage and electro-oxidation of methanol.
