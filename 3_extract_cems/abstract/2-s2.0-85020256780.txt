Supercapacitors, also called as ultracapacitors, are electrochemical energy-storage devices that exploit the electrostatic interaction between high-surface-area nanoporous electrodes and electrolyte ions that combine properties of conventional batteries and conventional capacitors. A symmetrical ZnO-Activated Carbon (ZAC) electrode supercapacitor have been fabricated in a simple and inexpensive manner. The electrochemical characteristics of fabricated supercapacitor was analyzed using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge technique, and impedance spectroscopy methods. Capacitance of fabricated ZAC electrode were showed capacitance in the range of 60-70 F/g respectively. It has been found that the cells have excellent electro chemical reversibility, capacitive characteristics in electrolyte and stable in cyclings, which is promising for energy storage applications.
