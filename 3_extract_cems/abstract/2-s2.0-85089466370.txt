In this study, benzoyl-hydrazine anchored graphene oxide (BHGO) is synthesised using graphene oxide (GO) and benzoyl hydrazine (BH) via a simple, cost effective ultrasonic assisted chemical route. BH acted as a nitrogen source, reducing agent, and morphology modifier resulting in good electrochemical performance of BHGO. The supercapacitor behaviour of BHGO is investigated in different aqueous electrolytes and it exhibits a specific capacitance of 170 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 and capacitive retention of 85% over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. This high performance is attributed to the enrichment of electroactive sites of GO through nitrogen moieties enhancing faradaic redox reactions and thereby the polarization at the electrode surface.
