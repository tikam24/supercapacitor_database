Selfdischarge characteristics of supercapacitors play a significant role in their sizing and power management. Furthermore, supercapacitor-s' selfdischarge, defined as no load voltage drop, is directly proportional to its charging rate. The paper proposes a framework to empirically model the terminal voltage response of supercapacitors during charge and selfdischarge. A set of empirical formulae has been identified by utilizing experimental data and nonlinear optimization technique for modelling, the charge and selfdischarge responses of supercapacitors. The empirical models are functions of charging rate and time. The proposed approach has been illustrated via experimental studies on a 10F commercial supercapacitor cell. The illustration shows a good agreement between the model responses and experimental data.
