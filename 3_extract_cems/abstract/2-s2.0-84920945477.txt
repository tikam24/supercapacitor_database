Two graphene-like carbide derived carbons (CDC-Gs) were produced by chlorination of SiC nanosheets obtained by magnesio-thermal reduction at moderate temperature of silica/graphene oxide nanocomposites. These CDC-Gs were evaluated as supercapacitor electrode materials in an organic electrolyte. Starting from a low SiO2/GO ratio in the precursor, the resulting CDC-G nanosheets are composed of a few layers of graphite, partially coated with microporous CDC. In contrast, a high SiO2/GO ratio leads to micropores generated on the basal plane of individual carbon nanosheets. The latter CDC-G shows a remarkable high power capability with 76 % of retention of the initial capacity at scan rates up to 3Vs-1. Notably, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and time constant of the cell were found to be extremely low at 0.45Ω·cm2 and 0.4s, respectively, thanks to the unique 2D open surface and enhanced access to micropores. These features were attributed to the unique nanostructure of the microporous graphene.
