Herein, a simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize cobalt hydroxide/nickel sulfide and cobalt foam (Co(OH)2/NiS@CF) composite electrode. By simply heating cobalt foam in the aqueous solution containing cobalt nitrate, nickel nitrate, and thiourea, Co(OH)2/NiS nano stereoscopic website was synthesized on Cobalt foam. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and electrochemical tests were used to characterize these composite electrodes. When the molar ratio of Co(NO3)2Â·6H2O to Thiourea of 4:5, Co(OH)2/NiS@CF exhibits excellent performance under these tests. The specific capacitance was 1260 F/g at 1.0 A/g. The composite electrode had 92.3% capacitance retention after 2000 charge-discharge cycles at 1.0 A/g.
