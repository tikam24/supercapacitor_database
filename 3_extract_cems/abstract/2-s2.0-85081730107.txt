The properties of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite hydrogels influenced by nanoparticles are reviewed. Various kinds of nanoparticles with excellent mechanical and electrical properties have been introduced into PVA hydrogel to produce stretchable and conductive PVA nanocomposite hydrogel. Understanding the mechanism between the matrix of PVA hydrogel and nanoparticles is therefore critical for the development of PVA nanocomposite hydrogels. This review focuses on the nanoparticles include carbon nanotubes, graphene oxide and metal nanoparticles, and describes the effects of nanoparticles on the mechanical and conductive properties of PVA nanocomposite hydrogels. A new promising area of soft stretchable PVA nanocomposite hydrogel is highlighted for possible applications. Finally, a brief outlook for future research is presented.
