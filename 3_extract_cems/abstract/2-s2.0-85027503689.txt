In this work, two different types of Co3O4 nano-crystals were synthesized by (i) conventional direct solid state thermolysis of cobalt terephthalate metal-organic framework (MOF-71) and (ii) new indirect solid state thermolysis of Co(OH)2 derived by alkaline aqueous treatment of MOF-71. The products were then characterized by X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Reflection electron energy loss spectroscopy (REELS), Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) techniques. By REELS analysis the energy band gap of MOF-71 was determined to be 3.7 eV. Further, electrochemical performance of each Co3O4 nanostructure was studied by the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode system in KOH electrolyte. An asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using indirect Co3O4 nanoparticles as cathode and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide as anode, and the electrochemical properties were studied and showed a high energy density of 13.51 Wh kg−1 along with a power density of 9775 W kg−1 and good cycling stability with capacitance retention rate of 85% after 2000 cycles.
