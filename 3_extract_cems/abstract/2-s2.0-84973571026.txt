The miniaturization of energy storage microcapacitors to develop portable electronic devices has been of high recent interest. Here, microsupercapacitors microrobot is fabricated using membrane template-assisted electrodeposition of WS2 nanoparticles (WS2NPs)/polyaniline (PANI) and platinum (Pt) layers. The microrobot navigates in the microchannel and attaches itself as part of the electrical circuit. The attached WS2NPs-PANI/Pt microrobots enhance the capacitive behavior of the circuit significantly. The results presented in this work open the door for the development of smart and miniaturized functional micromotors that are able to self-assemble to on-demand circuits.
