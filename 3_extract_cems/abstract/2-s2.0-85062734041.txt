A flower-like of MnCo 2 O 4 micro-nanostructures on Ni foam was prepared using a calcination-process assisted hydrothermal method. Following immersion of the MnCo 2 O 4 precursor in NaHS aqueous solution, S 2+ reaches the outer surface of MnCo 2 O 4 , and sulfur replaces the oxygen to form MnCo 2 S 4 , and hierarchical MnCo 2 O 4 @MnCo 2 S 4 core/shell is generated. The as-prepared core-shell micro-nanostructure revealed its component advantages and a synergistic effect for electrode materials of supercapacitors. The materials deliver a specific capacitance of 1933.33 F·g −1 at a current density of 1 A·g −1 with a superior rate performance in a three-electrode system. An asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with MnCo 2 O 4 @MnCo 2 S 4 core/shell micro-nanostructure arrays as positive electrode and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as negative electrode. The device delivers a high energy density of 50.75 W·h·kg −1 at a power density of 1260 W·kg −1 and an excellent cycling stability of 96% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles.
