The performance of three widely used energy management strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) is compared in this paper. The HEV considered here consists of the fuel cell (FC), battery, and supercapacitor (SC). Performance comparison is carried out among conventional proportional-integral (PI), rule-based (RB), and equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategies (ECMS) in terms of overall efficiency, battery state of charge (SOC) level, and FC hydrogen consumption. The comparative results reveal that the RB control strategy gives the highest overall efficiency. ECMS can maintain a higher SOC level, and PI control strategy reduces the hydrogen consumption of FC. The choice of the appropriate strategy for the energy management of HEV depends on the specific objectives.
