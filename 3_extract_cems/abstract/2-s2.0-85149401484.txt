Implantable power sources face great challenges in balancing multiple factors including high performance, biocompatibility, mechanical properties for soft tissue fit, and biodegradability. Toward this goal, a simple and feasible method is proposed to prepare implantable a hydrogel-based supercapacitor (SC). Specially, a multinetwork conductive electrode is in situ formed by aminated-reduced-graphene-oxide-and-methacrylic-anhydride-comodified sericin (SrMA/A-rGO) sequentially cross-linking with four-arm polyethylene glycol succinimide carbonate and polyethylene glycol acrylate. The conductive multinetwork endows the SrMA/A-rGO-based SC implant an equivalent series resistance of 21 Ω cm−2, a volumetric energy density of 26.0 µW cm−2, and a high specific capacitance retention (over 76.4%) after long-term charging/discharging. Two SCs connected in tandem are able to light up a light-emitting diode for both in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, they can work as a direct output power source to electrically stimulate a stopped heart to start beating again. Additionally, the SC exhibits superior biocompatibility and biodegradability in vivo, and holds the value of specific capacitance above 30% 2 weeks after implantation. Thus, this work demonstrates the SrMA/A-rGO-based SC's potential to serve as a power storage unit for medical implants (such as a temporary pacemaker).
