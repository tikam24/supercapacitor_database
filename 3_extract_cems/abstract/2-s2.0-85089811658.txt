Electrochemical and energy storage properties of vanadium oxide-graphene composite electrode based solid state supercapacitor using ionic liquid gel electrolyte over flexible stainless-steel foil substrates are discussed. The composite electrode was deposited by a simple technique of spin coating of nano-size graphene dispersed vanadium sol gel followed 300°C -6h air annealing. Graphene mitigates the low electrical resistance limitation of faradaic V2O5 while contributing double layer capacitance to the overall pseudocapacitance. The BMIMBF4 ionic liquid gel with 0.2M LiClO4 dopant acts as high ionic conductivity electrolyte and source of counter ions for redox reactions. The flexible symmetrical V2O5/graphene supercapacitor shows high specific capacitance of 650 Fg-1 and energy and power density values of 30 Wh.kg-1 and 3kW kg-1, respectively at charging potential of 1.5V. The linear charge-discharge, high Coulomb efficiency ∼90% and low internal resistance support its use as power source for portable electronics with high energy storage capability.
