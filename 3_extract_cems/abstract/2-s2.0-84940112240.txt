In the present work RGO/MnOx composites were fabracated by a hydrothermal method at different conditions. The crystal structure, chemical state of the elements, and the microstrucuture of the as-obtained samples were chracterized using power X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Moreover, the electrochemical behaviors were evaluated by cyclic voltammogram (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three electrod system. The test results showed that the specific capacitance of the optimal sample was calculated to be 289.8 F/g in 1 mol/L Na2SO4 electroyte at a current density of 1 A/g with a operating window from 0 to 1 V, and its specific capacitance was 223.9 F/g even at a current rate density of 20 A/g. In addition, the capacitance retention ratio of the sample remained 88% after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A/g.
