This paper deals with a hybrid energy source consisting of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), two storage devices and a load. Generally, this type of source can be constituted of non-isolated DC-DC converters. In order to have galvanic isolation for safety reason and high voltage ratio, we introduce another system based on the use of three-port isolated DC-DC converters. The storage devices can be either battery or supercapacitor. This paper presents a control strategy for the hybrid source and includes a global efficiency analysis of power sharing between modules. The proposed system is validated through different simulation results. Additionally some experimental results are given for the single module operation. © 2013 IEEE.
