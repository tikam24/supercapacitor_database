This paper presents an experimental set-up for performing preliminary tests for energy power systems, such as the ones found in the IoT systems. It is composed by an energy harvesting device that charges a supercapacitor and a Switched Capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter, implemented in 130 nm bulk CMOS technology, to convert the voltage variation of the supercapacitor into a stable power supply for the IoT system. The experimental results show that the SC DC-DC converter achieves a maximum energy efficiency of 75%, and the overall system achieves a maximum energy efficiency of 47%.
