Energy management in hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) consisting of battery and supercapacitor packages has an essential role in the efficient and safe use of energy storage devices. In the mentioned HESSs, with frequency separation-based energy management, the source with slow dynamics (eg, batteries) is supported by other sources with fast dynamics (eg, supercapacitors). To realize power sharing in the battery/supercapacitor HESS, the load current is divided into low- and high-frequency components and supplied/allocated from energy storage devices. This review touches on the historical development of electric vehicles and includes extensive information about the battery and supercapacitor. It also comprehensively analyzes frequency separation-based power allocation strategies for battery/supercapacitors HESS. These strategies were investigated in detail regarding their features, advantages, and restrictions. In addition, interconnection circuit topologies and control techniques used in frequency-based power allocation were explained comprehensively. As a result, this study will serve as a guide on frequency-based power separation principles in HESS.
