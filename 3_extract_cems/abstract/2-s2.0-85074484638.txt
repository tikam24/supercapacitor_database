The molybdenum-based metal organic framework (Mo-MOF) and polyaniline (PANI) composite is successfully prepared via in situ polymerization of aniline monomers. BET analysis reveals that the obtained Mo-MOF/PANI composite possesses larger specific surface area which is beneficial for its electrochemical performance. The charge-transfer resistance of the composite is greatly lower than that of the individual material. Meanwhile, the superior cycling stability and rate capability based on its favorable interface kinetics with faster charge transfer speed are also observed. The electrochemical kinetics investigated via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that Mo-MOF/PANI exhibits fast ion transformation rate.
