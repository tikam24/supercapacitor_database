Supercapacitors are well-known as promising energy storage devices capable of bridging the gap between conventional electrolytic capacitors and batteries to deliver both high power and energy densities for applications in electric vehicles and a smart energy grid. However, many reported instances of high-capacitance pseudocapacitors employ strong Faradaic reactions that hinder fast charge–discharge cycles and long-term stability, limiting their commercial viability. In this study, we utilise an economical and solution-processable procedure to fabricate a Cs3Bi2I9-based symmetric supercapacitor employing both electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance with an aqueous NaClO4 electrolyte to deliver an outstanding device areal capacitance of 2.4 F cm−2 and specific capacitance of 280 F g−1. The Cs3Bi2I9 device achieves an excellent 88% capacitance retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, proving its long-term cycle stability and promise as a practical supercapacitor. We characterise the time-dependent charge storage mechanisms through cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to find that electrostatic charge accumulation predominates at high potentials (0.3–0.6 V) whereas weak, Faradaic charge adsorption and pore penetration bolster charge storage at lower potentials (0.0–0.2 V).
