Activated porous carbon was synthesized from methylcellulose biopolymer through a two-step mechanism involving H3PO4 as an activating agent and then thermally carbonized in a tubular furnace under an inert atmosphere at 850 °C. The product was next rinsed with strong HCl, neutralized with deionized water, and dried in an oven at 80 °C. Then, to fully understand the behavior of the activated porous carbon, it was characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), RAMAN spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Additionally, we have created dye-sensitive solar cells and an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) using this porous carbon produced from methylcellulose (DSSC). We used the above-mentioned prepared porous carbon for the electrode portion of the Electric Double-Layer Capacitor (EDLC) fabrication, and the maximized polymer electrolyte film made from the methyl cellulose (MC) biopolymer combined with 60 wt.% of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide ionic liquid (IL), with a maximum conductivity of 1.93 × 10−2 S/cm, for the electrolyte. The fabricated EDLC device shows a specific capacitance of 60.8 F/gm at 5 mV/s scan rate which was confirmed by cyclovoltammetry and a low-frequency impedance plot in the CH electrochemical workstation. The DSSC device was fabricated using the same porous carbon as a material for the counter-electrode and the same composition polymer electrolyte that had been used in the EDLC as the electrolyte for the DSSC which yields an efficiency of 0.86%. The fill factor and other parameters were also calculated from the JV characteristics that had been characterized and obtained in the solar simulator.
