Co3O4@activated carbon fibers (ACF) composites were prepared through a facile hydrothermal method followed by calcination process, involving the growth of Co3O4 nanowires on ACF surface. Co(NO3)2•6H2O was used as Co source, urea and NH4F as additives. The structures and morphologies of Co3O4@ACF composites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption/desorption measures, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical properties of Co3O4@ACF composites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that Co3O4 nanowire arrays uniformly grew on the surface of ACF along the vertical direction, forming abundant mesoporous structures. Co3O4@ACF composites with various Co3O4 fractions could be obtained by adding different amount of Co(NO3)2•6H2O. Furthermore, Co3O4@ACF composite with 47wt% Co3O4 fraction exhibited a high specific capacitance of 566.9 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which was almost twice as high as that of pure Co3O4. Even at 15 A/g, the composite still delivered a specific capacitance of 393.3 F/g, showing good rate capability. The specific capacitance of the composite could retain 84.2% of initial value after 5000 charging/discharging cycles, which indicates its superior cycling stability.
