An increase beyond 70% in specific energy of an asymmetrical supercapacitor of carbon (-) and composite of carbon nanotubes and polyaniline (+) was achieved by firstly identifying the 'cell voltage limiting electrode', and then adjusting the capacitance ratio of the ±electrodes from 1.0 to 1.3. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
