The binary Ni-Al sulfide with hyacinth-like structure was grown directly on Ni foams via a facile two-step hydrothermal process as supercapacitor electrode materials. The structure and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The amorphous porous Ni-Al binary sulfuration achieved outstanding electrochemical performances with high specific capacitance of 2030 F/g under current density of 1A g−1, excellent cycle stability in 500 continuous cycles (only 8.5% decay after 500 cycles at 1A g−1), and good rate capability. The brilliant property of Ni-Al binary sulfide can be owed to the macroporous structure with high conductivity and transport rate for electrolyte ions and electrons, rich redox reactions and large surface area. The results demonstrate that the Ni-Al sulfides are the promising electrode materials in supercapacitor applications.
