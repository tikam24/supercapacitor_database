Oxygen-deficient perovskite oxides manifest capability of multi-functional application with remarkable physical and chemical properties. In the present study, Sr2FeCoO6-δ, an oxygen-deficient perovskite has been effectively prepared through easy wet chemical method followed by thermal processing at 1000 °C temperature. The Rietveld refinement of Sr2FeCoO6-δ, X-ray diffraction pattern indicates the structure of the cubic phase of Sr2FeCoO6-δ with Pm3‾m symmetry. The super-capacitive behavior of Sr2FeCoO6-δ electrode; investigated first time and electrochemical analysis technique performed using potassium hydroxide electrolyte solution show magnificent outcomes, i.e., the specific capacitance 263 F/g at 1 A/g. Further, electrode stability has been tested by performing 3000 charging-discharging cycles and 57% retention was attained, which indicates the electrode capability for energy storage application.
