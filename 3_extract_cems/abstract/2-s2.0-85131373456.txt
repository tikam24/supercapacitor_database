Nanocellulose exhibits the high mechanical strength, low density, and has many chemically modified hydroxyl functional groups on its surface. Therefore, it becomes the ideal material for assembling high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. In this review, the main mechanisms of soft material and carbon-based composite electrodes prepared by using nanocellulose combined with some active materials, such as conductive polymer and transition metal oxide, etc., were introduced. Then the assembling methods including the freeze drying, carbonization, in situ polymerization, filtration and coating, were discussed in detail. In addition, the mechanical and electrochemical performances of nanocellulose-based supercapacitor electrodes were compared and analyzed. Finally, the potential application of nanocellulose-based electrodes in supercapacitors were prospected.
