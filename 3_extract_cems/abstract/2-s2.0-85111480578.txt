Flexible and stretchable supercapacitors (FS-SCs) are promising energy storage devices for wearable electronics due to their versatile flexibility/stretchability, long cycle life, high power density, and safety. Transition metal compounds (TMCs) can deliver a high capacitance and energy density when applied as pseudocapacitive or battery-like electrode materials owing to their large theoretical capacitance and faradaic charge-storage mechanism. The recent development of TMCs (metal oxides/hydroxides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides, and selenides) as electrode materials for FS-SCs are discussed here. First, fundamental energy-storage mechanisms of distinct TMCs, various flexible and stretchable substrates, and electrolytes for FS-SCs are presented. Then, the electrochemical performance and features of TMC-based electrodes for FS-SCs are categorically analyzed. The gravimetric, areal, and volumetric energy density of SC using TMC electrodes are summarized in Ragone plots. More importantly, several recent design strategies for achieving high-performance TMC-based electrodes are highlighted, including material composition, current collector design, nanostructure design, doping/intercalation, defect engineering, phase control, valence tuning, and surface coating. Integrated systems that combine wearable electronics with FS-SCs are introduced. Finally, a summary and outlook on TMCs as electrodes for FS-SCs are provided.
