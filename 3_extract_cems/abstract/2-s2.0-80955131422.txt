High-power boost converter is an important part in supercapacitor energy storage system. The decline of supercapacitor's terminal voltage should be considered when design the converter. The advantages and disadvantages of the asymmetry half-bridge bidirectional converter are discussed. A novel PWM phase-shift plus feed-forward control method was proposed, which uses input voltage feed-forward to control duty cycle and output voltage feed-back to control phase shift angle. This control strategy could reduce the peak current of the transformer's leakage inductance, promote the converter's efficiency and ensure the switches' ZVS. The converter's operation is analyzed and the average model and small signal model are built. The control system was designed. The control strategy was verified by simulation. Â© 2011 IEEE.
