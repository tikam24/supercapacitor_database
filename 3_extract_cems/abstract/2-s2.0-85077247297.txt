Many hybrid electrodes for supercapacitors (SCs) are a reckless combination without proper structural design that keeps them from fulfilling their potential. Herein, we design a reduced graphene oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/polyaniline (RGO/PEDOT/PANI) hybrid with hierarchical and porous structure for high-performance SCs, where components fully harness their advantages, forming an interconnected and conductive framework with substantial reactive sites.Thus, this hybrid achieves a high capacitance of 535 F g−1 along with good rate capability and cyclability. The planar SC based on this hybrid deliver an energy density of 26.89 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. The linear SC developed via modifying a cotton yarn with the hybrid exhibits good flexibility and structural stability, which operates normally after arbitrary deformations. This work provides a beneficial reference for developing SCs. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
