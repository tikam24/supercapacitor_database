In this study, mesoporous NiCoP microflowers are fabricated by a simple direct low-temperature phosphorization of the hydrothermal-prepared Ni 0.5 Co 0.5 (OH) 2 microflower precursors. The resultant NiCoP material possesses a unique three-dimensional flower-like architecture with high specifc surface area (56.6 m 2 g −1 ) and large pore volume (0.432 cm 3 g −1 ). Utilized as the supercapacitor electrodes, mesoporous NiCoP microflowers outperform the monometallic phosphides (Co x P and Ni 2 P microflowers) with excellent charge-discharge rate properties (e.g., specific capacity of 1153 and 715 F g −1 at 1 and 30 A g −1 , respectively) and superior cycling performance. The specific capacitance of 883 F g −1 can remain stable at 20 A g −1 after 7000 cycles. More importantly, as-prepared NiCoP microflower electrode is able to deliver high energy densities of 48.4 Wh kg −1 and 30 Wh kg −1 at the power densities of 275 W kg −1 and 8.2 kW kg −1 , respectively. The enhanced pseudocapacitive performance is mainly attributed to the mesoporous microflower structure and the synergistic combination of different metal elements (Ni and Co) for electrochemical reactions.
