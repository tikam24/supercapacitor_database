The findings from a project on re-evaluation of the architecture battery powered electric vehicles (EV) traction systems are presented. The objective is to improve both the range and the cycle life available from a particular choice of battery using appropriate energy management systems. The terminal voltage of a traction battery can vary between fully charged and discharged states. The traction drive has to be rated to cater for a wide range of operating voltages without loss in performance.
