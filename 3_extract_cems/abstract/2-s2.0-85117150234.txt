Supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage devices that function by the adsorption of ions from an electrolyte onto an electrode with a high surface area. Due to the advantages such as high-power density and a longer life span, supercapacitors bearing nanoscale porous carbon-based electrodes, have gained special interest. The high specific surface area of nano-scale porous carbon-based electrodes could substantially increase the energy density of supercapacitors. Here we review the research pertaining to the energy storage of supercapacitors and the mechanism regulating the microscopic energy storage within nanopores. The advantages and challenges of various in situ characterization techniques and simulation techniques in the energy storage mechanism were discussed. The effective combination of in situ characterization techniques and computer simulations has been highlighted since it provides a useful means to understand the intrinsic properties of the electrode/electrolyte interface and various physicochemical reactions that take place during charging/discharging. This understanding is valuable for the design and development of next-generation supercapacitors with the high power density and high energy density.
