Pseudocapacitors hold great promise as charge storage systems that combine battery-level energy density and capacitor-level power density. The utilization of pseudocapacitive material, however, is usually restricted to the surface due to poor electrode kinetics, leading to less accessible charge storage sites and limited capacitance. Here, tin oxide is successfully endowed with outstanding pseudocapacitance and fast electrode kinetics in a negative potential window by engineering oxygen-deficient homo-interfaces. The as-prepared SnO2− x@SnO2− x electrode yields a specific capacitance of 376.6 F g−1 at the current density of 2.5 A g−1 and retains 327 F g−1 at a high current density of 80 A g−1. The theoretical calculation reveals that the oxygen defects are more favorable at homo-interfaces than at the surface due to the lower defect formation energy. Meanwhile, as compared with the surface, the homo-interface possesses more stable Li+ storage sites that are readily accessed by Li+ due to the occurrence of oxygen vacancies, enabling outstanding pseudocapacitance as well as high rate capability. This oxygen-deficient homo-interface design opens up new opportunities to develop high-energy and power pseudocapacitors.
