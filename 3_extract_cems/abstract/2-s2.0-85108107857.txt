Nanoarchitectures of ternary NiCo2S4 are desirable for the development of advanced high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, we demonstrate a simple solvothermal synthesis procedure for a fern-like nanoarchitecture of NiCo2S4 on Ni foam. The electrode exhibits a good areal capacity of approximately 1.55F cm−2 at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, while the ASC device exhibits an areal capacity of approximately 1.02 F cm−2 at 12 mA cm−2 and retention of 75.3% over 8000 charge–discharge cycles.
