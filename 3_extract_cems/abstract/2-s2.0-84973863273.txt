In the present study, molybdenum diselenide/reduced graphene oxide (MoSe2/rGO) nanosheets were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal process and the electrochemical performance of the nanosheets was evaluated for supercapacitor applications. The MoSe2 nanosheets were uniformly distributed on the surface of the rGO matrix. The MoSe2/rGO nanosheet electrode exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance (211 F g-1) with excellent cycling stability, compared with pristine MoSe2. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the MoSe2/rGO nanosheet electrode is mainly attributed to the improved electron and ion transfer mechanism involving the synergistic effects of pseudocapacitance (from the MoSe2 nanosheets) and the electric double layer charge (EDLC, from the rGO nanosheets) storage behavior. These results demonstrate that the enhanced electrochemical performance of MoSe2/rGO nanosheets could be obtained via a facile and scalable approach.
