Metal oxide/carbon composite systems have been investigated extensively for fabrication of supercapacitors. To obtain high capacitance, a thick pseudocapacitive layer loaded on a conventional carbon support inevitably leads to high dead volume and poor rate/power characteristics. Herein, we propose a strategy with biomass-derived hierarchical porous carbon as supports to bridge two critical but mutually exclusive properties of supercapacitors: high capacitance and rapid ion/charge transport. Highly dispersed deposition of nanosized MnO2 and MnO on hierarchically porous carbon were achieved through slow redox reaction controlled by gradual hydrolysis of fibrous polymers remaining in the hydrothermal carbon. High surface area, ultrathin pseudocapacitance layer, and wide voltage window (1.6–2 V) improve the synergy between the high energy density of MnOx and the high power density of porous carbon. The maximum energy density of 40.95 Wh kg−1 (at 180 W kg−1) and power density of 9000 W kg−1 (at 23.85 Wh kg−1) was realized for the assembled asymmetric/symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolytes. More importantly, a cycle life comparable to that of carbon-based double-layer capacitors (95.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles) could be achieved. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) was also conducted to elaborate the differences between manganese valence states for in-depth understanding. The characteristics of low cost, environmental friendliness, and excellent performance highlight the great promise of biomass waste in designing carbon supports for electrochemical applications.
