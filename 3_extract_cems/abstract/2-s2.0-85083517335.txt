Herein, Ni-MOF sheet incorporated with polypyrrole is fabricated via a simple wet-chemical approach, and the obtained PPy-MOF composite is investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The composite is systematically investigated by a series of characterization studies including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Besides that, the electrochemical capacitive behaviors of the products are examined by electrochemical measurements. Electrochemical results show varying the ingredient ratio can lead to different electrocapacitive behavior, and PPy-MOF-0.2 is proved to possess the best performance in the investigated recipes. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor employing PPy-MOF and activated carbon as positive and negative electrodes is also assembled, which exhibits high energy density.
