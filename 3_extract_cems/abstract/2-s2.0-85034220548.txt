This paper investigates the charging time constant reduction of supercapacitors with regard to some identified key parameters. These parameters involved are consistent with the Equivalent Series Resistances and the Double layer Capacitance in Stern's Model. The charging parameters have been considered and simulated in Matlab environment. The simulation results have indicated that the effect of capacitance of Electrical Double Layer on the charge time is more significant. However, it is noted that by varying some parameters such as reducing the relative permittivity of the electrolyte, active surface, and also increasing Helmholtz layer thickness contributed in improving the charging time of supercapacitor.
