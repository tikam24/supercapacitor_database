Nitrogen-enriched hierarchical porous carbon was prepared from melamine-formaldehyde resin/poly (vinyl alcohol) blend using MgO as template. The structural properties and surface chemistry were characterized by nitrogen sorption at 77 K, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results showed that the obtained carbon possessed unique hierarchical porous structure (micropores with the size of ca. 0.85 and 1.76 nm, mesopores with the size of ca. 2.3, 9 and 50 nm, and macropores at 100~200 nm), high meso/macro-porosity (67.3~84.9%) and rich heteroatoms (5.76~9.32 wt.% of N and 10.97~19.66 wt.% of O). Both of the porous structure and surface chemistry could be controlled by adjusting the content of template. The electrochemical performance was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy in 6M KOH. Analysis revealed that the surface functionalities could greatly enhance the specific surface capacitance and high meso/macro-porosity ensured high rate performance. Dou to the highest meso/macro-porosity (84.9%) and high content of heteroatoms (7.32 wt.% of N and 10.97 wt.% of O), the sample MPM -2 showed superior electrochemical performance (specific capacitance of 224 F g -1, capacitance retention of 67% and specific surface capacitance of 0.64 F m -2).
