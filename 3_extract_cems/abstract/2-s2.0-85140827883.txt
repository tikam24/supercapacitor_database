Spinel Li4Ti5O12 is an extensively studied and successfully commercialized battery type electrode for lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), mainly due to its abundance, improved rate capability, and safety guaranteed by the high potential intercalation mechanism. However, still, there is an unanswered question - is prelithiation necessary for LTO-based LIC systems? In this work, we studied the role of prelithiation by assembling different LICs with LTO anodes by varying prelithiation levels (Li4+xTi5O12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 3) with activated carbon (AC) electrodes. The disparities in electrochemical performance of such LICs, energy-power storage capability, and cycling stability are also investigated. The assembled AC/Li4Ti5O12 cell shows a maximum energy storage capability of 84.59 W h kg−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1. And, a LIC with an optimum prelithiation level (∼30 min (50-55 mA h g−1)) and AC/Li5Ti5O12 configuration exhibits effective utilization of the voltage window. However, the process of prelithiation ensures the cycling stability of such LIC systems.
