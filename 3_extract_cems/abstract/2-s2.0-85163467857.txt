Lightweight, portability, and sustainability have become key factors of the power source for the rapid development of multifunctional wearable electronic devices. In this work, a washable, wearable, and durable self-charging system for human motion energy harvesting and storage based on asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is investigated. The all-solid-state flexible ASC is composed of a cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide grown on a carbon cloth (CoNi-LDH@CC) as the positive electrode and activated carbon cloth (ACC) as the negative electrode and exhibits the performance of small size, high flexibility, and superior stability. The device was able to provide a capacity of 345 mF cm-2 and a cycle retention rate of 83% after 5000 cycles, which shows great potential as an energy storage unit. Additionally, flexible silicon rubber-coated carbon cloth (CC) is waterproof and soft and can be used as a TENG textile to gain energy for stable charging of an ASC, which presents an open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current of 280 V and 4 Î¼A, respectively. The ASC and TENG can be assembled to continuously collect and store energy, which provides an all-in-one self-charging system qualified with washable and durable for potential applications in wearable electronics.
