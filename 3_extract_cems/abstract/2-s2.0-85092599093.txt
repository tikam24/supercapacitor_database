A natural embodiment for multifunctional materials combining energy-storing capabilities and structural mechanical properties are layered structures, similar to both laminate structural composites and electrochemical energy-storage devices. A structural composite with integrated electric double layer capacitive storage is produced by resin infusion of a lay up including woven glass fabric used as mechanical reinforcement, carbon nanotube non-woven fabrics as electrodes/current collectors and a polymer electrolyte. The energy-storing layer is patterned with holes, which after integration form resin plugs for mechanical interconnection between layers, similar to rivets. Finite element modelling is used to optimise rivet shape and areal density on interlaminar shear properties. Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests during three-point bending show no degradation of properties after large deflections or repeated load/unload cycling at 3.5 V. This mechanical tolerance is a consequence of the elimination of metallic current collectors and the effective integration of multifunctional materials, as observed by electron microscopy and x-ray computed tomography. In contrast, control samples with metallic current collectors, analogous to embedded devices, rapidly degrade upon repeated bending.
