Flexible energy storage devices have developed rapidly in recent years to meet the increasing requirements for portable electronics. Supercapacitors have been regarded as promising energy storage units that exhibit long cycle life, high power density, high electrical and mechanical compatibility. In order to enhance the functionality and reliability in smaller scale, micro-supercapacitors have been developed to serve as on-chip micro-power sources for miniaturized electronic devices. In this work, we developed a novel method to fabricate the all solid-state graphene-based flexible micro-supercapacitors with high scalability and performance. A specifically designed shallow mask is applied for fabrication of interdigital patterns. The as-fabricated micro-device, with excellent charge storage capability, has shown great potential to be used in electronic packaging for fast and high power supply.
