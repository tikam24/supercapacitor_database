Non-activated carbons (non-AC) can be derived from different biomass sources through pyrolysis without any chemical or physical activations. The performance of non-AC as an electrode material for supercapacitor application is less intriguing than that of activated carbons (AC). This chapter reviews and compares the procedures of non-AC synthesis from various cost-free biomass sources with their inherent properties. By taking into account thesupercapacitoroperating principles and the charge-storage mechanisms of carbons, the causes of the limited capacity of non-AC charge accumulation are discussed.Non-activated carbons (non-AC) can be derived from different biomass sources through pyrolysis without any chemical or physical activations.
