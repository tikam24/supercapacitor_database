MnWO4 nanoparticles with the shuttle-like shape were prepared by a simple chemical co-precipitation method and analyzed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The prepared MnWO4 was used as the electrode material of a supercapacitor, and its electrochemical performance was studied using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MnWO4 exhibited good electrochemical performance. The MnWO4 nanoparticles had specific capacitances of 295 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and 219 F/g at a current density of 0.4 A/g. They also showed good cycle-life stability and low resistance. Therefore, MnWO4 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
