The performance of electrochromic supercapacitors (ESCs) can be improved by the use of electrodes with high electronic conductivity and ion transport ability. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) N-doped NiO ultrathin nanosheets (N-NiO UTNSs) synthesized in situ on fluorine-doped tin oxide glass were used as bifunctional ESC electrodes. These electrodes exhibited an elevated specific capacitance (540 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), superior cycling stability (85% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles), and good electrochromic properties (color change from colorless to black with a transmittance modulation of 73% and a coloration efficiency of up to 83.47 cm2 C−1 at 550 nm), which was ascribed to the high electronic conductivity of NiO (due to N doping) and the short ion diffusion path (due to the ultralow nanosheet thickness). To further explore the practical applications of N-NiO UTNSs, we constructed asymmetric ESCs by integrating NiO films with Fe2O3 films and revealed that these devices displayed applied voltage–dependent colors. Two charged asymmetric ESCs connected in series could light up a red light-emitting diode and changed color synchronously with charge state alteration. Thus, our results contribute to the development of Ni-based electrochromic supercapacitors exhibiting charge state-dependent color changes.
