With the advantages of being lightweight, flexible, and wearable, wire-shaped supercapacitors have received tremendous attention in wearable and portable power sources in recent years. Considering the demands for large-scale applications, it is necessary to explore a facile and convenient preparation approach for wire-shaped supercapacitors. Herein, we reported a simple approach to fabricate wire-shaped electrodes by a dipping method, which possessed a nitric acid-activated graphite fiber core and an activated carbon-coating layer structure. Parallel and symmetric all-solid-state wire-shaped supercapacitors (PWSCs) based on the electrodes were fabricated. The as-fabricated PWSC showed high energy density (6.60 W h/kg, 8.08 mW h/cm, and 1 mV/s) and power density (253 mW/kg, 0.31 mW/cm, and 100 mV/s) and excellent flexibility. Furthermore, this wire-shaped supercapacitor may bring broader application prospects for energy storage devices in future wearable electronic areas.
