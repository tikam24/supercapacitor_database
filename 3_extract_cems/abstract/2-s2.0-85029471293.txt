Developing porous carbon materials with low-cost, sustainable and eco-friendly natural resources is emerging as an ever important research field in the application of high-performance supercapacitor. In this paper, a simple synthetic method to fabricate nitrogen doped porous carbon (NPC) is developed via a one-pot carbonization of sodium alginate and urea. The as-prepared NPC annealed at 700 °C with meso- and macro-porous structure exhibits excellent specific capacitance (180.2 F/g at 1 A/g) and superior cycling life when serves as electrode materials for supercapacitor. Moreover, the investigation on the annealing temperature demonstrates that NPC pyrolysis at 700 °C possesses relatively high pyrrole nitrogen and pyridine nitrogen, which is favorable for enhancing supercapacitor performance. This work extends biomass derived carbon materials in energy storage applications.
