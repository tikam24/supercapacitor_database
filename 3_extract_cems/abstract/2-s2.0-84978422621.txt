High frequency ultrasonication was employed to reduce the aggregation of graphene by constructing hybrid carbon materials (HCMs),which are endowed with a large electrochemical reaction area and high energy density.HCMs exhibited a specific capacitance of 168.5 F g1 with 100%capacitance retention over 500 cycles. Flexible supercapacitors fabricated fromHCMs also showed an excellent capacitive behavior even under tough conditions. These outstanding electrochemical propertieswere ascribed to the increased specific surface area and open structure of HCMs.
