In this paper, the ultrathin Bi 2 O 3 nanowires are synthesized by an oxidative metal vapor transport deposition technique. Their diameters and length are about 10 nm and several tens of micrometers, the growth direction is along [101] and the specific surface area is about 7.34 m 2 g −1 . The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement results show that the specific capacitances of the Bi 2 O 3 nanowires-based electrodes increase with the decrease of the current densities. The maximum capacitance is 691.3 F g −1 at the current density of 2.0 A g −1 . The Ragone plot shows that the Bi 2 O 3 nanowires has excellent supercapacitive performance. Moreover, the cyclic stability is measured by the galvanostatic charge/discharge technique at a constant current density of 10.0 A g −1 in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results show the excellent capacitance retention of 75.5% over 3000 cycles. In a word, the Bi 2 O 3 nanowires should be the ideal potential electrode materials for low-costing and effective electrochemical supercapacitors.
