Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a fascinating polymeric material comprising nitrogen framework, has become a new research focus and has emerged as one of the most promising material in the area of energy storage devices. It has appealing features such as chemical stability, thermal stability and environment friendly properties. However, due to its low surface area, the electrochemical characteristics of bulk g-C3N4 obtained by standard thermal polymerization process are typically below par. This article presents two techniques of synthesising mesoporous g-C3N4 with enhanced porosity and specific surface area as well as higher electrode material conductivity thereby making it suitable for supercapacitor applications. The article outlines the two synthesis techniques of mesoporous g-C3N4 along with their electrochemical properties. The first technique is using a simple one-pot strategy (CN1) and the second one is carbonated beverage assisted hydrothermal method (CN2). In the first method, CN1 thus prepared exhibited a specific capacitance of 114.5F/g at a current density 0.5 A/g with 100 % coulombic efficiency and 90 % retention after 5000 charge and discharge cycles at 5A/g. The operational power was estimated to be 1330.2 W/kg with a specific energy of 1.74 Wh/kg. CN2 obtained by hydrothermal method exhibited a specific capacitance of 150.5F/g at current density 0.5 A/g with>100 % coulombic efficiency and 95 % retention after 5000 charge and discharge cycles at 5A/g. It also exhibited impressive energy density of 3.92 Wh/Kg at power density of 1666 W/Kg. This study reveals that CN2 is a long-lasting material with superior electrochemical properties, a moderate amount of energy and a high operating power compared to CN1 and bulk g-C3N4.
