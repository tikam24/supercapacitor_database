One-dimensional (1D) Graphene Nanoscrolls (GNS) is a new topology of carbon-based materials. This structure attracted more researchers towards a new class of energy storage materials due to its unique 1D tubular morphology. Here, the 1D GNS was synthesized by rapid quenching of aqueous suspension of chemically reduced graphene using liquid nitrogen. The electrochemical performances were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/storage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The specific capacitance of 309.8 F/g for GNS was obtained at the constant current density 0.5 A/g. The maximum energy and power densities achieved for GNS are 27.5 Wh/kg and 10800 W/kg, respectively with excellent cyclic stability. These results indicated that GNS with unique morphology could be used in future as a new electrode material for energy storage devices.
