To date, the development of clean and sustainable energy conversion and storage system to against the future energy crisis and environmental pollution has attracted enormous research interests among the energy research community. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with its remarkable functionality, versatility, structural tenacity and flexibility make it as one of the potential electrode material for supercapacitor application. In this chapter, the tuneable parameters of MOF attributes such as charge conductivity, physical and chemical properties, high porosity and large surface area and scalability and processability for energy storage application especially supercapacitor are discussed comprehensively. Moreover, the application of MOFs and its derivatives as electrode material for supercapacitor application were reviewed and discussed comprehensively in this chapter. This chapter concludes with some outlook and future perspectives on practically utilisation of MOFs and its derivatives in supercapacitor application.
