In the present investigation manganese oxide in three different forms; Mn-Oxide/pristine, Mn-Oxide/rGO-1 (synthesised through hydrothermal route in HCl media) and Mn-Oxide/rGO-2 (synthesised through hydrothermal route in ethylene glycol) were synthesised. Materials were characterised using spectroscopic, structural and morphological investigation. Supercapacitance property of the materials was investigated through various electrochemical techniques. Materials were having similar structural behaviour, however their morphological characteristics were different. Most superior supercapacitance property was observed in case of Mn-oxide/rGO-2 composite material. Stable charge discharge profile was observed in all the materials when recorded up to 2000 cycles. The specific capacitance values in the case of Mn-Oxide/pristine, Mn-Oxide/rGO-1 and Mn-Oxide/rGO-2 were obtained as 200, 400 and 750 Fgâˆ’1 respectively.
