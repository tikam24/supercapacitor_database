We are exploring a simplified electrochemically mediated atom transfer radical polymerization method (se-ATRP), allowing us to create new carbon-grafted polymer assemblies with improved charge storage capabilities. These molecularly imprinted conjugations serve as an active component of a supercapacitor electrode that displayed a capacitance value 46.5% larger than that of pure polypyrrole and seemed to double the stability at select voltages. Furthermore, after more than 5000 charge/discharge cycles, 98.97% of the capacitance was retained. This capacitance enhancement is owned to the morphology the polymer represented by nano-ribbons and nanoparticles that are evenly wrapped around carbon nanotubes. This favours charge transfer associate with redox activity of the polymer during electrode's chargeâ€“discharge life cycle. Moreover, carbon demonstrates dual functionality as a charge transport facilitator at first, and also as the stabilizing backbone for the polymer. The later results in improved lifetime of the electrode upon applied potential, which is always the most sought-after feature of polymer-based energy materials.
