Nanoarchitectonics integrates nanotechnology with numerous scientific disciplines to create innovative and novel functional materials from nano-units (atoms, molecules, and nanomaterials). The objective of nanoarchitectonics concept is to develop functional materials and systems with rationally architected functional units. This paper explores the progress and potential of this field using biomass nanoarchitectonics for supercapacitor applications as examples of energetic materials and devices. Strategic design of nanoporous carbons that exhibit ultra-high surface area and hierarchically pore architectures comprising micro-and mesopore structure and controlled pore size distributions are of great significance in energy-related applications, including in high-performance supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and fuel cells. Agricultural wastes or natural biomass are lignocellulosic materials and are excellent carbon sources for the preparation of hierarchically porous carbons with an ultra-high surface area that are attractive materials in high-performance supercapacitor applications due to high electrical and ion conduction, extreme porosity, and exceptional chemical and thermal stability. In this review, we will focus on the latest advancements in the fabrication of hierarchical porous carbon materials from different biomass by chemical activation method. Particularly, the importance of biomass-derived ultra-high surface area porous carbons, hierarchical architectures with interconnected pores in high-energy storage, and high-performance supercapacitors applications will be discussed. Finally, the current challenges and outlook for the further improvement of carbon materials derived from biomass or agricultural wastes in the advancements of supercapacitor devices will be discussed.
