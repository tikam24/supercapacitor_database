A facile method was applied to prepare manganese dioxide nanostructures grown on graphite sheets (G/MnO2). The morphology and component analysis shows that the manganese dioxide porous structures are successfully arranged in a close and orderly arrangement on the graphite sheet. The products have good capacitance performance due to the high electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. Both electrodes were obtained by coating on carbon and indium tin oxide substrates. The results of electrochemical performance of the electrodes on carbon substrate show excellent specific capacitance of 313 mF/cm2. This in-situ preparation method of the hybrids demonstrates an effective way to obtain excellent electrochemical properties. Therefore, the comprehensive study of the different substrates provides a reference application in the development of supercapacitors.
