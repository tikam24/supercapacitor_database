Nanohoneycomb-like strongly coupled CoMoO4-3D graphene hybird electrodes are synthesized for supercapacitors which exhibit excellent specific capacitance and superior long-term cycle stability. The supercapacitor device can power a 5 mm-diameter LED efficiently for more than 3 min with a charging time of only 2 s, and shows high energy densities and good cycle stability.
