Self-assembled flower-like nickel hydroxide was obtained by adding a small amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (NMH) in the hydrothermal process. The research mainly focuses on the influence of NMH on the structure and phase composition of nickel hydroxide. As the electrode material of supercapacitor, the electrochemical performance of the products obtained by adding NMH is significantly improved, showing higher specific capacitance and better cycling performance. The specific surface area and electrochemical properties of conducts reach the 218.66 m2 g−1 and 1111.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. The prepared samples also show excellent cycle performance (after1000 cycles, 90.4% capacitance retention) and prominent multiplier performance (720 F g−1 at 20 A g−1).
