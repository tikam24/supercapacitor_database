This review article focuses on supercapacitor electrode materials based on composites of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and conductive polymers (CPs). MOFs have attracted enormous attention due to their unique properties such as high porosity, nanoscale periodicity, large surface area and structural diversity. The major disadvantage of MOFs for energy storage applications is their low electrical conductivity. Combining MOFs with other (nano)materials is an effective strategy to increase the specific capacitance and overall performance of electrode materials. CPs are attractive compounds because of their controllable conductivity and mechanical properties, particularly including large specific capacitance, ease of fabrication, high environmental stability and good film-forming properties. This review mostly deals with hybridization strategies and discusses critically various types of CPs with different MOFs in relation to hybridization techniques and obtained results. An excellent summary of MOF@CP hybrids is provided with respect to recent advances in this field and presents new perspectives for enhancing the electrochemical performance of future MOF@CP supercapacitors.
