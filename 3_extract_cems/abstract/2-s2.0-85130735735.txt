In this work, we present a novel facile route to direct the synthesis of amorphous CoCr-LDH nanosheets via the Successive Ionic Layer Deposition (SILD) method. The results showed that the as-synthesized product is formed as ultrathin amorphous CoCr-LDH nanosheets with a thickness of 6â€“8 nm. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode based on the CoCr-LDH nanolayers deposited on nickel foam shows a pseudocapacitive behavior with the high specific capacity (1080F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) and also low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential (-175 mV at 10 mA/cm2) in alkaline media. We believe that these nanomaterials are can be promising candidates for application in high-effeciency pseudocapacitors and electrocatalysts for water splitting in alkaline media.
