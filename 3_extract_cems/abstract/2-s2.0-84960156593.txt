This paper presents a facile, low-cost approach for fabrication of flexible hybrid carbon/ MnO2 pseudo-capacitors. The highly porous carbon electrodes of the supercapacitor are fabricated by laser pyrolysis of polyimide-laminated copper sheet and subsequently coated with a uniform thin layer of MnO2. The porous laser carbonized polyimide provides a high effective surface area for the MnO2 coating, resulting in an increase of 55% in the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. The fabricated device exhibits a specific capacitance of 7.1mFcm-2 at a scan rate of 40mVs-1. Moreover, the copper backing film provides a proper electrical contact to the high surface area carbon/ MnO2 composite for stability under mechanical deformation and low internal resistance.
