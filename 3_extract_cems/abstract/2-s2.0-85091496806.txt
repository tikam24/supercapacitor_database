Ill this paper the Mn02@attapulgite nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized for the supercapacitor, and characterized by X-ray diffractometer. scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometer, infrared spectrometer, and surface area and pore size analyzers. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge were performed for Mn02@attapulgite in 1 M Na2S04 aqueous solutions. For the high specific capacitance and long life time the best mass rate of MnO2: ATP for Mn02@attapulgite was obtained.
