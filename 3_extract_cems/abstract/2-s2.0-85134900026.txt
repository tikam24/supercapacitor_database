Transition metal nitrides have good metallic conductivity and high pseudocapacitance, which have drawn extensive attention in the research of Zn-ion energy storage systems. In this paper, we present a novel fabrication of carbon cloth-supported TiN-coated carbon nanotube composites (TiN/CNTs@CC and TWC) via a CVD-ALD method using ethanol, TiCl4 and H2O as precursors. The prepared TWC composites can be used as self-supported electrodes with good flexibility and conductivity. Electrochemical performance tests show that the TiN/CNTs@CC electrode has a high specific capacitance of 363.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, good rate capability and excellent cycling stability with 92.9% capacity retention over 10 000 charge/discharge cycles. Impressively, the assembled zinc ion hybrid capacitor can achieve a high energy density of up to 81.8 W h kg−1 at a power density of 137.7 W kg−1. Even at a power density of 3013.7 W kg−1, a high energy density of 26.4 W h kg−1 is still achieved. This study provides a new insight into the application of nitride-derived carbon materials in zinc-ion hybrid capacitors.
