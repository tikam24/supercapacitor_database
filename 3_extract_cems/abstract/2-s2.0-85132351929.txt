ZnCo2O4-rGO nanohybrid was synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of this nanomaterial. To study the morphology and thickness of the material, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) was prepared. For the application of this material as an electrode of supercapacitors, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed. The novelty of this study was to investigate the effect of gamma-irradiation with 1.25 MeV average energy (Co-60) on the supercapacitor properties of electrodes. The synthesized samples were exposed to gamma rays at doses of 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 kGy. The sample that was exposed to the highest amount of gamma radiation showed the highest specific capacitance 365 Fg−1 and the maximum stability compared to other samples after 5000 consecutive cycles and the lowest charge transfer resistance. Discharge time was also increased in the gamma-ray exposed ZnCo2O4-rGO (50 kGy) by 88 s at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1 compared to the non-irradiation sample. According to these results, gamma ray not only has no destructive effect on electrode performance but also improves electrode performance. Thus, ZnCo2O4-rGO has the potential to be applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors in gamma radiation media.
