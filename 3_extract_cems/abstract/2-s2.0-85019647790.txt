In order to save the elevator energy, the most researched method is adopting the energy storage system composed of a bidirectional DC/DC converter along with supercapacitor. The supercapacitor can effectively harness the regenerated electric power in the regenerating mode and discharge it in the motoring mode. By analyzing traffic flow model of elevators, a capacitance design method based on traffic flow difference is proposed in this paper, which can satisfy the elevator operational safety requirements and reduce the system cost. Then, control strategies of motoring mode, regenerating mode and malfunction mode are analyzed respectively by analyzing energy management strategy of DC bus voltage detection. Finally, an experimental platform of supercapacitor energy-storage type elevator was built. Experimental results validate that the system control strategy can effectively harness and allocate the harnessed energy.
