In this modern era of electronics possessing features like advanced compactness and wearability, flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor devices constructed by using biomass-derived materials are considered as suitable aspirants by virtue of their high energy density, power density, and good cyclic life. Herein, we have constructed a high-performance all-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device using coconut fiber derived porous carbon as the anode and a nanocomposite composed of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (CF) immobilized within the pores of porous carbon (PC) as the cathode. The constructed device possessed a high energy density of 50.34 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1450 W kg-1 and good cycle life (retention of ∼91% specific capacitance (CS) after ∼5000 cycles). The fabricated device retained its performance even after considerable physical deformation. These excellent features of this device can be credited to the synergy between the CF and PC nanomaterials. CF nanoparticles provide fast redox processes and good power delivery within a few seconds of time, whereas the high surface area (BET surface area ∼1323 m2 g-1) porous carbon possessing structural porosity hosts the CF nanoparticles and also helps in faster ion transfer in the nanocomposite and provides mechanical robustness to the electrode. The results obtained from the present work encourage the augmentation of low-cost electrode material for highly efficient green energy-based electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices.
