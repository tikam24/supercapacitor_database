Developing new high-performance electrode materials for improving the energy density of supercapacitors is an important task. Herein, a new three-dimensional (3D) metal-orgainc framework (MOF) [Mn(BGPD)(H2O)2] (Mn-BGPD; BGPD = N,N′-bis(glycinyl)pyromellitic diimide) was synthesized. When Mn-BGPD is used as the electrode material of supercapacitors, in a three-electrode setup, it shows an outstanding specific capacitance of 832.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The asymmetrical supercapacitor of Mn-BGPD shows an attractive specific capacitance of 100 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which corresponds to an excellent energy density of 35.5 W h kg−1. Moreover, better cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 46.7% is also shown. The high electrochemical performance makes Mn-BGPD a very promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
