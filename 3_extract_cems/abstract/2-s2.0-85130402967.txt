In this work, NiMoO4 hollow nanocubes were first successfully obtained via facile solvothermal and subsequent etching process. Assembling two-dimensional NiMoO4 nanosheets into the three-dimensional framework based on Cu2O nanocubes provided outstanding nanostructure stability and excellent electrochemical property. For example, the as-prepared hollow NiMoO4 nanocubes exhibited an outstanding capacitance of 1093 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In addition, the supercapacitor is composed of hollow NiMoO4 nanocubes as positive electrode and N-rGO as negative electrode, which showed an outstanding energy density (44.01 Wh kg−1) at a power density of 769 W kg−1 in a voltage windows of 0–1.55 V, and even maintained an energy density (23.68 Wh kg−1) at a high power density (7.7 kW kg−1). Furthermore, the device delivered a promising long-term cyclic performance of 84.7% capacitance retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles.
