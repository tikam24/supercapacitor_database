Nanocomposites of PEDOT:PSS with V2O5 nanoparticles are synthesized by simple physical mixing of the two with different weight percentages of the latter and their performance as supercapacitor electrode materials is verified. Best performance is obtained for an optimum weight percent of 16.8% of V2O5. The specific capacitance and specific energy of the composite with 16.8% V2O5 increases by more than two fold, with increase in specific power, as compared to that of pristine PEDOT:PSS device. This is attributed to increase in conductivity brought about by the presence of V2O5 nanoparticles, easier transportation and intimate contact of electrolyte ions with the nanolayers of V2O5 due to the intercalation of PEDOT:PSS between the layers, and additional redox reactions due to various oxidation states of vanadium element, besides redox electrolyte effects. This is further confirmed by the reduced ESR of the composite device as compared to that of pristine PEDOT:PSS device.
