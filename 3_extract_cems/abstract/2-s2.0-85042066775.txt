Herein, ionic liquid functionalized graphene nanoribbons (IL-GNR) were fabricated via geminal dicationic ionic liquid, acting as not only a reducing agent but also a functionalizing one. The analyses including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction were employed to investigate the fabricated sample structures. Through the electropolymerization of ortho aminophenol monomers, carried out in the presence of IL-GNR, poly ortho aminophenol (POAP)/(IL-GNR) composite films, functioning as an active electrode in supercapacitor application, were prepared so that the electrochemical behavior of the conducting polymer could be enhanced. For investigation of the system behavior, various electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge method as well as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were utilized. Not only the superior active surface area and the composite film conductivity but also the synergistic effect existing between POAP and IL-GNR resulted in the supercapacitive performance of the fabricated composite film.
