Nanostructured electrode materials have illustrated predominant electrochemical properties in producing high-performance supercapacitors. Perovskite based nanostructures with formula ABO3 have received broad consideration due to their excellent physical and chemical characteristics such as electrically active structure, electronic conductivity, ionic conductivity, supermagnetic, photocatalytic, thermoelectric, and dielectric properties, etc. Hence, perovksite based nano-structured materials are supposed to be promising, fascinating electrode materials for designing supercapacitors with high energy storage performance. In this review article, the recent progress and advances in designing perovskite based nanostructured electrode materials is discussed, which can provide as a guideline for the next generation of supercapacitor electrode design.
