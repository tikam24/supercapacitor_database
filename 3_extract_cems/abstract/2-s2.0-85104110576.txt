Silicon dioxide peristaltic supporting carbon (SPSC) with a high specific surface area and excellent structural stability is successfully obtained by a partial etching strategy. Polyaniline (PANI) is assembled onto the surface of SPSC and finally MoS2 nanosheets are further decorated to obtain SPSC and MoS2 nanosheets co-anchored polyaniline nanocomposites. Benefiting from the unique creepable structure design and synergistic effect produced through the complementary properties of the three components, the fabricated SPSC-PANI-MoS2 electrode demonstrates ideal electrochemical performance for supercapacitors through electrochemical analysis. The nanocomposite exhibits an outstanding capacitive performance of 637.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor with SPSC-PANI-MoS2 and active carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, achieves a high energy density of 22.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 550.0 W kg−1. The study shows that the peristaltic core support material is valuable in the field of supercapacitor electrode materials, and that it can further demonstrate its own advantages when it is combined with other high-performance materials through clever structural design.
