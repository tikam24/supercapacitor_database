This paper develops an optimization method for the integration of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) considering different supercapacitors and three different forms of Li-Ion batteries: NMC (LiNiMnCo), LFP (LiFePO 4 ) and LTO (Li 2 TiO 3 ). The proposed method finds the proper demand side management (DSM) measures and optimizes the size of the HESS based on the profile selected and the electric tariff, finding the case where the net present value (NPV) is maximized. This method also evaluates which supercapacitor and battery chemistry better suit for each case. The proposed method allows to clearly evaluate not only the technical issues related with the performance of the system, but also the economical impact on the electric bill when integrating a HESS in an industrial application. This method will be also compared with the solution by only considering economical factors.
