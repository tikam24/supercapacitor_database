A fiber-based multifunctional nickel phosphide (NiPx) electrode has been successfully prepared by facile electrodeposition of nickel nanoparticle arrays on a commercial carbon fiber (CF) followed by low-temperature phosphidation. As a result of the synergistic effect from the 3D porous structure, enhanced conductivity, and the two active components Ni2+ and PÎ´- with rich valences, the resulting vertically aligned NiPx nanoflakes grown on the CF (CF@NiPx) electrode exhibit superior bifunctional electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline electrolyte as well as an ultrahigh specific volumetric capacitance of 817 F cm-3 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2. For practical applications, an efficient CF@NiPx-based alkaline water electrolyzer, with strong durability, can achieve 10 mA cm-2 water-splitting current at a cell voltage of only 1.61 V (iR uncorrected). Besides, a fiber-based flexible solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device with CF@NiPx as the cathode and reduced graphene oxide attached on CF@Ni (CF@Ni@RGO) as the anode was observed to achieve a remarkable volumetric energy density of 8.97 mW h cm-3, excellent flexibility and superior long term cycling stability. All these results render our fiber-based CF@NiPx electrodes as an ideal platform for electrocatalysis and flexible electrochemical energy storage applications.
