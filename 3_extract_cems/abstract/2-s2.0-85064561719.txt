An activated carbon-carbon nanotube (AC-CNT) composite is synthesized by using a simple chemical process, and its electrochemical performance in different aqueous electrolytes, such as H2SO4, Na2SO4, and KOH, is investigated. The composite exhibits different capacitive behaviors in different aqueous electrolytes, demonstrating the highest specific capacitance (205 Fg âˆ’ 1 ) in the H2SO4 electrolyte due to its having the highest molar ionic conductivity compared to the other two. Nyquist and Bode plots prove that the composite in the H2SO4 electrolyte has the lowest electrochemical impedance and highest capacitive behaviors compared to the others. The composite in the Na2SO4 electrolyte has the lowest capacitance due to the low molar ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, although it displays the best capacitance retention after 200 cycles. Selection of electrolytes, therefore, is an important factor for supercapacitor applications.
