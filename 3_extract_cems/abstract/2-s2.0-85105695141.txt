By using polytetrafluoroethylene@melamine sponge composite as the precursor, a nitrogen and fluorine co-doped porous carbon is prepared via a chemical etching process. The specific surface area and total volume of the mesoporous carbon are 1799 m2 g−1 and 1.48 m3 g−1, respectively. The doping amount of the fluoride and nitrogen in the resulting co-doped carbon is determined to be 1.2 at.% and 2.7 at.%, respectively. In a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH electrolyte, when mass loading of active material is 4 and 6 mg, electrodes deliver specific capacitances of 299 and 284 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, respectively. In a symmetric-electrode system in the same electrolyte, an electrode shows the specific capacitance of 233 F g−1 at the same current density. In aqueous electrolyte, the assembled simulated supercapacitor reaps a maximum specific energy of 8.3 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 101 W kg−1. Under the current density of 5 A g−1, after 6000 cycles, the 94.1% remaining capacitance indicates a good cycle stability. Findings demonstrate the synthesized fluorine and nitrogen co-doped porous carbon can be used as electroactive material for high-performance supercapacitor.
