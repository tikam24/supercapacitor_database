Four different iron cobaltite (FeCo2O4) structures namely nanoneedles, nanorods, nanosheets and microcubes have been obtained by varying the duration of hydrothermal reaction. The dependence of electrochemical properties on the FeCo2O4 structures has been investigated. The FeCo2O4 nanosheet have the highest specific capacitance (Csp), followed by nanorods, nanoneedles and microcubes. The highest Csp of FeCo2O4 nanosheets is attributed to its highest specific surface area and pore volume. A solid-state asymmetric FeCo2O4 nanosheet/polyvinyl alcohol—potassium hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide supercapacitor was fabricated. The supercapacitor exhibits maximum power density of 3202 W kg−1 and maximum energy density of 24.5 Wh kg−1. It demonstrates 70% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. The poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/propylene carbonate/1,2-dimethoxyethane/1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide/sodium iodide/iodine/4-tert-butylpyridine/guanidine thiocyanate electrolytes were assembled into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with FeCo2O4 nanosheets or platinum as the counter electrodes. DSSC with FeCo2O4 nanosheets counter electrode shows an efficiency of 6.04%.
