Due to complement characteristics of battery and supercapacitor, battery-supercapacitor combined energy storage systems show obvious superiority over these systems consisted of single supply of battery or supercapacitor. In this paper, a model predictive control based energy management approach is proposed to maintain the hybrid power supply performance of the system. The control strategy can prolong the service life of energy system by splitting the high-frequent component of the power demand to the supercapacitor and the low-frequent component to the battery. Before the design of the proposed model predictive controller, the models of battery, supercapacitor, DC/DC converter and total output current are derived. Finally, a simulation is conducted to verify the validity of the proposed method.
