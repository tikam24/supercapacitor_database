Graphene oxide (GO) is frequently used as a precursor to obtain 'graphene like' materials. We study preparation of GO thin film using voltage cyclic electrochemical deposition. GO thin films were obtained from 0.5 mg/ml GO-water dispersion on ITO glass substrate in the range of -1.6 to 0 V at scan rate of 75 mV/s. The electrochemical deposited GO thin films were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, the GO morphology and oxygen containing groups were obtained by using SEM, EDX and FTIR, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to measure its capacitive characteristic. We obtain that thickness of GO thin films can be controlled by number of voltage cycles applied during deposition. From cyclic voltammetry measurements, we obtained hysteresis curve that imply its potential application as supercapacitor electrode.
