In this paper, the method of identifying voltage difference of super capacitors and the principle of voltage balancing are presented. They are evaluated, according to the tolerance of the capacitance difference, the nature of self-discharging feature and the feasibility of the real implementation. The results show, much energy can be available if lower voltage difference of super capacitors is kept at high operating voltage. A lab setup of the super capacitor voltage balancing system is also realized for the validation. The information presented in this paper will be very useful for the specification and implementation of the voltage balancing circuits.
