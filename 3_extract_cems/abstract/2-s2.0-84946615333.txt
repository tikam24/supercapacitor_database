Here we report supercapacitors fabricated with the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique using two polymers, namely poly(o-methoxyaniline) (POMA) and poly(3-thiophene acetic acid) (PTAA). The electrochemical performances of POMA/PTAA supercapacitors were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results were compared with POMA casting film. The specific capacitance of LBL films increases almost linearly with a number of bilayers which were not observed for POMA casting films. The results of this investigation demonstrate that the self-doping effect between POMA and PTAA can change the properties on films and can be successfully used as a supercapacitor technology.
