Nanocomposites of Co3S4 grown on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) (Co3S4-NG) have been prepared at various concentrations of NG. The supercapacitive behaviors of the developed nanocomposites were assessed with cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge techniques. The nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 2427F/g at 2mV/s in Co3S4-NG-7 composite (7 indicates the percentage weight ratio of NG). The superior electrochemical performances could be due to synergistic effects between Co3S4 and NG, high charge mobility and good flexibility of graphene structures. These results indicate that the developed hybrid materials are promising candidates for high performance energy applications. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
