Electric vehicles have been drawing a large amount of popularity and attention for quite some time now as they are prominently seen as the most appropriate substitute for the conventional internal combustion engine vehicles which are the major contributors to air pollution worldwide. Energy manage-ment and storage are important aspects. This paper discusses the latest trends in the field of battery, its design, charging methodologies, challenges faced and its integration with super capacitors, making it a Hybrid Energy Storage System, which can enhance the power demands of the EV and the various strategies developed and applied for the optimal control over the power from the multiple energy storage devices, in order to develop an efficient system for the Electric Vehicles propulsion.
