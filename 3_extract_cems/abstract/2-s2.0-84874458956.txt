This review covers recent advances in conjugated polymers and their application in energy storage. Conjugated polymers are promising cost-effective, lightweight, and flexible electrode materials. The operating principles of conjugated polymers are presented within the framework of their potential for energy storage. Special focus is given to polyaniline electrodes. Recent advances are reviewed including new methods of synthesis, nanostructuring, and assembly. Also, covered are applications that take full advantage of the mechanical properties of conjugated polymers and future applications of these novel materials. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
