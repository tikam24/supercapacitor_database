A battery and a supercapacitor are the perfect combination forming a hybrid energy storage system to energize an electric vehicle. With bi-directional converter topology, a link is provided between supercapacitor and battery source comprising of integrated magnetic structure. This paper presents the HESS with Lithium ion battery and supercapacitor with load as an Electric vehicle. There is an interconnection of DC-DC converter with integrated magnetic structure, hence, the battery size reduces which in turn reduces the weight the system becomes compact. Also, the power quality of hybrid energy storage system is optimized. The simulation for the proposed system is carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The results of simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed system.
