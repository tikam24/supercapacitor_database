Diabetics often prick their fingertips to measure the glucose levels in their blood. However, this traditional method not only causes prolonged pain but also increases the risk of infection. Hence, in this study, a non-invasive flexible glucose biosensor with high sensitivity was fabricated. Specifically, NiCo metal-organic frameworks (NiCo-MOFs) served as the electrode material of a micro-supercapacitor and sensing material of a glucose sensor. The electrochemical tests verified that the prominent sensitivity of the NiCo bimetal product is 1422.2 μA mM−1 cm−2. The micro-supercapacitor based on the as-fabricated NiCo-MOFs showed a high energy density of 11.5 mW h cm−2 at the power density 0.26 mW cm−2. In addition, the as-designed glucose device exhibited an excellent sensitivity of 0.31 μA μM−1. Furthermore, a flexible energy storage and glucose detection system was successfully prepared by further integrating the micro-supercapacitor and glucose sensor. The smart detector could accurately and conveniently measure the glucose concentration in sweat in real-time. Therefore, the wearable real-time sensing device displays feasible application for non-invasive glucose monitoring and health management.
