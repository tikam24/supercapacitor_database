The nanoball is a unique spherical nanostructure having a large surface area, high chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and a range of advantageous physical properties. The nanoball nanostructures are of various types, including carbonaceous nanoball (graphene nanoball (fullerene), carbon nanoball), polymer nanoball, and inorganic nanoball. Owing to its exceptional properties, nanoball has gained enormous attention as a polymeric nanofiller. Consequently, polymer nanocomposites have been designed with carbonaceous and inorganic nanoball nanofillers. In this chapter, a discussion of the principles of design, morphology, and the optical, electrical, electrochemical, catalytic, mechanical, thermal, capacitance, detection, photovoltaic, and other physical properties of nanocomposites is presented. Polymer/nanoball nanocomposites have been used in sensor, supercapacitor, and dye-sensitized solar cell applications.
