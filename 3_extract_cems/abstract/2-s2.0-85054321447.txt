The direct coating of graphene sheets obtained by electrochemical exfoliation on commercial paper renders the preparation of highly conductive flexible paper substrate for subsequent deposition of polyaniline (PANi) nanorods via electrochemical polymerization. The deposition of PANi can be well-controlled by adjusting the electrochemical polymerization time, leading to the formation of PANi coated graphene paper (PANi-GP). The as-prepared electrode exhibited high areal capacitance of 176 mF cm −2 in three-electrode system at a current density of 0.2 mA cm −2 , which is around 10 times larger than that of pristine graphene paper due to the pseudocapacitive behavior of PANi. In-situ Raman test was used to determine the molecular changes during redox process of PANi. More importantly, all-solid-state symmetric capacitor assembled with two PANi-GP electrodes in a polymer electrolyte delivered an areal capacitance of 123 mF cm −2 , corresponding to an areal energy density of 17.1 µWh cm −2 and an areal power density of 0.25 mW cm −2 . The symmetric capacitor held a capacitive retention of 74.8% after 500 bending tests from 0 to 120°, suggesting the good flexibility and mechanical stability. These results showed the great promising application in flexible energy-storage devices.
