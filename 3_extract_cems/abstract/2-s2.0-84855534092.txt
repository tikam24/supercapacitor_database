A new kind of supercapacitor by using chemical reduced graphene (CRG) as electrode material and ionic liquid with addition of acetonitrile as electrolyte is assembled and investigated. CRG materials with high surface area are prepared by chemical reduction of graphene oxide. The capacitive properties of the supercapacitor composed of the CRG and ionic liquid electrolyte are studied by electrical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. With the combined advantages of graphene and ionic liquid, the supercapacitor shows perfect performance. The supercapacitor possesses wide cell voltage and good stability. The specific capacitance, energy density, and specific power density of the present supercapacitor are 132 Fg -1, 143.7 Wh kg -1, and 2.8 kW kg -1, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential application of electrical energy storage devices with high performance based on this new kind of supercapacitor. Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.
