The cost and driving performance of electric vehicles (EVs) highly depend on the capability and efficiency of the energy storage system (ESS), which can preserve a large amount of energy, along with the capability of responding instantaneously to the load demand. This chapter reviews the state of the art of battery, supercapacitor, and battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for advanced EV applications. It discusses the optimal control methods for the HESS and presents the existing battery and supercapacitor technology for automotive applications, respectively. The chapter introduces the control strategy and algorithm for the HESS and summarizes the conclusions and future research directions. The representative characteristic of a passive HESS is the direct combination of the battery and the supercapacitor in parallel. Optimal use of the supercapacitor bank and the battery pack requires an efficient power flow controller between the two energy storage subsystems.
