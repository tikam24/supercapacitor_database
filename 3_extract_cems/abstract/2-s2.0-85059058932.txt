Carbon cloth(CC) was treated by cyclic voltammetry in designed potential range to afford partially reduced functionalized carbon cloth(RFCC). Electrochemical deposition of nanostructured MnO2 was conducted on RFCC. The influence of electrodeposition solution on MnO2 deposition was investigated and N-MnO2/RFCC was prepared in the solution containing (NH4)2SO4. The results show that the functionalization of CC is helpful to improve its wettability, while the introduced oxygen containing functional groups can facilitate the uniform distribution of Mn2+ in the deposition solution to promote the uniform growth of MnO2 nanoparticles. The adding of (NH4)2SO4 is helpful to increase the specific surface area of MnO2, leading to improved charge storage behaviors.
