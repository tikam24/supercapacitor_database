The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of batteries with supercapacitors is used to mitigate wind power fluctuation, achieving smooth grid-connection of wind power. Firstly, considering the non-linear and unstable fluctuation characteristics of wind power, combining the maximum value of output power variation of wind farm on two time scales of 1 min/10 min, an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method is adopted to realize the adaptive decomposition of wind power and obtain the grid-connected power of wind power and the total power of the HESS. Secondly, according to the output demand of battery and supercapacitor, combined with the state-of-charge (SOC) constraints of energy storage equipment, a coordinated control algorithm for energy management of hybrid energy storage system is proposed to realize the internal power flow in energy storage system. Finally, based on wind power historical data, the effectiveness and reasonableness of the proposed method are verified.
