High-entropy Prussian blue analogues (HEPBAs) integrating the highly dispersed active sites of high-entropy materials with intrinsic 3D diffusion channels and the redox-active sites of Prussian blue analogues have great potential in electrochemical applications but have not been realized. In this work, a series of HEPBAs were successfully synthesized under room temperature combining mechanochemistry with wet chemistry for the first time.
