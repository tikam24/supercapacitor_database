The relative intensity ratios of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) used in Fig. 1b are incorrect in the original article. The value of ID/IG increases from 0.40 to 0.91 as the temperature is increased from 700 °C to 1000 °C. There are no errors in the original text. (Figure Presented). The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers.
