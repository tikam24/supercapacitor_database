Abstract: Through electrodeposition at a high current density and controlling the produced hydrogen gas, nanostructured copper foams were fabricated on copper as high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors. The structure and morphology of copper foams were controlled by adjusting deposition parameters and addition of acid acetic as bubble stabilizer addition. Acid acetic reduced the hydrophobic force between individual bubbles, and thus allowed controlling the porosity of the thin foam. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry were carried out to study the electrochemical behavior of copper foams. EIS results showed that thin copper foams deposited from 0.4 M CuSO4 and 0.1 M CH3COOH, at 3 A/cm2 for 20 s present the highest specific capacitance that was 102.68 F/g. GCD data for the same foam showed a capacitance of 95 F/g at 1 mA/cm2. Cycle life study exhibited 90% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles at high current density (20 mA/cm2).
