This paper reports the design, fabrication and testing of a flexible textile power module consisting of a ferroelectret energy harvester and solid-state supercapacitor energy storage device. Both devices can be combined and fabricated in a single woven textile layer. The textile ferroelectret achieved a peak power output of 0.47 Î¼W.cm-2 for a compressive force of around 350 N, and the single layer textile supercapacitor obtained an area capacitance of 5.2 mF.cm-2. The ferroelectret can charge the textile supercapacitor via a full bridge rectifier to 48 mV in 40 seconds demonstrating the feasibility of combining these devices on the single textile.
