Quantum dots are 2–5 nm nanoparticles with exceptional optical, electronic, luminescence, and semiconducting properties. Polyaniline is an exclusive conjugated polymer. This article reviews recent efforts, scientific trials, and technological solicitations of the polyaniline/quantum dot-based nanocomposites. Polyaniline/quantum dot mixtures form a unique composition for advance materials and applications. Carbon dots, graphene quantum dots, and several inorganic quantum dots have been added to a conducting polymer. A functional quantum dot may develop electrostatic, van der Waal, and π–π stacking interactions with the conjugated polymer backbone. Uniform quantum dot dispersion in polyaniline may result in inimitable morphology, electrical conductivity, electrochemical properties, capacitance, and sensing features. Finally, this review expounds on the many applications for polyaniline/quantum dot nanocomposites including dye-sensitized solar cell, supercapacitor, electronics, gas sensor, biosensor, and bioimaging.
