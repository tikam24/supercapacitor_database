This work demonstrates the fabrication of micro carbon fibers with hierarchical nanostructures of nickel-carbon nanotubes by electroless plating and chemical vapor deposition. Characterizations show that the micro coaxial fibers have 1400 times larger surface area, and 100 times larger electrochemical capacitance than pristine carbon fibers, while their mechanical strength has only 8% degradation. These outstanding properties make the micro coaxial fibers promising for applications in flexible or wearable supercapacitor electrodes.
