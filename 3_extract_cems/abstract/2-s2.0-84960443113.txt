MoS2 microflowers are fabricated by a facile hydrothermal route with polyquaternary ammonium salt (Polyquaternium-11, PQA) as a soft template. The experimental results indicate that the MoS2 microflowers are of hexagonal phases and have a hierarchical flower-like morphology, which are assembled by numerous few-layered nanosheets. A probable assembly process is proposed to illustrate the formation of the MoS2 microflowers. Additionally, as an electrode material for supercapacitor, the resultant MoS2 microflowers demonstrate a superior electrochemical property which could be attributed to their robust hierarchical architectures and few-layered feature.
