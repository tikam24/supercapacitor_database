A new composite from graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and NiFe layered double hydroxide was successfully prepared by the coprecipitation method under optimal conditions. The nanoparticles of the composite were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to obtain the structure, composition and morphology information. Also, the electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The nanocomposite displays a specific capacitance of 712.7 F g−1 and excellent cycle life after 2500 cycles by applying 10 A g−1 of the current density in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which confirms that the nanocomposite has superb capacitance retention (∼94.8 %) and can be used as a capable supercapacitor. Furthermore, this study provides a desirable procedure for the preparation of novel nanocomposites based on graphene quantum dots, which can be used in energy storage/conversion devices.
