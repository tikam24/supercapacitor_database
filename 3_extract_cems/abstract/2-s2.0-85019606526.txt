Supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) is a new approach to designing high-efficiency DC-DC converters by combining supercapacitors and a commercial LDO. In this approach, the end-to-end efficiency of the converter is increased by a multiplication factor, in the range of 1.33 to 3, compared with the efficiency of a linear regulator circuit with the same input-output voltages. SCALDO technique can be extended to develop a dual polarity, dual output version suitable for powering portable products, with efficiencies comparable with switching converter combinations giving dual polarity outputs. In this paper, theoretical background and the conceptual design of the proposed converter are discussed. As a proof of concept 12 V to Â±5 V DC-DC converter is implemented and its efficiency, load regulation, and line regulation details are presented.
