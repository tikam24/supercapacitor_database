A series of Bi2Se3@C materials were prepared through a bismuth metal organic framework (CAU-17) assisted hydrothermal selenization method followed by carbonization, which have been found to be useful as electrode materials for supercapacitor application. The Bi2Se3@C obtained below 500 Â°C seems to show an excellent specific capacity of 565.9 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, the performance of Bi2Se3@C in symmetrical supercapacitors (SSCs) is also systemically investigated, and the SSC device achieves a maximum energy density of 39.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 639.9 W kg-1 and maintains 90.5% of this capacity over 1000 cycles.
