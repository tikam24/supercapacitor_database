Green technology plays a vital role in generating electrical energy and act as power source for various electronic systems. Green technology is defined as harvesting electrical energy from natural power such as wind, solar, vibrations, thermal, tidal waves. Many research and development activities are carrying out by various researchers in this green technology. This paper represents the efficient design and development of ambient wind energy harvesting system based wireless sensor network (WEHS-WSN) for Structural Health Monitoring. In this WEHS-WSN system Supercapacitor is used as storage device instead of batteries, which eliminate the complication of replacing the batteries at regular intervals results in developing a sustainable power management system for wireless sensor nodes.
