Uniform and conformal coating of ultrathin molybdenum oxide (MoO 3) thin film onto conducting MWCNTs was successfully synthesized through a facile, nontoxic and generally applicable precipitation method, followed by a simple heat treatment. The ultrathin MoO3 coating enables a fast and reversible redox reaction which improves the specific capacitance by utilizing the maximum number of active sites for the redox reaction, while the high porosity of the MWCNTs facilitates ion migration in the electrolyte and shorten the ion diffusion path. The ultrathin MoO3 coated MWCNTs electrodes show a very high specific capacitance of 1145 Fg -1 in 2 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution when 5 nm thick MoO3 was considered alone despite the low weight percentage of the MoO3 (16wt%). Furthermore, the ultrathin MoO3 coated MWCNTs supercapacitor electrodes exhibited excellent cycling performance of > 97% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
