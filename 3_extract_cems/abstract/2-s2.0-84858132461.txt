Among different transition metal oxides cobalt oxide (Co 3O 4) has attracted considerable attention for supercapacitor applications because of its superior electrochemical characteristics at relatively low cost. Nanostructured Co 3O 4 electrodes are usually prepared from powders using sol-gel and hydrothermal techniques, which require multi-step procedures and longer processing times. Here, we report synthesis and characterization of Co 3O 4 supercapacitor electrode films deposited directly on current collectors via a single step solution precursor plasma spray route. In this approach, an aqueous solution containing cobalt acetate is axially fed into plasma plume to produce nanoparticulates of Co 3O 4 via accelerated thermo-chemical conversion process, which are eventually deposited on a current collector substrate. Thus, developed Co 3O 4 electrodes showed nano particulate structure with porosity. The phase structure and crystallinity of Co 3O 4 electrode films were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetry (DSC-TGA) studies. Electrochemical performance of these coatings showed a specific capacitance of ∼162 F g -1 with a retention capacity of 72.2% after 1000 cycles for a specific current rate of 2.75 A g -1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
