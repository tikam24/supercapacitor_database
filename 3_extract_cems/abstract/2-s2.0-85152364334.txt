Activated carbon (AC) is carbon that is processed at elevated temperatures with activating agents. It has relatively low-volume pores, meaning increased surface area, in order to store a considerable amount of energy. In addition to coal and coke, AC can also be produced from natural materials, which can be inexpensive and sustainable natural sources for utilization in energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and battery anodes. Many nutshells, coconut shell, bamboo, sugarcane bagasse, rice bran, corn cob, and potato wastes can be good sources of AC for different applications. These natural materials are used as a precursor, carbonized at high temperature in an oxygen free environment, and activated by physical or chemical activation processes to produce AC with a very high specific surface area (~1500 m2/g). The activated carbon is used to fabricate electrodes of supercapacitors and is characterized using different techniques prior to the application. These supercapacitors have a high specific capacitance, high energy density, and high power density compared to many other storage devices. This book chapter reports on recent developments in stabilization, carbonization, and activation of naturally grown biomass; their physical and chemical properties; and major applications in supercapacitors. This study shows that natural materials are promising options for producing ACs for different supercapacitor applications at a low cost. Many readers, such as students, engineers, scientists, and other participants in supercapacitor technologies, will greatly benefit from this work.
