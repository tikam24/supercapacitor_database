From the perspective of sustainability, using biomass waste to synthesize hierarchical interconnected porous carbon (HIPC) for long-life and high-energy/power density supercapacitors are a research hotspot. Here, waste peach gum and other green resources are transformed into N, P co-doped and O-rich layered interconnected porous carbon through impregnation and carbonization processes. Thanks to the multiple synergistic effects originated from a high specific area (1635 m2 g−1) and a suitable N, P co-doped content, the HIPC electrode materials exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance (490 F g−1 under 1 A g−1) and superior rate capability. More importantly, the maximum energy density of the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor can reach a power density of 76.87 Wh kg−1 at 799.8 W kg−1, and delivers an excellent cycle life (the capacitance loss rate after 10,000 cycles is only 10.1%). Moreover, the optimum samples of HIPC exhibit satisfactory rate stability at different scan rates. This work provides an efficient and economical strategy for energy storage and renewable delivery devices.
