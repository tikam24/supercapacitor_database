Nickel phosphates with open-framework structures have better electrochemical activity and are more stable than the corresponding sulfides and hydroxides. Herein, we synthesized sodium nickel phosphate with extended rod-like morphologies through a wet chemical approach and investigated it for energy storage applications. At a current density of 3 A/g, the material attained a specific capacitance of 281 F/g in a half-cell configuration. A bimetallic nanocomposite of manganese and nickel with carbon nitride having needle-like morphology was hydrothermally synthesized and was used as the counter electrode in the asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) assembly. The ASC delivered an excellent cyclic stability of 102% after a consecutive run of 10,000 cycles.
