One dimensional (1-D) wire-like NiO/Co3O4 composites were facilely prepared through annealing 1-D Ni/Co alloys, which were fabricated by a simple magnetic field-assisted hydrothermal method. Galvanostatic charge and discharge measurements reveal that the 1-D NiO/Co3O4 composites exhibit excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance still remains 221 F g-1 after 1500 cycles, which is nearly 1.5 times higher than that of the irregular NiO/Co3O4 spherical composite particles. And thus, this facile synthetic strategy could be useful to design high-performance electrodes for supercapacitors.
