The development of passivated silicon nanowire (SiNW) based micro-supercapacitor electrodes for on-chip applications using an environmentally benign aqueous electrolyte is reported. The SiNWs, produced by low-temperature (50 C) electrochemical etching, corrode during charge/discharge cycling in the aqueous environment, but upon coating with a silicon carbide passivation layer, the corrosion is mitigated. The as-formed materials are in electrical contact with the substrate, requiring no additional current collector. The passivated NWs achieve capacitance values up to ∼1.7 mF/cm 2 projected area (comparable to state-of-the art carbon based micro-supercapacitor electrodes), exhibit robust cycling stability, and maintain capacitive behavior over a wide range of charge/discharge rates. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.
