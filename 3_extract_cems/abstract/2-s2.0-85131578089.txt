Plastic is one of the most serious environmental threats. Plastic is a non-biodegradable substance that releases various hazardous compounds that cause cancer and other serious illnesses, as well as endangering aquatic life and polluting the environment. The use of waste plastic in the production of a variety of nanomaterials can protect people and the surroundings from the dangers of plastic waste, while simultaneously producing useful compounds for other applications. This critical review summarizes the current plastic waste circumstances investigation of the worldwide energy crisis, as well as a recent development in the structural forms and presents a situational investigation of common plastic waste into valuable carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) like carbon quantum dots, carbon nanoparticles, Carbon nanotube (CNT), graphene, and 3D porous carbon, which can be used as supercapacitor electrode materials. The impact of various structural alterations on CNMs on the charge storage mechanism has been widely addressed for the manufacture of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors, and their future potential. We think that our review reveals a promising long-term strategy for using plastic waste for supercapacitor electrode applications, as well as a new way for humanity's future energy and waste management challenges.
