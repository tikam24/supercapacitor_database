Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) high-performance electrode materials is the key to new advances in the fields of energy storage and conversion. As a novel family of 2D layered materials, MXenes possess distinct structural, electronic and chemical properties that enable vast application potential in many fields, including batteries, supercapacitor and catalysis. However, MXene layers are easily formed by stacking together, which significantly reduces the specific surface area, hinders the transmission of ions, and restricts other functional materials on the surface, thereby reducing performance. In addition, due to the inherent defects of a single electrode material, electrodes or catalysts made of single-phase MXene may not meet specific practical application requirements. MXenes nanocomposites materials based on enhanced electrochemical performance through nano-engineering technology and surface modification for morphological control are highly sought after to solve these challenges. This review aims to present recent advances in these emerging MXene nanocomposites for energy storage and conversion applications such as batteries, supercapacitors and catalytic reactions. We also introduced some of the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly developing field. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
