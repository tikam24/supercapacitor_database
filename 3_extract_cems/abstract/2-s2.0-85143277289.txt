In this paper, a carbonized cotton fiber/graphene oxide hydrogel-juglone (CCF/GH-JUG) flexible binder-free electrode was fabricated by carbonization and hydrothermal process method for supercapacitors (SCs). The CCF substrate possess a layered three-dimensional porous structure, which can provide a conductive pathways for rapid electron transfer. The as-prepared electrode with outstanding electrochemical properties because of the introducing GH and juglone. Juglone, a renewable biomolecule, is immobilized onto reduced GH sheets due to the stable π-π interaction between the aromatic structure and the carbon scaffold, which shorten the ion diffusion distance, and ensure sufficient contact area between the electrode and the electrolyte, increasing and fast charge/discharge capability and the specific capacitance of the hybrid electrodes. The CCF/GH-JUG 8:3 not only electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 453.9 F g−1 at a current of 1 A g−1, but also shows good rate capability of 89.75% at a current of 10 A g−1 and high stability with 87.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. In addition, the assembled flexible supercapacitor possesses a high energy density of 33.72 Wh kg−1 with the power density of 0.124 kW kg−1 at a current of 0.5 A g−1, and expressing almost no decrease in the capacitance at different bending angles. Such three-dimensional macroporous graphene hydrogel with high capacitance and long-term stability have promising application prospects in energy storage devices for supercapacitors.
