A ternary cobalt ferrite/graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite (CGP) is designed and fabricated via a facile two-step approach: cobalt ferrite nanoparticles dispersed on graphene sheets are achieved by a hydrothermal method, followed by coating with polyaniline (PANI) through in situ polymerization process. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the specific capacitance of the resulting ternary hybrid (CGP) is up to 1133.3 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and 767.7 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 using a three-electrode system, while 716.4 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and 392.3 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 using a two-electrode system, which are significantly higher than those of pure CoFe2O4, graphene and PANI, or binary CoFe 2O4/graphene, CoFe2O4/PANI and graphene/PANI hybrids. In addition, over 96% of the initial capacitance can be retained after repeating test for 5000 cycles, demonstrating a high cycling stability. The extraordinary electrochemical performance of the ternary CGP nanocomposite can be attributed to its well-designed nanostructure and the synergistic effects of the individual components.
