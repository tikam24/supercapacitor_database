The synthesis of an organic-inorganic supramolecular hybrid system has been reported, using a wet-chemical synthesis method, where the Bi2O3 nanoparticles are dispersed within the organic matrix. The XRD analysis showed the formation of crystalline Bi2O3. The XPS and Raman spectra analysis also confirmed the formation of Bi2O3. In this work, the organic molecule supported nanosized Bi2O3 has been used as an electrode material for supercapacitor application in presence of the aqueous solution of alkaline electrolyte (1.0 mol dm−3 of KOH) and exhibited a specific capacitance 407 F.g−1 along with the energy density value of 113 W.h.kg−1 at 1 A.g−1. The supramolecular system exhibited a long-term stability by retaining 89% of the initial specific capacitance value after 500 cycles at the current density of 5 A.g−1.
