The rapidly developing demand for lightweight portable electronics has accelerated advanced research on self-powered microsystems (SPMs) for peak power energy storage (ESs). In recent years, there has been, in this regard, a huge research interest in micro-supercapacitors for microelectronics application over micro-batteries due to their advantages of fast charge–discharge rate, high power density and long cycle-life. In this work, the optimization and fabrication of micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) by means of laser-induced interdigital structured graphene electrodes (LIG) has been reported. The flexible and scalable MSCs are fabricated by CO2-laser structuring of polyimide-based Kapton® HN foils at ambient temperature yielding interdigital LIG-electrodes and using polymer gel electrolyte (PGE) produced by polypropylene carbonate (PPC) embedded ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium-trifluoromethansulphonate [EMIM][OTf]. This MSC exhibits a wide stable potential window up to 2.0 V, offering an areal capacitance of 1.75 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 5.0 mV/s resulting in an energy density (Ea ) of 0.256 µWh/cm2 @ 0.03 mA/cm2 and power density (Pa ) of 0.11 mW/cm2 @0.1 mA/cm2 . Overall electrochemical performance of this LIG/PGE-MSC is rounded with a good cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles demonstrating its potential in terms of peak energy storage ability compared to the current thin film micro-supercapacitors.
