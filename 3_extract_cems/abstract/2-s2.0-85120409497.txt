Transition metal hydroxides are a kind of promising electrode material in electrochemical energy storage, but the poor conductivity limits their application. Lanthanides are good proton conductors and can usually improve the intrinsic conductivity of other materials. By integrating the merits of lanthanide elements and transition metal hydroxide, we designed lanthanum oxide nickel hydroxide composites (LONH) with unique ultrathin triangle nanosheet morphology via a controllable synthetic strategy for high-performance supercapacitors. When the LONH is used as positive electrode material in aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor, it reveals an energy density (107.8 W h kg−1 at 800 W kg−1), rate performance (86.9% retention at 4 kW kg−1) and outstanding cycle stability (more than 90% retention after 3,000 cycles). This work confirms that compositing La2O3 and Ni(OH)2 can significantly improve the supercapacitor performance of both pristine La2O3 and transition metal hydroxide composites. We hope this work would offer a good prospect for developing other lanthanide-transition metal hydroxide composites as an attractive class of electrode materials in electrochemical energy storage.
