Li4Ti5O12-TiO2 (LTO-TO) composite is coated on carbon foam (CF) for anode of lithium ion capacitors (LICs). The resulting CF@LTO-TO electrodes with varied mass loadings of LTO-TO exhibit much improved rate performance compared to pristine LTO electrode. Specifically, asymmetric LICs based on activated carbon cathode and CF@LTO-TO anode (AC//CF@LTO-TO) with 25 wt% of LTO-TO delivers a specific capacity of 65 mAh gâˆ’1 at 300 C. In addition, the self-discharge rates of the LICs are evaluated. It is found that AC//CF@LTO-TO LIC with 45 wt% of LTO-TO shows much reduced self-discharge rate (open circuit voltage drops from 2.5 to 1.1 V in 144 hours) relative to AC//CF@LTO-TO with different LTO-TO mass loadings. The results of this study suggest that the introduction of TO in LTO anode can affect both the rate performance and the self-discharge behavior, which may be due to the fast faradaic reaction kinetic of TO and the rich LTO-TO grain boundary interfaces.
