Control over the fabrication of state-of-the-art portable pseudocapacitors with the desired transparency, mechanical flexibility, capacitance, and durability is challenging, but if resolved will have fundamental implications. Here, defect-rich Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ ultrathin films with controllable thicknesses (5–627 nm) and transmittance (≈29–100%) are fabricated via an electrochemical chronoamperometric deposition using a aqueous precursor derived from end-of-life nickel-metal hydride batteries. Due to percolation impacts on the optoelectronic properties of ultrathin films, a representative Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ film with 86% transmittance exhibits an outstanding areal capacitance of 3.4 mF cm−2, mainly attributed to the intercalation/de-intercalation of anionic O2− through the atomic tunnels of the stratified Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ crystallites. Furthermore, the Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ thin-film device exhibits excellent capacitance retention of ≈90% after 16 000 cycles. Such stability is associated with intervalence charge transfer occurring among interstitial Ce/La cations and Mn oxidation states within the Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ structure. The energy and power densities of the transparent flexible Mn1−x−y(CexLay)O2−δ full-cell pseudocapacitor device, is measured to be 0.088 μWh cm−2 and 843 µW cm−2, respectively. These values show insignificant changes under vigorous twisting and bending to 45–180° confirming these value-added materials are intriguing alternatives for size-sensitive energy storage devices.
