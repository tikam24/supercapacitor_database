As a novel organic solvent electrolyte material, sulfites possess high antioxidation and electrochemical stability, butylene sulfite with cyclic structure has been synthesized. This study also showed that the liquid organic electrolyte system based on butylene sulfite containing different lithium salt had the excellent thermal stability and electrochemical properties. In order to evaluate the performance of the electrolyte in practical electrochemical devices, an electric double-layer capacitor was assembled with 1 mol/L LiClO4/BS. The experiments showed that the capacitor had typical capacitance characteristics and better reversibility and cycle ability.
