In this work, for acquiring high space efficiency of carbon cloth (CC) and high-performance electrodes, a facile route for the preparation of phytic acid functionalized 3D graphene-based foam is proposed to anchor in CC by one-step hydrothermal approach. Followed by combining with the composite of V2O5/CoMoS4, an integrated electrode of V2O5@CoMoS4/PGO@CC with fantastic electrochemical performance is fabricated. The 3D interconnected network PGO with abundant reactivity sites and large surface area fully covers in CC including the gaps between the carbon fibers or the crossed carbon fibers bundles, leading to a high mass loading of electroactive materials and providing a fast electron transportation route and low interfacial resistance. Benefiting from these advantages, the prepared typical battery-type electrode of V2O5@CoMoS4/PGO@CC can deliver a specific capacity of 158.6 mA h g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor device consisting of V2O5@CoMoS4/PGO@CC (positive electrode) and PGO@CC (negative electrode) shows an energy density of 40.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and the stability performance with capacity retention of 89.3% after 10,000 charging−discharging cycles, showing great potential in high performance flexible supercapacitor.
