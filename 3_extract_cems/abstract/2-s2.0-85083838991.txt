In this work, the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO is reported for supercapacitor applications. The ternary composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 450 F g−1 in a symmetric cell configuration, with maximum energy density of 131.4 Wh kg−1 and power density of 27.49 kW kg−1. The ternary hybrid also shows a cyclic stability of 91 % after 5000 cycles. Extensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations on the structure as well as on the electronic properties of the binary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs and the ternary hybrid structure VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO have been carried out. Due to a synergic effect, there are enhanced density of states near the Fermi level and higher quantum capacitance for the hybrid ternary structure compared to VSe2/SWCNTs, leading to higher energy and power density for VSe2/SWCNTs/rGO, supporting our experimental observation. Computed diffusion energy barrier of electrolyte ions (K+) predicts that ions move faster in the ternary structure, providing higher charge storage performance.
