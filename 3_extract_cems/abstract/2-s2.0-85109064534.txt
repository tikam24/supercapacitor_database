Pure Ti3C2Tx and Ti3C2Tx -multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) anodes with 35 ​mg ​cm−2 active mass (AM) are prepared. The 90%Ti3C2Tx-10%MCNT electrode shows the capacitance (CS) of 1.78 F cm−2 for 2 ​mV s−1 cyclic voltammetry sweep and 1.95 ​F ​cm−2 for a constant current discharge at 3 mAcm−2 in 0.5 ​M Na2SO4 aqueous medium. The CS of the Ti3C2Tx-10 MCNT anode significantly exceeds the literature results for other Ti3C2Tx anodes. The Ti3C2Tx-MCNT electrodes, showed low resistance and good CS retention at fast charging. Good electrode properties at high AM are achieved due to the use of advanced catecholate-type dispersant. The 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzamide (THB) dispersant showed adsorption on Ti3C2Tx and MCNT, favoured their dispersive mixing, and enhanced CS of the composite. High CS in aqueous 0.5 ​M Na2SO4 medium is promising for application in asymmetric supercapacitor cells operating in enlarged voltage range.
