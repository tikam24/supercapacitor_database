Silicon carbide (SiC) is a very promising carbide material with various applications such as electrochemical supercapacitors, photocatalysis, microwave absorption, field-effect transistors, and sensors. Due to its enticing advantages of high thermal stability, outstanding chemical stability, high thermal conductivity, and excellent mechanical behavior, it is used as a potential candidate in various fields such as supercapacitors, water-splitting, photocatalysis, biomedical, sensors, and so on. This review mainly describes the various synthesis techniques of nanostructured SiC (0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D) and its properties. Thereafter, the ongoing research trends in electrochemical supercapacitor electrodes are fully excavated. Finally, the outlook of future research directions, key obstacles, and possible solutions are emphasized.
