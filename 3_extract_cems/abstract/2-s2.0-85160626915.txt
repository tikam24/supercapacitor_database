This paper presents an estimation of the parameters for a Double Layer Super Capacitor (DLC) that is modelled with a two-branch circuit. The estimation is achieved using a constrained minimization technique, which is developed off-line and uses a single constraint to write the matrix equation. The model is algebraically manipulated to obtain a matrix equation, and a signal processing system is developed to prepare the signals for the identification algorithms. The proposed method builds on the results obtained using an unconstrained ordinary least-squares (OLS) technique. The method is tested both in simulation and experimentally, using a specially-designed experimental rig. A current ramp input is used to generate the corresponding output voltage and its derivatives. The results obtained from the constrained off-line minimization algorithm are compared with those obtained using a traditional off-line estimation method. The discussion of the results shows that the proposed method outperforms the traditional estimation technique. In summary, this paper contributes to the field of DLC parameter estimation by introducing a new off-line constrained minimization technique. The results obtained from the simulations and experimental rig demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with two of three parameters showing relative errors less than 5%.
