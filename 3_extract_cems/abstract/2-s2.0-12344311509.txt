The application of ultrasonic irradiation in preparing conducting polymer as active material for supercapacitor was studied. Symmetric supercapacitor was fabricated from poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene) (PEDOT) with 1 M H 2SO4 as supporting electrolyte. The PEDOT was prepared by chemical oxidization in aqueous media, where FeCl3 was oxidant and p-toluenesulfonic acid as dopant. Ultrasonic irradiation was introduced to enhance both chemical yield and specific capacitance of the material. The specific capacitance of PEDOT increased from 72 to 100 F/g by ultrasonic irradiation, which indicated that ultrasonic irradiation was an effective method to improve the performance of electrode materials for supercapacitor.
