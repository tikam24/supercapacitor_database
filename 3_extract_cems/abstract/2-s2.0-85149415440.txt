Electrified railway is one of the major users of electricity in the power system. The access of energy storage system (ESS) effectively solves the problems of peak traction load (TL) shock and regenerative braking energy (RBE) recycling, and the access of photovoltaic (PV) system improves environmental and economic benefits. However, in the current control strategy based on the electrified railway with ESS and PV, there are still problems of less optimal overall peak clipping effect of TL and insufficient penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) due to low utilization and lack of pre-processing capacity of ESS. Therefore, this paper proposes a rolling-adaptive peak clipping (RAPC) control strategy coordinating RBE recycling and PV consumption. Firstly, perform rolling peak clipping through dynamically divided implementation windows to make full use of the available energy in each time period. Secondly, according to the state of charge (SOC) of ESS and the specific working condition of TL, the ESS output is modified accordingly to perform adaptive deep peak clipping maximizing the consumption of PV energy and RBE. The simulation verified that the proposed strategy can improve the overall peak-clipping effect of TL, and achieve full recovery of RBE and complete consumption of PV energy under the same ESS configuration compared to the global optimization method. The results show that the RAPC control strategy can realize optimal peak-clipping and RBE utilization, and increase the PV penetration with limited ESS capacity, thus improving the economic benefits of the traction power supply system (TPSS) and promoting the energy transition of TPSS.
