A porous carbon prepared from waste palm kernel shells has been applied as a new supercapacitor electrode material. Activated carbon was synthesized through a carbonization process at a temperature of 400 Â°C which has a particle size of 90 urn and provide a surface area of 301.482 m2g-1. Carbon from waste palm kernel shells was distributed on a sheet of carbon paper surface with a variation of carbon paper and palm kernel shells carbon mass ratio. From the results reported that the capacitance value was increased to 1331.8 uF in rolling method with addition of carbon palm shells mass have higher capacitance values than which was obtained in plate or sandwich method.
