The concept of structural energy storage devices has fascinated great attention in the past decade as they enhance system capabilities by the system weight/volume savings. The existing engineering technique is to fabricate multifunctional devices with the capacity of electrical energy storage and load-bearing functionalities simultaneously. Herein, a novel structural hybrid supercapacitor with activated carbon fabric as a negative electrode and lithium cobalt oxide coated carbon fabric through electrophoretic deposition, as a positive electrode, is assembled, for the first time, using the vacuum bagging fabrication method. Increasing the lithium cobalt oxide deposition concentration on carbon fabrics improved the electromechanical performance of structural hybrid supercapacitors. At a 10 g of lithium cobalt oxide deposition on battery-type carbon fabrics, the structural hybrid supercapacitors display an outstanding specific energy of 2.4 Wh.kg−1, a specific power of 41.3 W.kg−1, the charge density of 11.71C.L−1, specific-capacitance of 0.6 F.g−1, in-plane shear strength of 25.3 MPa, in-plane shear modulus of ∼2 GPa, bending strength of 117 MPa, bending modulus of ∼28 GPa and impact strength of 317 kJ.m−2, demonstrating the prospective applications in the military, automotive and aerospace sectors.
