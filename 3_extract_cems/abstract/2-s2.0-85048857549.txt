This study aims to improve the characteristics and topology of charging device for supercapacitor energy storage of resistance welding machine power supply due to use of SEPIC converter as its base. The analysis of SEPIC converter particularities as well as carried out calculations and simulations made it possible to determine the charger topology providing the improved shape of consumed current, and to regulate this shape from zero value of the output voltage; to use the boundary current mode of the SEPIC converter, and this way significantly simplify the structure of the control system applying only one feedback loop of the capacitive storage output voltage; to decrease the pulsation of the input current by using the two-cell structure of the charger; to found out the conditions for obtaining the boundary mode of the SEPIC converter and for stabilizing the input current in the transition mode; to prove that at a partial discharge of the capacitive storage, the power factor of the charger exceeds x > 0.99; to prove that at a full discharge of the capacitive storage with an additional LC filter, starting with the output voltage of 25% of the nominal, the current becomes continuous with a satisfactory spectral composition.
