Hybrid energy storage systems can be designed to satisfy energy requirements of the vehicle while keeping operating and degradation costs at a minimum. The IEEE VTS Motor Vehicles Challenge proposed by IEEE VTS in 2020 is focused on minimizing the operation and degradation costs of the Electrical Chain Components Evaluation vehicle (ECCE). The vehicle includes a fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitors as power and energy sources and reservoirs. This work proposes an energy management system based on behavior rules oriented to solve the proposed problem. The work describes the implemented rules, the reasons of its existence, and the obtained simulation results. This strategy was ranked in third place.
