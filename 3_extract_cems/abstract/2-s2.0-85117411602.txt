Over the past decades, depleting fossil energy and global warming has made it imperative to develop clean, efficient and sustainable energy sources. Among the existing energy storage devices, supercapacitors are attractive systems due to their high power density and excellent cycling stability. In the present study, NiCo2O4 nanostructures are synthesized via hydrothermal route using different structure directing reagents for effectively assigning in supercapacitors as excellent electrodes. The as-synthesized structures are scrutinized using various characteristic tools for examining their properties. X-Ray Diffraction analysis of the samples confirms NiCo2O4 crystallite phases in the as-synthesized structures. Scanning Electron Microscopy of the samples reveal the structure of nanocubes and nanourchins for the two different as-synthesized samples. Brunaueur Emmett Teller study for analyzing surface properties of the samples illustrates higher surface area for nanocubes than nanourchins. Further, to investigate the electrochemical performance of nanodandelions, the samples were subjected to electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis and it is found to be illustrated with outstanding cyclic stability and capacitive performance.
