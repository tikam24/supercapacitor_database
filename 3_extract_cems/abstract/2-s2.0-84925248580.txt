Graphene has attracted the attention of scientific community immediately since its discovery in 2004, and raised a research wave of carbon allotrope after the finding of carbon nanotubes. A series of research works have been carried out on graphene fabrication, characterization and possible applications. Since its appearance, most studies have been concentrated on its electric properties, especially on the supercapacitor. Comparatively, there are fewer studies on its thermal properties. However, due to its extremely high thermal conductivity and negative coefficient of thermal expansion, as well as its value for engineering application, research on its thermal properties is becoming one of hot topics. In this paper, we overview the achievements in the world about thermal properties of graphene such as thermal conductivity and coefficient of thermal expansion. We are concerned with single layer and multilayer grapheme, and graphene foam. We present results obtained from experiments, theories and numerical simulations. Based on the review, we raise some existing problems, and propose possible solutions for future development.
