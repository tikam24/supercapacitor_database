Value creation through waste recycling is important for a sustainable society and future. In particular, biomass, which is based on crops, is a great recyclable resource that can be converted into useful materials. Black tea is one of the most cultivated agricultural products in the world and is mostly discarded after brewing. Herein, we report the application of black tea waste biomass as electrode material for supercapacitors through the activation of biomass hydrochar under various conditions. Raw black tea was converted into hydrochar via a hydrothermal carbonization process and then activated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) to provide a large surface area and porous structure. The activation temperature and ratio of KOH were controlled to synthesize the optimal black tea carbon (BTC) with a large surface area and porosity suitable for use as electrode material. This method suggests a direction in which the enormous amount of biomass, which is simply discarded, can be utilized in the energy storage system. The synthesized optimal BTC has a large surface area of 1062 m2 and specific capacitance up to 200 F·g−1 at 1 mV·s−1 . Moreover, it has 98.8% retention of charge–discharge capacitance after 2000 cycles at the current density of 5 A·g−1 .
