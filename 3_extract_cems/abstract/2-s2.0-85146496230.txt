Supercapacitor stores the electricity between the ions of the electrolyte & electrode in a double layer of rate. These capacitors have very excessive energy density in assessment to common capacitors. They are quite useful for hybrid motors. Combination of two different materials configuration and its mechanism is called asymmetric supercapacitor. Specifically, two different carbons or capacitive materials are used on the asymmetric supercapacitor. This work reviewed to get the high voltage window in symmetric designs. Here the porous graphene deposited on carbon cloth to form a positive electrode on supercapacitor and the carbon cloth with carbon nanotube to act as a cathode is studied based on electrochemical performance with 60 Î¼ L of PVA/sulphuric acid as an electrolyte. The proposed ASC achieved specific capacitance of 200F/g at a scan rate of 20 mV/s at a current density of 0.6 A/g. The proposed ASC can extend its operating voltage window 1.8 V for 20 mV/s. The main advantage of this ASC is it can retain 94 % of energy after 2500 cycles. This shows that the proposed carbon cloth with reduced porous graphene oxide is best for forming the Asymmetric supercapacitors.
