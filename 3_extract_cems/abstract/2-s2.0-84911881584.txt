Here, we report the reproducible synthesis of highly ordered mesoporous carbons (OMCs) with a 2D hexagonal mesostructure via a facile hydrothermal method employing Î²-cyclodextrin as a renewable and environmentally-friendly carbon precursor, which gives the OMCs a high surface area and micropore surface areas, as well as an oxygenated surface. As a supercapacitor electrode, these OMCs exhibit a high specific capacitance and a high electrochemical stability. This journal is
