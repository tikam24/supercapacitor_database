Decarbonization of the global energy system requires a coordinated effort towards disruptive technology of renewable energy conversion and storage (ECS) that can be potential to secure and diversify energy systems by increasing efficiency of conversion and storage of intermittent energy sources. Porous nanostructures have been newly reported as a promising class of most effective materials for this purpose because of their unique advantages in terms of large surface-to-volume ratios, surface permeability, and void spaces. These offer abundant active sites for ultimate electrochemical activities by the shortening pathway of mass/charge transport. Particularly, Fe-based mesoporous nanostructures (mp-FeNSs) have been recently fascinating. Iron is a principal active center in nanocomposites and has high industrial suitability for next-generation technology owing to its environment friendliness, abundance, and low cost. In this review, crucial technical advances related to mp-FeNSs that have occurred during 2016â€“2020 are summarized in terms of synthesis, structural design strategy, and ECS applications such as water electrocatalysis, Li-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. This review is supportive for potential readers to obtain general and professional information in this field since Fe-based energy materials are exclusively introduced in the article including a fundamental understanding of electrochemistry and related technologies in detail.
