The increasing attention being given to supercapacitors is stimulated by the prospect of using such devices as secondary power sources in electric vehicle propulsion. The present study focuses on redox supercapacitors with electronically conducting polymers as electrode materials. Performance data of a symmetric supercapacitor based on p-doped poly(pyrrole), of an unsymmetric supercapacitor based on both p-doped poly(pyrrole) and poly(3-methylthiophene), and of a symmetric supercapacitor based on p-and n-doped poly(dithieno[3,4-b : 3′,4′-d]thiophene) are here compared.
