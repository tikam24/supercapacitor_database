Tailoring the multiple structure defects of nanomaterials by developing efficient construction is a captivating approach to designing unique electroactive materials for supercapacitors with performance improvement. Here, we in situ synthesize Ni-doped tungsten disulfide nanorod arrays on nickel foam (Ni-doped WS2/NF NRs) by a hydrothermal technique procedure. These multiple structural defects in poor crystalline Ni-doped WS2/NF NRs construction configuration by abundant interconnected nanorods would reveal plentiful oxidational/redox-active states that supply porous/conductive skeletons for quick electrolyte/ion electrons transportations. Favoring its doped conductive effect and synergetic structure of multiple-like Ni-doped on WS2, the as-designed Ni-doped WS2/NF NRs electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 242.9 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, outstanding cycling stability of 6000 long cycles with capacity retention79.8% at 20 A g−1, which is higher than that of binary WS2 electrode. This outstanding performance arises from enhanced conductivity and richer active sites in the multiple structural electroactive materials. This research offers an efficient treatment to explore multiple structural morphologies and architectures of energy storage applications.
