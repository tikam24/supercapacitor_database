We report a cost-effective, chemical polymerization route to synthesize PANI/Co3O4/graphene (PCG) ternary nanocomposite for supercapacitor applications to achieve enhanced energy density in a cost-effective, non-toxic, and non-corrosive neutral aqueous electrolyte of 1M Na2SO4. These properties are advantageous for a supercapacitor assembling procedure, being favorably facile and inexpensive. The electrochemical analysis was carried out to check analyte performance with cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The PCG ternary nanocomposite exhibits a specific capacitance of 183 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a two-electrode device, and retains its 93% of initial specific capacitance after 2000 cycles. The energy density of PCG ternary nanocomposite is 49.81 Wh Kg−1 with a power density of 697.72 W Kg−1. The excellent electrochemical properties of the PCG ternary nanocomposite are credited to the good contact and the synergistic effect between the PANI nanofibers, Co3O4 nanoparticles, and graphene nanosheets. This indicates that this synthesized ternary nanocomposite material could be used as a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode material.
