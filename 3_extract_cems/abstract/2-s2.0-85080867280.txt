This paper presents a new approach for supercapacitors characterization using impedance spectroscopy taking into account the dynamics constraints, such as temperature, current ripple rate and cycling frequency. This characterization is done using Modulab XM test bench. The main goal of this study is to show the parameters evolution which can serve to find out the supercapacitor energetic performances. From experimental data, the parameters of the supercapacitor (series resistance and capacitance) are calculated from the Nyquist diagrams. The contribution of this paper is focused on the parameters dependence study according to the dynamics constraints listed previously (temperature, current ripple rate and the cycling frequency) and their combination (temperature-current ripple rate and current ripple rate-cycling frequency). Finally, the experimental results, which show a dependence of series resistance (ESR) and capacitance (C) compared to these constraints, are presented.
