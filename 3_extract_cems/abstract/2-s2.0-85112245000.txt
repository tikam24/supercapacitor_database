In this study, sodium lignosulfonate (LS) and graphene oxide (GO) were used as functional molecules and templates, respectively, lignosulfonate-modified graphene hydrogel (LGH) was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method at 80â„ƒ. And the supercapacitor was directly assembled using LGH as self-supporting electrode material to test its electrochemical performance. LGH was characterized with SEM, EA and FT-IR, and its electrochemical properties were test by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling (GC), and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). The results showed that LGH had an interpenetrating network structure and LS was successfully modified in the network structure. Besides, the electrochemical test results showed that when the current density was 1 A/g, LGH had an impressive specific capacitance of 140 F/g in 1 mol/L HClO4 aqueous electrolyte, which was 1.73 times higher than that of pure graphene gel (81 F/g). Moreover, the device exhibited high rate capability (74.3% capacitance retention at 20 A/g).
