Functionalized carbon nanorods have attracted extensive attention in materials science and technology, due to their unique structure and excellent properties. Nevertheless, it remains a huge challenge to develop an approach that combines simple, cost-effective implementation paths with outstanding target products. Herein, we propose a soft-template strategy to achieve directional preparation of one-dimensional (1D) “urechis unicinctus”-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanorods with abundant nitrogen content (8.35 wt %), high surface area (2560 m2/g), and hierarchical pore structure. The anionic surfactant sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) and melamine are the template agent and main carbon-nitrogen precursor, respectively. By controlling the amount of ammonia (NH4OH), the behavior of AOT molecules in the aqueous phase can be accurately interfered to construct rodlike micellar templates, thereby guiding the preparation of target structural products. The rationality and stability of the original route were verified by the rigorous control experiments and relevant characterization. Moreover, the prepared materials show excellent performance in the evaluation of supercapacitors with an outstanding specific capacitance of 398 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and 73.4% of original specific capacitance retention at a current density of 20 A/g.
