The proceedings contain 70 papers. The topics discussed include: frequency variation on grounding rod with additive biochar and fly-ash; design criteria of distribution transformer using graphic user interface (GUI) based on load growth in 20 kV networks; implementation of PVWATTS software for design of roof solar panels at the faculty of engineering Subang University; an experimental study of partial shading effects on the P-V characteristic curve; fuel cell penetration characteristics on standalone photovoltaic with hybrid energy storage system; increase in high impedance value of transformer to reduce short circuit fault currents in high voltage networks; effect of step skewing on the cogging torque of permanent magnet synchronous generator; comparative study of tracker based PV panel for stand-alone PV/diesel/battery power system; and energy management applications in battery and supercapacitor hybrid electric vehicles using fuzzy logic.
