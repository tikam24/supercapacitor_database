Cobalt–nickel sulfide (NiCo2S4) was directly grown on nickel foam by a facile hydrothermal method. The effect of four different sulfur sources, the composite step and RGO density on the morphology and electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 electrode for supercapacitor were investigated in detail. The results exhibited that under the same conditions, using the thioacetamide as the sulfur source, the electrochemical properties of the electrode material was the best, which combined with 0.1 g/L RGO in the second step of hydrothermal. It showed the highest capacity and longest cycling life, demonstrating a specific capacitance of 1733 F/g at a charge–discharge current density of 1 A/g and 87% capacitor retention rate after 5000 cycles.
