Hybrid diamond/sp2-C nanostructures have aroused growing interests in electrochemistry currently owing to the good chemical/physical properties, including high electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and high specific surface area, as well as the unique electrochemical properties, namely, an enhanced electrochemical activity while retaining a wide potential window and low background currents when properly engineering the microstructure. This mini-review presents the recent electrochemistry process of diamond/sp2-C nanostructures. In particular, the synthetic methods, microstructures, and possible growth mechanism of diamond/sp2-C nanostructures are briefly summarized. Then, the electrochemical property tailoring is addressed in detail, and subsequently, their potential applications in electrochemistry including electrochemical sensors, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, and other applications are discussed. The future perspectives of diamond/sp2-C nanostructures in electrochemistry finally conclude this review.
