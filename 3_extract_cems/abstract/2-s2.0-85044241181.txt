Supercapacitor is a newly-developed device for electrochemical energy storage with high power density, long life span, as well as rapid capture and storage of energy. Carbon-based materials, from carbon nanospheres, nanotubes and nanofibers to graphene, are the most commonly used electrode materials for supercapacitors. Our group has engaged in the research of carbon nanomaterials over the past decade. Herein we summarize some typical carbon nanomaterials and their synthetic routes based on our published works, which is expected to provide the theoretical and experimental basis for further applications on carbon-based energy storage devices.
