To assemble high-energy density asymmetric supercapacitors, the development of electrode mate-rials with large specific capacitances, negligible volume changes and long cycling stability is highly required. The hybrids of multiple transition metal sulfides with carbon nanomaterials are promising electrode materials. In this study, a hybrid consisting of Cu-Mo sulfides grown on microwave exfoliated reduced graphene oxide(CuS-MoS2/MErGO) was thus synthesized by means of a hydrothermal method. The CuS-MoS2/MErGO hybrid exhibits a specific capacitance up to 861.5 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g and long cycling life. An asymme-tric supercapacitor was assembled using the positive electrode of NiS/MErGO and the negative electrode of CuS-MoS2/MErGO. It delivers an energy density of up to 54.2 W•h•kg-1 at a power density of 1.28 kW/kg when a cell voltage of 1.6 V is applied. Therefore, the TMS hybrids are promising electrode materials for high-performance electrochemical energy storage applications such as for the assemble of asymmetric supercapacitors.
