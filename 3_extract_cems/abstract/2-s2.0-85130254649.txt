Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) - wrapped mesoporous NiO hollow spheres (MNHS) have been successfully synthesized via hydrothermal route using carbon spheres as templates. Structural, textural, morphological and electrochemical properties of MNHS were investigated. Galvanostatic Charge Discharge (GCD) analysis reveals the maximum specific capacity of 566 C g−1 at 1 A g−1.Furthermore,An Asymmetric supercapacitor (MNHS//RGO) has been fabricated and delivers the specific capacity of 75 C g−1 with an energy density of 121.17 W h kg−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. The device shows excellent cyclic stability ie.,94 % of retention even after 3000 cycles.
