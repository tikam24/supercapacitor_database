This work reports the anchoring of Mo15S19 nanosheets on conductive carbon cloth (CC) using a simple hydrothermal reaction. Based on the specific capacitance data for Mo15S19/CC electrode in 1 M AlCl3, 1 M MgCl2, 3 M LiCl, 1 M KCl, 1 M LiCl and 1 M NaCl electrolytes, the highest value (400 F g−1) obtained for aluminum chloride is attributed to the fast redox reactions with short diffusion path. This is supported by the decrease in the acidity of the electrolyte and reduction in the relative intensity of the Raman peaks between A1g and E1/2g for the Al3+ intercalated Mo15S19 nanosheets. Moreover, ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy displays the reduction of Mo4+ to Mo3+ for Mo15S19 nanosheets, confirming a charge compensation mechanism via Al3+ intercalation. Furthermore, an aqueous Al-ion capacitor is fabricated based on Mo15S19/CC positive/negative electrodes and 1 M AlCl3 electrolyte for efficient energy storage. The device delivers a long cycling lifespan with over 90.1% capacitance retention over 10,500 cycles at 10 A g−1. This work provides the possibility of aqueous capacitors based on trivalent Al-ion as a guest and offers a new direction for the future development of metal-ion capacitors.
