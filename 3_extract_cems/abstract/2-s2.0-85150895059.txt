Supercapacitors with high energy density and long serving life is highly desirable for solving the energy crisis. Herein, we propose a simple strategy to fabricate hollow cobalt metal-organic framework dodecahedron heterostructures composed of Co(CO3)0.5OH·0.11H2O [Co-CH], NiCo2S4 and Co9S8 with controllable energy storage kinetics. The decoration of NiCo2S4 nanosheets provides a 6.1-fold higher specific capacity (1011.0 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) than Co9S8. The electrochemical kinetic analysis reveals that the OH- dissociation process plays a decisive role in the structural stability. Surface-loaded pseudo-capacitive materials can promote the reversibility of Faraday redox reaction and OH- diffusion coefficient. Controlled growth of Co-CH nano-needles reduces the diffusion-dominated process and improve the cycling stability by a factor of 4.0–5.8 due to the increased reaction reversibility, charge transfer and OH- diffusion. The two-electrode asymmetric device displays a high energy density of 47.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and good cycling stability (78.1 % retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1). This work offers an effective approach for fabricating low-cost transition metal complexes that hold great promise for practical energy storage applications.
