The low energy densities of supercapacitors are generally limited by the used anodes. To develop supercapacitors with high energy densities, metal–organic framework (TRD-ZIF-8) derived honeycomb-like porous zinc carbodiimide (ZnNCN) based nanocomposites (HPZC) surface loaded with graphitized carbon nitride (g-C3N4) are synthesized. After their detailed characterization by means of electron microscopy, spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques, the materials are used to prepare asymmetric supercapacitor cells (HPZC-4//AC ASCs) with HPZC-4 and active carbon as electrodes, which demonstrate power and energy densities as high as 7839 W Kg−1 and 213 Wh Kg−1, respectively. The unique honeycomb-like porous structure of HPZC loaded with a 2D material (g-C3N4) improves charge/mass transport efficiency and reduces ion diffusion resistance, contributing to a specific capacitance of 779 F g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1. The study thus presents a new way to design transition metal carbodiimide materials and assesses their potential application as electrodes in asymmetric supercapacitors.
