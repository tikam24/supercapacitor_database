We develop a facile hydrothermal synthesis method to fabricate mesoporous Ni-Co oxides nanowire arrays on ordered TiO2 nanotubes (Ni-Co oxides NWs@TiO2NTs) as a high-capacity pseudocapacitor material. The composite electrode presented the highest specific capacitance of 2353 F g -1 at a charge and discharge current density of 2.5 A g-1 with excellent cycling ability, retaining 95% of the maximum capacitance after 3000 cycles. Even at a high current density of 50 A g-1, the electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of up to 2173 F g-1. In addition, the testing of a (Ni-Co oxides NWs@TiO2NTs)//(Ni-Co oxides NWs@TiO2NTs) symmetric cell yielded a specific capacitance of up to 144 F g-1 at a current density of 4 A g-1. The much improved capacity and cycling stability may be attributed to the superior conductivity and the aligned structure of the Ni-Co oxides NWs and the TiO 2NTs substrate, which can improve electron/ion transport and enhance the kinetics of the redox reactions.
