Energy storage materials are critical for reliable, safe, and flexible energy usage, as well as for using renewable energy sources. As a result, the materials that used to store energy encompass a huge range of materials that are attracting a lot of attention from research and development to industry. Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted considerable interest as high-power storage device, with the potential to make a contribution to the speedy increase of low-energy electronics (e.g., transportable electronic home equipment, wearable) and military packages. The selection of electrode materials may also have a big impact on the storage capacity of supercapacitors. The review paper discusses the energy storage devices, types of supercapacitors, preparation methods of CuO and advantage of CuO/RGO hybrid nano composite electrode supercapacitors.
