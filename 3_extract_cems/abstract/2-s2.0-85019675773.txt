We reported a facile route for the fabrication of Al-doped TiO2 nanostructure for supercapacitor electrode materials through an in-situ oxidation of Ti–8Al alloy. Ti–8Al alloy was prepared through solidification route. After high-temperature oxidation, rod-like and wall-like Al-doped TiO2 composites were formed on the surface of Ti–8Al alloy flake. This kind of novel structure consisted of numerous nanorods and nanosheets, exhibiting large open space. When applied for supercapacitor, Al-doped TiO2 composites electrode materials exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. After oxidation at 650 °C for 100 h, the electrode can deliver the highest capacitance of 4650 μF cm−2 at the current density of 10 μA cm−2 as well as long-term cycling stability of 98.5% of the initial specific areal capacitance after 6000 cycles.
