Light and flexible energy storage devices have taken great attention from the industrial point of view. We report the deposition of α-Fe 2 O 3 on thin, light weight and flexible stainless steel mesh substrate. Liquid phase deposition (LPD) which is simple, inexpensive and additive/binder free method is used for deposition. Supercapacitive performance of α-Fe 2 O 3 thin films deposited on stainless steel mesh are studied in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 3 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance obtained is 960 F g −1 at 4 mA cm −2 from charge-discharge curves. The supercapacitive performance is significantly improved when α-Fe 2 O 3 thin films are deposited on mesh substrate as compared to flat substrate.
