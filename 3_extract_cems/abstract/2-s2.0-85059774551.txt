One-step preparation of nitrogen-doped porous carbon with high specific surface area and large pore volume was carried out by taking pre-treated chitosan as the carbon and nitrogen source and KOH as the activator. The prepared product with a chitosan/KOH mass ratio of 1: 1 had a specific surface area of 2952.9 m 2 g −1 and a pore volume of 2.32 cm 3 g −1 . With 6 M KOH solution as the electrolyte, the specific capacitance of the product reached 325.6 F g −1 (0.5 A g −1 ), and the performance did not degrade after 5000 cycles. The results indicate the potential of this product as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
