A nanocomposite of carbonaceous shell-coated polypyrrole/titanium nitride (C@PPy/ TiN) as anode material for supercapacitor is designed and synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal method. Cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements indicated that the electrochemical performance of C@PPy/TiN is better than that of TiN and PPy/TiN nanocomposite. The ternary nanocomposite exhibits outstanding specific capacitance (587 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (91% capacitance retentions after 10,000 cycles), which are superior to those of its individual components and binary hybrids (TiN and PPy/TiN).
