As the overall structure of how electricity is delivered continues to change, ultracapacitor is considered as a possible energy storage device. Its application considerations range from electronics to large scale power systems. Much of its current uses in large scale applications, however, are focused on transportation needs with hybrid and electric vehicles. Its high specific power and moderate specific energy can be used as an electric flywheel to enhance power quality conditions caused by momentary and temporary interruptions. It can respond almost instantaneously and recharge in seconds. With the advent of power electronics and other materials technology, its capacity and capability as an energy storage device are just starting to be realized. This paper summarizes the research and development status and the applications of such devices in electric power systems. Â© 2008 IEEE.
