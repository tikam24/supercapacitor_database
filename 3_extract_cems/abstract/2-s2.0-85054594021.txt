In this study, we have reported facile electrodeposited MnS on reduced graphene oxide wrapped Ni-foam for enhanced supercapacitor applications. The crystalline nature of rGO, MnS and their composite are confirmed by the XRD analysis. The well distorted graphitic carbon network and homogenous dispersion of the rGO in the composite electrode materials are recognized by Raman spectroscopy. The improved current capability and their reversibility with strong redox behavior have been identified by Cyclic voltammetry technique. The electrodeposited MnS@rGO/Ni-foam composite electrode has delivered high specific capacitance of 2220 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with the retention of capacitance 94.6% in the 1000th cycle at 20 A/g. It is clearly mentioned that the electrodeposited MnS is able to meet the current requirements in energy storage devices.
