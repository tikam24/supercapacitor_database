In this work, an electronic converter used for voltage equalization of connected in series supercapacitor cells is presented. It is studied the voltage variation of the auxiliary secondary winding, used for supplying the transistors drivers, connected in the main secondary winding. Its voltage changes depending on the current used for charging the supercapacitors and the voltage across them. The equations shown can be used for engineering design of the high frequency transformer.
