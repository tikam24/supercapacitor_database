Here, nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles are prepared via an ultrasonication approach and tested for the pseudocapacitance performance. The crystalline structures, functional groups, and morphology of NiO nanoparticles are investigated using various experimental tools such as XRD, FT-IR, FESEM, and HRTEM respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were utilized to determine the pseudocapacitive properties of the NiO nanoparticles. Noticed high specific capacitance (423 F g−1) at 0.5 mA cm−2 current density and in addition achieved good capacitance retention (93%) even after continuous 2000 cycles illustrate excellent electrochemical stability of sonochemically prepared NiO nanoparticles compared to other preparation procedures.
