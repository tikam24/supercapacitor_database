Some new current feedback amplifier (CFA)-based active Resistance- Capacitance (RC) circuits are presented for the realization of an ideal grounded supercapacitor (Y(s)∈= ∈s<sup>2</sup>D) type Frequency Dependent Negative Resistance (FDNR). The D-element is then resonated with additional RC sections to derive multifilter function circuits. The filter function have been tested for continuous resonant frequency (f0) tunability in a range of 30∈KHz∈-∈f0∈-∈300∈KHz with high quality (1∈<∈ Q∈<∈10) response. Analysis assuming non-ideal CFA devices with finite port errors indicate that the circuits are practically active-insensitive. Experimental verification of the circuit characteristics had been carried out with both hardware implementation using Analog Devices (AD) 844 CFA-chip and by PSPICE macromodel simulation.
