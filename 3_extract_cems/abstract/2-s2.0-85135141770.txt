Supercapacitors have emerged to fill the gap between batteries and capacitors. The electrodes comprising a high surface area are utilized to fabricate the supercapacitors. However, the processes involved to fabricate electrodes are often strenuous and time-consuming. Herein, the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors using frosted glass as a template to grow electrodes is reported. The frosted substrates can host much higher ions owing to the numerous surface features arising from micro- and nano-level roughnesses, resulting in one order higher capacitance than the plain surface. Electrodepositing MnO2 nanostructures on the frosted surface further increases the capacitance and attains the highest value of 11 mF cm−2 at 300 min of electrodeposition, which is 6.5 times higher than the electrodes without MnO2. The stacked supercapacitors are made using polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 gel electrolyte, and the devices exhibit superior electrochemical properties such as high scan rate stability (100 V s−1), high cut-off frequency (333 Hz), low iR drop, high cyclic stability (93% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles), and low self-discharge. The roughened nature of the frosted glass can be imprinted onto the surface of polydimethylsiloxane substrate to fabricate flexible and stretchable supercapacitors. The present work can pave the way for facile and low-cost fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes.
