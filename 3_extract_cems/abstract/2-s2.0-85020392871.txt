A novel method of preparing cube-like MnO2 by MnCO3 was firstly reported. The MnCO3 used as self-sacrificing template was synthesized via a polyol process. The porous, hierarchical MnO2 microcubes with uniform size were obtained after thermal treatment from as-prepared MnCO3 in air atmosphere. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) together recorded the composition and structure information. Electrochemical tests showed that the highest specific capacitance can reach up to 152 F gâˆ’1 and hardly any loss was observed after 100 cycles at different current densities. The results suggested that this well-designed material may have a promising application in energy storage of supercapacitor.
