CuO/CNT composites were synthesized via simple and rapid microwave approach. The nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Further, the electrochemical performances of CuO/CNT composites were evaluated. The prepared samples displayed high specific capacitances of 164.5Fg-1 at 1Ag-1, during the cycle process, the capacitance value aggrandized to 274.7Fg-1, and the capacitance remained at 166% of the primary value after 10 000 turns. Moreover, the CuO/CNT//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) exhibited an energy density of 17.08Whkg-1 at 775Wkg-1 and excellent electrochemical stability in 6M KOH aqueous electrolyte, showing its enormous potential in energy-storage devices.
