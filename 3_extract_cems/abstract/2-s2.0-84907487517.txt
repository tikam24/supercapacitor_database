In this paper, fullerenes (C60)/graphene composite was synthesized to report. The C60/graphene composite was constructed first with graphene oxide and Li-functionalized C60 particles by a facile solution method. The synthesized samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. It was revealed that the C60 particles attached onto the surface of graphene. The prepared C60/graphene composite was employed as electrode in supercapacitors. It was found that the specific capacitance of C60/graphene composite reached 135.36 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 compared to pure graphene as electrode (101.88 F g-1). This composite material was also exhibited a remarkable retention rate of 92.35% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This result showed that the composite was a promising material for supercapacitor electrode.
