Through-electrode thickness honeycomb architectures were layer-by-layer self-assembled directly through a scalable printing process for ultrapower hybrid lithium-ion capacitor applications. Initially, the electrochemical performance of the pore-array electrodes was investigated as a function of the active material type (graphene plates, carbon nanofibers, and activated carbon). Inactive components (conductive carbon and polymer binder) were then minimized to 5 wt %. Finally, an optimized activated carbon-based cathode was paired with a spray-printed Li4Ti5O12-based anode and a range of anode-to-cathode mass ratios in a lithium-ion capacitor arrangement were investigated. A 1:5 anode/cathode mass ratio provided an attractive energy density comparable with a Li4Ti5O12/LiFePO4 lithium-ion battery but with outstanding power capability that was an order of magnitude greater than typical for lithium-ion batteries. The pore-array electrode was reproduced over areas of 20 cm Ã— 15 cm in a double-sided coated configuration, and the option for selectively patterning electrodes was also demonstrated.
