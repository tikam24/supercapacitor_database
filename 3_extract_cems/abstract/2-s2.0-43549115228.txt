Supercapacitors present many advantages in the energy storage field in comparison with batteries and electrostatic capacitors. To obtain an optimal solution for energy saving, combination schemes of supercapacitors and batteries are worthy of discussion. This paper describes the discharging process of the supercapacitors and some key problems to be solved in applications. Moreover, two methods for designing supercapacitor-battery hybrid systems are presented and compared. Furthermore, voltage balancing and overvoltage protection are discussed in this paper to improve the efficiency of the system and size the system optimally and economically. Â© 2006 IEEE.
