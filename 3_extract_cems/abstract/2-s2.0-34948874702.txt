Co3O4 nanocubes were synthesized by solvothermal method using polyethylene glycol 20 000 as dispersant in water and n-butanol solvent system. The structure and morphology of the precursor and product were charactrized by IR, X-ray diffraction(XRD) and transmission electron microscopy(TEM). The formation mechanism of Co3O4 was also discussed preliminary. The average grain size of the product was 21.6 nm calculated by Scherrer formula. Electrochemical properties of Co 3O4 electrode were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/ discharge and alternating current (AC) impedance method. The results indicate that the Co3O4 nanocubes show excellent capacitive performance, charge/discharge ability at high current density and cycling stability in 2 mol · L-1 KOH electrolyte in the potential range of -0.4∼0.46 V (vs SCE). The initial specific capacitance of single Co3O4 electrode reaches 333.21 F·g-1 and 69% is maintained after 1 000 cycles. The phase transformation of Co3O4before and after cycling was studied by XRD test. The results indicate that the cubic phase of Co 3O4 is maintained after 1 000 cycles.
