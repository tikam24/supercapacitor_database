The assembly of graphene into three-dimensional graphene (3DG) macro-structures is one of the most effective ways of putting two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanosheets into practical applications. The 3DGs not only preserve the intrinsic properties of the individual 2D graphene, but also provide higher specific surface area and conductivity and more robust mechanical intensity with interconnected porous structures. Recently, template-assistant chemical vapor deposition (CVD), self-assembly, electrochemical depositon, 3D printing methods were applied to prepare 3DGs with different structures. Furthermore, the 3DGs have been widely applied in such fields as energy, information, environment and biomedicine. This review provides the main achievements made in the preparation of 3DGs and highlights their application in supercapacitors and tissue engineering.
