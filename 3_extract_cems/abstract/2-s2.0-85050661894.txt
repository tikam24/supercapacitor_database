The present study deal with the fabrication of low cost nanocomposite based electrodes based on Nickel foam binder free substrate for supercapacitor applications. The composition of nanocomposite is molybdenum sulphide nanoparticle/graphene coated on mesoporous manganese oxide. The first step is to involve the preparation of mesoporous manganese oxide by non-ionic surfactant assisted method. In the second stage is to deposit the reduced graphene on mesoporous manganese oxide in the presence of ultrasonic irradiation followed by addition of known quantity of commercial MoS2 nanopowder (particle size below 90 nm). The manganese oxide based nanocomposite is showing porous architecture with graphene sheet formation together with MoS2 nanoparticle deposition. N2 adsorption-desorption Isotherm curves for MoS2 nanoparticle (NP) modified graphene oxide/meso-MnO2 and pure meso-MnO2 displayed type IV isotherm with improved surface area values. The reduced graphene oxide (graphene) and MoS2 exist in the form of glassy flaky morphology as well as tubular/needle shapes are obtained after the deposition process in the final nanocomposite. The orderly arranged and anchored nano-sized mesoporous manganese oxide nanocomposites are showed increased specific capacitance (up to 527, 727 and 1160 F/g) and continuous cyclic stability.
