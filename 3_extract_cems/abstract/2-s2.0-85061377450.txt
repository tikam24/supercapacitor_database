Pseudocapacitor electrodes usually cannot retain their specific capacitance with increasing mass loading or electrode thickness because of irregular diffusion paths. In a recent paper published in this issue of Joule, Yao et al. (2019) employed a new 3D-printed graphene aerogel scaffold with ordered micropores, which enables record-high pseudocapacitive performance of MnO 2 with mass loadings up to hundreds of milligrams per square centimeter.
