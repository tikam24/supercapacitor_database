Hexagonal microrods containing MoO3 thin films are synthesized by simple, low cost and scalable chemical bath deposition approach with acidification of ammonium molybdate ([NH4]6Mo7O24·4H2O). The structural and morphological analyses are carried out through X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) respectively. Hexagonal microrods of width ~5 µm and length of ~20–50 µm are manifested in FE-SEM analysis. Supercapacitive tests of electrode are performed with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) techniques in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance of 194 Fg−1 is obtained from CV study. The energy and power densities of 7.33 Wh kg−1 and 1200 W kg−1, respectively are obtained from GCD study. An electrochemical impedance spectroscopic study is also carried out.
