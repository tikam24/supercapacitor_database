This paper presents about the efficient range of power supply and it is highly reliable for an Electric Vehicle charging system. Battery, Solar PV source, Super capacitor plays a vital role for this extended power supply. Main source of power is battery, and is connected with super capacitor during transient phase like overloading and starting. To charge the Hybrid Electric Vehicle, the Hybrid Energy Storage System(HESS) along with super capacitor and battery is widely used for improving the charging and discharging characteristics of the battery, thus increases the instantaneous output power. For the purpose of reducing the energy loss of the Battery Supercapacitor Hybrid Energy Storage System, the bidirectional DC/DC converter with the soft switching technology is mandatory. Initially, the power received from the PV array is utilized to charge the supercapacitor as well as battery. when the PV could not supply enough power to charge the EV, then the power from the battery and Supercapacitor can be utilized. System performance is also compared with and without using Supercapacitor with the help of MATLAB software.
