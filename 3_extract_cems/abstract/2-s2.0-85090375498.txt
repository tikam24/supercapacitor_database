Owing to the unique structure and outstanding intrinsic properties, such as extraordinarily high electrical conductivity and large surface area, graphene-based materials have great potential for supercapacitor applications. Graphene-based electrodes act as electrical double-layer capacitors and possess high power density and excellent cycling stability. Extensive studies have been done as well as going on in the rationalization of their structures at varying scales and dimensions, effective and low-cost synthesis techniques, design and architectures, as well as their electrochemical performance in energy storage applications. Several architectures of graphene materials like zero-dimensional particles or quantum dots, one-dimensional fibers or yarns, two-dimensional films, and three-dimensional forms are employed in supercapacitor electrodes. Therefore, this chapter provides decent and updated coverage of graphene-based materials for supercapacitor applications. The chapter mainly focuses on the synthesis, structure, properties, and supercapacitor performance of graphene-based materials according to the architectures.
