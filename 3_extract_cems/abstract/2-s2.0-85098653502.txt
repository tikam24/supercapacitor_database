In this article, the fabrication and performance of supercapacitors prepared through electrochemical reduction applied at different voltage range from polyaniline/graphene oxide (PANi/GO) thin films, which are renewable materials with an excellent yield of energy conversion is reported. The PANi/GO thin film was reduced electrochemically with different potential windows, scan rate and number of cycles which was acquired using layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method. The resultant electrodes displayed various specific capacitances after pre-reduction with different conditions.The influence of the electrochemical reduction was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for capacitance performance. The optimum conditions were explored for supercapacitor application and an elevated specific capacitance 2619 F cm-3 (areal capacitance 18.38 mF cm-2) at 1 mV s-1 obtaining the film reduced with applied potential of -0.87 to -0.5 V. This study could introduce the new possibilities for the improvement of the electrochemical reduction effects to the composite materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
