The ternary nanocomposite of silver particles decorated N/S dual-doped graphene and molybdenum disulfide microspheres (Ag-MoS2/NSG) is prepared by hydrothermal-chemical reduction method with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as additives and graphene oxide, sodium molybdate and silver nitrate as main raw materials. For comparison, the binary composites of Ag-MoS2, Ag-NSG and MoS2/NSG are also prepared and discussed. In addition, the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of GQDs are studied, and the dynamic analysis of Ag-MoS2/NSG is also carried out. Results show that the ternary composite of Ag, MoS2 and NSG can effectively prevent the lamellar superposition and agglomeration of graphene, which effectively improves the specific surface area and conductive properties of the composite. The specific capacitance of Ag-MoS2/NSG is 1124.3 F g?1 at 10 mV s?1, and the specific capacitance retention is 95.2% after 10000 constant current charge/discharge loops. The asymmetric button supercapacitor device assembled with NSG and Ag-MoS2/NSG has a maximum energy density of 82.5 Wh kg?1 (900 W kg?1).
