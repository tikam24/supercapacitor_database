Multidimensional folded structures with elasticity could provide spatial charge storage capability and shape adaptability for micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). Here, highly crumpled in-plane MSCs with superior conformality are fabricated in situ and integrated by a fixture-free omnidirectional elastic contraction strategy. Using carbon nanotube microelectrodes, a single crumpled MSC holds an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance of 9.3 F cm-3, and its total areal capacitance is 45 times greater than the initial state. Experimental and theoretical simulation methods indicate that strain-induced improvements of adsorption energy and conductance for crumpled microelectrodes are responsible for the prominent enhancement of electrochemical performance. With outstanding morphological randomicity, the integrated devices can serve as smart coatings in moving robots, withstanding extreme mechanical deformations. Notably, integration on a spherical surface is possible by using a spherical mask, in which a small area of the microdevice array (3.9 cm2) can produce a high output voltage of 100 V.
