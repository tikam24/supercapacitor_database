Hybrid-structured nanoparticles have demonstrated superior chemical, physical or electrochemical properties over a single component owing to the synergistic effects from each component. Here we report on rambutan-like cobalt molybdate@nickel cobalt sulfides (CoMoO4@Co1.5Ni1.5S4) hybrids for electrochemical energy storage which are synthesized on Ni foam by a facile hydrothermal method. CoMoO4 microspheres are directly grown on the Ni foam as the core and Co1.5Ni1.5S4 nanorods grown in sequence in shape of branches. This exceptional structure is beneficial for rapid electron transport and fast diffusion of ions owing to the existence of vast channels. Consequently, this hybrid electrode material exhibits an overall improved capacitive performance, including a high specific capacitance of 1405 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and an excellent cyclic stability (92% retained after 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1). In addition, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated which exhibits a high specific capacitance of 221.3 F g−1 collected at 1.5 A g−1, and a high energy density of 127.86 W h kg−1 is gained at a power density of 2003.88 W kg−1. After rapid charging (3 s), two such all-solid-state devices in series light a red light-emitting diode over 10 min. Thus, our work provides a remarkable candidate for energy storage and conversion devices.
