Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), as an attractive renewable natural nanomaterial, are receiving intense research interests in various fields, including energy storage. Although great progress has been achieved in the past decade, there remains some technical challenges especially in the fabrication of weavable and wearable CNFs-based energy devices. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy to prepare a strip-shaped supercapacitor (SC) of this kind, which was intrinsically inspired by the traditional Chinese bamboo weaving. To this end, CNFs were first extracted from bamboo pulp and subsequently applied to stabilize the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) aqueous suspension. After vacuum filtration of the CNFs/CNTs suspension, cutting into strips, and then in situ growth of polyaniline (PANI), a ternary hybrid strip was finally obtained. This CNTs/CNFs-PANI strip was mechanically strong and flexible. It could be directly utilized as the electrode for the assembly of strip-shaped all-solid-state SCs, which showed both high flexibility and electrochemical stability. Interestingly, such SCs could be easily woven into a fabric to form a flexible and wearable energy supply device and successfully power wearable electronics.
