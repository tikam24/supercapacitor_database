With the rapid development of flexible wearable electronic products, flexible all graphene-based supercapacitors (FGSCs) with reduced graphene oxide rGO//graphene oxide (GO)//rGO structure have attracted substantial attention due to their unique structures and energy storage mechanism. However, restricted by design idea and preparation technology, improvement of capacitance performance for the FGSCs is not obvious recently. Herein, we demonstrate that an interface integration strategy of constructing the high-performance FGSCs with compact structure. Hydroquinone (HQ)-modified rGO (HQ-rGO) films (electrode materials) and sulfuric acid-intercalated GO films (electrolyte/separator) are assembled into the FGSCs utilizing hydrogen bonding and capillary contractility. The HQ further improves the electrochemical capacitance of electrode materials. The synergistic effect of the hydrogen bonding and capillary contractility guarantees compact and stable structure of the device. The resulting FGSCs exhibit an excellent areal capacitance of 804.6 mF cm−2 (@2 mA cm−2) and 441 mF cm−2 (@30 mA cm−2), and their highest energy and power densities can achieve 109.5 μWh cm−2 and 21,060 μW cm−2, respectively. These performances are superior to other all-in-one graphene-based SCs reported. Therefore, the construction technology of the FGSCs is a promising for developing all graphene-based SCs with high-performance.
