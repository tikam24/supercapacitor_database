Supercapacitor also known as electrochemical double layer capacitor is a unique energy storage device, which bridges the gap between conventional battery and capacitor. It emerges as an alternative to batteries due to its high power density, wide thermal operating range, long cycle life and low cost. Thus, allowing its applications for various energy and power requirement. Lots of research is going on for the development of activated carbon as an electrode material for supercapacitor. To get better capacitance, it is suggested that carbon material should possess large specific surface area and small pore size. A recent method of synthesizing activated carbon is by burning dead leaves of trees at a high temperature in an inert atmosphere. Trails for development of activated carbon from dead neem tree leaves at low temperature to high temperature are presented in this paper. Such method of obtaining activated carbon can be cost effective and environmental friendly.
