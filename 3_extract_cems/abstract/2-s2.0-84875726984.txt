NiO nanomaterial was synthesized at different calcination temperatures using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant via microwave method. Thermogravimetric studies revealed the decomposition details of Ni(OH) 2 precursor. The structure and morphology of the NiO was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). NiO calcined at 300 C shows a nanoflake-like structure. A possible formation mechanism has been discussed with time evolution study. Electrochemical studies indicate that the sample calcined at 300 C exhibits better charge storage. The NiO nanoflakes exhibit maximum specific capacitance of 401 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm -2. The energy generated and hence the charges collected from wind and solar panels are slow but in many applications the power delivery has to be at a faster rate. Considering this aspect, slow-charge and fast-discharge tests have been performed and reported. The NiO nanoflakes appear to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor application.
