Due to their high power density, lengthy cyclability, quick charge-discharge rates, and environmentally friendly design, supercapacitors are incredibly effective electrochemical energy storage devices. A lot of work has been progressed in this direction to increase the specific power and cyclic stability of supercapacitor mainly by using various metal oxides with 2D composites and high concentration electrolytes. But, there are some challenging issues like low energy density, high production cost, and short cyclic life. In this work, we aimed to resolve the low energy density and operating voltage of electrodes by selecting multiphase inorganic-organic material with a suitable concentration of electrolyte. To create such supercapacitor electrodes for high energy storage applications, ZnO doped SnO2 nanoflower decorated on graphene oxide/polypyrrole nanocomposite, which are novel materials with large specific surface area and cyclic stability were studied. The electrochemical study of the nanocomposite materials is done by studying the cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance (EIS) techniques. The supercapacitor device fabrication is processed using ZS/GP2 electrode, and the analysis of supercapacitor performance is also studied. As a result, ZS/GP2 nanocomposite showed a good capacitive behavior with a maximum specific capacitance of 392 F g−1 at 75 mV s−1 scan rate with significantly high specific energy and power density of 31.6 Wh kg−1 and 5177 W kg−1, respectively after the 27,000 consecutive charge-discharge (GCD) cycles at the current density of 0.25 A g−1. The results evidence that these hybrid materials are highly promising electrode materials for energy storage applications.
