Transition metal sulfides (TMS) are of great interest as promising battery-type electrode materials, however, the poor conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics seriously limit their application. Here, we designed a hollow structured precursor of Ni-based metal-organic frameworks (Ni-MOFs) via Ostwald ripening mechanism. Based on this unique precursor, a hollow carbon-coated nickel sulfide nanocrystal (H-NiS1-X/C) with sulfur vacancies was further synthesized through an ion exchange strategy and thermal annealing. By optimizing the content of sulfur source, the sample with appropriate S-vacancies (H-NiS1-X/C-50) was developed. Benefiting from its hollow structure and S-vacancies, this H-NiS1-X/C-50 displayed a high reversible specific capacity (1728 F g−1, 1 A g−1), stable cycling (72% capacity retention over 8000 cycles) and superior rate capability. After assembling the asymmetric supercapacitor, a high energy density of 36.88 Wh kg−1 was achieved. Experimental results and DFT calculations demonstrate that introducing S-vacancies builds an embedded electric field and produces lattice distortions in H-NiS1-X/C, thus enhancing the conductivity of the material. Our strategy also provides a facile way to construct high-performance TMS with unique hollow structure and S-vacancies for developing advanced energy storage devices.
