Polyaniline nanowires were electrochemically deposited on stainless steel electrode at the potential of 0.75 V vs. SCE and characterized by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte for supercapacitive properties. A high specific capacitance of 775 F g- 1 was obtained at the sweep rate of 10 mV s- 1. A long-term cyclic stability of the polyaniline nanowires demonstrated its implications for the high performance supercapacitors. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
