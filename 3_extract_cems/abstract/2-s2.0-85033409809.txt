For the purpose of smoothing wind power fluctuations by using a batteryâ€“supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), this paper designs a novel control strategy based on a self-adaptive wavelet packet decomposition technique and a two-level power reference signal distribution method. According to the fluctuation characteristics of wind power in different output scenarios, and considering the grid regulations on wind power volatility, the proposed technique can yield wind power grid-connected values adaptively. Then, the HESS power reference signals will be given by a two-stage reasonable distribution method based on the performance characteristics and the state of charge of the HESS. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can effectively improve the performance of wind power fluctuation smoothing and ensure that the HESS works within a reasonable range to guarantee the long-term stable operation of the HESS.
