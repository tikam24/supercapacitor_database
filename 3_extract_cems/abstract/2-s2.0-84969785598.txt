Here, we report a surfactant-free electrospinning based method for the synthesis of beaded manganese oxide (Mn2O3) nanofibers and their application as supercapacitor electrodes. The beaded morphology of the fibers was confirmed through electron microscopic analysis. The highly crystalline nature and lattice strain of the fibers were verified by X-ray diffraction analysis while the chemical composition of the fibers was studied by using X-ray photoelectron and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of the Mn2O3 nanofiber electrode were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the Mn2O3 beaded nanofibers was found to be 358 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. Lattice strain-induced ionic and electronic defects enhanced the surface properties of the Mn2O3 nanofibers, thereby improving their electrochemical properties.
