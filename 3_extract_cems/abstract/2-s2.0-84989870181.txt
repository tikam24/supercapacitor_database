High-porosity MnO2 with a mesoporous structure is synthesized through a facile redox reaction, and the polypyrrole (PPy) nanofilms are grown on the synthesized mesoporous MnO2 by chemical vapor deposition to form a 3D nanocomposite structure. The as-prepared high-porosity MnO2/PPy with a nanocomposite structure presents a high specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 and a 91.4% capacitance retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. MnO2/PPy and N-doped active carbon are employed as a positive electrode and a negative electrode, respectively, to assemble an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), which exhibits a high energy density of 38.6 Wh kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and long-term cyclic stability (90.6% capacity retention after 5000 cycles). Such high-performance capacitive behavior is attributed to the high porosity, mesoporous structure, and improved electrical conductivity of the fabricated ASC, which is promising for various supercapacitor applications.
