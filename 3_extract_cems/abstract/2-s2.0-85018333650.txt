It is often reported that pseudocapacitive electrodes’ mechanical stability seriously limited their cycling performances in supercapacitors due to their quick fall off the electrode matrix during frequent fast charge/discharge process. In this work, we have demonstrated the mechanical enhancement in hierarchical NiMoO 4 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) on free-standing substrates after introducing Co 3 O 4 hierarchies. Under sonication vibration environment, the mechanical stability of Co 3 O 4 @NiMoO 4 NSAs was enhanced by ∼70% compared to that of the pure NiMoO 4 ones. Moreover, the Co 3 O 4 @NiMoO 4 NSAs can display a high specific capacitance of 1476 F g −1 at the current density of 1 A g −1 , and an excellent rate capability (keeping 81% at 20 A g −1 ). And after 2000 cycles, high capacitance retention of 96% was achieved for the Co 3 O 4 @NiMoO 4 core/shell NSAs, while only 70% for the pure NiMoO 4 ones.
