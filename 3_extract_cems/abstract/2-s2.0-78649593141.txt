The aim of this paper is to present the design and development process of a supercapacitor-based Ride-Through System (RTS) for a variable speed 10 kW drive application. The paper describes the main design aspects of the system: the storage system rating and the dc-dc converter design. Based on this design procedure, a supercapacitor-based RTS has been developed and experimentally tested validating the converter design as well as its correct performance. It has been demonstrated that the system guarantees the correct operation of the variable speed drive when voltage sags and disturbances affect the grid. Â©2010 IEEE.
