Compressible and flexible supercapacitors have aroused enormous interest of many scientific researchers for potential applications in wearable electronic products. However, the design and construction of the electrode with superior mechanical as well as electrical properties still face a lot of challenges. In present work, melamine foam/polypyrrole (MF/PPy) electrode with high deformation-tolerance and excellent electrochemical performance is prepared by in-situ interfacial polymerization of polypyrrole on commercial melamine foam, where PPy nanoparticles with size of 700 nm are uniformly anchored on the MF skeletons. The electrochemical characterizations show that the electrode exhibits excellent specific area capacitance of 2.685 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 and good cyclic stability with more than 80% of capacitance remained after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, a symmetrical aqueous supercapacitor is assembled and exhibits an excellent energy density up to 75.95 μWh cm−2 at the power density of 5.82 mW cm−2 and excellent cycling stability as the current density increases by 10 times. Even under a high strain of 70%, about 95.76% of the initial capacitance is retained after 500 consecutive compressions. These outstanding performances enable the MF/PPy composite a promising candidate for potential applications in compressible and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices.
