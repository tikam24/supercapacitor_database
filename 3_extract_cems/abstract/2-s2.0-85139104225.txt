The zeolitic imidazolate framework 67 (ZIF67) derivative is a potential active material of supercapacitors (SC), owing to high specific surface area and porosity and possible formation of cobalt compounds. A novel ZIF67 derivative is synthesized using a one-step solution process with cobalt precursor 2-methylimidazole (2-Melm) and ammonia fluoride in our previous work. Due to its facile synthesis and excellent electrocapacitive behavior, it is crucial to understand the competition between ammonia fluoride and 2-Melm on forming derivatives with cobalt ions and to create more efficient ZIF67 derivatives for charge storage. In this work, several ZIF67 derivatives are designed using a one-step solution process with 2-Melm and ammonia fluoride incorporated in different sequences. The reaction durations for a single ligand and two ligands are controlled. The largest capacity of 176.33 mAh/g corresponding to the specific capacitance of 1057.99 F/g is achieved for the ZIF67 derivative electrode prepared by reacting ammonia fluoride and a cobalt precursor for 0.5 h and then incorporating 2-Melm for another 23.5 h of reaction (NM0.5). This derivative composed of highly conductive CoF2, NiF2, Co(OH)F, and Ni(OH)F presents high specific surface area and porosity. The relevant SC presents a maximum energy density of 19.5 Wh/kg at 430 W/kg, a capacity retention of 92%, and Coulombic efficiency of 96% in 10000 cycles.
