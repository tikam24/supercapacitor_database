Nanoporous carbon hybrids with high specific surface area and pore volume have been prepared from inexpensive commercial precursors, such as nanocarbon and organosilicon polymers. The synthesized carbon hybrids were found to possess specific surface area from 916 to 1798 m2 g−1, pore volume in the range of 0.5–1.2 cc g−1, and micropore volume up to 0.804 cc g−1. Cyclic voltammetry in aqueous electrolyte indicated ideal supercapacitive behavior for certain samples. Specific capacitance in the range of 176–333 F g−1for a moderate voltage scan rate of 20 mV s−1 was observed for the carbon hybrids. The article explores a simple method for the fabrication of novel carbon hybrids with excellent porosity control and pore volume. The process can open new avenues for the fabrication of a series of novel carbon hybrids, where pore dimensions and specific surface area can be engineered with the careful selection of organosilicon polymers and process conditions.
