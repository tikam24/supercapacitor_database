Recent years have witnessed the possibility of realizing wearable electronic textiles as well as performance advances in electrical devices for incorporating high technology into daily garments. In the development of wearable electrical devices, conductive organic materials such as conducting polymers and carbon have emerged as the optimum materials for substituting conventional inorganic materials or metals. In this chapter, the efforts toward the development of highperformance conductive organic materials from their initial stages to date are described chronologically. A variety of methods for inserting electrical devices into fabric and surface treatment methods for enhancing the electrical properties of conductive organic materials are also discussed. Finally, conductive organic material-based sensors, transistors, light-emitting devices, actuators, solar cells, supercapacitors, and batteries were introduced as implementable wearable devices for electronic textiles.
