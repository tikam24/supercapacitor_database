Quickly discharged supercapacitors are often found to show voltages that increase with time ranging from minutes to several hours. People attribute this to the special structure of the supercapacitor; however, we propose an alternative explanation. A physical model was developed to explain the phenomenon and further reveal the working mechanism of supercapacitor discharge, thus providing a guide for improving the performance of supercapacitors.
