In this paper, a novel probabilistic-based prediction of Drive Cycle (DC) for an electrical vehicle has been suggested. Prediction of DC allows the pre-charging and pre-discharging of Ultra Capacitor (UC) according to the requirement of Energy Storage System (ESS). In the proposed work, a probability-based switching algorithm has been developed for the efficient utilization of batteries and the UC bank. DC has been segregated in different segments of probability density functions with finest mean and variance. Maximum probability of the vehicle falling in the particular segment of voltage, state of charge, speed, torque, and change in speed is calculated. The values of maximum probability in the different segments of the DC provided the optimum switching function of the UC bank. The switching performance of the capacitor bank has been improved by the proper mapping of drive cycle. In the proposed method, size and rating of capacitive switching bank have been reduced which reduces the cost and increases the life of bank as the switching losses are less. State of charge and voltage of the battery is being monitored with the current and voltage across the capacitor bank configuration.
