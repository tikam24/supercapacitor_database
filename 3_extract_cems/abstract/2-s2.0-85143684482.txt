In this work, highly pure nano-structured thin films of cupric oxide (CuO) were synthesized at various deposition temperatures from 250 to 400 ℃ on stainless steel substrate by spray pyrolysis. Different analytical techniques and electrochemical measurements were used to study the effect of deposition temperature on the physical and electrochemical properties of the prepared CuO material. The results showed that, along with morphological modifications, the wettability, and crystallinity of prepared polycrystalline CuO material increase with the increase in deposition temperature. Further, the enhanced specific capacitance (SC) with an increase in deposition temperature confirmed that deposition temperature affects the supercapacitive properties of the nano-structured CuO material. High specific capacitance and low internal resistance of the trapezium shape nano grain-like CuO material revealed its suitability as an impressive candidate in supercapacitor applications. The highest assessed value of SC was 3285.7 Fg−1 at 2 mVs−1 scan rate in 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The galvanostatic charge-discharge study reveals the pseodocapacitive behavior of the deposited CuO material.
