It is convinced that controllable preparation of active materials and electrode play a key role in improving the electrochemical performances. Herein, a modified hydrothermal technique focusing on assistance of counterpart through slow release feeding of metal ions is supplied by introducing a planar metal counterpart inner the hydrothermal chamber. The influence of slow release feeding rather than conventional batch-feeding of metal ions on targeted product in-situ grown on interested metal support is investigated through compositing, doping and/or possible induction effect. Moreover, anisotropic feeding of this counterpart mode supplies the possibility of oriented induction. As a result, components and morphologies, as well as structure or even crystalline are strongly depended on the counterpart kinds, or even its forms (net, foam or foil). In addition, as-prepared MxOy@M electrodes exhibit enhanced capacitance and cycling stability even with high mass loading, and their asymmetric supercapacitors also deliver good energy density and excellent cycling durability. This work supplies a new strategy in developing tuned electrodes.
