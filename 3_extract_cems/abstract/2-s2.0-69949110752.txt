The interlocked cubes of hausmannite Mn3O4 thin films were synthesized by simple, inexpensive, and low temperature chemical route from urea containing bath. These films were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), optical absorption and wettability test. From the XRD patterns, polycrystalline nature of the hausmannite Mn3O4 films has been confirmed. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the development of three dimensional growths of interlocked cubes of Mn3O4 material. FT-IR spectrum bands confirmed the formation of Mn3O4 compound. The Mn3O4 film showed a direct optical band gap with energy 2.5 eV and hydrophilicity with water contact angle of 60°. Mn3O4 film when used in supercapacitor exhibited specific capacitance of 193 F g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
