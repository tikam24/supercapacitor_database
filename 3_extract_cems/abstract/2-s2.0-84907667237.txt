Here we report a facile efficient anodization approach to fabricate nickel oxalate nanostructures on nickel foam (NON@NF). The NON@NF electrode exhibits high specific capacitance and excellent cycling performance. Moreover, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based upon NON@NF and activated carbon shows excellent performance with high energy/power density and long cycling stability.
