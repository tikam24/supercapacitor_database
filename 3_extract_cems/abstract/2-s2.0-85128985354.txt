The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter can integrate the split low-voltage small-capacity supercapacitor modules into the high-voltage high-power applications. However, the discrepancy of the supercapacitors’ parameters can lead to overcharge, and underutilization of some supercapacitors’ capacity. In this paper, the steady-state power balance in the sub-modules of a CHB with an integrated DC-DC converter scheme is studied. In this way, a power distribution control strategy for the CHB energy storage system (ESS) is proposed. MATLAB/Simulink simulation results shows the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed power distribution control strategy.
