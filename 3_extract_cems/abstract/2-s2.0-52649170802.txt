Finite field polymerization was applied to prepare carbon nanotubes-polyaniline (CNTs-PANI) composite based on coating polyaniline on the surface of the CNTs. The microstructure and component of the obtained materials were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the samples were tested by cyclic voltammogram and galvanostatic charge/discharge by assembling the materials into electrochemical supercapacitors. The results showed that PANI could symmetrically grow on the surface of the CNTs by the finite field method. The specific capacitance of the obtained composite material was about 117.7 F·g-1 (organic electrolyte) whereas the specific capacitances of the pure CNTs and the pure PANI were about 25.0 and 65.0 F·g -1 at the same conditions. All these indicated that the finite field polymerization was a promising method to prepare nano-composite. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
