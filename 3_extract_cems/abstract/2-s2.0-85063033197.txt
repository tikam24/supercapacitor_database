The role of redox additive electrolytes in supercapacitors is gaining an increased significance. The present research work, for the first time, investigates the supercapacitor performance of a rGO/TiO2 nanosheet composite (prepared via facile one step hydrothermal reaction route) electrode in combination with a redox additive electrolyte, i.e., 0.2 M K3[Fe(CN)6] in 1 M Na2SO4. The synergistic effects between the porous rGO/TiO2 nanosheet electrode and the optimized redox electrolyte have helped to achieve a significantly high specific capacitance of 1565 F/g at a current density of 3 A/g (working potential window = −0.1–0.5 V). This value of specific capacitance is much higher than achievable with the application of a plain aqueous electrolyte (e.g., 1 M Na2SO4). Furthermore, rGO/TiO2 nanosheet electrodes have been used to fabricate a symmetrical supercapacitor device which has delivered an excellent specific capacitance value of 204.5 F/g at a current density of 1.5 A/g. The device also yielded promising values of energy density (15.5 Wh/kg) and power density (1.1 kW/kg) apart from showing a long-term cyclic stability (∼87%) even after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles.
