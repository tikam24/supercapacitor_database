Partonite (VS4) - based nanostructures have recently received significant attention in electrochemical energy storage due to the intriguing physico-chemical properties emerging from their unusual crystallographic structure. Besides, the morphology, surface area, porosity, and pore size all play a crucial role in attaining a high-performance energy storage device, particularly in supercapacitors. Herein, the pristine VS4 nanostructures with various morphologies are synthesized through a simple hydrothermal method with the aid of PEG. The influence of PEG on the morphology, physicochemical properties, and electrochemical performance is discussed. Among all of these, the VS4 electrode labeled as PEG 55 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1675 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 1 M Na2SO4. The electrode delivers a good cycling performance with the capacity retention of 90% up to 5000 cycles. Moreover, the VS4 symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device delivers a high energy density of 94 Wh/kg and power density of 400 W/kg with excellent cycling stability (83.5% up to 10,000 cycles). The results demonstrate that the VS4 nanostructure could be a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
