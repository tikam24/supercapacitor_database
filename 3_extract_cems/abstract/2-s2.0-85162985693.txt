Supercapacitors have been attracting a remarkable research interest due to their outstanding intrinsic properties, such as high electrical response, great durability, and a wide range of operating temperature and voltage. In this work, the synthesis and evaluation of the electrochemical performances of graphene oxide doped with Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3@GO) and reduced graphene oxide doped with Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3@rGO) without any binder material were carried out using a low concentration (1.0 M) of KOH electrolyte. The solvothermal method of nanomaterial synthesis was employed. The produced nanomaterial was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and electrochemical characterizations. An improved performance was recorded by the electrode made of Bi2O3@rGO, which achieved 560 Fg−1 specific capacitance at 5 mVs−1 scan rate; 28 Whkg−1 and 17 kWkg−1 energy and power densities, respectively. The electrode also retained 99% of its capacitance after 3000 galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) cycles.
