In this paper, Cu2O/Cu porous granular films were prepared by electrodeposition in copper sulfate solution containing triethanolamine and in-situ oxidation strategies. The effects of the amount of triethanolamine, electrodeposition time and annealing temperature on the morphology, structure and electrochemical properties of the granular film were investigated, and the related reasons were discussed. Results show that the CV curves of the as-prepared sample have a pair of redox peaks with good symmetry and reversibility in 1 M KOH solution at a potential window from −1 to −0.2 V, corresponding to the conversion process between Cu2O and Cu. When the amount of triethanolamine is 0.2 wt%, the deposition time is 3 min, and the annealing temperature is 200 °C, the capacitance of the sample reaches the maximum value of 158.8 mF/cm2. Moreover, the sample has a good cycling stability with 85.9% of its original capacitance value after 3000 cycles.
