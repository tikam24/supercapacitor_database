This paper presents a new integrated RF energy harvesting system using a rectifier with reconfigurable stages. The design replaces the diode-connected transistors used in conventional RF-DC rectifiers with diode-emulated transistors for minimizing conduction losses. In addition, a voltage feedback loop is employed to regulate the output voltage at the main load. Extra available power is provided to a secondary storage unit (supercapacitor). The system is implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology, and circuit simulations show that the proposed design achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 29% at 0dbm input power, and a load regulation of 10mV.
