Energy storage technology facilitates the joint operation of wind power-electric boiler-energy sto-rage system, and the hybrid energy and power storage systems can satisfy the technical and economic requirements of wind farms and electric boilers. The mathematical model of the hybrid energy storage system and the wind farm is established. In this model, the lithium batteries use universal controlled voltage sources and fixed internal resistance series model. An improved first-order RC model is adopted for supercapacitor. In addition, the wind power model considers the decoupling control of active and reactive power through power decoupling method. Based on this, an energy storage system control model for multi-objective operation of wind power and electric boiler is developed, in which the technical and economic constraints of wind farm, electric boiler and hybrid energy storage system are considered, and the local wind power accommodation, the adjustment times of electric boiler's tap position, and the service life of energy storage system are included in the objective functions. The flexible tolerance polyhedron approach is utilized to solve this model. The feasibility and practicability of this approach in optimizing the combined operation of wind power and electric boiler are verified by a demonstration project. Under pre-specified setting of parameters, the energy storage system increases the accommodation of wind power by 5.36 % and decreases the control times of electric boiler by 8 times per day.
