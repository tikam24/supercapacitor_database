The typical physical and chemical properties lead the nanomaterials to breakthrough in the field of energy storage especially, supercapacitor applications. The optimization of electrical conductivity, structural flexibility, band gap and charge carrier mobility are the key point to solve the issues in the electrochemical charge storage mechanism of supercapacitor. The semiconducting heterostructured nanomaterials are the best choice to store energy by near-surface ion adsorption along with additional contribution from fast reversible faradic reactions. The creation of active sites and defects in the grain boundary of the heterostructure materials results in multiple redox activity, superior ionic conductivity and short diffusion path. Therefore, sufficient researches enrooted to the doped and nano heterostructure electrode materials needs to be performed in order to exploit the high power and energy storage applications. This article reviews current trends in the synthesis of heterostructure electrode through hybridization of different electrochemical double layer capacitance (EDLC) and pseudocapacitive materials. This article also emphasize on the effect of doping on the electrode possessing both EDLC as well as the pseudocapacitance. In addition, the advantages of superlattice structure for the superior electrochemical properties are also discussed.
