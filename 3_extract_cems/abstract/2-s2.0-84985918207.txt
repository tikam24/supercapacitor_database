In this paper, one-dimensional Ni3V2O8 nanofibers with interconnected nanoparticals was synthesized by a simple and efficient electrostatic spinning technique and subsequent annealing process. X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to systematically characterize the crystal structures and morphology of Ni3V2O8 nanofibers.The experimental results confirmed that the pure Ni3V2O8 was obtained.The FESEM and TEM results show that Ni3V2O8 powder possesses 1D nanostructures with diameters varying from 200 to 300 nm and has a narrow partical size distribution ranging from 20 to 25 nm.The electrochemical measurements indicate that the Ni3V2O8 nanofibers have a ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1 152 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, 1 345 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, and excellent cycling stability (the retention 84.08% of initial specific capacitance after 2 000 cycles at 2 A/g). The unique structure of Ni3V2O8 nanofibers can enhance mechanical stability and electrochemical properties including electrical/ionic conductivity.Therefore, Ni3V2O8 nanofibers can be proposed as a promising electrode material for high-performance faradaic pesudocapacitance.
