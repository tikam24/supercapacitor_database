A series of graphene oxide (GO)/lanthanum titanate (La2Ti2O7, LTO) fiber composites were prepared through a hydrothermal method. The LTO fibers were homogeneously dispersed between the GO sheets. The structure and micromorphology of the GO/LTO composites were systematically studied. The composite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 900.6 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 in the 1 M H2SO4 and 10 wt % sucrose aqueous solution as the electrolyte. With the extended potential window of 1.8 V, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor device delivered a maximum energy density of 94.0 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 750.1 W kg-1. The GO/LTO composites could be promising materials for energy storage.
