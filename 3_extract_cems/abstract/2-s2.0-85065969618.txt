This paper presents energy control of a battery powered Electric Vehicle (EV) with the aid of Ultra Capacitor (UC). Induction motor powered EV is fed by the battery through the buck boost converter and inverter with New European standard Driving Cycle (NEDC). A 48V battery and 300F UC is connected to the motor load of excitation of 200 V through a 5kW bi-directional buck boost converter. The voltage profile of the load is controlled by Reset-Set-Track (RST) controller thereby controlling the load torque profile. Energy flow to load is from both battery and UC with power management, which limits the battery current requirement and hence improves the battery performance. Results show that the voltage regulation of battery is improved from 4.8% to 1.8 % by the compensation of voltage sag of load with the aid of UC and the State Of Charge (SOC) is increased by4.2% over a period of2 hours. Peak power management is also improved by monitoring the load profile. Simulation has been done using MATLAB/SIMULINK.
