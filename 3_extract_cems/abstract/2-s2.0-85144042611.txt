Assembly of battery-type supercapacitor hybrid device (BSHD) using capacitive electrode and battery-type electrode is considered as a reliable way. In this work, honeycomb-like nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide/polymethylene blue/carbon cloth (NiCo-LDH/PMB/CC) composite electrode materials with hierarchical structure have been synthesized via two-step electrodeposition. While providing a handful of specific capacitance for the composite, PMB nanospheres offer rich active sites for growth of NiCo-LDH. In addition, the morphology and electrochemical performance of NiCo-LDH/PMB/CC are dominated by mole ratios of Ni/Co. At the mole ratio of Ni/Co = 3/1, NiCo-LDH/PMB/CC-31 displays excellent specific capacity of 1075 C g− 1 at 1 A g− 1 and maintains 70.6% at ultra-high current density of 40 A g− 1. The assembled BSHD, constructed with NiCo-LDH/PMB/CC-31 as cathode and activated carbon as anode, displays outstanding specific energy of 40.7 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 808.4 W kg−1 and prominent capacity retention (89.7% after 2000 cycles). Notably, the assembled BSHD still achieves specific energy of 25.0 Wh kg−1 at 12.0 kW kg−1, which demonstrates decent specific energy of it at high specific power.
