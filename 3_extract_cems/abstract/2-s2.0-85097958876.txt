Supercapacitors (SCs) can bridge the gap between batteries and conventional capacitors, playing a critical role as an efficient electrochemical storage device in intermittent renewable energy sources. Transition metal-based electrode materials have been investigated extensively as a class of electrode materials for SC application, but they have some limitations due to the sluggish ion/electron diffusion and inferior electronic conductivity, restricting their electrochemical performances towards energy storage. Developing advanced transition metal-based electrode materials is crucial for high energy density along with high specific power and fast charging/discharging rates towards high performance SCs. In this review, we highlight the state-of-the-art of transition metal-based electrode materials (transition metal oxides and their composites, transition metal sulfides and their composites, and transition metal phosphides and their composites), focusing on specific morphologies, components, and power characteristics. We also provide future prospects for transition metal-based electrode materials for SCs and hope this review will shed light on the achievement of higher performance and hold great promise in vast applications for future energy storage and conversion.
