Polyaniline-tungsten oxide nanocomposite onto anodized graphene oxide nanosheets (PANI-WO3/GO NSs)/graphite electrode was easily fabricated by pulse reverse co-electrodeposition of polyaniline and tungsten oxide nanocomposite onto previously anodized graphene oxide nanosheets/graphite electrode. SEM as well as BET investigations proved that the PANI-WO3 nanocomposite with high surface area was uniformly co-electrodeposited onto the anodized graphene oxide nanosheets/graphite electrode. The supercapacitive performance of the PANI-WO3/GO NSs/graphite electrode was carefully evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical measurements confirmed the WO3 and polyaniline possess synergistic effect in capacitive behavior of the modified electrode and the other hand graphene oxide nanosheets with high surface area increase adhesion of PANI-WO3 nanocomposite to the graphite electrode, leading to significant supercapacitive activity and long cyclic life. The PANI-WO3/GO NSs/graphite electrode showed remarkable specific capacitance of about 677 F g−1, a superb energy density of 61.1 mWh g−1 and an appropriate power density of 200 mW g−1 at a current density of 2.0 A g−1 in 1.0 M aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. The all solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device based on PANI-WO3/GO NSs/Graphite electrodes and PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte displayed 82% specific capacitance retention upto 1000 continuous charge–discharge cycles.
