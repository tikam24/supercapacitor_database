The establishment of isolated microgrid including wind power, storage and seawater desalination load is of significant important to the use of renewable energy and the supply of fresh water resources in island region. A real-time simulation platform based on PXI and PC is built to test the operation and control of the isolated microgrid. The construction of the real-time simulation platform and the digital simulation model is introduced respectively. A coordinated control scheme of the microgrid is discussed in detail. It makes use of the controllability of seawater desalination load, coordinates supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery energy storage so as to maintain the balance and stability of isolated microgrid. Finally, the simulation results show that the feasibility of the proposed coordinated control scheme.
