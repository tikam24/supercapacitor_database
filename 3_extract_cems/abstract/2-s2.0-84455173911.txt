RuO2-CeO2/Ti electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition, taking RuCl3 and CeCl3 as raw material, ethanol as solvent and Ti slide as substrate. The microstructures were investigated by means of XRD, SEM and HRTEM. The supercapacitive properties were examined by cyclic voltammetric and chronopotentiometry measurements. The results showed that the highest specific capacitance was obtained in the electrodes prepared at 300°C, and the electrodes at higher or lower sintering temperature had lower specific capacitances. It is indicated that the capacitive properties of the Ti/RuO2-CeO2 electrodes were influenced by their microstructures. The unstable or well developed structure of the oxides was not good for the supercapacitor performance of the electrodes. In the electrodes prepared at 300°C, the amorphous structure with nanocrystals could be found. This kind of microstructure had more electroactive points and lager electrochemical roughness.
