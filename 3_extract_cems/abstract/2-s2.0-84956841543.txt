Hydrogenated barium titanate films show enhancement of the double layer capacitance and therefore can be employed as electrolytes in the all-solid-state supercapacitors. This behavior was attributed to the accumulation of protons at the metal-electrolyte interface over a Debye length (capacitive double layer). Electrical measurements were carried out on hydrogenated layers (BaTiO3:H) and tri-layer stack (BaTiO3/Ba TiO3:H/BaTiO3) to study the active defects at the origin of the conduction mechanisms.
