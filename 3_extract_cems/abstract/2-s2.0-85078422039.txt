Ni/Co composite oxide with varying composite proportions were prepared by coprecipitation method. The structure, morphology and electrochemical properties of Ni/Co composite oxides with varying composite ratio were studied. The XRD results showed that the Co element was uniformly compounded with NiO, and the crystallinity of the composite decreases with the increase of Co content. SEM results showed that the Ni/Co composite oxide had petal-like morphology and larger specific surface area. Electrochemical tests results showed that the electrode with the ratio of Ni to Co 7:3 had the best electrical properties, the highest specific capacity, the best cycle stability and the lowest resistance at the same current density, which fully reflected the excellent cyclic stability and high rate performance.
