Porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as promising materials for electrochemical devices on account of their diverse functional groups and morphologies. Herein, we describe a one-pot two-step synthesis of redox-active and permeable POPs as uniformly shaped fibrils with homogeneous micropores and hierarchical mesoporous channels. Owing to the high fraction of redox-active groups and porous structure, the active material (PI-Fiber) exhibited a high charge capacity of 83.3 mA h g−1 over 0.5 V even at a current density of 75 A g−1, a coulombic efficiency of over 95%, and stability to endure nearly 10 000 cycles. Additionally, high energy and power densities were observed in a two-electrode cell, indicating that PI-Fiber can be adapted for pseudocapacitive energy storage systems. Therefore, our work illustrates that a novel molecular design, supramolecular assembly, and hierarchical architecture of POPs can aid the development of novel and versatile energy-storage materials.
