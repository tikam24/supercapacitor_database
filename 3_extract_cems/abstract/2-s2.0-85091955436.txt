Many studies on symmetric capacitors have been extensively conducted. Not only the specific capacitance and energy density, but release rate energy are also necessary. Thus, continuous research is needed to improve capacitor performance by modifying ZnONP (nanoparticles) to ZnONR (nanorods) because the surface area of ZnONR is higher than ZnONP so that the interaction performance may increase. The spin coating speed needed to find out the appropriate ZnONR levels and morphology influencing supercapacitor performance. This research is focused on the influence of spin coating speed on the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of ZnONR/Aluminum foil electrodes. The deposited content, microstructure, and morphology of ZnONR are strongly influenced by the coating process. ZnONP coating on the surface of the substrate was carried out at a spin coater speed of 1500, 2500, and 3000 rpm. As the spin-coating speed increases, the porosity also increases, while the size of the grain, crystallinity, and specific capacitance reduce. Therefore, the best performance is shown by the lowest speed of 1500 rpm with the condition show ZnONR more deposited, and porosity, the highest cycle stability, and the specific capacitance reach to 0.0086 F/g with energy density 0.00433 Wh/g.
