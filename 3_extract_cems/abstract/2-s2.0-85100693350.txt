Smart or electronic textile (e-textile), integrated with functional electronics, holds great promise for applications as fashionable/stylish wearable electronics. This chapter overviews the fundamentals of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), followed by a summary of the progress in textile TENGs. Nearly all materials have the triboelectrification effect, such as metals, ceramics, polymers, or natural leathers, wools, cottons, cellulose, and silks. By far, textile TENGs fabricated by weaving, knitting, and sewing processes have all been reported. Supercapacitor yarns can be sewed, knitted, or woven in common fabrics, so a single textile can possess two functions of both energy harvesting and storage. The chapter also discusses 1D fiber or yarn, 2D fiber, 3D orthogonal woven structures for TENGs. A few washing experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the washing durability of textile TENGs. As for the conductive coatings of electrodes, it is expected that metal wires and electroless-coated metal coatings are durable to washing.
