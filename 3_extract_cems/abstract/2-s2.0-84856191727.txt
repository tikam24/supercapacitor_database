Electricity plays a vital role in our day to day life and also there is a great demand for electricity today. Transmission losses are also one of the reasons for this demand. Since transmission is a main part of the power system it should be more efficient. During transmission there is a loss of 30%. To eliminate these losses we need a new technique which is called recent trend. The recent trend for efficient transmission of power is the "wireless power transmission system". This paper exposes a new method for wireless power transmission using EM waves that comprises a transmitter and receiver in which we get a transmission efficiency of 95%. The receiver does not require an independent power source and it is comprised of an optical feedback to the transmitter and does not require a separate communication channel to the transmitter. The transmitter uses the optical feedback to locate and track the receiver. The transmitter can optionally employ a macro adjusters and micro adjusters that direct the beam onto the receiver for optimal power transmission. The system also optionally has a tight loop beam detector to enhance the safety of the system. Either the receiver or transmitter may also encode data on the energy transmission, resulting in oneway or two-way data transmission.
