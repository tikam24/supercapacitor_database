In the article the main approaches to calculation the nominal capacity of the supercapacitor module of energy storage for variable frequency asynchronous electric drives are discussed. A brief overview of the known procedures for calculating the nominal capacity of the module, both without taking into account and taking into account the power losses in the elements of the electric drive, is given. An example of determining the capacity of a supercapacitor module for a frequency-controlled asynchronous electric drive with a variable cyclic load is described. Energy expressions are given. The problem of accounting for losses in the elements of an electric drive is discussed. Variants of approximate calculation of power losses and the idea of an iterative procedure for a more accurate calculation of capacity are proposed.
