Size and shape-selective Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials have been synthesized for the first time using a simple hydrothermal route by the reaction of Sn(ii) chloride salt with sodium molybdate in CTAB micellar media under stirring at 60 °C temperature for about three hours. Needle-like and flake-like Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials were synthesized by optimizing the CTAB to metal salt molar ratio and by controlling other reaction parameters. The eventual diameter and length of the nanoneedles are ∼100 ± 10 nm and ∼850 ± 100 nm respectively. The average diameter of the flakes is ∼250 ± 50 nm. The synthesized Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials can be used in two potential applications, namely, catalytic reduction of nitroarenes and as an anodic material in electrochemical supercapacitors. From the catalysis study, it was observed that the Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials could act as a potential catalyst for the successful photochemical reduction of nitroarenes into their respective aminoarenes within a short reaction time. From the supercapacitor study, it was observed that the Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials of different shapes show different specific capacitance (Cs) values and the highest Cs value was observed for Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials having a flake-like morphology. The highest Cs value observed was 109 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 for the flake-like Sn(MoO4)2 nanomaterials. The capacitor shows an excellent long cycle life along with 70% retention of the Cs value, even after 4000 consecutive cycles at a current density of 8 mA cm-2. Other than the applications in catalysis and supercapacitors, the synthesized nanomaterials can find further applications in photoluminescence, sensor and other energy-related devices.
