Porous N-doped carbon nanomaterials have great potential in supercapacitor owing to their high surface area, excellent chemical stability and good hydrophilic property. In this work, ZIF-8 nanocystals were well grown on the surface of polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide composite (ZIF-8/PPy/rGO). After carbonization of ZIF-8/PPy/rGO and chemical etching of the product, a porous carbon with N-doping (PNC) and proper structure was obtained. In comparison with the carbonized ZIF-8 and PPy/rGO, the ZIF-8/PPy/rGO derived carbon possesses much higher electrochemical performance. As electrodes in supercapacitor, the PNC exhibits a significantly enhanced specific capacitance (236 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), superior rate capability (retained 86.1 % from 1 to 20 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (over 96.8% capacity retained after 10000 cycles), exhibiting its potential for electrode materials with high performance.
