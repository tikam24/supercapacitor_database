This paper reports and analyses experimental results showing the performances of two state-of-the art, commercially available storage systems, adequate for use onboard hybrid vehicles, i.e. a supercapacitor (SC) and a super-high power lithium battery. The two devices were subjected to specific experimental tests adequate to ease comparisons for use onboard hybrid vehicles. The results are expressed mainly in terms of specific power and charge/discharge efficiency as a function of the wanted discharge time; they show that, if future cycle efficiency analyses do not reverse the result, very high power lithium batteries are a very competitive candidate for use as onboard storage within hybrid vehicles, when storage of a single technology are considered.
