Abstract: The current era focuses not only on producing solar energy but also preserving it for future use. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and supercapacitors (SC) are such energy-based devices. DSSCs capture the solar energy and SCs store this captured energy. A natural anthocyanin dye extracted from Garcinia indica (kokum fruit) was used in the DSSCs. SnO2, one of the promising electrode materials for DSSC, was synthesized via a microwave technique. Blend polymer electrolytes (BPE) were prepared through a solution casting technique. A polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) blend with varying concentrations of potassium iodide, along with iodine dopant, was prepared as a BPE electrolyte composition. The best of the PVA-PVP/KI composition was chosen using Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Varying the temperature, the dielectric and conductivity study of the chosen composition was studied in detail. A fast/single-step synthesis technique, namely a laser-engraved approach, was used for few-layer graphene synthesis. This graphene serves as a common platform for the DSSC-SC integrated device: as a counter electrode in DSSC and graphene-graphene symmetric electrode in SC. A DSSC-SC integrated device was fabricated and characterized using various analytical and microscopy techniques. The integrated device showed a 0.42 fill factor and 0.56% efficiency. The discharge time for integrated DSSC-SC cells was found to be increased threefold. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
