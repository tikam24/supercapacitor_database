Nitrogen doped hollow carbon spheres (NHCSs) with tunable surface morphology have been prepared through one-pot carbonization method by using melamine-formaldehyde spheres as template and resorcinol-based resin as carbon precursor in ethanol-water solution. Well-dispersed NHCSs with particle size of 800 nm were obtained and the surface of NHCSs turn from smooth to tough, wrinkled, and finally concave by increasing the ethanol concentration. The fabricated NHCSs possessed high nitrogen content (3.99–4.83%) and hierarchical micro-dual mesoporous structure with surface area range of 265–405 m 2 g −1 and total pore volume of 0.18–0.29 cm 3 g −1 , which contributed to high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and long cycle life.
