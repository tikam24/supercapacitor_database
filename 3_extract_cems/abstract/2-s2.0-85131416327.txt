Construction of multi-component composite electrode materials with unique hierarchical structures is an effective method to manufacture high-performance hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs). In this study, carbon-incorporated multiple metal sulfides-based composite with three-dimensional hierarchical core-shell structure directly grown on the Ni foam (Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S@Co9S8–C/NF) was successfully prepared. The Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S@Co9S8–C combining with Co9S8–C nanoparticles anchored on the substrate of Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S possesses the unique structures of nanoflake and nanospine. The Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S@Co9S8–C/NF electrode with heterogeneous composition and carbon incorporation demonstrates a hierarchical structure. Such features can offer more exposed active sites and redox reactions, and to an extent, it will enhance the electrochemical conductivity, and supply more efficient transfer of charge and ions. As a consequence, the Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S@Co9S8–C/NF exhibits a high specific capacity of 2.16 C cm−2 (617.14C g−1) at 4 mA cm−2 and satisfactory rate performance (76.85% capacity retention from 4 to 20 mA cm−2). Additionally, the assembled Ni3S2@Mn–Co–S@Co9S8–C//active carbon HSC device delivers a maximum energy density of 47.6 Wh kg−1at 805.5 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (92.41% capacity retention after 5000 cycles). Such work may provide an attainable strategy to engineer self-standing carbon-incorporated multiple metal sulfides-based electrodes with unique compositions and nanostructures for high-performance HSC devices.
