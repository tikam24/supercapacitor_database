Reduced graphene nanosheets/Fe2O3 nanorods (GNS/Fe2O3) composite has been fabricated by a hydrothermal route for supercapacitor electrode materials. The obtained GNS/Fe2O3 composite formed a uniform structure with the Fe2O3 nanorods grew on the graphene surface and/or filled between the graphene sheets. The electrochemical performances of the GNS/Fe 2O3 hybrid supercapacitor were tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Comparing with the pure Fe 2O3 electrode, GNS/Fe2O3 composite electrode exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance of 320 F g-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and an excellent cycle-ability with capacity retention of about 97% after 500 cycles. The simple and cost-effective preparation technique of this composite with good capacitive behavior encourages its potential commercial application.Â© 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.
