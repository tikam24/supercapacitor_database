Supercapacitors are energy storage devices known for their long life charge-discharge cycling stability, highly reversible charge storage ability, and high power density. Carbon nanomaterials, particularly carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been recognized as promising active materials due to their outstanding conductivity and large surface area, the two key requirements of superior supercapacitor electrode materials. Moreover, the compositesof these nanomaterials and different conducting polymers (CPs) are borne out to be even more promising for that purpose. The present article provides a critical review of conducting composites made of the fullerene-based polymers belonging to the redox conducting polymers (RCP), the aniline, pyrrole and thiophene π-electron polymers of the electronically conducting polymers (ECPs) family and CNTs- and/or graphene-based structured nanomaterials. Specific capacitance values up to ∼900 F g-1 were reported for some nanocarbon/CP composites indicating that they can be considered as future electrode materials for constructing charge storage devices. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.
