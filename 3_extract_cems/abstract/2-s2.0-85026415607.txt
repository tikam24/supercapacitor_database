An urgent task is to develop new methods of obtaining porous carbon materials with required complex of properties of cheap raw materials, for example, wastes of mechanical and chemical wood processing. This article deals with the subject of production of activated carbon for supercapacitors with different electrolytes. Activated carbons produced from two wood species, birch and alder, were compared. For both carbons identical dependences of the porous structure and electrochemical parameters of the carbons on activation conditions were determined in a wide range of activation parameters (temperature, alkali/carbon mass ratio). The work was done on the basis of commercial coals of alder. The correlations between the activation parameters of coal (temperature of activation and the relationship of the activator/raw materials), porous structure and functional parameters of capacitors were established. It was established that the acceptable value of the temperature of activation for aqueous electrolyte was 600 °C, and the ratio of activator/ raw = 1.25, for organic - 600 °C, the ratio of the activator/raw = 2. A comprehensive study of carbon properties was conducted including a detailed study of the porous structure by the method of limited evaporation and electrochemical parameters of activated carbon in the composition of the supercapacitors. Assumptions were made on the features of formation of porous structure of activated carbons obtained by thermo-chemical synthesis using alkali as an activator, and on the influence of synthesis parameters on the electrochemical characteristics of the supercapacitors.
