Developing novel techniques to convert lignin into sustainable chemicals and functional materials is a critical route toward the high-value utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. Lignin-derived carbon materials hold great promise for applications in energy and chemical engineering, catalysis and environmental remediation. In this review, the state-of-art sciences and technologies for controllable synthesis of lignin-derived carbon materials are summarized, pore structure engineering, crystalline engineering, and morphology controlling methodologies are thoroughly outlined and critically discussed. Green chemical engineering with cost-effectiveness and precise carbonization tuning microstructure are future research trends of lignin-derived carbon materials. Future research directions that could be employed to advance lignin-derived carbon materials toward commercial applications are then proposed.
