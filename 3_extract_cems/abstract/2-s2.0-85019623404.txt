NiMoO 4 nanoparticles and quantum dots were uniformly distributed on the surface of reduced nanohole graphene oxide (rNHGO). NiMoO 4 @rNHGO exhibited a higher specific capacitance and better cycling stability than NiMoO 4 @reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which were attributed to the large surface area and high electrical conductivity. NiMoO 4 nanoparticles and quantum dots (QDs) had high surface to volume ratio, which would not result in change in volume during the electroâ€“chemical operation and induced better supercapacitor performance. Moreover, synergistic effect between NiMoO 4 and the rNHGO also improved undoubtedly high specific capacitance and cycle stability.
