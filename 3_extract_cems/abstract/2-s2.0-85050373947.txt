Flexible materials have drawn considerable attention due to the demand for wearable and flexible electronic products. Seeking new kinds of precursors for preparing carbon nanofibers with good flexibility for high-performance supercapacitors is a hot issue. In this work, a flexible polypyrrolone (BBB)/polyimide (PI) composite-based carbon nanofiber membrane (PBPICF) is prepared by a facile electrospinning and carbonization process. The PBPICF membranes exhibit a three-dimensional (3D) porous, fluffy and self-standing structure with good mechanical performance and flexibility, and can be arbitrarily bent and folded. PBPICF-65-35 (consisting of BBB (65 wt%) and PI (35 wt%)) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 172.44 F g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution, which is two-fold more than that of commercial polyacrylonitrile-based carbon nanofibers. In addition, PBPICF-65-35 also displays good power density (90 W kg-1) and energy density (19.4 W h kg-1), and the capacitance remains at 96% even after 10000 cycles at 1.0 A g-1. Therefore, the simple preparation and good capacitance performance of PBPICFs make them a promising binder-free electrode for wearable supercapacitors.
