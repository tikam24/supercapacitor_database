A novel flexible nanoarchitecture is fabricated via the facile electrophoresis of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) network on carbon nanotube (CNT)-Fe3O4 film for supercapacitor electrode applications. The interconnected networks of graphene with large specific surface area (248.4 m2 g−1) improve the diffusion of the electrolyte ions into the electrode. The resulting supercapacitor exhibits a high specific energy density of 36.7 Wh kg−1, specific capacitance of 275.6 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent cyclic stability with only 7.1% loss of its initial specific capacitance after 10000 change-discharge cycles. These results suggest that such CNT-Fe3O4-rGO composite is very promising for next generation high-performance supercapacitors.
