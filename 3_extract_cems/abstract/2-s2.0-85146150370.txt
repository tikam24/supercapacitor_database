As a promising energy storage matter, two-dimensional (2D) layered double hydroxides (LDHs) suffer from a lower specific capacitance and poor retention. Morphology engineering is deemed to be an effective means. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) nickel-vanadium hydrotalcite (NiV-LDHs) with ball-flower structure are synthesized successfully via a facile dynamic-refluxing route, such a green strategy dispenses with template and high pressure, and generates a specific surface area as high as 61.6 m2/g. Then, the screen-printed inks with outstanding rheological performances are formulated and the resulting electrodes display superior hydrophilic performance. Benefitted from the 3D architecture and shear-flow process, the NiV-LDHs electrode can deliver an enhanced specific capacitance of 1069 F/g at 1 A/g with cycling stability of ∼68.0 % after 1500 cycles at 20 A/g, in contrast with that of NiV-LDHs prepared by coprecipitation (848 F/g and ∼5.1 %). Furthermore, an asymmetric NiV-LDHs//activated carbon supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled, which can yield a remarkable energy density of 75.8 μWh/cm2 at a power density of 0.80 mW/cm2, and two ASCs in series can illuminate a red light (2.5 V) for more than 270 s. Therefore, this study proposes a facile and economic strategy to prepare 3D nanomaterial for advanced and flexible printable energy storage devices.
