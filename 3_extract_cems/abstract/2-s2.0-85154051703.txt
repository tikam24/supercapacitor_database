Electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs) based on nanostructured materials with high energy storage, fast charge and discharge rate, and long-term cycle life are globally required for energy storage applications. In the present study, we prepared cubic spinel manganese cobalt oxide (MnCo2O4) by simple hydrothermal method. The optimized MnCo2O4 (MCO-8) reveals highly porous chestnut microsphere-like surface morphology. The Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analysis illustrates the specific surface area of 39.25 m2 g−1. The MnCo2O4 electrode demonstrates an outstanding electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 248.16 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, good rate performance, and cycling stability of 93.8% after 2000 cycles. The present work provides a promising route to develop high-energy storage electrodes for energy storage devices.
