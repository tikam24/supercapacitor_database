Supercapacitors exhibit a self-sensing phenomenon with voltage sensitivity under mechanical effects. This paper proposes a dynamic model that reveals the mechanism of this sensitivity phenomenon. During a mechanical process such as an extreme impact or a finger press, transient changes of the coupled micro-deformation, porosity and output voltage of the supercapacitors are simulated, and the relationship between change in voltage and strength of the mechanical impacts is obtained. In particular, the experimental phenomenon that the output signal of the supercapacitors under extreme effects exhibits few clutters is theoretically explained and simulated. Finally, for the application of electronic skin and wearable electronics, the self-sensing characteristics of the supercapacitors under finger pressing are experimentally studied, and the ability to perceive the magnitude and duration of pressing is verified. This work provides a strong theoretical foundation for designing self-sensing supercapacitors with superior performance and expands their applications under various mechanical effects, from electronic skin to car crash protection.
