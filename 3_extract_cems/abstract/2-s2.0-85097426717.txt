The main goal of AGROinLOG is the demonstration of Integrated Biomass Logistic Centres (IBLC) for food and non-food products, evaluating their technical, environmental and economic feasibility. The project is based on agro-industries, which are willing to deploy new business lines in their facilities, opening new markets in bio-commodities (energy, transport and manufacturing purposes) and intermediate bio-products (transport and biochemicals). More specifically, this work is focused on a fodder industry, whose main activity is related to the dehydration of wheat straw and corn stalk to produce animal bedding and feeding. The object of this study is the evaluation of two biomass-based materials (i.e. wheat straw and corn stalk) to determine the potential of these feedstock as raw materials for the synthesis of activated carbons (ACs) and their further application as supercapacitors.
