This paper reports the preliminary experimental evaluation of a four wheel motors series hybrid prototype equipped with an internal combustion engine coupled to a generator and an energy recovery system (batteries plus ultracapacitors). The paper analyses global efficiency (energy dissipated to overcome the dissipative forces on energy dissipated in fuel), autonomy in electric configuration, and the efficiency of the regenerative braking system. The tests were carried out in a test cell equipped with a chassis dynamometer. The tests were performed according to the current regulated procedures. A constant speed test was performed in order to evaluate the autonomy of the vehicle in the electric configuration. The results show that the real tank to wheels efficiency is about 30% for HOST as a series hybrid and 79% for HOST as an electric vehicle. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
