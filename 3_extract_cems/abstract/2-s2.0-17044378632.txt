Aerogel supercapacitors are used as energy storage devices in digital subscriber line (DSL) modems, offering advantages over larger and less reliable energy storage technologies. The supercapacitor offers a very high capacitance in a small package, and stores energy using static charge/discharge. It is based on carbon aerogel as its active electrode material. Preventing interruption between the modem and the central office, aerogel supercapacitors are designed to provide continuous power to the modem until it is able to safely power down.
