The electrochemical performances of resorcinol-formaldehyde-based carbon aerogels can be significantly enhanced by nitric acid activation.FT-IR spectra and SEM images reveal the constitution and morphology of samples.The electrochemical performances of materials were tested by cyclic voltammetry,galvanostatic charge/discharge test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic test. The results show that activation does not influence the molecular structure of carbon aerogels,which maintains their nano-porous structure. Activation increases the specific capacitance by 50% and improves the conductivity of carbon aerogels,resulting in fenfect cycling stability. So nitric acid activated carbon aerogels is an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
