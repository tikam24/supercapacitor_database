MoS2 with different morphologies were synthesized via hydrothermal method by using different types of surfactants (CTAB, SDBS or PVP), and ammonium molybdate and thiourea as molybdenum and sulfur sources, respectively. The characterization for microstructure and morphology of the products by XRD, Raman, SEM and TEM showed that the shape and size of MoS2 could be controlled by altering the surfactants in the reaction system. Electrochemical performance determinations, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), indicated that the shape and size of MoS2 had a remarkable influence on its capacitive performance. The MoS2 nanosheets synthesized with the presence of SDBS possessed a high specific capacitance of 221.2 F/g and a stable capacitance retention of 148 F/g after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A/g, suggesting good cycling stability. Therefore, the MoS2 nanosheets will be a suitable candidate for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
