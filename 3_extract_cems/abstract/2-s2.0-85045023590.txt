Nanosheet-like tungsten diselenide (WSe2)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid has been developed for the first time by facile one-step hydrothermal route for supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical measurements show that the WSe2/rGO-based supercapacitor electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 389 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with capacitance retention of 98.7% after 3000 charge/discharge cycles at a high current density of 7 A g−1, and delivered a energy density of 34.5 W h kg−1 at 400 W kg−1 and 22.4 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 4000 W kg−1.
