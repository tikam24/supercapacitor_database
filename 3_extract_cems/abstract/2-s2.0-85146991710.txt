In this study, the mixed Niâ€“Zn nanoparticle's noteworthy shape is attained using a solvothermal reflux technique. The distinctive crystalline spinel cubic structure, morphology with the correct stoichiometric element ratio, and surface analysis was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. A three-electrode device was used to confirm the electrochemical properties of the materials as they were produced. Electrochemical performances attest to the electrode material's electrochemical behavior. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) techniques are used to investigate the electrochemical performance in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The Ni0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 (ZNF3) electrode performs better than the other electrodes such as Ni0.9Zn0.1Fe2O4 and Ni0.8Zn0.2Fe2O4 (ZNF1 and ZNF2) electrodes in terms of specific capacitance (Cs), measuring 152 F/g, at a current density (CD) of 2 A/g. The study of the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve revealed that the ZNF3 electrode had a higher photocurrent density.
