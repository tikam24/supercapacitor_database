Electrochemical energy storage using pseudocapacitors employs fast reversible surface faradaic redox reactions to provide high performance renewable energy devices at very low cost. In this study, perovskite type oxide LaCoO 3 (LCO) nanoparticles are synthesized by co-precipitation method. The structural and morphological study of the sample are analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical performance of LCO as an active material for supercapacitor is appraised by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The sample displays maximum specific capacitance of 532.55 Fg -1 at scan rate 10 mVs -1 . The excellent performance of LaCoO 3 electrode offers great promise for high performance pseudocapacitor.
