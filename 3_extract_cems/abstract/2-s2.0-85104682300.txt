Amorphous pseudocapacitive nanomaterials are highly desired in energy storage applications for their disordered crystal structures, fast electrochemical dynamics, and outstanding cyclic stability, yet hardly achievable using the state-of-The-Art synthetic strategies. Herein, for the first time, high capacitive fiber electrodes embedded with nanosized amorphous molybdenum trioxide (A-MoO3-x) featuring an average particle diameter of ~20nm and rich oxygen vacancies are obtained via a top-down method using -MoO3 bulk belts as the precursors. The Jahn-Teller distortion in MoO6 octahedra due to the doubly degenerate ground state of Mo5+, which can be continuously strengthened by oxygen vacancies, triggers the phase transformation of -MoO3 bulk belts (up to 30 m long and 500 nm wide). The optimized fibrous electrode exhibits among the highest volumetric performance with a specific capacitance (CV) of 921.5 F cm-3 under 0.3Acm-3, endowing the fiber-based weaveable supercapacitor superior CV and EV (energy density) of 107.0 F cm-3 and 9.5mWhcm-3, respectively, together with excellent cyclic stability, mechanical robustness, and rate capability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy for synthesizing nanosized amorphous materials in a scalable, cost-effective, and controllable manner.
