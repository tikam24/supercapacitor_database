Electrospinning is an efficient and versatile technology to prepare continuous nanofibers. Carbon nanofibers prepared from electrospun nanofibers have a large surface area, high porosity and large liquid permeability, and good electrical conductivity; as a result, they have attracted growing attention as electrode materials for supercapacitor application. In this chapter, the progress made in carbon nanofiber-based electrodes and their electrochemical performances are reviewed. The selection of precursor materials, control of fiber morphology and pore structure engineering involved in making high-performance electrode materials will be summarized. Carbon composite nanofiber electrodes containing heteroatoms, transition metal compounds, or conducting polymers are discussed. Attention will particularly be paid toward the relationship between electrochemical performances and fiber porous structure and composition.
