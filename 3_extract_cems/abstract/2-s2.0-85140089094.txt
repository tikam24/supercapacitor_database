In the present work, the magnetic CoFe2O4/SiO2 nanocomposites were prepared by the simple sol-gel method for supercapacitor applications. Various characterization techniques, including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) analysis, were used to investigate the CoFe2O4/S iO2 composites. The same materials were used to perform the electrochemical activity for electrode applications, thus confirming their comparable efficiency and reversibility. The prepared electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 316.14 Fg−1, a maximum energy density of 295.6 Wh kg−1 1 (4 Ag−1), and a maximum power density of 9.1 kW kg−1 (4 Ag−1). Excellent capacitance retention of 95.4 % over 5000 cycles showed outstanding cycle stability.
