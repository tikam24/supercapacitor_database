According to a Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology report, high winds and waves have a greater impact on vessels at lower speeds, e.g., when approaching harbor, which has particular implications for ships with a flexible power strategy. To address this, an energy storage backup is needed to compensate for load fluctuations, specifically supercapacitors. There are different versions with slightly different characteristics. For instance, Skeleton’s development is based on the charge-holding capabilities of graphene’s nanostructure. Another, by KHI’s collaborator JM Energy, is offering a Li-ion capacitor (LiC) which is a cross between a Li-ion battery and an electric double-layer capacitor. LiC’s is upward of 500,000- ad Skeleton’s pegs its supercapacitor’s life at over a million cycles.
