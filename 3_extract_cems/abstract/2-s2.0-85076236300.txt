For the first time, Co3O4/CdO composite nanospheres were synthesized using a simple solvothermal method. During electrochemical study, Co3O4/CdO nanospheres showed a high capacitance of 351 F g−1, and 84.9% of the original capacitance was also reached from 2 to 10 A g−1, indicating an excellent rate performance. The asymmetric supercapacitor containing Co3O4/CdO nanospheres exhibited high capacitance of 109.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The fabricated Co3O4/CdO nanospheres were promising alternatives for highly performed supercapacitors.
