For the wearable and flexible applications, solid-state supercapacitors have been attracted significant attention owing to their unique features. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of a high-energy solid-state hybrid supercapacitor by using cobalt hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles and molybdenum oxide thin films grown on the flexible carbon fiber cloth. The flexible hybrid supercapacitor using a neutral gel electrolyte can be operated in a stable potential window of 2.0 V and delivers a maximal energy density of 67.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 1003 W kg−1, outstanding reliability without capacitance degradation under various twisting rates, and remarkable cycling stability retaining 74% of initial capacitance after 10000 cycles.
