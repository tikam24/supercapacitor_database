Evaluation of FC/SC-based UPS has been done in terms of energy containers usability in the power emergency generation system. The Uninterruptible Power Supply delivers electric support for connected loads basing on hydrogen energy direct conversion into electricity with aid of low-temperature PEM fuel cell and additional energy carriers - supercapacitors. The paper contains description of design and rules of operation, and measurement results that have been determined under various conditions to examine usefulness of FC/SC implementation.
