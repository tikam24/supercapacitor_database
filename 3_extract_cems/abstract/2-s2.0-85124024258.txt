Todayâ€™s world requires high-performance energy storage devices such as hybrid supercapacitors (HSc), which play an important role in the modern electronic market because supercapacitors (Sc) show better electrical properties for electronics devices. In the last few years, the scientific community has focused on the coupling of Sc and battery-type materials to improve energy and power density. Recently, various hybrid electrode materials have been reported in the literature; out of these, coordination polymers such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly porous, stable, and widely explored for various applications. The poor conductivity of classical MOFs restricts their applications. The composite of MOFs with highly porous graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO), or reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanomaterials is a promising strategy in the field of electrochemical applications. In this review, we have discussed the strategy, device structure, and function of the MOFs/G, MOFs/GO, and MOFs/rGO nanocomposites on Sc. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical performance of coordination polymers composites towards Sc application has been discussed. The reported results indicate the considerable improvement in the structural, surface morphological, and electrochemical performance of the Sc due to their positive synergistic effect. Finally, we focused on the recent development in preparation methods optimization, and the opportunities for MOFs/G based nanomaterials as electrode materials for energy storage applications have been discussed in detail.
