A novel process to fabricate a carbon-microelectromechanical-system-based alternating stacked MoS2@rGO–carbon-nanotube (CNT) micro-supercapacitor (MSC) is reported. The MSC is fabricated by successively repeated spin-coating of MoS2@rGO/photoresist and CNT/photoresist composites twice, followed by photoetching, developing, and pyrolysis. MoS2@rGO and CNTs are embedded in the carbon microelectrodes, which cooperatively enhance the performance of the MSC. The fabricated MSC exhibits a high areal capacitance of 13.7 mF cm−2 and an energy density of 1.9 µWh cm−2 (5.6 mWh cm−3), which exceed many reported carbon- and MoS2-based MSCs. The MSC also retains 68% of capacitance at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 (5.9 A cm−3) and an outstanding cycling performance (96.6% after 10 000 cycles, at a scan rate of 1 V s−1). Compared with other MSCs, the MSC in this study is fabricated by a low-cost and facile process, and it achieves an excellent and stable electrochemical performance. This approach could be highly promising for applications in integration of micro/nanostructures into microdevices/systems.
