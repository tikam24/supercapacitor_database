Fiber supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices for potential application in wearable and miniaturized portable electronics, which currently suffer from difficulties in achieving high capacitance and energy density synchronously owing to the limited specific surface area of the electrode materials and material incompatibility between the two electrodes. Herein, a strategy is developed for the manufacture of coaxial asymmetric fiber supercapacitors by wrapping a core of PVA-KOH gel electrolyte-coated Ni(OH)2@NiCo2O4/CNT fibers with MoS2@Fe2O3/CNT paper. The as-prepared coaxial fiber asymmetric supercapacitors exhibit a specific capacitance of 373 mF cm−2 (at a current density of 2 mA cm−2) and energy density of 0.13 mW h cm−2 (at a power density of 3.2 mW cm−2), and also show good rate capability, long cycle life, and excellent flexibility. This work provides the possibility for the practical application of fiber supercapacitors in wearable and portable energy storage equipment.
