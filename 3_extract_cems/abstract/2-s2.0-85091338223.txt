Supercapacitor is an electronic device with characteristic of having higher power density than battery and higher energy density than conventional capacitor. In order to achieve exceptional power density and energy density, it is necessary to use materials with high specific surface area as its electrodes. In this study, we prepared a rolled supercapacitor device model using carbon-sheet as the electrodes and 1 M KCl as the electrolyte. A carbon-sheet was soaked in 1 M KCl and assembled as a rolled supercapacitor device model. Performance of the rolled supercapacitor device model was measured using a cyclic voltammetry (CV) in the voltage range of â€“ 0.8 V to + 0.1 V with scanrate variations of 1 mV/s, 5 mV/s, 10 mV/s, 15 mV/s and 20 mV/s. Cyclic voltammetry measurement provide results as follows, Esp = 0.289 to 0.103 Wh/kg and Psp = 5.024 to 35.738 W/kg. By using Ragone plot, we found that the prepared rolled supercapacitor using carbon-sheet as electrodes had met criteria of supercapacitor. The result shows that the carbon-sheet has a good prospect to be used as electrodes for rolled supercapacitor.
