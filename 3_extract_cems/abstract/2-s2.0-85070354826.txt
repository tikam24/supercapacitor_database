In this work, the nanosheets-composed porous spheres with a narrow pore size distribution are designed as a rational microstructure configuration of electrode materials for Faraday supercapacitors (FSs). The design of this structure is based on the electrochemical mechanism of FSs, which is beneficial to the redox reactions of electrode materials and the transfer of electrolyte ions to the greatest extent. This structure is built by the interlocking of nanosheets under the high shear mixer-exerted shear force using Zn2+ doped Ni(OH)2 nanosheets as building blocks. It is found that the strong shear force is the driving force for the interlocking of nanosheets. The layer-by-layer growth through the nanosheets interlocking results in the formation of nanostructured spheres designed by us. Due to the appropriate pore structure and the two-dimensional morphology of building blocks, the porous spheres of Zn2+ doped Ni(OH)2 present high electrochemical performance.
