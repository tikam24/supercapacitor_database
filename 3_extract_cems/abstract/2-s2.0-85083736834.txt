Super Capacitor (SC) has gain momentum as energy storage and provide alternative to rechargeable battery specifically in area where fast charging and burst energy transfer is demanded. SC is also superior in number of charge cycling capability compare to batteries. However in terms of energy capacity SC is still fall short to popular Li-ion battery (a couple of mWH/kg vs few hundreds mWh/kg). In this research we fabricated SC from coconut shell activated carbon and study the result of energy capacity yield when using combination of electrolytes and MnO2 powder to maximize Electrochemical Pseudocapacitance effect. The electrodes are cut 20x5 cm2 and using 70wt% of coconut shell activated carbon (CSAC) mixed with 30wt% polyurethane. The result table indicates that electrolyte of choice can have a significant effect on total SC energy capacity.
