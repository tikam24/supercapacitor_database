Manganese sulfide (MnS) thin films are deposited by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method on stainless steel substrate. Manganese acetate and sodium sulfide are used as the source materials for the preparation of thin films. These films are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) which shows that the prepared MnS films are polycrystalline in nature, having a crystallite size of 0.2647 nm. It is determined from the broadenings of corresponding XRD peaks by using Debye–Scherrer's formula. The wettability study of deposited MnS thin film is hydrophilic in nature. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy technique is used to determine the functional groups present in MnS material and its chemical composition. Bandgap of MnS thin films is measured using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy which shows a gap of 2.6 eV. The present work focuses on studying the supercapacitive properties of MnS material which is used as electrode material for supercapacitor. The highest specific capacitance (Cs) of MnS 632.91 Fg−1 is obtained for 100 mV S−1 scan rate by using galvanostatic charge discharge technique.
