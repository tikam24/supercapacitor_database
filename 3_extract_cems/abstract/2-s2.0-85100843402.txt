Aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers have been considered as one of the ideal candidate electrodes for fiber-shaped energy harvesting and storage devices, due to their merits of flexibility, lightweight, desirable mechanical property, outstanding electrical conductivity as well as high specific surface area. Herein, the recent advancements on the aligned CNT fibers for energy harvesting and storage devices are reviewed. The synthesis, structure, and properties of aligned carbon nanotube fibers are briefly summarized. Then, their applications in fiber-shaped energy harvesting and storage devices (i.e., solar cells, supercapacitors, and batteries) are demonstrated. The remaining challenges are finally discussed to highlight the future research direction in the development of aligned CNT fibers for fiber-shaped energy devices.
