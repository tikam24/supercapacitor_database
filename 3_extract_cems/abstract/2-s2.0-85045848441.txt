In the present study, graphene oxide is synthesized using modified Hummers method. The X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) study is used to understand the successful synthesis of graphene oxide using the modified Hummers method. Secondly, the TiO2/RGO composite has developed using co-precipitation method and structural, morphological, electrochemical and supercapacitive properties are studied. The TiO2/RGO nano-composite shows the porous nanopetals like nature. The thin films of TiO2/RGO composite are developed using the doctor blade method on steel, and the copper substrate and the electrochemical and supercapacitive properties are studied. The TiO2/RGO composite thin films deposited on steel substrate are showing relatively less charge transfer resistance, and better specific capacitance than thin film deposited copper substrate. The TiO2/RGO thin films deposited on steel substrate shows maximum specific capacitance 192 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1.
