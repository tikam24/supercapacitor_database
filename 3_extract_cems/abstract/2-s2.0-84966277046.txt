Nitrogen-rich hierarchical porous hollow carbon nanofibers (HPCNFs) were synthesized by concentric electrospinning and subsequent KCl/K2CO3 activation. The obtained HPCNFs have quite high nitrogen content (14.4 wt%) and rational hierarchical porous structure, thus exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 293 F g-1, a superior specific areal capacitance of 40 Î¼F cm-2 at 0.2 A g-1 and an excellent rate capability of 62.8% (185 F g-1) at 50 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
