Ordered mesoporous carbon materials show great potential for electric double-layer supercapacitors because of their high specific surface area, designable pore structure, and tunable morphology. However, low graphitic crystallinity nature and poor contact between particles lead to their high inherent resistance, which limits the supercapacitance performance. Herein, we report on a hierarchically rambutan-morphological design of carbon composites with ordered mesoporous carbon as the core and carbon nanotubes as the shell, which significantly improve the electric contact between mesoporous carbon particles and promote the electrochemical performance. By an ultrafast microwave process in a household microwave heater under ambient condition, carbon nanotubes grow out from the pores of ordered mesoporous carbon and are dispersed on its surface like the whiskers of rambutan. As-synthesized ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3/carbon nanotubes nanocomposites show significantly enhanced specific capacitance (315.6 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, as compared with 172.1 F·g−1 of CMK-3), high rate capability (214.6 F·g−1 at 50 A·g−1), and cycling durability (10,000 cycles, 99.32%). The structural design and microwave synthesis enable a facile preparation of the hybrid ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3/carbon nanotubes nanocomposites, and show potential for easy and low-cost production of high performance electric double-layer supercapacitors materials.
