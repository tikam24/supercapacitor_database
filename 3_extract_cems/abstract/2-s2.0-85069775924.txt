Prussian blue analogues (Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2)) derived nanocube-like Ni(OH)2 was grown evenly on the surface of GO via solution-precipitation and potassium hydroxide etching process at room temperature. Due to the even dispersion of Ni(OH)2 nancubes, the obtained sample Ni(OH)2/GO exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 1299 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, excellent electrochemical stability (capacity retention of 63% from 0.5 A g−1 to 10 A g−1), and long-cycle stability (capacity retention of 78% over 2000 cycles).
