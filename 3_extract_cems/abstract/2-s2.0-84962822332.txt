Design of an onboard energy storage system (ESS) plays a vital role in laying out performance specifications for an electric vehicle (EV). One solution to address the relatively low power density problem of battery being sole storage source is to hybridize ESS with higher power density sources such as supercapacitor (SC) via a power converter to electrically regulate each power flow. This paper proposes a simple but innovative algorithm with the aim of guiding EV designers of logically choosing the optimal size and ratio of each source to form a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), when considering a set of practical constraints such as cost including the presence of a power converter. Two popular design examples are given differentiating LiFPO4 based battery pack from LMO or NCM based one since both weight specific energy density and cost specific energy density of each candidate varies significantly from those of the other in the current market environment. The algorithm is proved effective to find the global optimal solutions for each design example. Final recommendations are therefore able to be made based on these results to compare and understand potential impact of various design choices over HESS.
