Copper oxide (CuO) and manganese (Mn) doped CuO nanostructures have been synthesized via facile solution routeand their electrochemical properties were analysed towards supercapacitor electrode application. Morphological investigations reveals the formation of nanoworm like structure for CuO in which addition of Mn lead to the configuration of flake like morphology. Electrochemical nature of the materials were studied using cyclic voltammetric (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance analysis. 5 wt% of Mn doped CuO nanoflakes exhibit the maximum specific capacitance of 625 Fg−1 at 2 mV s-1 and offers a good cyclic stability with the capacitance retention of 84% after 2000 cycles. Electrochemical impedance analysis shows a charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 1 Ω for 5 wt% of Mn doped CuO nanoflakes, which is quite beneficial for better charge-discharge performance at higher current rates. These findings suggest thatMn blended CuO nanostructures prepared through cost effective and simple chemical precipitation method offers better electrochemical features.
