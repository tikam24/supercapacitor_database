Principle conditions for layer-by-layer synthesis of nanocomposite layers incorporating graphene and metal oxides or hydroxides are formulated in the review. Practical applications of such nanocomposites in the electrodes of lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, or electrochemical sensors, systems of water purification and environmental control, photocatalysts, etc, are considered. As an example of this method the synthesis of nanocomposite containing graphene nanosheets and CuO nanorods is described. This material was first synthesized in our study using Cu[NH3]4(OAc)2 solution and water suspension of graphene. Analysis of the synthesized thin films by SEM, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy have shown that the size of the graphene nanosheets in the films is about 2 Î¼m and the size of the CuO nanorods is approximately 10-12 by 150-200 nm. This nanocomposite layers were deposited on the surface of nickel foam and their electrochemical properties were studied for application in supercapacitor electrode. It was shown that the capacitance of the supercapacitor is 700 F/g, and its value after 500 cycling is reduced by 6% only. Also some recommendations are given concerning potential applications of these layers in the electrodes of electrocatalysts or electrochemical sensors.
