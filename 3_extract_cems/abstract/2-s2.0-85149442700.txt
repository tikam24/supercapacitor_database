The concerns of sustainable energy rely on highly efficient renewable energy sources and effective storage devices. Supercapacitor is practically reliable energy storage devices with rapid charging rate, high power density, simple setup, and good stability. Electrode materials have significant impacts on the performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, finding high-performing electroactive material is a critical concern of the area. Herein, the recent progress of vanadium pentoxide-based electroactive materials for supercapacitor application has been reviewed. Vanadium pentoxide is a potential electroactive material for supercapacitor due to its mixed oxidation states, eco-friendliness, low cost, high capacitance, and high energy density. But, poor conductivity and low cyclic stability are major drawbacks of the oxide which affect its electrochemical properties. This review points out different strategies of mitigating such limitations. Finally, future perspectives on V2O5-based electroactive materials for supercapacitor application have been highlighted.
