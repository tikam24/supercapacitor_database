Cerium tungstate nanostructure was prepared through precipitation and characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), as well as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and continuous cyclic voltammetry (CCV) in terms of structural and electrochemical properties. The electrochemical evaluations using cerium tungstate electrodes revealed that the electrode material has interesting supercapacitive properties including a specific capacitance (SC) of 348 F g −1 at a potential scan rate of 2 mV s −1 . Also CCV experiments proved that the material maintains 95.8% of its original capacitance after 4000 cycles. The properties make the nanostructures suitable for use as high-quality electroactive materials for supercapacitor applications.
