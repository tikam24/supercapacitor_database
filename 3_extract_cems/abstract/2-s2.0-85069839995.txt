Waste cigarette butts are one kind of common life garbages and contain some harmful substances such as nicotine, tar and so on. If they were not reasonably recycled, the environment pollution or the waste of resources would be brought out. For this purpose, waste cigarette butts were recycled via one step pyrolytic carbonation for N-doped carbon. The waste-cigarette-butts-derived N-doped carbon was studied in terms of the microstructure, elemental composition, electronic conductivity and super-capacitive performances by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), four electrode conductivity meter, galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The results suggest that the-waste-cigarette-butts-derived N-doped carbon contained a small amount of residual N and O heteroatoms. Carbon electrode exhibited the initial specific capacitance of 251 F/g and reversible 220 F/g even after 1500 cycles at 100 mA/g, indicating satisfactory super-capacitive performances.
