Among the intrinsically conductive polymers, polyanilines have been of great interest in the past decades due to their wide applications in many fields, thanks to their reasonably good conductivity, easy preparation, and special redox properties. Ever-increasing environmental considerations make the processing of polyanilines shift from toxic organic solvent-based system to eco-friendly water-based system. The present paper reviews the synthesis of water-borne conducting polyanilines, and possible applications are discussed including supercapacitor electrode material, metal free corrosion protection coating, lithium oxygen battery cathode material and ultraviolet curable resin.
