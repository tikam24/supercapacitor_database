Transparent flexible supercapacitors (TFSCs) are a tantalizing power supplier for future transparent flexible electronics. However, their energy density is far behind a practical level while maintaining high transparency. We report here a transparent flexible potassium-ion microcapacitor, and its high energy density (15.5 Î¼Wh cm-2) roots in the battery-supercapacitor hybrid storage mechanism and much enlarged working voltage (3 V), outperforming the state-of-the-art TFSC, which is generally based on an aqueous electrolyte and an asymmetric pseudocapacitive mechanism. From an electrode material perspective, a multidimensional topotactic host composite anode is designed in which the component not only performs energy storage by synchronous and reversible uptake of potassium ions and electrons into its host structure, but also mutually compensates individual weakness in functional and structural aspects, efficiently constructing a three-dimensional potassium-ion diffusion and electron transport system. This conceptual exhibition provides design principles at material and device levels for high-performance TFSCs.
