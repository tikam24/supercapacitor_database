Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) is synthesized by typical solvothermal method and subsequently calcined under air and nitrogen atmosphere, respectively. The carbon in the calcined ZIF-8 under nitrogen atmosphere was from the carbonization of the guest molecules, without adding any other carbon sources. The samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electrochemical analyzer system. When the ZIF-8 is used as electrode materials for a supercapacitor in 6 M KOH electrolyte, it displays a pseudocapacitive behavior. The untreated ZIF-8 and calcined ZIF-8 under air and nitrogen atmosphere electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance of 96, 156, and 185 F g−1, respectively, at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1and good stability over 1,500 cycles. These results indicate that the ZIF-8 is a promising material for supercapacitors.
