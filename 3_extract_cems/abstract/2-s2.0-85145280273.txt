In the present study, cadmium molybdate (CdMoO4) nanoparticles are synthesized successfully by most adoptable hydrothermal method. To improve the supercapacitive properties of sole CdMoO4, optimized quantity of Eu3+ is doped in the material, and improved capacitance is obtained. The prepared material is figured out by various characteristic techniques such as XRD, FTIR, RAMAN, ICP, FESEM, TEM, BET, XPS and EDX analysis. The electrochemical analysis of the prepared material is obtained by CV, GCD and EIS techniques. High specific capacitance of 601 F g−1 was obtained from Cd0.98MoO4:Eu3+0.02 at 1 A g−1 which was higher from CdMoO4 (343 g−1 at 1 A g−1). Further, the specific capacitance of doped material was improved by adding the small amount of MWCNTs. The high specific capacitance of 1011 F g−1 was obtained at the current density of 1 A g−1 from the MWCNTs@Cd0.98MoO4:Eu3+0.02 composite. In addition, MWCNTs@Cd0.98MoO4:Eu3+0.02//AC device is fabricated, and high energy density of 25.2 W h kg−1 at power density of 362.5 W kg−1 was obtained using the current density of 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, LEDs, toy motor fan and kitchen timer are also powered by series connected two MWCNTs@Cd0.98MoO4:Eu3+0.02//AC device.
