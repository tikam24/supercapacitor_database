We provide a novel delay-compensating stabilizing feedback control for a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV)/hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The HESS is comprised of a battery and a supercapacitor (SC) and features high energy and power density. The proposed control is based on delay-compensating chain predictors for bilinear systems, and it features real-time implementation feasibility and global asymptotic stability to desired reference trajectories. Real-time simulation results of a grid-connected PV/HESS verify the efficacy of our method in controlling its dynamics in the presence of digital implementation delays while ensuring delivery of desired power to the grid.
