The hybrid supercapacitor using carbon/AlPO4 hybrid-coated H2Ti12O25/activated carbon is fabricated as a cylindrical cell and investigated against electrochemical performances. The hybrid coating shows that the conductivity for the electron and Li ion is superior and it prevented active material from HF attack. Consequently, carbon/AlPO4 hybrid-coated H2Ti12O25 shows enhanced rate capability and long-term cycle life. Also, the hybrid coating inhibits swelling phenomenon caused by gas generated as decomposition reaction of electrolyte. Therefore, the hybrid supercapacitor using carbon/AlPO4 hybrid-coated H2Ti12O25/activated carbon can be applied to an energy storage system that requires a long-term life.
