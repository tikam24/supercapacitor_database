This paper presents an approach for current sharing in non-coupled interleaved bi-directional boost converters employed for supercapacitor applications. The approach employs a master voltage regulator for output voltage while each of the boost converters is run to follow the specified reference current. For similar boost converters, the specified reference currents, which need to be followed by the converters, are considered to be equal. Experimental results are shown to prove the effectiveness of this approach in current sharing between interleaved converters.
