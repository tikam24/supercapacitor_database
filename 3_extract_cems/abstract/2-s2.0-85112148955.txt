This paper describes the adaptive Volterra filtered-x logarithmic cost least mean lp-norm (AVFxlogCLMP) algorithm for the control of voltage source converter (VSC) of the grid-tied dual-stage PV system with multi-carrier energy storage system (MESS). The proposed VSC control fulfils multi-faceted objectives, i.e., reactive power compensation, load balancing, harmonics elimination, and power balancing. The proposed system performs satisfactorily under steady-state and various dynamic-state conditions, i.e., fixed power mode, variable power mode with irradiation variation, and load unbalancing. The MESS comprises the lead-acid battery bank, proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and ultracapacitor (UC). With the contrasting nature of the energy storage element, the system can easily handle the load side and the PV side irregularities. The proposed system is working satisfactorily in MATLAB Simulink environment as per IEEE 519 standards.
