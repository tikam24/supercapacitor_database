Coal-based carbon nanofibers with uniform diameters were prepared by means of electrospinning with oxidized coal, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). Coal-based super-capacitor electrodes were further obtained by carbonization and activation. The phase and morphology of precursor and final product were characterized via energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) adsorption-desorption isotherm, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results indicated that the solubility of raw coal in organic solvents can be enhanced after oxidizing treatment with potassium permanganate because of the disconnection of alkyl chains in macromolecules and the increase of oxygen containing groups. Electrochemical testing of the coal-based electrode showed a specific capacitance of 259.7 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in three-electrode system, and a capacity retention of 99.2% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g.
