A facile and scalable method is reported for MgV2O5 (MVO) interconnected with a porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) sphere network using a hydrothermal technique. The synthesized MgV2O5-N-doped Carbon (MVO-NC) nanocomposite has an orthorhombic crystal plane and a sheet-like MVO with a porous NC network based on structural and morphological analyses. In an aqueous electrolyte, the hydrothermally produced MVO-NC electrode demonstrates good charge–discharge performance, with an exceptional cycling retention of 97.05% over 5000 cycles. At 2 A g−1, the MVO-NC has a higher specific capacitance of 358 F g−1 than other MVO electrode compositions (272 F g−1) and V2O5 (146 F g−1). Owing to the highly redox-active MVO-NC composite and exceptionally porous activated carbon components, the hybrid supercapacitors achieve a maximum energy density of 38 W h kg−1 and maximum power density of 8000 W kg−1. The two-dimensional porous network structure of the MVO, along with the porous NC, creates sufficient interstitial space for electrolyte accommodation, thereby allowing a rapid and reversible electrochemical process.
