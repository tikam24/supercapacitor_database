Graphene nanosheets have been prepared by electrochemical exfoliation method. For the graphene synthesis 0.1 M potassium sulphate is used as the electrolyte. After synthesis, graphene is characterized by Raman, SEM, TEM and UV-Vis spectroscopy. Graphene paper electrodes are prepared by using brush coating on A4 size paper which are used for making flexible supercapacitors. The performance of the supercapacitors is analysed by cyclovoltammetry(CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (CD) curves. Seven gel electrolytes PVA/KCL, PVA/H3PO4, PVA/H2SO4, PVA/LiCl, PVA/KOH, PVA/NaOH and PVA/KNO3 are used for making supercapacitors so as to compare their specific capacitance values. It has been observed that graphene supercapacitor exhibited maximum specific capacitance with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte.
