The present article deals with automatic generation control of a three-area multi-source thermal-gas (T-G) system with integration of distributed generation (DG), electric vehicles (EVs), and energy storage devices. Each thermal unit is equipped with a single reheat turbine, a generation rate constraint, and a governor dead band. A cascade combination of two degree of freedom proportional-integral-derivative with a filter (2DOF-PIDN) and a fractional order integrator controller [(2DOF-PIDN)-FOI] is proposed as the secondary controller for the system. A meta-heuristic algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, is utilized for simultaneous optimization of gains and other parameters of controllers PIDN, PIDN-FOI, and (2DOF-PIDN)-FOI. Critical observation reveals the superiority of the latter in terms of peak deviations and settling time (ST) for the T-G system under both step load perturbation and random load perturbation. Eigen value analysis is also performed for the T-G system with and without secondary controllers. Analyses show noticeable improvement on the T-G system with incorporation of both DG and EV. Investigations infer that combined involvement of energy storage devices like ultra-capacitors and superconducting magnetic energy storage devices along with DG and EV leads to better performance regarding the reduced peak deviations, magnitude of oscillations, and settling time for the T-G system. Moreover, sensitivity analysis reveals that (2DOF-PIDN)-FOI controller parameters obtained at nominal conditions are robust and there is no need to reset again with a wide variation of system parameters like the inertia constant and area participation factor and system conditions like loading and disturbance.
