Hierarchical MoO3@MoS2/rGO nanocomposites with highly active sites deliver high power density and energy density are fabricated here by using a simple two-step process, the first one is a direct anion-exchange reaction of the inorganic MoO3 nanorods (NRs) for growth of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets in a perpendicular direction and other is the composition of rGO sheets with core–shell MoO3@MoS2. Interestingly, how the modification of hybrid solvent in the anion-exchange mechanism and the concentration of thiourea impact on the morphologies of core–shell MoO3@MoS2 at quantum level have been inspected. A fruitful synergistic effect between MoO3/MoS2 core–shell nanostructures and rGO nanosheets led to a high surface area and transporting properties are inspected obviously through fundamental studies. Therefore, in eventual, this novel and more active sites MoO3@MoS2/rGO hierarchical structures material has delivered an outstanding specific capacitance of 525.06F/g at 4 A/g when used as an electrode in supercapacitor and more importantly good stability (80.6% at 10 A/g) even after 1000 successive cycles has been procured in an electrode in which MoS2 shell layer prepared at 5 mmol thiourea ratio.
