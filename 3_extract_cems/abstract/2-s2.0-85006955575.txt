Layer-by-layer V 2 O 5 structures self-assembly by quadrate sheets like “multilayer cake” were successfully synthesized using NH 4 VO 3 as the vanadium sources by a facile hydrothermal route and combination of the calcination. The structure and composition were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, X-ray powder diffraction, Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The optical properties of the as-obtained V 2 O 5 layer-by-layer structures were investigated by the Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectrum. The electrochemical properties of the as-obtained V 2 O 5 layer-by-layer structures as electrodes in supercapacitor device were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) both in the aqueous and organic electrolyte. The specific capacitance is 347 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in organic electrolyte, which is improved by 46% compared with 238 F g −1 in aqueous electrolyte. During the cycle performance, the specific capacitances of V 2 O 5 layer-by-layer structures after 100 cycles are 30% and 82% of the initial discharge capacity in the aqueous and organic electrolyte, respectively, indicating the cycle performance is significantly improved in organic electrolyte. Our results turn out that layer-by-layer V 2 O 5 structures are an ideal material for supercapacitor electrode in the present work.
