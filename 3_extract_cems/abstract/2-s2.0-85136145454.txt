Ternary metal sulphide Zr2S3-BaS-Cr2S3 thin film was fabricated through physical vapour deposition and characterized. A mixed morphology with flakes and rice grains-like particles was observed in the material. The average crystallite size of the nanocomposite was 21.8 nm as determined through X-ray diffraction (XRD). Band gap energy of 3.7 eV was observed for the nanocomposite. Thin film was explored for energy storage potential as supercapacitor electrode by electrochemical investigation through cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry. An impressive specific capacitance of 455 F g−1 was obtained at the scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Moreover, the photocatalytic property of the thin film was also investigated for environmental remediation of organic contaminants including, methylene blue dye, pesticide zoxamide and phenol. Highest photocatalysis was witnessed for dye (86%) with degradation rate constant of 3.24 × 10−2 min−1. Whereas, the degradation rate dwindled to only 73% after four cycles of photocatalysis.
