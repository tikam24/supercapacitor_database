Polyaniline (PANI) and manganese dioxide (MnO 2) composite (PANI/MnO 2) was synthesized via a simultaneous-oxidation route. In this route, all reactants were dispersed homogenously in precursor solution and existed as ions and molecules, and involved reactions of ions and molecules generating PANI and MnO 2 simultaneously. In this way, PANI molecule and MnO 2 molecule contact each other and arrange alternately in the composite. The inter-molecule contact improves the conductivity of the composite. The alternative arrangement of PANI molecules and MnO 2 molecules separating each other, and prevents the aggregation of PANI and cluster of MnO 2 so as to decrease the particle size of the composite. The morphology, structure, porous and capacitive properties are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Branauer-Emmett-Teller test, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge test and the electrochemical impedance measurements. The results show that MnO 2 is predominant in the PANI/MnO 2 composite and the composite exhibits larger specific surface area than pure MnO 2. The maximum specific capacitance of the composite electrode reaches up to 320 F/g by charge-discharge test, 1.56 times higher than that of MnO 2 (125 F/g). The specific capacitance retains approximately 84% of the initial value after 10,000 cycles, indicating the good cycle stability. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
