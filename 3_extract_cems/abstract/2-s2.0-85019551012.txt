A facile one-step calcination-free approach is introduced to synthesize zinc cobaltite nanospheres (ZCONS). The as-prepared electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 1596 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and outstanding cycling stability of 119% after 2000 cycles. The excellent performance is ascribed to the electroactive surface of Zn and Co oxides and the fast electron and ion transport in the microporous/nanoporous structure.
