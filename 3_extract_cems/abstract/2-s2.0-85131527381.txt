In this study, egg proteins are used as a nitrogen source for the synthesis of nitrogen-rich carbonaceous material through hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) for the electrochemical energy storage application. The composite of activated carbon with egg-derived protein (AC/EDP) is prepared by mixing untreated egg proteins in the aqueous dispersion of activated carbon, followed by HTC at 220 °C for 12 h in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The resultant composite is then directed to chemical activation with KOH and thermal activation at a temperature ranging from 500 to 700 °C. The nitrogen-doped activated carbon exhibited a microporous and mesoporous structure with a high specific surface area of 1660 m2 g−1, confirmed through BET analysis. The composite morphology was analyzed through scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates the presence of a considerable amount of pyrrolic, pyridinic, and quaternary nitrogen in AC/EDP, which improved the electrochemical performance. The composite activated at 700 °C exhibited the highest capacitance of 263 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. The highest energy density and power density values are 32 Wh kg−1 and 7920 W kg−1, respectively. The AC/EDP exhibited high cyclic stability, and the capacitance retention observed after 10,000 cycles is 98%.
