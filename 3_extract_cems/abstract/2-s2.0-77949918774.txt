In the present study, a manganese oxide obtained by the acid treatment of LiMn 2O 4 spinel has been used as a positive electrode of supercapacitor. Removal of lithium from a spinel allowed to obtain MnO 2 compound with the pores partly distributed in atomic scale, hence, an efficient use of its pseudocapacitive properties could be reached. On the other hand, residual lithium remaining in the structure preserved layered framework of MnO 2 with pathways for ions sorption. Physical properties, morphology, and specific surface area of electrode materials were studied by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption measurements. Voltammetry cycling, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and impedance spectroscopy measurements performed in two-and three-electrode cells have been applied in order to measure electrochemical parameters. Neutral Li 2SO 4 aqueous solution has been selected for electrolytic medium. Extension of operating voltage for supercapacitor has been realized through asymmetric configuration with an activated carbon as a negative electrode. The asymmetric capacitor was operating within a voltage range up to 2.5 V (limited to 2.0 V for cycling tests) and was able to deliver a specific capacitance of 60 Fg -1 per capacitor at 100 mA g -1 current density. High specific energy of 36 Wh kg -1 was reached but with a moderate power density. Â© Springer-Verlag 2009.
