Supercapacitors with polyaniline/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PANI/MWCNT) composite-based electrodes are fabricated and studied. The cases of electrodes with randomly distributed and vertically aligned MWCNTs are considered. The measured discharge curves demonstrate the presence of memory effect in studied devices. The fractional-order equivalent circuit model is proposed to describe the impedance spectra.
