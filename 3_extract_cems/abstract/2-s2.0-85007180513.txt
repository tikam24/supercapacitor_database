Herein, we report for the first time efficient CuS/nickel foam (NF) counter electrode for quantum dots-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) is fabricated using chemical bath deposition technique which can serve as a highly efficient CE for QDSSCs. These are characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), current voltage and impedance spectroscopy. The CuS/NF and CuS/FTO films are investigated as a counter electrode (CE) in QDSSCs. The QDSSC based on CuS/NF CE achieves power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.93% accrediting to the high fill factor (FF) of 0.58, and the PCE is greater than that of CuS/FTO CE (4.27%) for TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS electrode, under the illumination of one sun (AM1.5, 100 mW cmâˆ’2). Electrochemical measurements testified that CuS/NF reveals high electro-catalytic activity towards polysulfide reduction, thus accelerating QDSSCs performance. Consequently, the CuS/NF is very capable as an efficient CE for QDSSCs. This procedure not only provides high electro catalytic activity but also an efficient scheme to be used in different applications such as flexible solar cells, fuel cells and supercapacitor.
