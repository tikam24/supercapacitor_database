Graphene oxide (GO) anchored porous manganese sulfide nanocrystals (MnS/GO-NH<inf>3</inf>) were obtained via a facile hydrothermal method based on the Kirkendall effect. The honeycomb-like manganese sulfide nanocrystals (40-80 nm) and the three-dimensional sandwich structure endow the MnS/GO-NH<inf>3</inf> with high supercapacitive performance when it was used as a supercapacitor material. The MnS/GO-NH<inf>3</inf> electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (390.8 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.25 A g<sup>-1</sup>), high rate capacity (78.7% retention at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and stable cycle life (81.0% retention after 2000 cycles), which are superior to those of GO anchored MnS floccules (MnS/GO) and manganese hydroxide (Mn(OH)<inf>2</inf>/GO). As a novel material for supercapacitors, the charge-discharge mechanism of the MnS/GO-NH<inf>3</inf> composite is proposed via detailed investigation. Asymmetric supercapacitors, assembled with MnS/GO-NH<inf>3</inf> as the positive material and activated carbon as the negative electrode, reveal a high specific capacitance (73.63 F g<sup>-1</sup>), a high energy density of 14.9 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at 66.5 W kg<sup>-1</sup> and even 12.8 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at a high power density of 4683.5 W kg<sup>-1</sup>.
