Supercapacitors are state-of-the-art eco-friendly energy storage devices featuring impressive power capacity not achievable by batteries. High surface area of the electrodes is achieved by using nano porous carbon particles. Polymeric binders provide mechanical integrity to the electrode, but hinders the charge from accessing some parts of the porous surface. In this study, the effect of binders in covering pores and also insulating some of the conductive carbon particles causing a decrease in capacitance is investigated with the help of Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. A quantitative analysis of the capacitance lost as a consequence of these twin effects is studied.
