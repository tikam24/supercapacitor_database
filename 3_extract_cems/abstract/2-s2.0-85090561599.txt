Supercapacitors and batteries are among the most promising electrochemical energy storage technologies available today. High demands in energy storage devices require low-cost fabrication and environmentally friendly materials. Even though lignocellulose has been used for electrochemical applications, there is a lack of literature that collectively summarizes key aspects of its applications in electrochemical devices. In this research, a comprehensive review of lignocellulose, an emerging class of materials, as electrodes was conducted. The methods of extraction, pretreatment processes, modification, and their applications as electroactive materials are discussed. The molecular structure of various components and the effects of morphology on the capacitive performance are analyzed. This review addresses the state of theart, outstanding challenges, and potential solutions to the design and fabrication of advanced electrodes. A critical summary of current knowledge and recommended future studies are provided.
