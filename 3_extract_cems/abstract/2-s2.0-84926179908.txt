Hierarchical 3D cobalt phosphate octahydrate (Co3(PO4)2Â·8H2O) architecture with flower-like morphologies assembled from 2D microsheets are successfully synthesized at room temperature by a green precipitate process without adding any surfactant. The as-prepared architecture with an interconnecting 2D microsheets structure provide large nanoscale pore channels for ion transport, exhibits remarkable pseudocapacitive activities including good specific capacitance (350 F/g at 1 A/g), rate capability (227 F/g at 10 A/g), and excellent cycling stability (capacitance increase to retention 102% after 1000 cycles).
