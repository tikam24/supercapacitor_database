Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS), which is commonly used in Electric Vehicles (EV), is a combination of two energy storage devices. Supercapacitors (SC) due to their high charge/discharge rate, high power density, long lifetime in comparison to batteries, and capability of supporting high stress represent an optimal solution for HESS when combining with batteries. In such HESS configuration dc-dc converter is needed. Half-Controlled Converters (HCC) is an excellent solution due to their low cost and similar efficiency in comparison to the most used types of converters. In this paper, a strategy for power distribution between SC and battery, based on current control and a filter decoupling technique is proposed, along with the method to evaluate the decoupling frequency. The proposed strategy overtakes other approaches, such as fuzzy control or neural network, in terms of a faster and less complex implementation. Â© 2012 IEEE.
