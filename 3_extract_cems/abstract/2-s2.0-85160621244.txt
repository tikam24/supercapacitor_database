In the existing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategies, the power command, affected by the control parameters, does not have a definite value. Besides, the front-end DC-DC converter passively adjusts the output power of photovoltaic (PV) array according to the variation of DC bus voltage, so that the dynamic response of the PV side is relatively low. This paper proposes a LVRT control strategy under an asymmetrical fault for the two-staged grid-connected PV system based on the super-capacitor (SC). The proposed method mainly focuses on the dynamic response of the PV side, which can calculate the maximum output active power of the inverter according to its capacity. The SC converters at the both ends of the DC bus are used to stabilize the DC bus voltage, and the boost converter at the PV side is used for controlling the PV output power in order to match the output active power of the inverter quickly. The simulation results show that under the asymmetrical fault, the proposed method is able to stabilize the DC bus voltage and realize the rapid adjustment of the PV output power.
