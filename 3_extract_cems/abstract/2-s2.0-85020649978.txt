Stretchable energy storage devices are required to fit for stretchable electronic devices, forming a fully stretchable system for comfortable and body-attachable electronic devices. Herein, highly stretchable micro-supercapacitors are fabricated by designing wave-shaped hybrid multiwalled carbon nanotubes/polyaniline electrodes. As-fabricated stretchable devices exhibit a large areal capacitance of 44.13 mF cm−2 and offer a power density of 0.07 mW cm−2 at an area energy density of 0.004 mW h cm−2. Owing to the designed wavy electrode structure, the electrochemical performances of the stretchable micro-supercapacitors are almost invariably under different stretching stations ranging from 5% to 40%. By fabricating stretchable micro-supercapacitors arrays, a red light-emitting diode can be easily lighted under different conditions including stretching, twisting, crimping, and winding. All these results confirm the outstanding stability and mechanical strength of stretchable micro-supercapacitors, demonstrating its potential application in skin-patchable electronics or portable/wearable devices.
