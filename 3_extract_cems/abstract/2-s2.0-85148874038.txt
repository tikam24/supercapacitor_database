The emerging supercapattery imparts optimum electrochemical performance by synchronizing the admirable power density and cyclic stability of supercapacitors with the high energy density characteristic of batteries. The strong bonds of a metal center with an organic linker give rise to a unique group of porous materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Here, we state the synthesis and electrochemical analyzation of a copper-MOF and cobalt-MOF. The initial specific capacity revealed in the three-electrode assembly for the Cu-MOF and Co-MOF is 451 and 103 C g-1 at 3 mV s-1, respectively. Owing to the favorable characteristics of the Cu-MOF, a supercapattery device is fabricated as Cu-MOF//activated carbon. The device exhibits energy and power densities of 41 Wh g-1 and 2400 W kg-1, respectively, with a reversible capacity retention of 92% and coulombic efficiency of 99%. Moreover, to elucidate the capacitive and diffusive contributions of the battery-supercapacitor, Dunnâ€™s model is adapted. The favorable properties of the Cu-MOF electrode as a battery-grade material may be adapted for future energy storage applications.
