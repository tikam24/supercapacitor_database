An electric vehicle uses one or more electric motors or traction motors for propulsion. In this paper, an energy management strategy in electric vehicles with Fuel Cell (FC) as the primary source and a Super Capacitor (SC) and Solar Photovoltaic (PV) module as secondary sources is proposed. However, fuel cells also have disadvantages of being less efficient in high-demand conditions, the rate of power transfer getting slowed down during transient conditions and the cost per watt being high. Due to these reasons, fuel cells are used along with high power density and renewable sources to meet urgent high power needs synergistically in electric hybrid vehicles to cater to varying load demands during transient conditions. The proposed control strategy is about ensuring efficient and effective power management among these three diverse sources and is incorporated with the droop control algorithm using which power sharing is achieved under different load conditions.
