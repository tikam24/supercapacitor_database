Nanostructured carbon materials with tailor-made structures (e.g., morphology, topological defect, dopant, and surface area) are of significant interest for a variety of applications. However, the preparation method selected for obtaining these tailor-made structures determines the area of application, precluding their use in other technological areas of interest. Currently, there is a lack of simple and low-cost methodologies versatile enough for obtaining freestanding carbon nanostructures that can be used in either energy storage or chemical detection. Here, a novel methodology for the development of a versatile electrochemically active platform based on freestanding graphite nanoplatelets (GNP) has been developed by exploiting the interiors of hollow carbon nanofibers (CNF) comprising nanographene stacks using dry ball-milling. Even though ball-milling could be considered as a universal method for any carbonaceous material, often, it is not as simple (one step, no purification, and no solvents), efficient (just GNP without tubular structures), and quick (just 20 min) as the sustainable method developed in this work, free of surfactants and stabilizer agents. We demonstrate that the freestanding GNP developed in this work (with an average thickness of 3.2 nm), due to the selective edge functionalization with the minimal disruption of the basal plane, can act either as a supercapacitor or as a chemical sensor, showing both a dramatic improvement in the charge storage ability of more than 30 times and an enhanced detection of electrochemically active molecules such as ascorbic acid with a 236 mV potential shift with respect to CNF in both cases. As shown here, GNP stand as an excellent versatile alternative compared to the standard commercially available carbon-based materials. Overall, our approach paves the way for the discovery of new nanocarbon-based electrochemical active platforms with a wide electrochemical applicability.
