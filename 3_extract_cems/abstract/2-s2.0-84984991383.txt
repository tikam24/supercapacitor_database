In order to meet the demand for future electrochemical power source, electrochemical energy storage devices become an important subject. The electrode material has attracted much attention. This paper thus reviews some recent developments on the preparation of nano-structured transition metal nitrides and application for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. In particular, the design of nanostructured transition metal nitride material was discussed.
