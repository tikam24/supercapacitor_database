This research proposes an enhanced converter for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for a multi‐input bidirectional DC–DC power converter (MIPC). When batteries are used for energy storage, their charge and discharge rates are low, putting the battery under current stress and shortening its life. Because of their increased power density, supercapacitors (SCs) can react quickly to abrupt fluctuations and solve this problem. SCs, on the other hand, cannot be utilized for storage since they cannot provide power for prolonged periods of time. Batteries and supercapacitors are employed together in HESSs because their opposing characteristics make them an ideal pair for energy storage. An MIPC is used to connect the HESS to the DC microgrid. The MIPC allows for decoupled battery and SC power regulation, as well as energy transfer across storage devices inside the system. A controller has been developed to regulate both HESS charging and discharging operations, making it a unified controller for DC microgrid applications. The proposed model predictive control (MPC) provided better DC grid voltage restoration to step change in PV generation and load demand over the traditional proportional integral (PI) control scheme. The MPC method minimizes current strains, extends battery life and enhances overall system performance in response to a step change in PV power and load demand as well as providing quicker DC grid voltage control. Simulation and experimental data for the proposed controller were created by varying PV generation and load demand, resulting in faster DC link voltage regulation.
