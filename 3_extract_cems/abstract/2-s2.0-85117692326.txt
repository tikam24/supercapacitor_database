Polyoxometalate (POM)-based coordination hybrids not only integrate the benefits of POMs and transition-metal complexes perfectly, but also ameliorate the demerits of individual components, providing a prospective strategy to approach high performance supercapacitors. In this work, two new coordination hybrids [CoII(pzta)2(H2O)]2(H4GeMo12O40)·4H2O (1), and [CoII(pzta)2(H2O)]2(H4SiMo12O40)·4H2O (2), (3-pyrazinyl-1, 2, 4-triazole = pzta) were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and further confirmed by IR, PXRD and XPS techniques. Compounds 1 and 2 are isostructural compounds that only differ in the central atom of the Keggin clusters possessing POM-sandwiched porous structures. The electrochemical properties including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical active surface area, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of 1- and 2-based electrodes in the three-electrode system were studied in details. The results of electrochemical tests indicate that these electrodes possess high specific capacitance and good cycling stability. When the current density is 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance is 121.5 F g−1 for 1-based electrode, 182.0 F g−1 for 2-based electrode, 121.5 Fg−1 for [SiMo12O40]-based electrode and 46.2 Fg−1 for Co-pzta-based electrode. Therefore, the specific capacitance of 2-based electrode 1.5 times higher than that of parental POM [SiMo12O40]-based electrode and more than 3.9 times higher than that of Co-pzta-based electrode. Moreover, at the current density of 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate of 1000 cycles of cycle charge and discharge is 86% and 91% respectively. Thus, this work verifies that incorporating POMs with transition-metal complexes is an effective strategy for improving the capacitance performance of pure POMs.
