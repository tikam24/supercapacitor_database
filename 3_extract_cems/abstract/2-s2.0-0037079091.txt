Redox supercapacitors using polyaniline (PANI) coated, stainless-steel (SS) electrodes have been assembled and characterized. PANI has been deposited on SS substrate by a potentiodynamic method from an acidic electrolyte which contains aniline monomer. By employing stacks of electrodes, each with a geometrical area of 24cm2, in acidic perchlorate electrolyte, a capacitance value of about 450F has been obtained over a long cycle-life. Characterization studies have been carried out by galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling of the capacitors singly, as well as in series and parallel configurations. Various electrical parameters have been evaluated. Use of the capacitors in parallel with a battery for pulse-power loads, and also working of a toy fan connected to the charged capacitors have been demonstrated. A specific capacitance value of about 1300Fg-1 of PANI has been obtained at a discharge power of about 0.5kWkg-1. This value is several times higher than those reported in the literature for PANI and is, perhaps, the highest value known for a capacitor material. The inexpensive SS substrate and the high-capacitance PANI are favorable factors for commercial exploitation. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
