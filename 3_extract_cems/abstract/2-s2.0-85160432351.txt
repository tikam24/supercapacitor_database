The design of scalable electrode materials has been the subject of research in energy storage for the advancement of the field. Herewith, we report on the metal oxide-based nanomaterials which were synthesized via facile sonication strategy and calcination by forming nano-hybrid material, NiO/Fe2VO4 (VFN) with a size of 5–10 nm. Activated carbon (AC) based nanocomposite electrodes with VFN (5–15 %) were produced having excellent physicochemical properties and better conductivity. The nanocomposite electrodes showed promising electrochemical performance with anhydrous glycerol/KOH gel electrolyte in supercapacitor application. The device with C/VFN15 electrodes in symmetric cell configuration displayed an excellent specific capacitance of 290 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and specific energy of 40 Wh kg−1 at a power of 250 W kg−1 with non-aqueous electrolyte. The material exhibited promising cyclic stability up to 10,000 cycles retaining 90 % of its initial capacitance. In addition, a device with C/VFN15 was assembled and exhibited better performance and lighting a RGB LED under various angles.
