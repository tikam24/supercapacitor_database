In this work, we propose a novel and delicate strategy to significantly boost the supercapacitive performance of graphite felt (GF)@Co2(OH)2CO3 hybrid via a facile Ni−P electrodeposition on the pre-hydrothermally generated GF@Co2(OH)2CO3 (denoted as GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P). Electrochemical measurements show that the areal specific capacitances of the resulting GF@Ni−P, GF@Co2(OH)2CO3 and GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P are 118, 1022 and 1360 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. Besides, 72.8% of specific capacitance can be maintained upon rising the current density from 1 to 20 mA cm−2 for GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P, far higher than 47.0% for GF@Co2(OH)2CO3. More strikingly, the assembled all-solid-state flexible symmetric supercapacitor GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P//KOH//GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P delivers high energy densities of 46.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1, and 20.7 Wh kg−1 at elevated 5.0 kW kg−1, surpassing most of the reported analogues. Moreover, the device holds 92.9% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Such substantially enhanced electrochemical performance of GF@Co2(OH)2CO3@Ni−P owes to the improvement of the electronic conductivity by the Ni−P coating and the reinforced synergic effect contributing to the capacitance between the active Co2(OH)2CO3 and Ni species including Ni−P and Ni−OH species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the coating of Ni−P onto inorganic metal compounds for energy-storage/conversion systems.
