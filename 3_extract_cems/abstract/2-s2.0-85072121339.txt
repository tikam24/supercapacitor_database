Graphene is a flat monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. Graphene has many outstanding properties such as high electron mobility, superb strength, transparency and great flexibility. These exotic properties make graphene a promising candidate for solar cell, fuel cell, battery, supercapacitor and so on. In this report, we have studied the effect of acetic acid pre-treatment on the growth temperature of graphene on copper by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In case of graphene growth without acetic acid pre-treatment, the high temperature of 1000 °C is needed for the growth of graphene by CVD. In contrast, the growth temperature can be decreased to 800 °C for graphene growth with acetic acid pre-treatment. We found that acetic acid pre-treatment can eliminate copper oxide from the sample surface resulting in the growth temperature of graphene decreases.
