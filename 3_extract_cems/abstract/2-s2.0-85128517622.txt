Ever since their discovery in 2011, a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have amassed a lot of attention owing to their inherent electronic conductivity, rich surface chemistry and superior hydrophilicity, which have made them a prospective candidate for application in energy conversion as well as electrochemical storage. In this chapter, we aim to summarize the recent advances in MXene and MXene-based hybrids for supercapacitor applications while also highlighting the current bottlenecks and new opportunities.
