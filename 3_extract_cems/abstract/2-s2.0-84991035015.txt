Carbon-carbon (C/C) nanocomposites based on nanodispersed carbon black and pyrolytic carbon obtained with matrix synthesis are investigated. The work presents the results of electrochemical tests on prototype samples of C/C nanocomposites as the components of electrochemical capacitors electrodes with the solutions of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) in water and tetraethylammonium tetrafuoroborate (TEABF4) in acetonitrile acting as electrolytes. The research demonstrated the interrelation of the electrode components size factor and the supercapacitor electrochemical properties, and also the prospects of C/C nanocomposites application as the basis for supercapacitors electrodes with high-energy electrolytes.
