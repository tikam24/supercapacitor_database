We describe in this paper the synthesis and the characterization of Li4Ti5O12-reduced graphene oxide (LTO-RGO) composite and demonstrate their use as hybrid supercapacitor, which is consist of an LTO negative electrode and activate carbon (AC) positive electrode. The LTO-RGO composites were synthesized using a simple, one-step process, in which lithium sources and titanium sources were dissolved in a graphene oxide (GO) suspension and then thermal treated in N2. The lithium-ion battery with LTO-RGO composite anode electrode revealed higher discharge capacity (167 mAh gâˆ’1 at 0.2 C) and better capacity retention (67%) than the one with pure LTO. Meanwhile, compared with the AC//LTO supercapacitor, the AC//LTO-RGO hybrid supercapacitor exhibits higher energy density and power density. Results show that the LTO-RGO composite is a very promising anode material for hybrid supercapacitor.
