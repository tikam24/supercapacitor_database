Supercapacitors are a new generation of energy storage systems, but their low energy densities need to be improved depending on their capacitance and operating voltage range. In this study, the effect of dyes such as hydroxy naphthol blue (HNB), methyl orange (MO) and thymol blue (TB) on the electrochemical performance of polypyrrole coated on carbon cloth as electrode material in supercapacitors was analysed. The results of this study reveal that dye-functionalized polypyrrole shows higher specific capacitance than forms of polypyrrole. Among all the three electrode materials PPy/HNB electrode showed highest capacity of 108.0 F g−1 at the current density of 0.4 A g−1. Additionally, a maximum energy density of 135.6 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 40.0 kW kg−1 were attained by the PPy/HNB symmetric supercapacitor. The device exhibits stability for 5000 cycles and a 91.06% capacitance retention.
