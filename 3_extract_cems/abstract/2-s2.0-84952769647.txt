In this chapter, Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) is considered with dual energy storage sources. In order to respond to a transient power demand, usually battery energy storage device is combined with super capacitor. Battery-super capacitor system is used to create an energy storage system with the high energy density attributes of batteries and the high power density of super capacitor. In order to simulate the PEV model, dynamic state space models of bidirectional DC-DC converter and grid connected voltage source converter with energy storage models are considered to connect the PEV to the main grid. In order to stabilize the DC-link power and distribute the power between dual energy storage sources in PEV during normal and disturbance conditions on the grid voltage, a Lyapunov based Neuro-Fuzzy control strategy has been developed. This controller determines the super capacitor power that should be generated according to the amount of available energy in DC-link. Moreover, a robust sliding mode control strategy for voltage source converter based on positive and negative symmetrical components is presented to investigate the voltage disturbance ride-through and voltage control capability.
