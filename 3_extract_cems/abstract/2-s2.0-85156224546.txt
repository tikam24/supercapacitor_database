Herein, we report the large-scale synthesis and compare the effect of transition metal oxide (Co3O4/Fe3O4) nanoparticles assistance on electrochemical energy storage performance of zinc oxide (ZnO)-graphene oxide (GO)-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites. The resultant quaternary nanoarchitectonics composites of Co3O4–ZnO–GO–PANI (S1) and Fe3O4–ZnO–GO–PANI (S2) exhibit layered fibrous structure on the surface, where these fibers form a porous and mesh-like network. The systematic electrochemical analyses reveal that S1 has better electrochemical performance as compared to S2. Specifically, S1 has a higher specific capacitance (246.33 F/g) relative to S2 (110.17 F/g) at a current density of 1 A/g due to higher reduction potential of Co (+ 1.81 V) than that of Fe (0.77 V). This higher potential causes Co to be more reactive in the redox transitions than Fe. Moreover, the enhanced ionic intercalation and improved electrical conductivity associated with their specific morphology plays a role to enhance the energy storage performances. Therefore, Co3O4–ZnO–GO–PANI nanoarchitectonics composite can be used as a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage device fabrication.
