The work proposed in this paper deals with the influence of a DC/DC power converter choice on the performance of the Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) in electric vehicle applications. The HESS is composed of Li-ion battery and supercapacitor coupled to a DC/DC power converter. A basic study of the different association topologies between the HESS and the power converters is carried out. Then, an improved method of designing power converters using the PowerForge professional platform is developed in parallel with MATLAB environments. Finally, a comparison of the estimated number of supercapacitor and battery cells, weight and volume of the HESS for different driving cycles (ARTEMIS, WLTP, NEDC, FTP-75) is made. The obtained results, show the good performance and the time saving of the power converters sizing methods used and confirm the feasibility of our approach.
