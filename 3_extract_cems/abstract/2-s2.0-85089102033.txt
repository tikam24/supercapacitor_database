Nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) have engrossed substantial research curiosity because of their broad diversity of applications in catalysis, solar cells, biosensors, energy storage devices, etc. Among the various NTMOs, manganese oxides and their composites were highlighted for the applications in Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors as electrode materials owing to their environmental friendly nature and various oxidation states. This review concerns the deposition, characterization, and applications of nanostructured manganese oxide thin films (NMOTFs) during the few decades. The deposition and characterization of NMOTFs are discussed. Characterization discussed here enlightens the structural and morphological studies. The focus of the application section includes Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
