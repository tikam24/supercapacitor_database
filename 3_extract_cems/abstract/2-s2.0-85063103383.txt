The Activated Carbon/rGO supercapacitor electrode from coconut shell (Cocos nucifera) in this research has been successfully synthesized using dry mixing method. In this study the mass composition of composite used 10 wt% rGO and 90 wt% Activated Carbon. To find out the capacitance of the electrode was performed cyclic voltammetric characterization at a scan rate of 1-5 mVs-1 in a 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Electrode characteristic test used is BET and CV test. The CV characterization results show the best capacitance value occurs at scan rate of 1 mV/s ie 336 Fg-1. At a low scan ra te on cyclic voltammetry, the electrons have a long time to diffuse evenly to the electrode surface and the greater the charge transfer resulting in higher capacitance values. Conversely, the higher the scan rate, the electrons can diffuse rapidly and the charge transfer process on the electrode surface is very limited.
