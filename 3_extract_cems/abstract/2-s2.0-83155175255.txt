An electrode material based on polypyrrole (PPy) doped with graphene oxide (GO) sheets was synthesized via in situ polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of GO in various proportions (5% and 10%). The synthesized samples were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and electrical conductivity measurements. FTIR spectroscopy and XRD revealed the interaction between GO and PPy. The direct-current (DC) electrical conductivity (75.8 S/cm) of the prepared composites was dramatically enhanced compared with pure PPy (1.18 S/cm). High specific capacitance of PPy/GO composite of 421.4 F/g was obtained in the potential range from 0 V to 0.50 V at 2 mA compared with 237.2 F/g for pure PPy by galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis. Incorporation of GO into the PPy matrix has a pronounced effect on the electrical conductivity and electrochemical capacitance performance of PPy/GO nanocomposites. Â© 2011 TMS.
