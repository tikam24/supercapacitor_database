In this study, we described a simple hydrothermal method to synthesize hollow urchin-like manganese dioxide without any template and surfactant. 3D Hollow urchin-like manganese dioxide was consisted of single manganese dioxide tube with stable structure. Its unique structure is beneficial to improve the specific capacitance. The specific capacity is 254.6 F · g-1 in 1 mol · L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 1 mV · s-1. Over 97.5% of the first cycle capacitance was retained after repeating the galvanostatic charge-discharge for 1 000 cycles. This nanomaterial could be used to supercapacitor which exhibited excellent stability and capacitive properties, indicating its potential application to act as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
