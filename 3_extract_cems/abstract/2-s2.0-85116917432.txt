A facile and effective approach to assemble graphene hybridized multiple manganese oxides /grapheme (m-MnO2/Gr) was explored. The structure varied from two-dimensional (2D) to one-dimensional (1D) club-shaped manganese oxides via blending of Gr into the molten salt precursor. Compared to the m-MnO2 and pristine Gr electrode, the m-MnO2/Gr composites displayed a superior synergistic effect in promoted capacitive performance, exhibiting the specific capacitance of 90 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and cycle performance with capacity retention of about 90% after 2000 charge-discharge cycles. It expects to supply a promising strategy to synthesize large scalable production of hybrid supercapacitor electrode.
