Three-dimensional (3D) electrodes, which are composed of thin inorganic pseudocapacitive nanowire networks, show high electrochemical capacities and excellent cyclic performance because of their high surface area, convenient ion/electron transport and mechanical stability. Herein, we reported the hydrothermal preparation of a 3D ultra-thin Ni/Co basic carbonate nanowire network with the aid of a small amount of graphene oxide (GO) (6 wt%) as both the binder and the conductive filler. Through using an electrochemical cyclic process, the Ni/Co basic carbonate nanowires were subsequently in situ converted to Ni/Co hydroxide nanowires with high electrochemical capacitance. The specific capacitance of the Ni/Co hydroxide nanowire/rGO hybrid networks achieved 1434 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the sample has no loss during the 5000 charge/discharge cycles. This Ni/Co hydroxide nanowire/rGO composite can be used to prepare asymmetric supercapacitors with high performance.
