Pure and bimetallic transition metal oxides have been very attracted for catalysts, energy storage and magnetic applications. Herein, FeNi oxide and pure Fe2O3 cubes synthesized by the hydrothermal method, and ferromagnetic multiphase FeNi oxide and pure Fe3O4 were first shown to be induced by water-gas shift reaction (WGSR). The multiphase FeNi oxide showed a saturation magnetization of 88.7 emu/g at 1.8 K with the Verwey transition point at 120 K. For comparison, pure paramagnetic Fe2O3 cubes were found to be changed to ferromagnetic (83.1 emu/g) Fe3O4 upon WGSR. The WGSR-induced multiphase FeNi oxide was found to be active at temperatures as low as 220 °C, much lower than 500 °C for pure Fe oxides. The FeNi oxide cubes showed a specific capacitance of 104 F/g at a current density of 1.67 A/g, higher than 67 F/g for pure Fe oxide. The WGSR-induced magnetic materials and their fundamental properties provide useful information on the development of magnetic transition metal oxide materials for diverse applications.
