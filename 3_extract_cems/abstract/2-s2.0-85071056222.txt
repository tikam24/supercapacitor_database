Supercapacitors (SCs) are being considered the next-generation power storage devices due to the many favorable properties. In this regard, mesoporous nanostructures are excellent supercapacitor electrodes as they enjoy a large number of active sites and high surface area promising the utilization of the full capacitance of the active materials. In this study, we report on the assembly of electrospun, binder-free mesoporous Mn0.56V0.42O@C fibrous electrodes. The morphological and structural analyses of the fabricated Mn0.56V0.42O@C electrodes were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and GAXRD confirm the formation of Mn0.56V0.42O nanofibers and their successful bonding to carbon during crystal growth. Those fibrous composite electrodes showed excellent specific capacitance of 668.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1. The highly obtained capacitance is attributed to the multiple oxidation states of the Mn-V oxides, the binder-free electrodes, surface roughness, and the mesoporous nature of the fabricated nanofibers. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of the mesoporous Mn0.56V0.42O@C nanofibers as the positive electrode and graphene hydrogel as the negative electrode possesses ultrahigh energy density of 37.77 W h kg-1 and a power density of 900 W kg-1 with superior Coulombic efficiency over 13 000 charge-discharge cycles.
