The research on supercapacitors has been attractive due to their large power density, fast charge/discharge speed and long lifespan. The electrode materials for supercapacitors are thus intensively investigated to improve the electrochemical performances. Various transition metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with a hydrotalcite-like structure have been developed to be promising electrode materials. Earth-abundant metal hydroxides are very suitable electrode materials due to the low cost and high specific capacity. This is a review paper on NiMn LDHs for supercapacitor application. We focus particularly on the recent published papers using NiMn LDHs as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The preparation methods for NiMn LDHs are introduced first. Then, the structural design and chemicalmodification of NiMn LDHmaterials, as well as the composites and films derived from NiMn LDHs are discussed. These approaches are proven to be effective to enhance the performance of supercapacitor. Finally, the reports related to NiMn LDH-based asymmetric supercapacitors are summarized. A brief discussion of the future development of NiMn LDHs is also provided.
