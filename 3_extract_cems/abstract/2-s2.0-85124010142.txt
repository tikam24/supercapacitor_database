The power gap between supply and demand in the microgrid caused by the uncertainty of wind and solar output and users’ electricity consumption needs to be absorbed by the hybrid energy storage devices and the demand‐side electricity price response. To maximize the service life of the lithium battery pack, this paper optimizes a reasonable ratio of the supercapacitor pack’s daily charge and discharge times to the daily cycle times of the lithium battery pack. The model construction includes two parts: power prediction and multi‐objective optimization modeling. In the case study, a microgrid district under the Guizhou Power Grid is analyzed and discussed. Based on the predicted wind output, solar output, and load demand on a certain day, the optimal scheduling results have been obtained. On the one hand, a reasonable ratio regarding the daily charge and discharge times of hybrid energy storage devices has been obtained under the optimized parameter k in the model. Correspondingly, the daily operation and maintenance of the lithium battery pack is minimum. On the other hand, when the hybrid energy storage devices and demand‐side electricity price response are included and not, the changes on the supply and demand sides (a) and of three evaluation indicators (b) are compared, respectively. Thus, the effectiveness of the model in this paper is verified.
