Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and iron pyrite (FeS2) films are good to enhance the electrochromic devices as they serve as a surface stabilizer, nanoparticle dispersant, growth modifier, and reducing agent. The synthesis of FeS2 with PVP provides an easy pathway for electrolyte penetration which can improve the electrochemical performances in supercapacitor applications. In this work, we report a facile single-step chemical bath deposition technique to synthesis the FeS2/PVP on Ni foam for the first time. The broad bean-like nanostructure of FeS2 is fully covered with PVP nanoparticles and formed like a coagulation nanostructure on Ni foam. The FeS2/PVP/NF composite was evaluated as an efficient electrode for supercapacitor in 3 M KOH solution, exhibited a greater specific capacitance of 526.08 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, high cyclic stability, remain 91.2% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles and high rate capability which is higher compared to bare FeS2/NF electrode (434.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and cyclic stability of 76.7%). The remarkable electrochemical performance of FeS2/PVP/NF composite is attributed to its enhanced electroactive sites, higher surface area, fast electron, and ion transport pathway and most importantly for its facile electrolyte infiltration into the FeS2/PVP/NF.
