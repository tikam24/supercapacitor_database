Interfacial composite with improved carrier separation is promising to achieve multifunctionality and thus contribute to the carbon neutrality and sustainability of our society. Herein, we demonstrate a facile defect-assisted photo-reduction strategy to rationally design interfacial rGO/WO3−x composites with versatile properties. Under light irradiation, the accumulated electrons in oxygen-defective WO3−x endow partial restoration of the π network within GO nanosheets. The in-situ formed rGO/WO3−x not only broadens optical absorption but also accelerates carrier migration, enabling superior gas-sensing, photocatalytic and energy storage applications. When used as sensing material of smart sensors, the resultant rGO/WO3−x exhibits high response (8.4), low detection limit (92 ppb), good selectivity, fast response, and long-term stability (7 weeks) to ppm-level triethylamine. As an efficient photocatalyst, the photocatalytic kinetic of rGO/WO3−x towards visible-light-driven RhB degradation is promoted about 7 times as compared with that of pristine WO3−x. The synergism of suitable components endows the rGO/WO3−x supercapacitor with high capacity (380F/g) over prolonged cycling. This work provided a successful approach for in-situ formation of interfacial composites and thus broadens the material's versatility for advanced nanotechnology.
