The fabrication of high performance supercapacitor electrodes has been greatly investigated for future high power storage applications. In this present work, chromium oxide-cobalt oxide based nanocomposite (Cr2O3–Co3O4 NC) was synthesized using the hydrothermal approach. Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) study reveals the Cr2O3–Co3O4 NC delivers a high specific capacitance of 619.4 F/g at 10 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of Cr2O3–Co3O4 NC possess the solution resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 0.68 Ω and 0.03 Ω respectively. The Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis demonstrated the prolonged charge-discharge time and good rate capability of the Cr2O3–Co3O4 NC. The cyclic stability of Cr2O3–Co3O4 NC delivers superior capacitive retention of 83% even after 2000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device based on Cr2O3–Co3O4//AC yielded an energy density of 4.3 Wh/kg at the corresponding power density of 200 W/kg. Furthermore, the ASC delivers superior cyclic stability of 74.8% even after 1000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles.
