A hierarchical hybrid structure of cuprous sulfide (Cu 2 S) nanoparticles anchored graphene (Cu 2 S/RGO) has been successfully synthesized through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The Cu 2 S nanoparticles with a size in the range of 10-30 nm are uniformly deposited onto the double sides of the RGO nanosheets to form a sandwich structure. Electrochemical tests demonstrate that the as-synthesized Cu 2 S/RGO hybrids have an improved specific capacitance of 208 F g -1 at a current density of 1.0 A g -1 . The Cu 2 S/RGO exhibit higher cycling and rate performances than corresponding Cu 2 S nanoparticles mainly attributed to the unique structural properties of Cu 2 S/RGO hybrids, which combine a non-aggregation of graphene layers and well distribution of Cu 2 S nanoparticles.
