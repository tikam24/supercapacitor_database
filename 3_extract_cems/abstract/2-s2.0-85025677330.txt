Today most machines in industrial automation are build without UPS functionality. In case of a mains failure, a DC-link extension for drives can be used to maintain the voltage of the DC-link at a specified level to bypass the failure without disturbance and/or to bring the machine to a controlled stop. Supercapacitors provide peak power and back-up power. A smart supercapacitor (SC) based DC-link extension can offer uninterruptable power supply (UPS) capability and acts also as an energy efficient line regeneration replacement. Peak power requirements for acceleration and deceleration can be provided by the SC based energy storage system. The size of the AC power supply can be reduced to lower power ratings.
