The research of novel materials with good performance and unique microstructures is a hot topic in the field of materials science. However, for the materials such as nanocrystals, polycrystals and nanoclusters, the influences of materials phase and state on their property are still challenge due to the limitation of traditional characterization techniques. In this work, mono-dispersed cobalt-oxide nanoclusters encapsulated in a typical structured carbon have been synthesized. The hybrids possess ordered mesoporous structure, high specific surface area (1000–1160 m2/g), well-dispersed uniform cobalt-oxide nanoclusters and improved wettability, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. Importantly, the phases of the nanoclusters heat-treated at various temperatures have been investigated by XAS technique. It demonstrates that Co3O4 nanoclusters are formed in the hybrids heat-treated at 500 °C with size of ~5 nm. The button supercapacitors fabricated with the hybrids exhibit a high power density of 750.2 W/kg with good electrochemical stability.
