A typical flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor (FSCs) is proposed based on mesoporous Bi2MoO6 quasi-nanospheres (MBiN) on activated carbon cloth (ACC) hybrid electrode for improving the energy storage density and cyclic stability in this work. Specifically, MBiN is anchored directly on the surface of ACC via an in situ growth routine by using covalent bonding interactions, which shows an ideal pore diameter of 6.46 nm, a large specific area of 233.31 m2 g−1, and a small average particle size of ~40 nm. Benefit from MBiN and ACC features, the optimized supercapacitor based on MBiN/ACC flexible electrodes displays an ultrahigh mass capacitance (345.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and an excellent rate performance (181.2 F g−1 at 5 A g−1) coupled with a satisfactory capacitance retention of 90.2% after 10000 GCD cycles. Notably, its energy density values up to 110.4 Wh·kg−1 at a power density of 1429.6 W kg−1. Furthermore, ACC substrate endows the device with the excellent strength and flexibility under various bending states.
