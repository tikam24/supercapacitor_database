A thin film binder-free Co-Mn composite oxide (MnCo2O 4) electrode was fabricated by using electroless-electrolytic (EE) techniques that is amenable to continuous processing and used for supercapacitor applications. The composite oxide was characterized by XRD, XPS and LIBS. A specific capacitance around 832 F g-1 at a scan rate of 20 mV s -1 was obtained using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and a nearly rectangular-shaped CV curve observed for the composite oxide. When tested in a symmetrical cell setup, the EE electrode yielded a specific capacitance of 240 F g-1 at 74 A g-1 with an energy density of 21 Wh kg -1 and 51.6 kW kg-1 of power density. This work suggests the binder-free Co-Mn composite electrode by the low temperature EE method is a promising candidate for high performing supercapacitors. Â© 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.
