As an alternative to binder-based overlay of carbon powder on the current collector, the precursor sol may be carbonized directly on the current collector for the purpose of making supercapacitor electrodes. The disintegration of precursor sol into fine droplets prior to the deposition and subsequent removal of solvent from the deposited gel through lyophilization may enhance the internal surface area and the pore connectivity. This article presents the impedance spectroscopy analysis of such electrodes and reports the resistance to transport of electrolyte ions in such pore network through meaningful equivalent circuits. Neutral, alkaline, and acidic electrolytes were considered in this study. Multiple levels of hierarchy in the pore network are considered here to ascertain the extent of heterogeneity and branching in the pore structure. The electrodes from the binder-based overlay of carbon powder are studied here for comparison. The method of spray coating, followed by in situ carbonization seems to have produced a pore structure, which is less branched. The resistance to access the internal surface is more uniform over the entire domain for such electrodes. The equivalent series resistance was found significantly smaller for these electrodes.
