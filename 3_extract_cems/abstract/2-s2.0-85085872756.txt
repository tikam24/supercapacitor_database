Emerging technologies, such as portable electronics, have had a huge impact on societal norms, such as access to real time information. To perform these tasks, portable electronic devices need more and more accessories for the processing and dispensation of the data, resulting in higher demand for energy and power. To overcome this problem, a low cost high-performing flexible fiber shaped asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated, exploiting 3D-spinel manganese oxide Mn3O4 as cathode and 2D molybdenum disulfide MoS2 as anode. These asymmetric supercapacitors with stretched operating voltage window of 1.8 V exhibit high specific capacitance and energy density, good rate capability and cyclic stability after 3000 cycles, with a capacitance retention of more than 80%. This device has also shown an excellent bending stability at different bending conditions.
