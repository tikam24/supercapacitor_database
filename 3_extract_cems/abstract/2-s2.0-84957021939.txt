In order to move away from the carbon-based energy technologies, electrochemical energy production and storage is under serious consideration as an alternative energy/power source. The future success of this global effort is under review, and researchers are looking forward to designing more sustainable and environmentally friendly electrochemical energy storage and conversion (EESC) systems. Electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems in the broadest sense have three variants: batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical capacitors, also known as supercapacitors. The energy storage and conversion mechanisms in these three systems are different, but the energy-providing processes in these systems-all follow solid state and surface interface chemistry, taking place in active electrode materials and at the phase boundary of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Also, all three systems consist of two electrodes which are in contact with the electrolyte but separated by a membrane. Conventional materials used in these systems cannot meet the ever-increasing demand for energy. Thereby, designing efficient and miniaturized EESC devices that achieve high energy storage or delivery at high charge and discharge rates and with lifetimes capable of matching the specific requirements of applications is one of the major challenges facing todayâ€™s research community. Thereby, this chapter will review some of the recent developments (2010-2012) in the fabrication of nanostructured electrode materials by electrochemical methods and their application in the fuel cells and supercapacitors. Furthermore, novel nanowire-/nanoparticle-based electrodeposited nano-heterostructures (Armand M, Tarascon JM, Nature 451:652, 2008; Chmiola J, Largeot C, Taberna PL, Simon P, Gogotsi Y, Science 328:480, 2010; Tarascon JM, Armand M, Nature 414:359, 2001) and their advantages over conventional electrode materials will be discussed.
