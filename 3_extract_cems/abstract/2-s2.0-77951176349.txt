We report the fabrication and characterization of conductive Pt fiber mats as the conducting core of a high rate redox supercapacitor. Electrospun Pt fiber mats calcined at 350°C exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 412 S cm-1 as well as highly porous morphologies composed of 10 nm crystalline Pt nanoparticles. The Pt fiber mats served as the conducting core for electrochemically deposited hydrous RuO2 overlayers. The hybrid electrode utilizing hydrous RuO2 -coated Pt fiber mats showed a high specific capacitance of ∼409.4 F g-1 and high rate capability with a capacity loss of only 21.4% from 10 to 1000 mV s-1. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
