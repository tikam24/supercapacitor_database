Correction for 'Simultaneous sulfur doping and exfoliation of graphene from graphite using an electrochemical method for supercapacitor electrode materials' by Nazish Parveen et al., J. Mater. Chem. A, 2016, 4, 233-240. Due to errors in eqn (1) and (2) the following parts of the above paper have been corrected as described below. On page 238 eqn (1) and (2) should be as follows:1-5 (Equion Presented) In the abstract on page 233 the specific capacitance exhibited by the S-GN electrode should be stated as 275 F g-1 at a current of 3mA. On page 237 the specific capacitance of GN and S-GN should be reported as 70 and 81.25 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1 and 40.44 and 51.56 at 100 mV s-1, respectively. On page 238 the capacitance values of the S-GN electrodes should be stated to be calculated as 275, 260 and 120 F g-1 at 3, 5 and 10 mA, respectively. On page 238 the maximum energy density should be reported as 9.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 375.7 W kg-1 in 3 M KOH electrolyte and an energy density of 4.1 W h kg-1 was maintained at a high power density of 1242 W kg-1. The correct Fig. 7c and d are shown below. (Figure presented). The Royal Society of Chemistry apologises for these errors and any consequent inconvenience to authors and readers.
