A sandwich-structured porous supercapacitor electrode layered by MnO2/Polyaniline/MnO2 (MPM) was constructed by electrochemical deposition and in situ polymerization method. As a supercapacitor electrode, it had uniform mesoporous structure and a fast electron transport high-way due to the electrochemical deposition method and the middle thin layer of conductive polyaniline which could dramatically enhance the conductivity of MnO2. In three-electrode system, this sandwich-structured MPM electrode has superior capacitive performance to electrode which consists of only two layers of MnO2 (MM).
