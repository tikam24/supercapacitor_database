The practical energy storage applications of metal sulfides are greatly hindered by their unsatisfactory specific capacity, inferior rate capability and poor stability. In this work, monolithic Ni3S2@PEDOT arrays are rationally designed by surface engineering as robust binder-free cathode to boost the electrochemical performances of asymmetric supercapacitor and aqueous Ni–Zn battery. Benefiting from the unique protective and conductive PEDOT shell to accelerate the electron/ion transport and provide a large interfacial area, the monolithic Ni3S2@PEDOT array displays a ultrahigh reversible specific capacitance (1589.3 F g−1 at 2.0 A g−1) and favorable rate capability (75.5% of initial capacity retention under 10 A g−1). The assembled Ni3S2@PEDOT//active carbon asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a remarkable capacity of 243.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding cycling durability (only 2.4% decay within 4000 cycles). Moreover, the aqueous Ni3S2@PEDOT//Zn battery reveals an admirable specific capacity 261.9 mAh g−1 under 3.13 A g−1 while only reaching 2.7% capacity attenuation within 2000 cycles. Furthermore, the aqueous rechargeable Ni3S2@PEDOT//Zn battery presents an impressive energy density 456.4 Wh kg−1, together with a peak power density 5.45 kW kg−1. These encouraging results offer compelling insights for the design of high-performance metal sulfides and numerous electronics, electric vehicle applications in the future.
