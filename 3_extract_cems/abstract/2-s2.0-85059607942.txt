Due to white pollution related environmental concern and sustainable development requirement, it is desirable to recycle the widely used plastic wastes into products with commercial value, such as high-valued carbon materials which can be applied in electrochemical fields. In this work, porous carbon flakes (PCFs) are produced by direct pyrolysis of polystyrene waste through template method. Furthermore, manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) nanosheets are selectively deposited on the surface of resultant PCFs to form hybrid (PCF-MnO 2 ). Because of the large specific surface area (1087 m 2 /g) and high conductivity of PCFs, native high specific capacity of MnO 2 , and positive synergistic interaction between PCF and MnO 2 , the resulting hybrid materials show an ultrahigh capacitance of 308 F/g at 1 mV/s and 247 F/g at 1 A/g in LiCl electrolyte, and excellent cycle stability of 93.4% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g in symmetric supercapacitor device. This work demonstrates a convenient method for the preparation of cost-effective and high-performance electrode material for electric capacitor. More importantly, it provides a potential way to recycle polystyrene waste into high-valued product in large-scale with disposing of polymeric waste to alleviate environmental concerns.
