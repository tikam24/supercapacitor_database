A nanoflake manganese oxide (Mn2O3) electrode was deposited by the galvanostatic electrodeposition method. The nanoflake Mn2O3 electrode was characterised by using various characterization techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and surface wettability. The testing of the Mn2O3 electrode as a supercapacitor was carried out with the help of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The XRD study reveals the formation of cubic crystal symmetry for the Mn2O3 electrode. The SEM image shows that the Mn2O3 electrode exhibits nanoflake like morphology. The surface wettability study shows that the Mn2O3 electrode is hydrophilic in nature. The Mn2O3 film electrode shows a maximum specific capacitance of 414 F g−1 calculated using CV techniques in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 with 86% cycling stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoflake Mn2O3 electrodes are suitable for supercapacitor applications.
