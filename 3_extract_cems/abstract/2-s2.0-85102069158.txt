This paper proposes an extended droop control strategy for dynamic transient power-sharing between supercapacitor (SC) and AC grid to manage the power demand in the DC microgrid. The proposed control strategy utilizes a virtual impedance droop structure with the SC converter and a virtual resistor droop structure with the grid rectifier, which are responsible for splitting the load power into transient and average load power, respectively. Load transient caused by a sudden change in the load is buffered by supercapacitor and additional average load power demand is supplied by the grid. The working methods of the proposed control strategy and the design of the system are explained, and theoretical analyses are verified by simulations.
