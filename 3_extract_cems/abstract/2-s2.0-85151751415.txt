Supercapacitors tend to deliver energy at a very swift rate and as such are important energy devices. With the continuous rise in demand for efficient energy storing devices and rising interest in portable and flexible electronics, supercapacitors are widely and constantly explored over recent years. The flexible and wearable supercapacitors exhibit numerous functional and physical features and are classified as fiber-like, paper-like, and three-dimension porous supercapacitors respectively based on the micro-structures and macroscopic patterns. The integration of supercapacitors into textiles and flexible microstructures offers promising and unique characteristics in the field of wearable supercapacitors. The possibilities pertaining to the design and fabrication of these devices are complex and vary with numerous materials with various configurations. This chapter provides an overview related to flexible supercapacitor material and its design aspects.
