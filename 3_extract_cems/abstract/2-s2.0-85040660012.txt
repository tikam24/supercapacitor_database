Photovoltaic energy is very important to meet the consumption needs of electrical energy in remote areas and for other applications. Energy storage systems are essential to avoid the intermittent production of photovoltaic energy and to cover peaks in energy demand. The super capacitor, also known as electrochemical double layer capacitor, is a storage device which has a very high power density compared to conventional battery and is capable of storing a large amount of electrical energy in short time periods, which reflects its interest to be used for the storage of photovoltaic energy. From this principle, this paper represents a three-branch RC model of super capacitor to describe its different dynamics of operation during the charging, discharging and rest phases. After having validated the good functioning of this model with the experimental study of Zubieta, The super capacitor performance has been demonstrated and compared with a conventional battery in a photovoltaic converter chain to power AC machine.
