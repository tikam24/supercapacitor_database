In this work, a simple and controllable approach has been developed to construct unique Bi2MoO6 nanoplate structures via low cost DNA-templated hydrothermal route. The structure and surface morphologies of Bi2MoO6 specimens with an addition of various concentrations of DNA template were studied systematically through different characterization techniques. The morphological analysis of the freshly prepared Bi2MoO6 specimen with DNA template shows a uniform nanoplate structure with better regularity than that of bare Bi2MoO6 particles. Furthermore, electrochemical properties of all the freshly prepared Bi2MoO6 specimens were evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometric (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. Among the various Bi2MoO6 specimens, the optimal BM-3 (Bi2MoO6 specimen synthesized using 40 ml of DNA solution) electrode material exhibits a remarkable performance with an appreciably high specific capacitance of 698 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and possessing an excellent cycling stability of 86% of initial capacitance retention, even after 3000 continuous CV cycles at the high scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in an aqueous 1 M NaOH electrolyte solution. Hence, the typical DNA-templated Bi2MoO6 nanoplate material (BM-3) could be employed as a potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
