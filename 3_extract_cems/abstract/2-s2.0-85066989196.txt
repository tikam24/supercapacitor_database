The paper describes the design of the device that is used to improve performance of internal combustion engine starting system, especially, in cold weather, extend lifetime of starting battery and eliminate voltage drop during starting process. As additional energy storage supercapacitors are utilized due to high power density, low series resistance and superior cycle performance. The addition storage is connected through controllable switch to increase stored energy and connect additional storage only when it is required. A prototype is tested under real conditions; experimental results are registered and included in the paper. The results shows that such device significantly reduces current from the battery and provides successful cold cranking of the engine.
