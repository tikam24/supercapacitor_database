Here we present for the first time, a high-performance supercapacitor based on PANI@Co-Porphyrins composite electrode. The evaluation of new supercapacitor has been achieved by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GSCD) tests in 1.0 M H2SO4 solution. The as-prepared composite is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The incorporation of Co-Porphyrins nanoparticles into polyaniline (PANI) enhances greatly the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor. The new supercapacitor based on PANI@Co-Porphyrins composite electrode displays superior specific capacitance of 823 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Further increasing the current density to 20 A g−1, leads to a decrease in Cs values to reach to 560 F g−1. The capacitance retention is maintained at nearly 91% after 1000 cycles. As well, the supercapacitor yields an optimum energy density and power density in the range from 41 to 27 Wh kg−1 and 150 to 5856 W kg−1, respectively.
