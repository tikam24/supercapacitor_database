Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) have been employed as catalysts for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Nonetheless, the preparation of such nanoparticles using hazardous precursors and chemical methods has a drawback in real-world applications. In the present study, the ferromagnetic iron nitride (ε-Fe3N) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using the direct current (DC) thermal plasma arc discharge (TPAD) method. The experiments were carried out using argon and ammonia (NH3) gas atmospheres at different plasma powers, such as 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5 kW. The synthesized ε-Fe3N NPs have a spherical morphology with a crystalline nature. The saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercive force (Hc) values for single phase ε-Fe3N NPs are 140 emu/g and 121.4 Oe, respectively, which reveals a soft ferromagnetic nature. As ε-Fe3N NPs shows superior storage properties with an outstanding specific capacitance of 556.1 F/g at 1 A/g with pseudocapacitive behavior. The ε-Fe3N exhibited higher cycling stability with 73.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 A/g. Furthermore, ε-Fe3N NPs exhibit excellent electrochemical activity in the oxygen evaluation reaction (OER) catalyst, which exhibits an onset potential of 1.51 V with a lower overpotential of 280 mV and Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec. This work provides significantly better electrochemical energy storage and water splitting applications for thermal plasma synthesized ε-Fe3N NPs.
