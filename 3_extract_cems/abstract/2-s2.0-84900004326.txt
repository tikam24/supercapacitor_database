Novel nanostructured composite fibers based on graphene and carbon nanotubes are developed with high tensile strength, electrical conductivity, and electrocatalytic activity. As two application demonstrations, these composite fibers are used to fabricate flexible, wire-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells and electrochemical supercapacitors, both with high performances, for example, a maximal energy conversion efficiency of 8.50% and a specific capacitance of ca. 31.50 F g-1. These miniature wire-shaped devices are further shown to be promising for flexible and portable electronic facilities. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
