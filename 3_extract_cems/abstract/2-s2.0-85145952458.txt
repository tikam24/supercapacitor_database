With the rapid development of electronic devices, the corresponding energy storage equipment has also been continuously developed. As important components, including electrodes and diaphragms, in energy storage device and energy storage and conversion devices, they all face huge challenges. Polyphosphazene polymers are widely used in various fields, such as biomedicine, energy storage, etc., due to their unique properties. Due to its unique design variability, adjustable characteristics and high chemical stability, they can solve many related problems of energy storage equipment. They are expected to become a new generation of energy materials. This article briefly introduces the research progress in energy based on polyphosphazene materials in the past ten years, on topics such as fuel cells, solar cells, lithium batteries and supercapacitors, etc. The main focus of this work is on the defects of different types of batteries. Scholars have introduced different functional group modification that solves the corresponding problem, thus increasing the battery performance.
