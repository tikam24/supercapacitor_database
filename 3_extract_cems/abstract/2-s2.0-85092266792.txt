This study involves the production of MgO thin films in which different amount of silver is doped on amorphous glasses. The aim of this study is synthesis and characterization of silver doped magnesium thin film electrodes. XRD, SEM and EDX analysis are performed for the characterization of thin films and their capacitance properties are examined using time-dependent current/voltage (I/V) measurements. And also, capacitance properties of these films under violet, green, yellow and red lighting are assessed. It is observed that capacitance properties of Ag doped thin films increased by around 10% under violet light. SEM and EDX analysis is revealed that the amount of silver on the surface have been decreased with the increase of silver doping amount. In addition to the differences on the morphologic images of doped and undoped films, serious differences are observed on the surface structure of the 10% Ag doped films compared to the others.
