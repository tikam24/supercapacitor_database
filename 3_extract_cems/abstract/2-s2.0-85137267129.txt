In this work, The LiMn2O4 nanocomposite was synthesized by using the hydrothermal method, taking lithium acetate, potassium permanganate, and aniline as precursors. LiMn2O4-rGO and LiMn2O4-rGO/PANI was prepared by exfoliation of rGO and PANI on it. XRD and FTIR spectroscopy was used to analyze the structural and optical properties of prepared samples, while FESEM images were used to analyze the morphology of all samples. The average size of the crystallite, tensile strain, degree of crystallinity, and dislocation density were all calculated by using the XRD data. The XRD results show the presence of a single phase of LiMn2O4. To study the electrochemical performance of each prepared electrode, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and impedance analyzer tests were performed. Specific capacity, energy density, power density, DC conductivity, and diffusion coefficient were calculated using electrochemical testing data. LiMn2O4-rGO/PANI shows specific capacity of 135 mA h g−1 with a 85% retention after 100 cycles, while pristine LiMn2O4 shows specific capacity of 105 mAhg−1 with retention of 70% after 100 Cycle. The addition of rGO and PANI enhance the electrical conductivity and reduced the structural aggregation, results in improved electrochemical performance.
