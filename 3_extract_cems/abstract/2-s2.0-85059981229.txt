Although titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) exhibits excellent promise in electrode materials for supercapacitors, its poor conductivity and low areal specific capacitance hamper further development. In this work, we have designed a clever way to deposit manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) in order to improve its electrochemical performance via a facile and typical hydrothermal method. In a hydrothermal process, carbon (C), which deposited via new gas thermal penetration, acts as a reducing agent, while a potassium permanganate (KMnO 4 ) solution acts as an oxidant. In this way, MnO 2 , which has a high theoretical capacity, is generated on TiO 2 nanotube arrays (denoted as TNTs) successfully. Remarkably, a TNTs/C/MnO 2 film prepared at a hydrothermal temperature of 90 Â°C and 0.3 g of KMnO 4 revealed a superior electrochemical property with 55 mF/cm 2 areal capacitance at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, 23 times more enhanced than that of a TNTs/C film. Also, the energy density of a TNTs/C/MnO 2 film reached 46.8 Wh/cm 2 when the power density was 0.12 mW/cm 2 , and the energy density still remained at 22.4 Wh/cm 2 at a high power density of 0.8 mW/cm 2 . After 1000 cycle tests, 93.2% capacitance was still retained, indicating excellent reversibility and cycle stability of TNTs/C/MnO 2 electrode. This work opens up a facile path for efficient growth of electrode materials with high performance for energy storage devices.
