Supercapacitor electrodes heavily loaded with active material suffer from low areal capacitances because close-packed, thick films are often obtained with high mass loading. In this work, nanostructured, mesoporous Co 3O4 was directly deposited on a free-standing carbon substrate and evaluated as a supercapacitor electrode. The mesoporous structure combined with a conductive carbon network maximizes the utilization of active material, resulting in a high areal capacitance in spite of the high Co 3O4 loading.
