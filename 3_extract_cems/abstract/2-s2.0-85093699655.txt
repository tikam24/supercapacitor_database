In this study, NiO/Co3O4 nanocomposites were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method and exploited as electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor. The synergistic interaction between NiO and Co3O4 was explored systematically by varying their mass ratio. Interestingly, the electrochemical performances were dependent on the mass ratio of NiO/Co3O4 nanocomposite. NiO/Co3O4 electrode with mass ratio of 1:1 exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 937 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, due to their distinct microspherical structure with large surface area, which would lead to the more accessible active sites for Faradaic reactions. This investigation provides a useful strategy to develop a new class of electrode materials with the improved electrochemical performance.
