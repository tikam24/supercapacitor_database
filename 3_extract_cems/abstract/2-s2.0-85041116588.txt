Cerium metal-organic framework based composites (Ce-MOF/GO and Ce-MOF/CNT) were synthesized by a wet chemical route and characterized with different techniques to characterize their crystal nature, morphology, functional groups, and porosity. The obtained Ce-MOF in the composites exhibit a nanorod structure with a size of âˆ¼150 nm. The electrochemical performance of the composites was investigated in 3 M KOH and 3 M KOH + 0.2 M K3Fe(CN)6 electrolytes. Enhanced electrochemical behavior was obtained for the Ce-MOF/GO composite in both electrolytes and exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 2221.2 F g-1 with an energy density of 111.05 W h kg-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The large mesoporous structure and the presence of oxygen functional groups in Ce-MOF/GO could facilitate ion transport in the electrode/electrolyte interface, and the results suggested that the Ce-MOF/GO composite could be used as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode material.
