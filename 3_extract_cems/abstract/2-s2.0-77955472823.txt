A novel, hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated with Li2FeSiO 4 (LFSO) as the negative electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the positive electrode in a standard, non-aqueous 1.0 M LiPF6-EC/DMC electrolyte. The electrochemical properties of the LFSO/AC hybrid supercapacitor are investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge/discharge (C/D) measurement and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The CV results reveal the typical capacitance behavior of the LFSO/AC cell within the potential range of 0-3 V. The LFSO/AC cell presents a high discharge capacitance (D SC) of 49 F g-1 at a current density of 1 mA cm -2 and delivers a specific energy of 43 Wh kg-1 and a specific power of 200 W kg-1. The cell exhibits excellent cycleability and greater efficiency over 1000 cycles. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
