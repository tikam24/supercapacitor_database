Interface engineering of heterostructures has proven a promising strategy to effectively modulate their physicochemical properties and further improve the electrochemical performance for various applications. In this context related research of the newly proposed amorphous-crystalline heterostructures have lately surged since they combine the superior advantages of amorphous- and crystalline-phase structures, showing unusual atomic arrangements in heterointerfaces. Nonetheless, there has been much less efforts in systematic analysis and summary of the amorphous-crystalline heterostructures to examine their complicated interfacial interactions and elusory active sites. The critical structure-activity correlation and electrocatalytic mechanism remain rather elusive. In this review, the recent advances of amorphous-crystalline heterostructures in electrochemical energy conversion and storage fields are amply discussed and presented, along with remarks on the challenges and perspectives. Initially, the fundamental characteristics of amorphous-crystalline heterostructures are introduced to provide scientific viewpoints for structural understanding. Subsequently, the superiorities and current achievements of amorphous-crystalline heterostructures as highly efficient electrocatalysts/electrodes for hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, supercapacitor, lithium-ion battery, and lithium-sulfur battery applications are elaborated. At the end of this review, future outlooks and opportunities on amorphous-crystalline heterostructures are also put forward to promote their further development and application in the field of clean energy.
