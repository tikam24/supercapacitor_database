This paper discusses the control strategy of energy management in single railway vehicle with a on-board supercapacitor energy storage system. First, the structure of the energy storage system is introduced. Second, the model of energy storage system is built and a method to design the current loop for bi-directional DC-DC converter for energy storage is proposed. Finally, an indirect current control strategy is established to ensure an optimal power flow of single railway vehicle. The simulation and the experimental results verify that the new control strategy can avoid the voltage fluctuation and regeneration failure.
