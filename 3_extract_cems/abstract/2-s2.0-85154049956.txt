Carbon materials, such as graphite and activated carbon, have been widely used as electrodes in batteries and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). Graphene, which has an extremely thin sheet-like structure, is considered as a fundamental carbon material. However, it was less investigated as an electrode material than graphite and activated carbons. This is because graphene is a relatively new material and is difficult to handle. However, using graphene electrodes can enhance the performance of nanodevices. Here, the performance of EDLCs based on single-layer and bilayer graphene electrodes in LiCl, NaCl, and KCl aqueous electrolyte solutions was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, and the charging mechanism was evaluated using molecular dynamics simulations. KCl aqueous solution provided the highest capacitance compared to LiCl and NaCl aqueous solutions in the case of single-layer graphene electrodes. In contrast, the dependence of the capacitance on the ion species was hardly observed in the case of bilayer graphene. This indicates that Li and Na ions also contributed to the capacitances. The high EDLC performance can be attributed to the fast ion transfer promoted by the dehydration and modification of the second hydration shell on the bilayer graphene because of the relatively strong interaction of ions with the bilayer graphene.
