Temporal diversity via resource-mix is supposed to alleviate issues of adequacy and stability associated with complimentary renewable sources like wind and solar. However, variability/intermittency is still associated with resource-mix generation. Empirical wavelet transform (EWT) based 'role-dividing-strategy' (RDS) is proposed/devised for hybrid storage system units to accommodate imbalance in power thereby mitigating these issues. The proposed scheme exploits the complimentary characteristics of the battery and the ultracapacitor, with battery and ultracapacitor in charge of middle and high frequency power fluctuations of the power imbalance respectively. Based on role dividing strategy, the optimal sizing strategy for ultracapacitor bank and the battery is devised accordingly to ensure balanced flow of energy and maximum utilization of hybrid storage system (HSS) without any overloading condition thereby making resource mix power dispatchable. The energy/power rating of HSS needed to make power from resource mix dispatchable is significantly lower the power/energy ratings of HSS required to make solar and wind dispatchable separately. Actual data of wind/solar power has been used for case studies/validation of proposed methodology.
