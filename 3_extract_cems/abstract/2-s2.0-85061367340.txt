With the goals of high specific surface area electrodes, wide operating potentials and excellent energy densities, the development of a graphene-based supercapacitor combined with ionic liquid electrolytes has been summarized. The key to the success of a supercapacitor with an ultrahigh energy density is the ability to make full utilization of the intrinsic surface capacitance and specific surface area of graphene. Ionic liquid electrolytes show great potential in high-rate charge-discharge capability and low interface impedance for graphene-based supercapacitors.
