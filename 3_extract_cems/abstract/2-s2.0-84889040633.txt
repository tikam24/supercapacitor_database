A Ti/TiO2-MnO composite electrode was prepared by anodizing, chemical dipping and annealing. The crystalline structure and the microscopic morphology of the sample were characterized by XRD and SEM. The results show that the pore diameters of the Ti/TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) range from 60 nm to 95 nm, and their lengths range from 350 nm to 820 nm. Ti/TiO2 nanotube array obtained through anodizing at ambient temperature is amorphous. However, it transforms from amorphous to anatase after annealing at 500Â°C. Only MnO is found after the sample is immersed in MnSO4 solution. A button supercapacitor device is assembled and its cyclic voltammetry curves are determined. It shows that its cyclic voltammetry curves have a pair of redox peaks, which corresponds to the calation/intercalation process of H+ in NTAs. The intercalation/calation process of H+ is controlled by diffusion. The CV response current of Ti/TiO2-MnO electrode decreases as TiO2 transforms from amorphous structure to anatase and MnO deposites in NTAs.
