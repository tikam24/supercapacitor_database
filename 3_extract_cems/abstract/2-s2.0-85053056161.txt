Ordered mesoporous carbons (OMC) loading on sulfonated graphene (OMC/SG) have been fabricated by multi-components co-assembly followed by thermal polymerization and carbonization. OMC/SG composites possess the hierarchically ordered hexagonal mesostructure with the lattice unit parameter and porous diameter about 10 nm and 4 nm, respectively. Sulfonated graphene is integrated into the interpenetrated network structures via covalent bonding and hydrogen bonding, as well as is highly dispersed in OMC matrix. OMC/SG composite shows a specific surface area high up to 1708.78 m2 g−1, and a mesoporous ratio as high as 80 %. Meanwhile, the obtained OMC/SG exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 314.2 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, while OMC based electrode is only 196.6 F g−1. In addition, the resultant OMC/SG composites display good rate capability (70 % of the capacitance retained at current density high up to 100 A g−1), and an excellent cycling stability (no capacitance loss over 5000 cycles). In particular, the surface capacitance of OMC/SG (Cs) increases up to 18.4 μF cm−2 at 1 A g−1. These optimized interconnected porous structures in the OMC/SG composites are favorable to the accessibility, rapid diffusion of aqueous electrolytes, while sulfonated graphene can also facilitate the transport of electrons and provide better interface wettability of electrodes with electrolytes, thereby leading to an excellent energy storage performance.
