Novel hierarchical graphene/polypyrrole (GNS/PPy) nanosheet composites have been successfully fabricated for the first time based on an in situ chemical oxidation polymerization method. Sheet-like PPy with a thickness of 20-50 nm grown on the surface of the composites of the GNS/PPy polymerized at an early stage due to the dominated role of the sheet-like GNS and residue glucose in the synthesis process. Supercapacitors based on the hierarchical composite exhibit large electrochemical capacitance (318.6 F g-1) at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. They also show superior electrochemical rate capability and cyclic stability. The capacitance retained ∼95% (132.9 F g-1) after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV s-1. Accordingly, the hierarchical GNS/PPy nanosheet composites are potential electrode materials for electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
