Coaxial-cable like Mn2O3 nanofibers are fabricated by a facile and cost-effective single-nozzle electrospinning technique and subsequent calcination. The morphology, microstructure, crystal structure, composition and specific surface area are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and N2 adsorption-desorption. A possible formation mechanism of the coaxial-cable like Mn2O3 nanofiber has also been proposed. Due to the large specific surface area and porous structure, the synthesized coaxial-cable like Mn2O3 nanofiber is employed as the electrode for supercapacitor in 6M KOH aqueous condition. The specific capacitance is up to 216F/g at 0.5A/g and the electrode also exhibited excellent cycling stability of 93% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The encouraging results show the potential of the coaxial-cable like Mn2O3 nanofiber as supercapacitor electrode material.
