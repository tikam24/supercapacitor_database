The present work demonstrates the fabrication and performance of polyaniline-conjugated graphite–montmorillonite electrode material (PANI-GMMT), which is ideal for supercapacitor applications. PANI-conjugated electrode materials PANI100-GMMT, PANI200-GMMT, and PANI300-GMMT were prepared by electropolymerizing aniline on the graphite-MMT electrode surface at 100, 200, and 300 scan cycles, respectively. The surface projections on GMMT that are likely in nanometer size served as the active sites for the polymerization, resulting in a nanofiber network of PANI. The highest specific capacitance is observed for the cell constructed with PANI200-GMMT, which is 342 F g−1. The strong synergetic interactions in PANI200-GMMT reflect in the lowest serial resistance, whereas the large electroactive surface area is accounted for the lowest charge transfer resistance observed with PANI200-GMMT. The SEM micrographs reveal that polyaniline coating on PANI200-GMMT is densely and uniformly packed, which facilitates to increase the electroactive surface area available for charge storage. The improved specific capacitance and low cost of fabrication make PANI-GMMT a potential energy storage material for supercapacitors.
