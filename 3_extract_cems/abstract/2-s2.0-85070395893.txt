Replacing the internal combustion engine with an electric motor in the vehicular technology is taking place globally to reduce the depletion of fossil fuels, pollution and the effect of global warming. A proper power electronics circuitry is very essential in the electric vehicle to integrate different energy sources effectively. A novel modified interleaved dual input - single output dc-dc converter is introduced in this paper to integrate the battery and ultracapacitor. The introduced converter is able to deliver power individually and/or simultaneously from the two input sources to meet the demand of electric vehicular loads. The same converter can be used to charge one of the input sources from another source without any additional circuits. The steady state output equation of the converter based on its modes of operation is derived. Small signal model of the converter is obtained and dynamic performance is also verified. The validity of the converter is carried out by a detail simulation study and the simulation results are confirmed with the results obtained from the experiment. Performance comparison of the proposed converter with the existing converters is carried out in terms of voltage gain. The proposed converter offers lesser components count, simplified structure, and enhanced efficiency compared to the existing converters.
