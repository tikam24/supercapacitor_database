Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has emerged as an optimal polymeric material for photocatalysis, electronic assemblies, energy storage and conversion applications. The two dimensional (2D) materials posses exotic electronic properties due to abundant active sites extending the potential use in various technological applications. To realize the advancement from laboratory to industrial use of g-C3N4 a low cost, rapid and large scale production is highly needed. In this work we use microwave-assisted scheme which can overcome these challenges and provide robust, low-cost and scalable approaches to synthesize materials. In present work we designed an innovative method to tailor melamine in microwave reactor by pre-treatment with nitric acid (HNO3) to obtain porous g-C3N4 nanosheets with a thickness of ~10 nm. This method provides a degree of freedom to tune C to N ratio by just varying the microwave reaction time. The electrochemical properties of the g-C3N4 are performed using nickel foam in KOH electrolyte. The g-C3N4 nanostructures show a specific capacitance of 287 F/g. The electrochemical behavior of pristine g-C3N4 was also measured using Quartz crystal nanobalance and showed a capacitance of 10 F/g. These studies elucidate the electrochemical behavior of g-C3N4 as supercapacitor material. The devised synthesis method will facilitate new pathways for synthesis of 2D g-C3N4 for applications in energy storage and conversion.
