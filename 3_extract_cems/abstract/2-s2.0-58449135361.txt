Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of using kinetic energy harvesting to power wireless condition monitoring sensors. Design/methodology/approach - The system presented duty cycles its operation depending upon the energy being harvested. The harvested energy is stored on a supercapacitor and the system samples sufficient vibration data to enable an FFT to be performed at the receiver. Findings - The results of this study show it is perfectly feasible to power practical wireless condition monitoring sensors entirely from the vibrations of the machines being monitored. Originality/value - Energy harvesting techniques can be used to power wireless sensors in a range of applications. Removing the need for a battery power supply presents obvious environmental benefits and avoids the need to periodically replace batteries. Â© Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
