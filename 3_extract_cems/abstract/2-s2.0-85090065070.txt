A sticky surface of a tape was adhered to a graphite surface and then the tape was peeled off. The insulator tape was coated with thin graphite and became conductive in order to use flexible tape as a current collector. Aniline was electrodeposited onto a flexible tape substrate having graphite layer by electrochemical polymerization method from an aqueous (H2SO4 solution containing aniline monomers) and non-aqueous media (a deep eutectic solvent containing aniline). The prepared polymeric electrodes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy techniques. The electrochemical properties of coated and uncoated electrodes were also examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge techniques. The polyaniline (PANI) coated tape can be used as a flexible electrode in supercapacitor applications because PANI coated electrodes are highly electroactive in Na2SO4 electrolyte. After 3000 cycles, the capacitance retention of PANI film electrodeposited from Ethaline bath was 90%, while the areal capacitance of PANI film obtained from acidic medium reaches 50% after 500 cycles. As PANI electrode is stable in an ionic liquid for long cycling, Ethaline ionic liquid can be used as electrolyte for PANI based supercapacitor electrode. PANI coated graphite on tape, which is prepared in an easy and inexpensive way is a promising flexible material for high performance supercapacitors.
