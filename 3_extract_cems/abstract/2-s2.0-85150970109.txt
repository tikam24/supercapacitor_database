Hybrid electric cars have the same advantages as hybrid cars, but the main difference is that they use an electric motor that is powered by an energy storage system that gets its energy from a source like batteries or the grid to help with the main source of power. As a bonus, the electric motor can also be used to make electricity. When the car brakes, it converts the energy into electricity that can be stored in the car’s energy storage unit. A hybrid control strategy is usually used in an energy-saving study of a vehicle. This strategy divides the load between different modes of operation, such as when the vehicle is running. This thesis talks about how electric vehicles (EVs) came to be and how they can be used with a combined energy storage system. To make electric cars last for a long time and keep costs down, this paper proposes a new hybrid energy storage device for electric cars. This thesis proposes the best way to control the hybrid energy storage device, which is made up of a Li-ion battery and a supercapacitor. The battery’s capacity dynamic constraint rule-based control is based on the supercapacitor’s state of charge. Use of an ANFIS controller makes hybrid energy storage system outputs more accurate and less distorted when they're used in a system.
