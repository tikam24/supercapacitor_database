3 D capacitance: Hierarchical porous carbon-based electrode materials with a composite structure are prepared from a biomass waste by a facile carbonization and activation process without using any additional templates. Benefiting from the composite structure, the ions experience a variety of environments, which contribute significantly to the excellent electrochemical properties of supercapacitors.
