Porous carbons (PCs) for supercapacitors were synthesized by a combined Mg(OH)2 templating and in-situ KOH activation method using coal tar pitch as the carbon precursor, and were characterized by TEM, Raman spectroscopy, XPS and N2 adsorption. Their electrochemical properties were investigated by galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Results show that the specific surface area of the PCs increases with the KOH dosage and exhibits a maximum with an activation temperature at 800â„ƒ. The optimum PC has a high surface area up to 3145 m2 g-1 with abundant micropores, and exhibits a high specific capacitance of 272 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1, a rate capability of 217 F g-1 at 20 A g-1 and a good cycle stability with a 96.69% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. This work provides a simple method for the large-scale production of PCs from pitch-based carbon sources for high-performance supercapacitors.
