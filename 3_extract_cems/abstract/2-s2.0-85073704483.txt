The miniature printing device was produced by using 3- axis stage and the stage was controlled by microprocessor. The ink section was fixed at the top of the stage and the substrate was mobile in the system. The ink was produced by using graphene as an electrode material and it was printed on a non-conductive substrate. It was used a 1 M KOH for an electrolyte material and electrochemical performance of the device were investigated. It was obtained that the first cycle specific capacity of the device is 102 F/g and it was decreased to 88 F/g for 1000 cycle. So it may say that the device is very useful for energy storage device and it is cheaper than that of the commercial systems.
