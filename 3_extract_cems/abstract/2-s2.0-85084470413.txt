The “in situ electrolyte” concept displays a novel method for the fabrication of carbon-based supercapacitors. The synthesis is designed in such way that by-products formed during the carbon synthesis directly act as an electrolyte salt and contribute to the supercapacitor's functionality. The presented method produces materials competitive with conventional approaches but simplifies and economizes their whole synthesis and application. The concept shows how process steps can be rendered obsolete by taking a holistic view on the material synthesis and its respective application, by not treating by-products as waste, but rather as integral part of the desired application.
