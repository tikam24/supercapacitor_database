Chemical oxidation is used to cut and unzip multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the transverse direction and the axial direction to form graphene oxide nanoribbon (GONR). Ruthenium oxide/reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon composite (RuO2/rGONR) with a 72.5 wt% RuO2 loading is synthesized through an aqueous-phase reaction, in which GONR is served as starting material, followed by mild thermal treatment in ambient air. The resulting RuO2/rGONR composite achieves specific capacitance up to 677 F·g-1 at the current density of 1 A·g-1 in three-electrode system using 1 mol·L-1 H2SO4 as electrolyte. The resultant electrode exhibits an excellent rate capability (91.8% retention rate at 20 A·g-1). Especially, the symmetric supercapacitor assembled on the basis of RuO2/rGONR electrode delivers high energy density (16.2 Wh·kg-1) even at the power density of 9885 W·kg-1, which is very essential for supercapacitors. rGONR was uniformly coated by RuO2 particles using a facile route. With unique microstructure and high RuO2 loading, the electrode material exhibits a high specific capacitance, and excellent rate capability.
