Fuel cell hybrid electric buses (FCHEBs) employing hydrogen fuel cells as the main power source and supercapacitors as the energy buffer could be a feasible electrified transportation technology. This paper evaluates two model predictive control (MPC) schemes with different error compensation strategies for power management in FCHEBs: MPC scheme with Adaptive Compensation (denoted as AC-MPC) and MPC scheme with Gaussian Process Regression Compensation (denoted as GPRC-MPC). AC-MPC introduces adaptive weights based on the supercapacitor state of charge (SOC) and compensates for the errors associated with the linearization of the nonlinear fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. GPRC-MPC utilizes Gaussian process regression to predict and compensate for the load disturbance error and the residual error. AC-MPC and GPRC-MPC are evaluated using the New York Bus (NYBus) drive cycle and a drive cycle collected along the GBG17 bus route in Sweden. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AC-MPC and GPRC-MPC in improving the hydrogen system performance by reducing the hydrogen consumption and the maximum fuel cell current change rate compared to the linear MPC scheme without any compensation while ensuring that the supercapacitor SOC is bounded.
