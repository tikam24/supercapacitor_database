The bulky structure of current power sources is hindering the widespread development of next-generation electronics. Here, we propose a graphene/single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) hybrid structure for the realization of high-performance supercapacitors. The devices are assembled by using 2 cm2 area hybrid graphene/SWCNT electrodes, designed by combining a scalable solution-processing method (e.g., liquid phase exfoliation of pristine graphite and de-bundling of SWCNTs) with dynamic spray-gun deposition, and an aqueous electrolyte (3 M LiNO3). This architecture allows us to effectively balance the supercapacitors performance achieving remarkable electrode gravimetric capacitance and specific energy at 2 mVs-1 of 104Fg-1, 20.8 Wh kg-1, respectively, and a maximum specific power of 92.3 kW kg-1. Our results, based on industrially scalable materials production and deposition methods, represent a real breakthrough compared to state-of-the-art lab-scale devices.
