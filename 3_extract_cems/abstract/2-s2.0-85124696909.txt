The contribution of power generation from converter-dominated renewable energy sources (RES) has increased enormously. Consequently, the system inertia is decreasing, and it impacts the frequency of the system. With large-scale integration of power electronic inverter-based power generation from RES, inertia from energy storage devices would be unavoidable in future power grids. In this paper, the inertia emulator is formed with a supercapacitor (IE–SC) to improve inertia in a low inertia grid. To emulate the inertia in a low inertia grid, this paper pro-poses a fuzzy logic controller-based emulated inertia controller (FL-EIC) for an inverter attached to IE–SC. The proposed fuzzy logic controller estimates the inertial power required based on the frequency deviation and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF). The output of the fuzzy controller adds to the conventional emulated inertia control (EIC) technique to alter the load angle for the power electronic inverter of IE–SC. Specifically, the proposed FL-EIC achieves inertia emulation by proportionally linking the time derivative of the grid frequency and frequency deviation to active power references of IE–SC. A comparison of the conventional EIC and FL-EIC is carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed FL-EIC. Furthermore, real-time simulations with the help of the OPAL-RT real-time simulator (OP 5700) are presented to validate the advantage of the FL-EIC.
