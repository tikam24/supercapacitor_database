An in-plane micro-supercapacitor (MSC) which has a unique interdigitated electrode structure with through-holes was developed by laser annealing and ablation of a carbon/polyamide acid composite coating on a polyimide film. The laser annealing of a composite film consisting of multi-layer graphene or activated carbon remarkably lowered the resistivity by laser carbonization of polyamide acid. The laser ablation was conducted to make an interdigitated electrode with a through-hole structure. The through-holes were effective to improve the capacitance of an in-plane MSC by enhancing the ion diffusion in carbon layer because the surface area of carbon layer can be increased using front and back sides of a polyimide film. An in-plane MSC consisting of an asymmetric interdigitated electrode which had an activated carbon composite layer on the front side and a multi-layer graphene composite on back side of a polyimide film showed the improvement of capacitance.
