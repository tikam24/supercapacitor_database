In this paper a single-loop automatic control system for a DC-DC converter is considered. Bidirectional DC-DC converter is used to connect the block of supercapacitors to the DC link of the frequency converter in order to increase the energy efficiency of the electric drive. The paper formulates the requirements for the control system of DC-DC converter, describes the DC-DC converter as a control object, and considers the synthesis for non-linear current controllers. This paper compares a single-loop control system with three different types of current controllers. The paper presents the simulation results for all variants of DC-DC converter control systems, which show, that in a single-loop control system the using of a PI current controller leads to significant errors.
