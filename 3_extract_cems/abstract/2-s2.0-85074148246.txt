Graphene and carbon nanotubes have been widely used as electrode materials for flexible and wearable supercapacitors due to their excellent properties. Here, we report a kind of novel woven textile electrodes of seamlessly connected graphene/nanotube hybrids for application in wearable and stretchable energy storage. Owing to the support effect of carbon nanotubes seamlessly grown around graphene tubes, the graphene/nanotube hybrids in the textiles could maintain a unique self-supported tubular structure, which provides a perfect platform to be functionalized on both inner and outer surfaces of the tube. Benefiting from its unique structure and properties, the graphene/nanotube hybrids derived all-solid-state supercapacitors not only show high electrochemical performance, but also exhibit superior stretchability of 200% and high optical transmittance of 46%. The novel woven fabrics of seamless graphene/nanotubes are promising to be extended for other wearable electronic applications.
