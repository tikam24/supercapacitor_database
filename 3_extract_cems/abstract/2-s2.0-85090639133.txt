Microgrids are small-scale power systems destined to supply isolated villages and optimum utilization of renewable energies. For this reason, this paper presents a DC-MG of 150 Kwp to feed an island village. The configuration of the proposed system consists of four interconnected sub-sections supplied by the centralized unit through PV and Wind Distributed Energy Resources DERs, in addition to the supercapacitor storage device. In the other hand, internal batteries of each sub-section cover its load demand separately, where electrical and chemical storage devices can be advantageous hybrid energy storage system HESS for the system. Thus, the control structure of the DCMG is based on current hysteresis method to assure the charge/discharge operation and the stability of the DC-bus voltage, then a proposed management strategy to manage the shared energy of the DCMG system. The system behavior is tested under variable parameters and conditions using Matlab/Simulink.
