Datura metel L. leaf extract mediated sodium alginate polymer membrane was successfully made using the solution casting technique. Electric, electrochemical, physicochemical and antimicrobial analyses of the prepared film were investigated. Functional groups of polysaccharides are identified in FTIR analysis and crystallinity/amorphous of the prepared samples was studied using XRD analysis. The prepared polymer membrane (DmMSA2) exhibits the ionic conductivity of 2.18 × 10−4 Scm−1, maximum specific capacitance of 131 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g and also exhibits a significant effect of antimicrobial activity against human pathogens. Hence, Datura metel L. leaf extract mediated polymer membranes are promising candidates for solid-electrolyte in supercapacitor devices and antimicrobial agents in food packaging applications.
