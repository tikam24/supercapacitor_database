The variation in wind speed changes the output power of Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS). In DC microgrid, the WECS system connected to DC link through DC-DC boost converter results in large variation in DC link voltage. Maintaining the DC link voltage constant is a challenging issue. Under wide variation of wind speed, the Composite Energy Storage System (CESS) can stabilize the DC link voltage. Similarly, during the gust period, the CESS maintains the DC link voltage constant by supercapacitor absorbing transient energy from the system. In this paper, a power management algorithm for WECS based CESS is proposed. The power management algorithm maintains the SoC limits of both supercapacitor and battery. The simulation of the system carried out in MATLAB-Simulink to validate the results.
