Chemically A-MWCNT (activated multiwalled carbon nanotube)/PANI (polyaniline) composites produced via ultrasonic polymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of A-MWCNTs were investigated as potential electrode materials for supercapacitors. These composites were compared to pristine MWCNTs and MWCNT/PANI composites. The influence of the pore structure, which developed because of the polymerization process, was investigated by measuring N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77K. The electrochemical properties of the materials were determined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling measurements in 1M NaNO3 electrolyte solution, using a three-electrode system at room temperature. The results suggested that the pore structure of the A-MWCNTs could effectively promote the homogenous-dispersion of aniline and consequently result in excellent cycling performance. Furthermore, interaction between the Ï€-conjugated structure of carbon and the quinoid ring of the PANI matrix can lead to enhancement in the charge transfer process.
