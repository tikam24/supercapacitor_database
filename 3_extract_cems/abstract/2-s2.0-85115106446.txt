Nano-biotechnology deals with the role of biological species in the field of nanotechnology and has gained significant attention in the last few decades. Nano-sized materials have superior physical, chemical, optical, electrical and mechanical properties in comparison with the bulk materials. A number of techniques have been employed so far to synthesize nano-structured materials, and among these, bio-inspired methods are found to be economically viable and environmentally sustainable. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most abundant and nontoxic transition metal oxides with high thermal stability, good oxidation and corrosion resistance, good hydrophobicity and non-wettability. All these properties along with a wide band gap make TiO2 an important material for various applications in the fields of solar cells, sensors, batteries, and supercapacitors. In this review work, a comprehensive study has been carried out on the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) using different biological extracts and applications of TiO2 NPs in the design and development of various electronic devices.
