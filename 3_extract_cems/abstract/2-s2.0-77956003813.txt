The carbon aerogel was prepared by the polycondensation of resorcinol (R) with formaldehyde (F) and sodium carbonate was added as a catalyst (C). Hydrothermal method was used to prepare MnO2/CRF composite using KBrO3 and MnSO4Â·H2O as raw materials. The structure of composite was characterized by N2 adsorption and XRD. The result shows that MnO2 prepared by hydrothermal method is pure pyrolusite, and the add of carbon aerogel powder doesn't influence its crystal structure. Electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry in 1 mol/L KOH aqueous solution electrolyte. The electrode has a stable electrochemistry performance, and preferable reversibility, the specific capacitanceof MnO2/CRF electrode was 146.6 F/g under 1 mA current densities. The electrode presented a stable capacitance after 500 cycles and it's an ideal electrochemical materials.
