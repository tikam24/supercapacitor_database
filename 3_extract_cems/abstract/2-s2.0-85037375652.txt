The introduction of surface functional groups onto graphene can provide additional pseudocapacitance for supercapacitors. However, the compensation for the loss of electrical conductivity arising from the disruption of the conjugated system remains a big challenge. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the design of oxygen clusters distributed in graphene with “paddy land” structure via a low-temperature annealing process. Moreover, the distribution, content, and variety of oxygen groups and the conductivity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) can be easily adjusted by annealing temperature and time. First-principles calculations demonstrate that “paddy land” structure exhibits conjugated carbon network, ultralow HOMO–LUMO gap, and long span of atomic charge values, which are beneficial for the enhanced pseudocapacitance and rate performance. As a result, the functionalized graphene (GO-160-8D) exhibits high specific capacitance of 436 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, exceeding the values of previously reported RGO materials, as well as excellent rate performance (261 F g−1 at 50 A g−1) and cycling stability (94% of capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles). The findings may open a door for finely controlling the location and density of functionalities on graphene for applications in energy storage and conversion fields via a green and energy-efficient process.
