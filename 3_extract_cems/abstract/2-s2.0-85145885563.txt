Rational design and regulation of the porosity of porous carbon are of great significance for high-energy–density supercapacitors. In this study, we synthesize degraded chitosan hydrogel-derived hierarchical porous carbon (DCHPC) with appropriate pore size distribution by adjusting the crosslinking density of hydrogel precursor and assisting KOH activation. The obtained DCHPC-3 has a high specific surface area (3179 m2 g−1), large pore volume (1.60 cm3 g−1), high microporosity (77.5%), and a hierarchical interconnected porous frame. The DCHPC-3 electrode performs ultra-high specific capacitance of 506.3 F g−1 at the current density of 0.3 A g−1. It exhibits excellent cycling stability, whose capacitance retention is close to 100% after 10,000 cycles. In addition, a symmetric supercapacitor based on a DCHPC-3 electrode shows a high energy density of 30.75 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 700 W kg−1. This study provides a facile design idea for porous carbon materials with special pore sizes.
