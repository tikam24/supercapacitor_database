Novel ternary composite reduced-graphene oxide/Ag nanoparticles/poly(p-phenylenediamine) (rGO/Ag NPs/PpPD, GMP) is first designed, synthesized and demonstrated. Nanocomposite rGO/Ag NPs is prepared by in situ simultaneous reduction of [Ag(NH3)2]+ and GO, and then a thin layer of PpPD is coated on the surface of ternary composite by polymerization. In this study, Ag NPs are no longer just designed as a typical dopant to improve conductivity, but can contribute the pseudocapacitance for composite. As a result, the obtained composite GMP-1,5,4 delivers an excellent areal capacitance of 2779 mF cm−2 (926 F g−1) at 1 mA cm−2 and a good rate capability (1639 mF cm-2 at 40 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the design of composite is indeed an effective strategy for combating the low cycling stability. For comparison, GMP-1,5,4 maintains 89.42% of the initial specific capacitance after 2000 cycles, while only 52.24% for GM-1,5 is left after 500 cycles. Additionally, it is found that ammonium persulfate (APS), a typical initiator for polymerization, may oxidize Ag NPs when its concentration is low. Therefore, our study will be of great help to researchers who will synthesize polymer/Ag NPs composite in the future.
