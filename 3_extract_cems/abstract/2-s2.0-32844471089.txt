High specific surface area mesoporous activated carbon (AC) for supercapacitors was fabricated from petroleum coke through chemical activation. XRD, SEM and BET were used to analyse the as prepared AC. The AC was made into supercapacitor electrode to study its capacitive performance by galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results show that the specific surface area of the AC is 1733 m2/g and the volume fraction for rnesopore is 60.6%. At a current density of 150 mA/g, a specific capacitance of 180 F/g is reached. Supercapacitors based on the AC have low ESR and excellent power property.
