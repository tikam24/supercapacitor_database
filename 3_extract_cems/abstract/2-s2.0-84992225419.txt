A control strategy based on the cascaded PBC(Passivity-Based Control) and PI control is proposed for the coordinated power control of isolated DC microgrid. Its PCH(Port-Controlled Hamiltonian) model is established and its passivity-based controller is designed. An outer-loop PI controller is developed to eliminate the steady-state errors of DC bus voltage caused by the parameter disturbance for improving the robustness of closed-loop system. The simulative results show that, the PBC-PI control strategy could reasonably adjust the power balance of DC microgrid, stabilize the voltage of DC bus and improve the robustness of closed-loop system against parameter disturbance.
