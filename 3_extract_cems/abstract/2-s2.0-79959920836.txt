The paper presents a control strategy for a wind energy conversion system (WECS) which tracks the maximum power point of the wind turbine. The topology of the system consists of a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a diode bridge rectifier, a hybrid dc-dc converter which lowers the dc voltage, a supercapacitor and a battery charger. This strategy uses the measured wind speed and imposes the optimal rotation speed of the wind turbine. The control method is simulated in Matlab/ Simulink and the results are presented and discussed.
