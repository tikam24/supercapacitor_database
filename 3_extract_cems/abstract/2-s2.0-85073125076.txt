The rapid growth of technology made significant impact in development of distributed and unique electronic devices which played vital role in modern human life. The technology has reduced size and power consumption of the electronic circuits which opens the way to look alternative energy source which in return expands the product life and reduce the product dependency on battery. This evolution requires new and efficient solutions from a power-management point of view because, if efficient power maintenance is not deployed, all these devices will just end up being a collection of discharged, useless electronics. This paper presents the design of Low Frequency energy harvesting system for low power automotive key fob sensor application. Magnetic field created by car ignition lockset a Transmitter is used as energy harvesting source. A Receiver and RF-DC circuit on Remote Keyless Entry system along with super capacitor is used to replace conventional battery in this system. The proposed system works at 125KHz and harvest 30.3 mW of energy for normal operation of the key fob.
