Layered NbS2, a member of group-V transition metal dichalcogenides, was synthesized via a colloidal synthesis method and employed as a negative material for a supercapacitor. The morphologies of NbS2 can be tuned from ultrathin nanosheets to hierarchical structures through dynamics controls based on growth mechanisms. Electrochemical energy storage measurements present that the ultrathin NbS2 electrode exhibits the highest rate capability due to having the largest electrochemical surface area and its efficient ion diffusion. Meanwhile, the hierarchical NbS2 shows the highest specific capacitance at low current densities for small charge transfer resistance, displays 221.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 117.1 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, and cycling stability with 78.9% of the initial specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles. The aggregate or stacking of nanosheets can be suppressed effectively by constructing hierarchical structure NbS2 nanosheets.
