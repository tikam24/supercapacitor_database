As sustainable energy generation and highly fuel efficient hybridelectric vehicles (HEVs) are becoming more prevalent, energy storage devices will be critical in supporting these technologies to become more viable for consumers. Among all types of energy storage technologies, lithiumbased batteries and capacitors are the most effective and attainable. Today, lithiumion batteries (LIBs) are the dominant power source on the market for HEVs and have emerged as the leading candidate to replace internal combustion engines for automobiles. However, while LIBs provide very high energy density, they have a relatively short cycle life, require long charging times and have limitations on power delivery. Conversely, newly developed lithiumion ultracapacitors (LICs) offer a very long lifespan (>1 million cycles), have charge times measured in minutes, are capable of high power, and have the highest energy density of any commerciallyavailable capacitor. These qualities m ake LICs an excellent candidate for use in both vehicle and grid applications, to complement batteries in hybrid energy storage systems and entirely supersede them for certain applications. A new generation of high performance LIC laminate cells have been assembled with labscale equipment using activated carbon cathodes and hard carbon/lithiumdoped anodes. A specific energy and energy density as high as 18 Wh kg1 and 32 Wh L1 have been achieved, respectively. The laminate cells obtained a maximum specific power of 8.5 kW kg1. The discharge capacity retention of the LIC laminate cell at 40 째C is about 80% compared to the value at 30 째C. After 100,000 cycles, the LIC laminate cells still retain 90% of the initial discharge capacitance. The operating temperature range of the LICs is from 40 째C to 70 째C.
