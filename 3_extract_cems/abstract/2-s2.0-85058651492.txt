This paper examines the cobalt-doped ceria/reduced graphene oxide (Co-CeO2/rGO) nanocomposite as a supercapacitor and modeling of its cyclic voltammetry behavior using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest Algorithm (RFA). Good agreement was found between experimental results and the predicted values generated by using ANN and RFA. Simulation results confirmed the accuracy of the models, compared to measurements from supercapacitor module power-cycling. A comparison of the best performance between ANN and RFA models shows that the ANN models performed better (value of coefficient of determination >0.95) than the RFA models for all datasets used in this study. The results of the ANN and RFA models could be useful in designing the unique nanocomposites for supercapacitors and other strategies related with energy and the environment.
