Anatase TiO2 hierarchical nanostructures with higher photocatalytic activity are of special importance in various applications. We have reported the synthesis of TiO2 as water chestnut plants like morphology via facile hydrothermal method, by using Titanium (IV) butoxide (TBOT) as a precursor solution. It is found that TiO2 nanoparticles work as seed and completely convert into water chestnut plants like structure or morphology, which are composed of crystallized anatase nanocrystals. X-ray diffraction spectra confirmed the presence of anatase phase of crystallized TiO2 plants (TPs). The average life time delay for generated charge carriers in TPs was calculated to be around 2.45 ns, which reflects slow recombination of charge carriers. The prepared TPs show excellent photocatalytic performance when applied in photo degradation of Rhodamine B organic dye. The unique features exhibited by TPs make them a promising candidate for vast potential applications in field such as solar cells, photocatalysis, supercapacitor, lithium ion batteries and some related fields.
