Poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) was extensively studied for its high ionic conductivity. In this paper, PEDOT films electrodes were prepared on the stainless steel substrates by unipolar pulse method using 3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as monomer. The effects of different pulse parameters on the capacitance of PEDOT films were investigated. The PEDOT-coated stainless steel electrode was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which confirm that PEDOT films are deposited into a pleated structure by an irregular virtual sphere, and a high degree of ClO4- is successfully doped in the PEDOT films. In addition, the results of cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge show that the PEDOT electrodes exhibit a good specific capacitance of 128.64 F/g, rate performance and stability (retention rate=71.26% after 2000 cycles). The thin, lightweight electrode material based supercapacitor shows considerable potential for low-cost, high-performance energy storage applications.
