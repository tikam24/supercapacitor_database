Wearable devices have attracted great interest in practical applications, satisfying controllable size and comfortable human-computer interaction environment. Regarding as two core parts in electrochemistry, it is essential to explore an effective and simple integration process of wearable biosensors and supercapacitors. Herein, flexible electrochemical biosensors and supercapacitors based on Prussian blue/Reduced graphene oxide (PB/RGO) ink (PRG ink) have been fabricated via facile screen printing technique. As-prepared biosensors not only possess stable response to substrates, but also exhibit excellent sensing performance towards hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ascorbic acid (AA), revealing promising prospects in practical use (e.g., juice or VC tablet samples). Meanwhile, multifunctional PRG ink enables supercapacitors with competitive capacitive characteristics. Significantly, electron transfer (ET) of electrocatalysis has been particularly discussed and evaluated during electrochemical biosensing and charge-discharge process. Prospectively, these flexible integrated devices would make attractive electrochemical platforms for highly-efficient and cost-effective wearable biosensors and supercapacitors in further application.
