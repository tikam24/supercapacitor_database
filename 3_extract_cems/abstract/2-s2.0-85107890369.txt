Here, we detail the influence of the surfactant concentration on the morphological, structural and energy-storage property of CuO electrode material. When proposed as a supercapacitor material in neutral electrolyte (NaCl), it shows excellent electrochemical nature. Besides, it attains high specific capacitance (303F g-1 at 2 mVs-1), good rate performance (102F g-1 at 25 mVs-1) and good cyclic stability. In count, it has low charge transfer resistance (2.04 X), which is very essential when performing supercapacitive study at high current rates. These results are enhancing the study of CuO based electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
