We used multi-structured activated carbon electrodes to fabricate hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) showing excellent electrochemical performance. As the active material, the activated carbon coupled with Li4Ti 5O12 showed a partially graphitized as well as a porous structure, and thus provided two different capacitive mechanisms: electric double layer capacitance and shallow intercalation. HSCs produced with this unique structure show excellent specific capacitances of 77 F g- 1 and 62 F cm- 3. Partially graphitic activated carbon has great potential for HSC applications.
