Stretchable supercapacitors are widely used in wearable community. It requires not only excellent capacity, but also outstanding stretching stability. Here, stretchable wavy current collectors were designed with commercial available stainless steel wires. Polyaniline was then electrochemically polymerized on the stainless steel wire as the active material. A linear stretchable supercapacitor was assembled with such wavy electrodes and stretchable polymer electrolyte. The stretchable supercapacitor could be stretched by 30% and maintain 89% of its original capacitance after 1000 stretching/releasing cycles.
