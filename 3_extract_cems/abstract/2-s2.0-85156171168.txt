Major power quality issues such as voltage harmonic, and swell/sag usually occurred in utility grid mainly in the distribution part that may affect the performance of the circuit and it can be mitigated by installing the Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR). The integration of DVR, a solar PV-Battery and a supercapacitor (SCAP) are implemented in this circuit which is used to inject the required voltage in sustaining the mitigation of power quality disturbance, especially voltage sag and voltage swell. Solar PV-Battery and SCAP are implemented to meet the necessary power required by the grid and also for power quality improvement. The suggested solar PV-Battery minimises electricity demand from the power system along with maintaining voltage. The supercapacitor has a low energy density and a high power density that is ideal for compensation of voltage sag and swell that require high power for short spans of time. It also will independently compensate for temporary voltage sags and swells without interrupting the grid to compensate for the power quality. The simulation results are presented using MATLAB/Simulink to demonstrate the suggested system's and its control system's efficacy in reducing power quality disruptions.
