Transition metal diselenides are trendy electrode materials for supercapacitors. The main reason behind it is their high specific capacitance. But, they suffer from poor electronic conductivity and agglomeration issues which hinder their practical use. Herein, we present the preparation of nanocomposites including transition metal diselenide MSe2 (M=Mo, Co, and Ni) with activated carbon using the facial hydrothermal route. Inspiring from the high electrochemical results of a hybrid nanocomposites symmetric cell, an aqueous asymmetric ultracapacitor cell (AUC) comprised of different shaped carbon-coated MSe2 (positive electrode) as well as activated carbon (AC) (negative electrode) has been fabricated. The NAC//6KOH//AC asymmetric cell displays the best outcomes among all fabricated devices. The specific capacitance observed is about 3740 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. It delivers a high energy density of 69 Wh kg−1 along with a power density of 687 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The electrochemical results motivate us to explore the practical usability of the prepared NAC//6KOH//AC device via illuminating 26 red LED panels which glow for 26 min. The findings in this report indicate that MSe2-based nanocomposite has the scope and is a potential material in the energy storage field.
