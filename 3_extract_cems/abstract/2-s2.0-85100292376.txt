Suffering from the competitive relationship between the abundant electrochemically active sites and the fast ion transfer channel, it still faces tremendous challenges in simultaneously designing and preparing biomass-derived carbons with excellent capacitive and rate performance. Herein, a dual-activation strategy of KOH and KMnO4 is used to prepare cotton stalks-derived porous carbon with large specific surface area (SSA) (1634 m2 g−1), interconnected network structure, as well as rational mesopores and micropore ratio. Consequently, the obtained sample exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 318 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, 71% capacitance retention at current density up to 50 A g−1, and only 2% capacitance dissipation in a two-electrode system in 6 M KOH after 10 000 cycles. Importantly, the obtained sample also shows a high areal capacitance of 3.8 F cm−2 under a high mass loading of 16 mg cm−2. Moreover, the obtained sample also delivers a high energy density of 19.9 Wh kg−1 at 397 W kg−1 in the symmetric two-electrode system using 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. This work provides an alternative avenue for the facile and scaled-up conversion of earth-abundant agricultural wastes into advanced carbon materials for supercapacitors application.
