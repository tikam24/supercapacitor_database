In this work, a simple eco-friendly, one-step, green synthesis method was employed to prepare reduced graphene oxide-Cu nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental characterization was done by XRD, SEM, and FTIR. The surface morphologies of Cu NPs were in spherical particles decorated with an average size of 10 nm. The Cu nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on RGO sheets. The electrochemical performance of as synthesized Cu and RGO-Cu nanocomposite fabricated on Ni foam studied and compared the obtained data from using the techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, chrono potentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in presence of 3 M NaOH a three electrode aqueous method. A highest specific capacitance of 245Â±2 F/g was noted at a current density of 0.5 A/g and with excellent capacity retention at 8 A/g even after 2000 cycles. The outstanding electrochemical performance of RGO-Cu nanocomposite can be using as electrode material for future electrochemical energy storage in particular high performance supercapacitor applications.
