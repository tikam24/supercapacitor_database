An interdigitated immunosensor for Cystatin C detection based on polypyrrole/carbon nanotube electrochemical capacitor is described. Cystatin C (CysC) is powerful biomarker for early acute renal failure and one predictive for cardiovascular risk, sepsis, cancer and death. Recently, electrochemical immunosensors based on interdigitated electrodes (IDE) have been successfully focused on development of point-of-care testing, due to their miniaturization facilities and higher sensitivity as compared with the screen-printed electrochemical sensing. Herein, a polypyrrole/carbon nanotube nanoyhibrid film was grafted on two gold fingers by electropolymerization obtaining a supercapacitor. Anti-CysC antibodies were immobilized on the IDE by covalent entrapment via ethylenediamine bifunctional agent, followed by glycine blocking in acid and alkaline medium. Under low frequency, capacitive effect of antigen-antibody interaction were observed by double layer capacitance, and analytical responses of this IDE immunosensor to CysC serum were obtained by changes on phase angle a linear range up to 300 ng/mL. The cutoff was calculated for serum samples showing a total reducing of non-specific binding at approximately 28 ng/mL CysC. This immunosensor based on interdigitated electrode (IDE) is a potential tools as portable device,with possibility to use as a practical and rapid test for CysC diagnostic in samples of serum.
