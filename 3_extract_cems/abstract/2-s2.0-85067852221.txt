This paper describes the design charging and discharging supercapacitors of LED lamps for emergency lighting rated 10-W, 12-V. Designing two modules of supercapacitors used, each 33.33-F, 15-V. By SC1 and SC2 are charged by simultaneously until fully. When the power outage SC1 will discharging the led lamps until the voltage reduced to 5-V. Then SC2 will discharging charge to the led lamp until the voltage reduced to 5-V. Causing both SC1 and SC2 to not be able to discharge energy. When the electrical system enters normal conditions, both SC1 and SC2 will be recharged again. The results showed that was when supercapacitors charged by plugging in to the 220-Vac electrical system. The supercapacitors were fully charged at 15.4-V in 10 minutes. After that, the relay control circuit would disconnected the charging process. In case of power outage, the supercapacitors discharging to the LED lamps. It can give luminance for 28.34 minutes. The luminous efficacy of emergency lighting was 20.20 lumens per watt.
