Owing to the limited electrochemical performance of pristine metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for supercapacitors, precursor conversion method is employed to synthesize sheet-like and sphere-like Ni(OH) 2 using a MOF template based on the exploration of Ni-MOF at different growth time. The morphology has significant impact on the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH) 2 electrode, we compare the electrochemical behavior of sheet-like Ni(OH) 2 and sphere-like Ni(OH) 2 by means of CV, GCD and EIS test. Electrochemical evolution demonstrates that the sphere-like Ni(OH) 2 delivers a superior specific capacitance (982 Fg −1 at 1 Ag −1 ), better cycling life span and also relatively low resistance, which can be attributed to its porous structure and large accessible specific surface area. Our findings lead us to conclude that the sphere-like Ni(OH) 2 synthesized by a facile method is shown to be potentially attractive candidate in supercapacitors.
