Polyaniline (PANi) particles with hierarchy are prepared by adding (NH 4)2S2O8 dropwise into aqueous solution containing aniline monomer and HCl acid at 0°C under nitrogen atmosphere with stirring. SEM images show that the resulted PANi particles are composed of their primary particles, which are composed of multi-layer flakes. Symmetric redox supercapacitor (prototype) is assembled with the PANi particles as active electrode materials and 2 mol·L-1 H 2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor are tested with cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedancespectroscopy. When the charge-discharge current is 7 mA, the specific energy and specific power of the supercapacitor can reach 6.35 Wh·kg-1 and 132 W·kg-1 (based on the mass of PANi), respectively; the capacitance of PANi electrode is about 408 F·g-1. When the charge-discharge current is 20 mA, the specific energy and specific power of the supercapacitor can reach 4.39 Wh·kg-1 and 328 W·kg-1 (based on the weight of PANi), respectively; the capacitance of PANi electrode is about 324 F·g-1. During 100 charge-discharge cycles, the discharge capacity of the supercapacitor is constant, and the charge-discharge efficiency is 95%. The results show that the PANi supercapacitor with hierarchial particles as active electrode material can store a great deal of charge and energy in H2SO4 solution.
