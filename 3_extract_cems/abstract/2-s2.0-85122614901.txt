Current overshooting, which is a common but undesired phenomenon in the rapid charging process of supercapacitors, is harmful for chargers. In this paper, we propose an intelligent charging method for supercapacitors with set point modulation to eliminate the current overshoot. The charging system is modeled using the differential equation and the motivation is presented. Then, an intelligent charging method is designed to charge the supercapacitor by smoothing the set point of the charger, which can suppress current overshoot while maintaining the same charging time. Thereafter, we provide a case study to show how to design the parameters of the intelligent controllers. We build a laboratory testbed to prove the validity of the proposed intelligent charging method. Experiment results indicate that the proposed method has a better current overshoot suppression performance compared with the classical method.
