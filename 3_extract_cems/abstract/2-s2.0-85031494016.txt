Recently, the number of research publications has increased drastically in the field of supercapacitors. Therefore, it is very important to compare and analyse reported results via standardized procedures. Karthikeyan et al. (RSC Adv., 2012, 2, 12322-12328) reported a study titled "Microwave synthesis of a graphene/magnetite composite electrode material for a symmetric supercapacitor". Herein, I demonstrated that Karthikeyan et al. overestimated the electrochemical supercapacitor performance. The actual electrochemical supercapacitor analysis reveals that the supercapacitor performance is much lower than that reported in the abovementioned study. In my opinion, it is very confusing to make a quantitative comparison between their results and the state-of-the-art electrode material performance evolution.
