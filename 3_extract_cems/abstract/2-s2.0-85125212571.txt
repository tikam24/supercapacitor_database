Onion-like carbon (OLC) is one kind of a quasi-nanosphere with a concentric graphite shell structure and abundant mesopores, which is appropriate for a high rate of charging/discharging and long-lifespan cycling. However, the moderate specific surface area seriously impeded its capacitance performance in comparison with activated carbon and porous carbon. Herein, we have unlocked the Zn ion storage performance of OLC material through introducing N and P dopants. Benefitting from the fabricated N,P-OLC with a fully accessible external surface area for ion adsorption, high proportion of mesopores for fast ion migration, and synergistic effect of N and P co-doping in a carbon matrix favoring chemical adsorption of Zn2+ions, when applied as a cathode electrode for Zn ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such a device can deliver a high specific capacitance of 420.3 F g-1(184.5 mA h g-1) at 0.5 A g-1, an outstanding capacitance retention capability of 262.7 F g-1even at 20 A g-1(âˆ¼63% capacitance retention), a high energy density of 149.5 W h kg-1, and a high power density of 26.7 kW kg-1. Furthermore, this N,P-OLC material can in situ tightly integrate with a carbon cloth (CC) or carbon fiber to construct a freestanding and flexible electrode. The fabricated Zn//N,P-OLC@CC device achieved a high energy density of 85.3 mW h cm-2, a high power density of 24.3 W cm-2, and a long-term cycling lifespan (77.8% after 50 000 cycles). At last, the assembled quasi-solid-state fiber-shaped ZHSCs also present excellent flexibility and practicality. Our study exhibits that OLC can act as a promising carbon electrode for ZHSCs.
