5.8 trillion cigarettes are smoked worldwide per annum. The discarded cigarette ash (CA) derived from the lighted cigarette is a major waste disposal and environmental pollution hazard. In an effort to turn dangerous waste into high value products, a facile and novel dual-templating (Mg(OH)2·3MgCO3·3H2O and ZnCl2) strategy to fabricate high oxygen-containing porous carbon materials (CAPC-X-Y) with nitrogen external defects engaging the discarded cigarette ash as carbon source is demonstrated. The nitrogen defects possess a positive effect on the distribution of electron density and surface condition, while the rich oxygen functional groups could provide surface wettability and extra pseudocapacitance. In virtue of both configurable and compositional superiorities, the high oxygen-containing (42.7 at.%) porous carbon materials with nitrogen external defects manifest remarkable performance for supercapacitors (SCs) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings shed fundamental insight on the design of dual function cost-free carbon for optimizing hydrogen evolution reaction and supercapacitor storage properties.
