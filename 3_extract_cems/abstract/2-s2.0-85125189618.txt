A compound energy management strategy is proposed to improve the fuel cell’s durability and the economy of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV). A control strategy that combines fuzzy control and switching control is proposed, taking into account factors that affect the fuel cell’s durability and the supercapacitor park’s safety. To smooth the output power of fuel cells under frequent variable load conditions, a moving average filtering algorithm has been added. Finally, co-simulation using Advisor and Matlab/Simulink under the World Light Vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) compares the proposed strategy with fuzzy control and power following strategies. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy ensures the safety of the supercapacitor park and improves the durability of the fuel cell while improving the economy of the whole vehicle.
