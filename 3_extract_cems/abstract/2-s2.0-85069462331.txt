Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) microtube electrodes doped with different acids and surfactants were obtained by one-step electrochemical deposition method and could be used for flexible and all-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs). We also investigated the effect of deposition time on the capacitance performance of PEDOT microtubes doped with the same acid medium and surfactant. The structures of the final product were characterized by different characterization techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FT-IR spectra. The electrochemical results showed that the capacitance of PEDOT microtubes doped with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) could be improved significantly. The areal capacitance of the prepared supercapacitor with deposition time of 600 s could achieve to 113.5 mF • cm-2 at the scan rate of 10 mV • s-1. The areal capacitances under the different bending angles remained at 93% of initial capacitive value revealing that the supercapacitor had highly mechanical stability. In addition, it remained 95.5% of the initial capacitive value after 2 000 cycles at a current density of 0.6 mA • cm-2 showing its superior cycling stability. The prepared flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor can power a light-emitting-diode (LED) which meets the practical applications of micro-power supplies.
