The graphene/polyaniline novel composites have been synthesized through modified hummers' method and in situ polymerization and treated the composite with microwave irradiation. The composites with various weight feed ratio of polyaniline (PANI) to graphene are synthesized and dura-tion for microwave treatment has been optimized. Then the composites have been characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge and Discharge (GCD) measurements and Electrochemical Imped-ance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical tests show that the electrochemical performances of microwave treated graphene/PANI depend largely on the mass ratios of PANI to graphene and the microwave treatment. Compared with the electrode materials, the composite (MPG21) has the highest specific capacitance of 249.32 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 10 mVs-1 and good charge and discharge cycling stability. The improved electro-chemical performances of microwave treated graphene/PANI are ascribed to the synergistic effects between the PANI and graphene. The excellentelectrochemical performance of the composite electrode suggests of promising application for high performance supercapacitor.
