Anodic processes on aluminum used as a current collector in electric double-layer capacitors in a 0.1 M solution of tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate in acetonitrile are studied to determine its corrosion resistance. It is shown that aluminum can be anodically dissolved in an aprotic electrolyte of a supercapacitor with formation of electroconductive films on its surface.
