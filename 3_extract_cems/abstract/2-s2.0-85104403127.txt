Poplar catkins, as a typical biotemplate, has great potential for designing of interconnected porous carbon (IPC) toward hybrid supercapacitors. Herein, NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH)/IPC composites were prepared and utilized as competitive materials of supercapacitor electrodes. NiCo LDH/IPC electrode displays the better electrochemical performance (209.7 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1) than pure NiCo LDH electrode (148.6 mAh g −1 at 1 A g −1). Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) were assembled using a positive electrode of as-prepared NiCo LDH/IPC and a negative electrode of IPC. The NiCo LDH/IPC||IPC provides the higher specific energy of 29.6 Wh kg−1 and better cycling stability than NiCo LDH||IPC, which is ascribed to the introducing of IPC with advanced porous structure, improving the electrochemical performance.
