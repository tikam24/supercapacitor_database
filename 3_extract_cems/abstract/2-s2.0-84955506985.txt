The layered MnWO4/reduced graphene oxide (MnWO4/RGO) was prepared through a facile one-pot low-temperature hydrothermal route without using any templates. The structure and morphology of MnWO4/RGO nanocomposite were characterized through X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption/desorption and thermo-gravimetric analysis. While its electrochemical behaviors were investigated using cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. In the case of three electrode cells, MnWO4/RGO with 7.28 wt% RGO content fulfilled a maximum specific capacitance of 288 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 with the potential range from -0.35-0.55 V. While in the two electrode cell, it obtained a maximum specific capacitance of 109 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and displayed the cycle life of 14.9% capacitance decline after 6000 cycles.
