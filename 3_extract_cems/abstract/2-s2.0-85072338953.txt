Reasonable design of multi-compositions electrode material with hierarchical structure can effectively enhance the electrochemical performance of electrode. Here, the hierarchical structure of MoS2/Co3S4/Ni3S4 (CMS) nanosheet-on-nanorod arrays have been synthesized through a simple in situ hydrothermal. The growth process is proposed according to the morphology evolution on hydrothermal time. The hierarchical structure obtained through optimized time enhances the accessible surface area for electrolyte, and multi-compositions provide rich redox reactions. Therefore, the hierarchical CMS electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 3.94 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, and prominent cycle stability with 91.8% retention after 5000 cycles. These results demonstrate that the CMS electrode developed in this study has good potential for high-performance supercapacitors.
