To enhance the reduced graphene oxide hydrogels' capacitive performance, many modifiers are used to add doped element into the materials and improve the structure. The isomers of aminophenol which contain amino and hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring are employed as structure regulator and modifier to synthesize high-performance reduced graphene oxide hydrogels. The influences of preparation conditions including ratios of graphene oxide to aminophenol isomers, temperature, reaction times on the samples’ structure and properties have been investigated. The results show that the oligomer of o-aminophenol is formed on reduced graphene oxide sheets while the molecules of p, m-aminophenol are bound to the sheets; and that the hydrogel prepared in the presence of p-aminophenol has larger specific surface area, total pore volume, specific capacitance and good rate capability (74.0% of 427.0 F g−1 retains at 100 mV s−1) than other. The cells assembled by the optimized hydrogels exhibit the energy density of 14.07 Wh kg−1 at power density of 124.3 W kg−1, and 4.96 Wh kg−1 at 6.78 kW kg−1. Furthermore, 92.2% of initial capacitance can be retained after 20,000 cycles for the cells assembled by the optimal hydrogel. This kind of material may be found its use in energy storage field.
