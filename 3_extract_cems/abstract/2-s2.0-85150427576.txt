Unique hierarchical mesoporous with hollow nanostructures of rare earth transition metal oxides (RE-TMOs) has obtained significant research notice owing to its surface permeability (hollow interior), bulky surface area, low density, as electrode materials for better search of supercapacitors. Nevertheless, controlling the hallow nanostructures in a simple method is a very challenging one. A unique SmMnO3/MWCNT material as a potential battery-typesupercapacitor electrode material was prepared from a solvothermal method in water/ethanol media. The as prepared SmMnO3/MWCNT electrode delivered 47.13 mAh/g@1A/g specific capacities from the galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis and delivered 86.22% capacity retention over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, an assembled hybrid supercapacitor (SmMnO3/MWCNT//CNT HSC) displays 255.82 F/g specific capacitance, 79.94 Wh/Kg @ 1 A/g energy density, 14996.39 W/Kg@20 A/g power densities with the decent cycling stability of 79.83% and coulombic efficiency of 99.84%@20000 cycles.
