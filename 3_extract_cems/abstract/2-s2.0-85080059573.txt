Microwave irradiation is one of the heating modes which is employed in the preparation of porous carbon materials. The activated carbon materials prepared using microwave heating are highly capable to serve as an adsorbent, or as an anode material in energy storage applications such as supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries. The scientific background of microwave-assisted carbonization, activation, and regeneration of spent activated carbon are explained. The advantages over conventional heating methods, its application potential, disadvantages and limitations are presented in this paper. This analysis is completed with reported cost production data and electrical energy consumptions.
