Carbon electrode materials from agricultural and forestry biomass have drawn great research attention for supercapacitor applications based on their renewable nature, intrinsic porous structures, widespread availability, and environmental friendliness. In recent years, various promising methods have been applied to the synthesis and structural design of biomass-derived porous carbons (BDPCs), and significant breakthroughs have been made. In this work, we try to review the current research on the synthesis methods of BDPC-based electrode materials by comprehensively and systematically summarizing recent advances in the synthesis methods. The main activation methods for BDPCs and the promising modification methods for the improvement of their electrochemical performance, including heteroatom doping and incorporation of metal compounds, are summarized and discussed. Perspectives regarding the promising research directions and challenges on the further development of electrode materials from biomass materials are also provided.
