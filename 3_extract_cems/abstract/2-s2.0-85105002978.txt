Nickel phosphide (NiP) and bimetallic nickel–cobalt phosphide (NiCoP) materials were obtained from Ni–MOF and bimetallic NiCo–MOF followed by optimizing conditions to make them suitable for strongly active electrode substances for high-rate supercapacitor applications. NiCoP was shown to be of higher specific capacitance of 1456 F/g at a current density of 2 A/g and very reasonable capacitance retention of 968 F/g at 100 A/g. This excellent capacitance behavior can be due to additional redox processes that are carried out by the Co metal and synergistic effects between Ni and Co in the NiCoP structure. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on the NiCoP as a positive electrode and active carbon as a negative electrode was assembled. Surprisingly, the NiCoP//AC ASC showed a high energy density of 36.87 Wh/kg and a power density of 2250 W/kg at current density of 3 A/g. Overall, Bimetallic NiCoP exhibited intriguing potential for storing energy in the fabricated high-performance supercapacitor.
