Biochar produced during the thermochemical decomposition of biomass not only reduces the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere, but it is also an environment-friendly replacement for activated carbon and other carbon materials. In this review paper, researches on biochar are discussed in terms of production method and application. Different processes for biochar production, such as pyrolysis, gasification, hydrothermal carbonization, etc., are compared. Physical and chemical activation methods used to improve the physicochemical properties of biochar and their effects are also compared. Various environmental application fields of biochar including adsorption (for water pollutants and for air pollutants), catalysis (for syngas upgrading, for biodiesel production, and for air pollutant treatment), and soil conditioning are discussed. Recent research trend of biochar in other applications, such as fuel cell, supercapacitor, and hydrogen storage, is also reviewed.
