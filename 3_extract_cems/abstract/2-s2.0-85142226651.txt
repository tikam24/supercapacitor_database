Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are synthetic electrolytes that have a large electrochemical stability window, making them attractive candidates for electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) applications. Due to their high viscosities and low ionic conductivities, RTILs are often diluted with organic solvent for practical use. We study the effects of dilution on the performance of RTIL EDLCs using a simple mean-field model. We find that dilution diminishes the unfavorable hysteresis that results from a spontaneous surface charge separation (SSCS). As a result, the RTIL concentration can be used to modulate the proximity to the SSCS transition, and maximize capacitance. The interplay between the concentration and the correlation strength gives rise to complex zero-potential phase behavior, including a tricritical point and a Î»-line, very similar to the Blume-Capel dilute Ising model. Additionally, electrodes that are solvophilic aid in the prevention of SSCS by drawing solvent molecules to the electrode and displacing ions. Solvophilic electrodes give rise to a phase transition at finite potential where the surface charge rapidly increases with a small increase in potential, leading to a substantial increase in capacitance and energy storage.
