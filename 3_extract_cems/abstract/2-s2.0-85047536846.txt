Herein, we propose a novel scalable and ascendant strategy to design a CoMoS@Co(OH)2 core-shell architecture possessing a CoMoS nanorod "core" and Co(OH)2 nanoflakes as the "shell" layer wall for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor application. The surface architecture and material properties of the prepared material are characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Experimental analysis verifies that the nano-porous core-shell CoMoS@Co(OH)2 architecture is strongly interconnected with the carbon cloth, ensuring sufficiently porous nanostructures. The core-shell CoMoS@Co(OH)2 architecture exhibits a high capacitance of 1711 F g-1 at a current density of 20 mA cm-2, demonstrating a powerful synergistic effect efficiently using all of the desired functions of each material constituent. Finally, a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor is fabricated using CoMoS@Co(OH)2 and activated carbon as electrodes (CoMoS@Co(OH)2//AC) and a polymer-based gel electrolyte. The fabricated flexible CoMoS@Co(OH)2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device delivers an energy density of 58.1 W h kg-1 over the voltage range of 0-2 V with a capacitance retention of 91.47% after 8000 cycles. The illumination of a red light-emitting diode for more than 1.5 min is experimentally confirmed using a single solid-state CoMoS@Co(OH)2//AC supercapacitor. These advantages indicate the considerable potential that the core-shell CoMoS@Co(OH)2 architecture possesses for commercial applications.
