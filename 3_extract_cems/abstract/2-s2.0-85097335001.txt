Swift heavy ion (SHI) beam irradiation technique is one of the sophisticated techniques used for modifying material properties to design efficient devices. In this report, the casted MoS2- PVA nanocomposite films have been irradiated with 80 MeV C6+, 100 MeV Si9+, and 120 A g9+ ion beams to achieve enhanced conductivity and have been exploited as an electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitor. PVDF-HFP: TPAI gel polymer electrolyte having 3 wt.% TPAI content showed the highest conductivity and was chosen for the iodide redox gel polymer electrolyte system. The pristine MoS2-PVA nanocomposite films having an electrical conductivity of 2.5E-5 S/cm exhibited specific capacitance of 65.27 F/g whereas the films irradiated with 120 MeV Ag9+ ion beams showed an electrical conductivity of 9.7E-3 S/cm and enhanced specific capacitance of 186.67 F/g. The enhanced capacitance is attributed to the high current density generated due to the increased conductivity of the electrodes.
