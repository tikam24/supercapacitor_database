Nowadays, hybrid DC microgrid has attracted a lot of attentions due to its wide applications. One of the biggest challenges can be considered as coping with pulse load unfavorable effects in DC microgrid. In this situation, DC bus voltage can rise and fall in response to pulse load on- or off-states; hence, supercapacitor with large capacitance is required to prevent variations in the microgrid voltage. In this paper, a novel SC active control is presented which will reduce the SC needed capacitance and voltage drop in the microgrid by connecting the SC to microgrid via a bidirectional converter and providing instantaneous current of pulse load. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by several case studies which are investigated through simulation environment.
