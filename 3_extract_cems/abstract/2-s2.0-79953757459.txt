The paper focuses on the influence of layer structure of graphite oxide, crystallinity, and the content of surface functional groups on the electrochemical capacitance performance. Graphite oxide (GO)samples as electrode materials were prepared by modified Hummer method using spectroscopically pure(SP) graphite and chemically pure(CP) graphite as precursors. The surface chemistry of the resultant GO samples were studied by XPS and FT-IR spectrum, and the structure of GO samples were tested by XRD, FE-SEM and the nitrogen adsorption at 77 K. Their electrochemical properties were investigated by charge-discharge of constant current, cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectrum and so on. The results showed that the specific capacitance of the supercapacitors made by SP GO was lower, and the maximum was 18.8 F/g; then CP GO was processed by ball milling, the specific capacitance of the samples raised, and the maximum was 119.7 F/g.
