With the progress and development of electrochromic (EC)technologies in various applications, the demand for multicolor EC devices (ECDs)has been increasing, and it has a huge connection with the expansion of the market. This paper reports on a novel multicolor ECD with a simple hybrid capacitor architecture (glass/ITO/multi-EC gel/carbon/glass), containing both anodic and cathodic EC materials. By employing the carbon capacitor electrode having porous morphology and large surface area as a counter electrode, even large charge amount consumed by multiple redox pairsâ€™ cathodic materials was adequately compensated. The successful fabrication of the device, consequently, it provides four well-defined colors (white, green, yellow, and red)in one single device.
