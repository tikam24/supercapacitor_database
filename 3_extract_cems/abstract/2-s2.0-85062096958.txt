In this paper, a decentralized energy management strategy (EMS) based on the improved mixed droop control is proposed for a hybrid power supply system (HPSS) with multiple fuel cells (FCs) and supercapacitors (SCs). By utilizing a virtual inductor droop (VID) scheme to the FC converter and a virtual resistor droop (VRD) scheme to the SC converter, the proposed EMS is able to split the load power automatically into low- and high-frequency components and allocate them to the FC and SC units, respectively. Since the proposed EMS is fully decentralized, it features high flexibility and scalability, and sources have hot-plug function (to add or remove sources at run time). Furthermore, the proposed strategy is not only suitable for extending the service life of the system because the voltage recovery and protection of the SC have been considered in doing the energy management, but also it can accommodate the regenerative power in a lossless way. The operational principle and system expansion method of the proposed strategy are elaborated, followed by which hardware-in-the-loop simulations are conducted to verify its feasibility.
