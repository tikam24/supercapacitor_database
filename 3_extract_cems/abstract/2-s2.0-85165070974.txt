Graphene quantum dots were synthesized in a simple one-step procedure using citric acid as starting material. 4-Ferrocenylbutanol as a battery-type electrode material was further used to modify the surface of graphene quantum dots based on hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. Finally, the nanocomposites with different compositions were synthesized using different amounts of CNT and Fe3O4. Their electrochemical performance shows the properties of the final nanocomposite for practical application in supercapacitors. The final nanocomposite exhibits ideal battery-type capacity, including high capacity of 258 mAh g−1 at 2.5 A g−1, excellent cycle life (89.2 %), and high energy and power density of 75 Wh kg−1 and 6000 W kg−1 (in two electrode system), respectively. The results show superior electrochemical performance and improved ion transfer rate between the electrode/electrolyte surface. The superiority of the final nanocomposite indicates its special properties for potential applications in energy storage devices.
