Biomass porous carbon with a wide range of raw material sources and green and eco-friendly has received extensive attention. In this manucript, the imperata cylindrica has successfully developed as a precursor of a new type of biomass porous carbon. With KOH as an activator and urea as a dopant nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials was formed by one-step pyrolysis and carbonization. And then we investigated the optimal doping ratio of urea. The prepared materials were characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman and XPS. The electrochemical performance of the material was tested by the three-electrode system. The results showed that the prepared electrode material had the best performance when the mass ratio of 2:1. In 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte, when the current density is 1 A/g, the specific capacitance of the material is 304.1 F/g. After 5000 long cycles, the capacity retention rate is 96.24%.
