For the application of lignin-based materials, it is necessary to develop simple and efficient chemical modification strategies for lignin. In this work, the iodization modification strategy is selected to improve the specific surface area and graphitization degree of lignin-based carbon fibers. The introduction of an iodine atom can effectively increase the πelectron cloud density of the lignin aromatic hydrocarbon structure. High πelectron cloud density can effectively enhance the π-πinteraction force between lignin molecules (the supramolecular bonds). The biomass precursors with this intermolecular microstructure exhibit good thermal stability and can maintain the original fibrous morphology during high-temperature treatment, which is beneficial for increasing the specific surface area of biomass-based carbon materials. Furthermore, this intermolecular microstructure also contributes to the graphitization of biomass precursor materials and reduces the spacing of graphite micro-lamellae. The obtained lignin-based carbon fibers with iodization modification exhibit a specific capacitance of 333 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in the three-electrode tests in 6 M KOH solution. As the assembled supercapacitor, the specific capacitance of lignin-based carbon fibers reaches 87 F/g in 1 M Na2SO4 solution. Compared to other modification processes for raw materials, this strategy is simple and efficient and has reference value for the synthesis of other high-performance biomass-based materials.
