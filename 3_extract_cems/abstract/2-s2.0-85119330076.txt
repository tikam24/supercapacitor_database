The present work is an approach to the use of nanomaterials and energy storage and conversion devices—mainly supercapacitors—for the Defense area, aiming to describe, in its more general scope, aspects related to the concepts, tools and methods of nanotechnology related to such devices and their application. In particular, the development of nanomaterials (especially metal oxides and their nanocomposites), which are optimized and applied in devices according to their functionalities, has been pointed out as one of the most promising tools improvement of energy devices, focusing on the area of Defense.
