This paper proposes a forward conversion topology using a multi-winding transformer known as global modular balancing (GMB) for multiple supercapacitor cells connected in a series of high-voltage applications. The proposed topology can easily be modularized and is not limited to the number of supercapacitors existing in the modules. Moreover, the proposed GMB needs merely one MOSFET switch for each supercapacitor, and a one Pulse width modulation circuit that can control all the switches in the modules. Furthermore, the proposed topology is employed to achieve voltage balancing in a supercapacitor string. The proposed topology balancing performance is validated through MATLAB/Simulink Software.
