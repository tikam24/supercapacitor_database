Single crystal like TiO2 nanotubes with preferential orientation along the [001] direction, parallel to the growth direction of nanotubes, that offer ease of charge transport much higher than reported so far, are fabricated using a cost effective two step technique. The success of this method to grow the nanotubes with the anomalous intense [001] preferential orientation is attributed to the zinc assisted minimization of the (001) surface energy. The single crystal like TiO2 nanotubes show superior performance as supercapacitor electrodes compared to the normal polycrystalline titanium dioxide nanotubes.
