This paper deals with the design of battery-supercapacitors energy storage for an electric waste collection vehicle. The vehicle was simulated on an urban driving cycle and a simple power flow management based on the power limitation in battery was developed. The main benefit of the hybridization, the reduction of the losses within the battery, is outlined and we show how the ultracapacitor pack could be designed in order to prevent stress on battery and, consequently, to extend its lifetime.
