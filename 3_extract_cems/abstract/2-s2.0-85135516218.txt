Agricultural waste-derived three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon material enhances the electrochemical performance of symmetrical solid-state supercapacitors (SSCs) which are prepared by using as electrodes and (PVA-Li2SO4) gel polymer electrolyte. A saving and simple carbonization method with solution chemical activation is developed for synthesizing porous carbon from peanut shell with high specific surface area of 1348 m2 g–1. The electrodes making by such 3D porous carbon in a 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 386 F g–1 at current density of 2 A g–1, energy density and power density of 53.61 Wh k g–1 and 1000 W kg–1, respectively. The symmetrical SSCs following sandwich structure of (3D porous carbon P/PVA-Li2SO4/3D porous carbon P) exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 116 F g–1 at current density of 0.5 A g–1 with excellent energy density of 9 W h kg–1 at power density of 380 W kg–1. Moreover, the devices demonstrate good cycling stability 89% retention after 7000 cycles. In this report, the cost-effective, fast and simple process of synthesis 3D porous carbon material from abundant biomass resources is presented which aim to apply in low-cost and highly stability supercapacitors.
