We have developed a simple solvothermal-calcination strategy to synthesize continuous graphitic carbon coated hollow CuO (H-CuO@GC) spheres with excellent electrochemical performance. The H-CuO@GC spheres exhibit a high specific surface area (106.6 m2 g-1), penetrated mesochannels (âˆ¼5-15 nm), a large pore volume (0.313 cm3 g-1), a robust hollow structure, and an integral graphitic carbon layer. The H-CuO@GC sphere electrode presents high capacitance, good rate capability, and outstanding cycling ability in supercapacitors. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by this structure exhibits a good rate capability (retain 75.7% at 10 A g-1) and an excellent cycling stability (90.2% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles), as well as a high energy density (38.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1.018 kW kg-1). This work represents a novel design strategy for the improvement of low-conductive nanomaterials applied in many fields, especially in energy applications.
