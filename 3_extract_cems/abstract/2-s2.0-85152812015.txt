This volume presents papers from International Meeting on Energy Storage Devices (IMSED 2018). It covers the recent research in energy storage devices, specifically for Li-ion battery and supercapacitors, covering their synthesis, characterization of storage materials and associated phenomenon at electrode/electrolyte interfaces, as well as addressing the challenges associated with their disposal, cost, life cycle and usage. This volume will be of interest to researchers and engineers across a variety of fields.
