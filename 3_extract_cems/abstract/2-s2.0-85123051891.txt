Activated carbon with porous structures attracted much attention for supercapacitor applications due to their viability, sustainability, and eco-friendliness. In particular, decentralized and sustainable production of materials related to energy technologies would be enabled through bio-source derived materials. This is the first report on Momordica Charantia as a bio precursor for making electrode material. Herein, KOH-treated porous activated carbon was prepared under different activation temperatures using the pericarp of Momordica Charantia. The activated carbon synthesized at an activation temperature of 900 ℃ showed a high specific surface area of 1126 m2 g−1. It exhibited a specific capacitance of 186 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Symmetric supercapacitor device fabricated delivered an energy density of 8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1 with 98% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in 1 M H2SO4. A further improvement of energy density to a maximum of 23 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 6000 W kg−1 was achieved using dual redox mediators (KI + HQ) in H2SO4 due to the redox activity of the I2/I− and Q/HQ redox species at the positive electrode.
