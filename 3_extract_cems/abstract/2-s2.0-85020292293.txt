Tin oxide nanopowders were synthesised by co-precipitation method using ammonia as reducing agent. XRD study shows that the average crystallite size of different temperature sintered tin oxide samples is 10 nm. The increase in sintering temperature enriched redshift in absorbance and decreased the bandgap of the tin oxide samples. The electrochemical property of super capacitance performance has been studied using Cyclic-Voltammetry system. The maximum specific capacitance was obtained for sample with low crystallite size.
