One of the main steps to improve the ecology of large cities is to abandon the use of internal combustion engine transport in favors of electric buses (EB). The main objective of this work is to unite alternative sources of electricity generation, both on board the bus and in the transport infrastructure, for fast charging/recharging of EB with ultracapacitor-based energy storage unit. Comparison of the costs of introducing a new EB route and a trolleybus was carried out. It was determined that the total cost of the trolleybus route is approximately 2.65 times higher. Requirements for alternative electricity generation systems (EE) for charging urban EBs on board and in transport infrastructure were formulated. A method of creating an integrated system of alternative sources of electricity generation (ASEG) for urban passenger transport was developed in the EB and the transport infrastructure for charging urban EB. The possibility of application of alternative energy sources in transport infrastructure and in electric buses is studied. In addition, the energy balance in EE has been drawn up taking into account ASGEE. The presented results are the basis for the development of a business project for the introduction of environmentally friendly transport in large cities.
