An electrode based on hollow MoS2 spheres intercalated graphene film was firstly fabricated. When used as an electrode in a supercapacitor, the unique structure can provide electrically conducting channels to promote electrolyte penetration and utilize their surface as much as possible. Thus, the resultant binder-free electrode demonstrated a high specific capacity of 286.8Fg-1 more than 2 times of pure MoS2 hollow spheres (116.4Fg-1). A supercapacitor based on MoS2/grapheme and active carbon can achieve a maximum energy density of 22.0W hkg-1 at 800Wkg-1. The outstanding electrochemical properties of the hybrid electrode demonstrate that it holds great potential for the next-generation energy storage applications.
