Due to the high specific capacitance and wide operating potential of iron compounds, iron metaphosphates are expected to be high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. Herein, we propose a strategy for preparing three-dimensional (3D) flower-like iron metaphosphates on iron substrates, which includes anodization of Fe and subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The rod-like ferrous oxalate films are obtained by anodization of Fe in an oxalic acid electrolyte. Then 3D flower-like iron metaphosphates can be obtained through hydrothermal treatment of ferrous oxalate films soaked in phosphoric acid solution. The prepared 3D flower-like iron metaphosphates electrode displays a high areal capacitance of 117.4 mF cmâˆ’2, about 12.6 times higher than that of pure iron. In addition, this kind of iron metaphosphates may be further used in electrocatalysis, solar cells, and so on.
