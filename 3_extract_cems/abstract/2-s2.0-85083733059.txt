It remains a great challenge to simultaneously guarantee the conductivity and high areal loading of active materials for integrated electrode of supercapacitors. Herein, we designed a hierarchical structure with cores of NiSe single-crystal nanorods and sheaths of 2-nm-thick NiCo thin sheets grown on nickel foam (NiCo LDH@NiSe/NF) as integrated electrode. It reaches a high areal capacity of 1131 μAh cm−2 at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, which is 2.2 times of NiSe/NF (522 μAh cm−2) and 6.0 times of NiCo LDH/NF (189 μAh cm−2), superior to most reported integrated electrodes. The enhanced areal capacity can be ascribed to the high active material loading of 6.5 mg cm−2 (twice more than other reported values) and considerable conductivity of single-crystal NiSe nanorods of 2630 S cm−1. The fabricated hierarchical integrated electrode of NiCo LDH@NiSe/NF assembled with activated carbon shows a maximum energy density of 0.454 mWh cm−2 and a maximum power density of 80 mW cm−2. This work presents supports of single-crystal nanorods for thin LDH sheets to fabricate high-density hierarchical structure for integrated electrode, which improves the conductivity and structural stability of active materials especially the LDHs, resulting in excellent electrochemical performance. It offers a promising approach to engineer and fabricate advanced supercapacitors with enhanced areal capacity.
