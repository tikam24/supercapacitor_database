“C2N”-species have emerged as a promising material with carbon-like applications in sorption, gas separation and energy storage, while with much higher polarity and functionality. Controlled synthesis of “C2N” structure is still based on complex and less-sustainable monomers, which prohibits its broader industrial application. Here we report a class of well-defined C2(NxOySz)1 carbons with both high content of N/O/S heteroatoms and large specific surface area of up to 1704 m2 g−1, which can be efficiently synthesized through a simple additive condensation process using simple gallic acid and thiourea as the building blocks, without sub-tractive activation. This 1,4-para tri-doped C2(NxOySz)1 structure leads to sufficient CO2 adsorption capacity (3.0 mmol g−1 at 273 K, 1 bar) and a high CO2/N2 selectivity (47.5 for a 0.15/0.85 CO2/N2 mixture at 273 K). Related to the polarity, the polar frameworks can be used as supercapacitor electrodes, with record specific capacitances as high as 255 F g−1at 3.5 V for a symmetric supercapacitor in ionic liquid electrolyte. This work discloses a general way for preparing a novel family of multifunctional, high heteroatom-doped porous materials for various applications.
