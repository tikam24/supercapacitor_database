Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and Co-doped MoS2/N, S-rGO composite have been prepared using the hydrothermal method. As prepared materials, crystal structures and morphology are analyzed by XRD, and HR-TEM. XPS carried out the elemental compositions of the material. The nano composite of Co-doped MoS2/N, S-rGO deliver a high capacity of 626 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with excellent cyclic stability of 95% capacity retention over 4000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles at 5 A/g. Co-MoS2/N, S-rGO composite can be used as a promising electrode materials for supercapacitors with high power density and high energy density.
