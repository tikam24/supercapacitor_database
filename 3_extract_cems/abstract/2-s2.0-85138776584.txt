In this paper, a battery pack and a supercapacitor bank hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with a new control configuration is proposed for electric vehicles (EVs). A bidirectional quasi-Z-source inverter (Bq-ZSI) and a bidirectional DC-DC converter are used in the powertrain of the EV. The scheme of the control for the proposed HESS Bq-ZSI using finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is first deduced to enhance the dynamic performance. With the idea of managing battery degradation mitigation, the fractional-order PI (FOPI) controller is then applied and associated with a filtering technique. The Opal-RT-based real-time simulation is next executed to verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed HESS control strategy. As a result, the proposed HESS Bq-ZSI with this control scheme provides a quick response to the mechanical load and stable DC link voltage under the studied driving cycle. Moreover, the comparative results also show that the proposed HESS Bq-ZSI equipped with the new control configuration enables the reduction of the root-mean-square value, the mean value, and the standard deviation by 57%, 59%, and 27%, respectively, of the battery current compared to the battery-based inverter. Thus, the proposed HESS Bq-ZSI using these types of controllers can help to improve the EV system performance.
