3D porous carbon electrodes (cNPIM), prepared by solution casting of a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1) followed by nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) and carbonization are presented. In order to effectively control the pore size of 3D porous carbon structures, cNPIM was prepared by varying the THF ratio of mixed solvents. The SEM analysis revealed that cNPIMs have a unique 3D macroporous structure having a gradient pore structure, which is expected to grant a smooth and easy ion transfer capability as an electrode material. In addition, the cNPIMs presented a very large specific surface area (2,101.1 m 2 /g) with a narrow micropore size distribution (0.75 nm). Consequently, the cNPIM exhibits a high specific capacitance (304.8 F/g) and superior rate capability of 77% in an aqueous electrolyte. We believe that our approach can provide a variety of new 3D porous carbon materials for the application to an electrochemical energy storage.
