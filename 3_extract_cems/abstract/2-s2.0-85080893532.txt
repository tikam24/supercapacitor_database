Supercapacitors are promising for high power applications particularly in the transport sectors. The recent developments in the electric vehicles require such devices to meet out their high power and increase the life of the batteries. Hybridization of batteries and supercapacitors are encouraging and attempts are in progress. Thus, fabrication of supercapacitor with high energy density without conceding their power density is highly essential. In the present work, a high efficiency Fe (III) doped BiOCl ultrathin nanosheets (Fe (III)/BiOCl) were developed by an effective solvothermal route. The structural, morphological, surface area and chemical composition were analyzed by using XRD, Raman, FESEM, HR-TEM, EIS, BET, and XPS techniques. The electrochemical performance of evaluation showed that a specific capacitance of 540 F/g and 125 F/g respectively in three and two electrodes configuration for 6 wt% Fe (III) doped BiOCl nanosheets. In addition, the charge-discharge cycling demonstrated high electrochemical stability for 5000 cycles at high current density 5 A/g with a high energy density of 17 Wh/Kg.
