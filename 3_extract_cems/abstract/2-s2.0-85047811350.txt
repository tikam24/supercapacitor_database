Nanostructured hybrids have attracted great interest in the development of high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, a novel hierarchical nanohybrid of La(OH)3 electrostatically anchored onto 2D-Graphene nanosheets (GNs) were prepared by a simple solvothermal reduction method and investigated as an electrode material for supercapacitors for the first time. This 2D La(OH)3-G nanohybrid electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 485 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 295 F g−1 at 15 A g−1 with 61% of capacitance retention from 1 A g−1 to 15 A g−1 in 6 M KOH in the potential window of −0.2–0.4 V. This nanohybrid electrode provides a convenient and advantageous way for charge and ion transport and highly accessible electroactive sites to improve the performance of supercapacitors. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with La(OH)3-G nanohybrids as a positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode produce the highest specific capacitance of 69 F g−1 at of 1 A g−1 and retains 82.6% up to 5000 cycles with 97% Coulombic efficiency in 6 M KOH. These electrochemical findings demonstrate La(OH)3-G nanohybrid as a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
