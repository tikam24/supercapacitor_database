This paper systematically studies the influence of temperature during KOH activation of graphene on quantities and types of oxygen-containing groups, pore structure, specific surface area, and performance of supercapacitor. The changes of the amount and types of oxygen-containing functional groups were observed with the aid of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The pore structure and specific surface area were characterized by means of X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption and transmission electron microscopy. Electrochemical properties were assessed by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and galvanostatic charge-discharge. As the temperature increased, the oxygen content of activated graphene decreased, while its specific surface area increased. The specific capacitance of the activated graphene first increased and then decreased with a maximum (326 F/g) at 400 °C. When the temperature was 800 °C, the surface area of the material peaked (3269 m2/g), and the specific capacitance was 204 F/g.
