The conventional super-capacitor (SC) energy storage system and the equalizer are often designed separately, resulting in the need of a large number of equalization devices. In view of this, this paper proposes a novel voltage self-balancing topology, which reuses the first column of super-capacitors (SCs) as equalizing devices to realize the voltage self-equalization of the array. The entire equalizing system has only SCs and switches, which greatly reduces the number of components and the complexity of circuit. At the same time, during the equalization process, the equivalent capacitor is used to replace the parallel capacitor bank to obtain the characteristics of the SC's voltage, current and energy loss. With the characteristics of SC that can be charged and discharged with the large current, the array can be quickly balanced. The working modes of the topology are introduced in detail, and PSIM simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed topology, and the multi-module comparative analysis proves that the proposed topology has good scalability. Finally, a 4 series 2 parallel SC array is designed to carry out the voltage self-equalization experiment, which proves its effectiveness and practicability.
