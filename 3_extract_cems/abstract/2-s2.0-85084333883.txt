In this study, a novel polypyrrole (PPy)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/lead dioxide (PbO2) nanocomposite (PGPb) has been successfully fabricated by a one pot cathodic electrodeposition method for the first time and characterized systematically. The fabricated electrode exhibited an enhanced electrochemical capacitance of 514 F g−1 and a capacitance retention of 86% even after 4000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. The enhanced specific capacitance, rate capability, and cycling performance are ascribed to the rapid transferring path for electrons and ions and the structural integrity and stability endowed by synergy.
