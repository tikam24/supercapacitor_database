Pyrrole was polymerized on the surface of titanium foam using FeCl 3 as oxidant and the as-synthesized product could be directly used as electrode for supercapacitor. The globular polypyrrole (PPy) particles were firmly loaded on the substrate with high density. The morphology study of PPy film is observed in SEM images, the XRD, FTIR and UV-vis spectra reveal the structure and crystalline of PPy nanoparticles. The electrochemical properties of PPy modified electrode are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and cycle life techniques. The electrochemical measurements showed such a PPy-Ti electrode had a wide working potential window, a high specific capacitance of 855 F g-1 and excellent cycle stability at a discharge current density of 1 A g-1.
