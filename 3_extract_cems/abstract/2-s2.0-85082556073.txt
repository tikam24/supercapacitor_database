The high B-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (HPB-OMC) was prepared by using 4-hydroxyphenylboronic acid-modified phenolic resin (HPBPF) as a boron and carbon precursor via the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) approach. The chemical composite, mesoporous structure, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared HPB-OMC are investigated. The results show that both highly boron-doped and well-ordered mesoporous structure are achieved for HPB-OMCs, owing to the improvement of solubility of the resins in ethanol, and the enhancement of thermal stability of pore channels during carbonization. Moreover, the HPB-OMCs exhibit an ideal electric double-layer capacitor performance. With the increase of the B-doped content, the specific capacitance of the HPB-OMC electrode rises gradually, then drops off a little. The HPB-OMC with a high B content (3.96 wt%) shows a much high specific capacitance of 183 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, suggesting its promising application in the field of supercapacitors.
