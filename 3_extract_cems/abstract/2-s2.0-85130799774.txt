The electrode material has played an essential role in the performance of supercapacitors. In this paper, we report a mesoporous polymorphic CoSe2@N-doped carbon (CoSe2@N–C) material synthesized by a facile and efficient in-situ microwave process derived from cobalt organic framework (Co-MOF). The as-synthesized CoSe2@N–C electrode shows polymorphism with a stable mesoporous morphology and exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance which is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of N-doped carbon material, mesoporous structure and polymorphism resulting from selenization. Furthermore, the as-constructed asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC): CoSe2@N–C//graphene aerogel (GA) displays a maximum energy density of 42.2 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 791.6 W kg−1 and long-term cycling life with capacitance retention of 94.4% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The results have shown a great potential for the CoSe2@N–C electrode in SC applications.
