A new printed circuit board (PCB) offers a plug-and-play solution by combining all of the circuitry required to accomplish these tasks for any size of supercapacitors. Each board measures only 0.6 x 1.6 in. and, when fully populated, can balance up to four with different combinations of MOSFETS to reach required voltages. The board can accommodate supercapacitors from 0.1 F to 3,000 F and beyond. The average additional power dissipation due to the use of the boards is zero, which makes this method of supercapacitor balancing very energy-efficient. The board has TO277 pads for adding external Schottky rectifiers (power diodes) to clamp current transients. An optional resistor can also be connected across each pair of supercapacitors. Normally, this is left open, but if those two supercapacitor locations are unpopulated, a zero-ohm jumper in the corresponding location should be installed. The leakage current balancing mechanism is fully automatic and works for supercapacitor arrays with different leakage current profiles. In a stack with many supercapacitors in series, multiple MOSFET arrays function to balance the various leakage currents.
