Flexible energy storage devices have attracted wide attention because of the increasing requirement of wearable electronics. However, comfortability, productivity, and feasibility, to name a few, are still far from satisfactory in the current wearable supercapacitors (SCs). This is largely due to the missing of an ideal low-cost flexible substrate/current collector that should not only exhibit high conductivity, but also be compatible with modern textile technologies. Herein, we apply the traditional gilding technique to cloth and successfully convert the cloth to be an excellent current collector which is available at a reasonable cost and compatible with textile technologies. Thanks to the strong electrostatic interaction, we found that a positively charged gold leaf could be laminated on a negatively charged polyester cloth intimately. This substrate could perfectly act as an integrated compact electrode after the electrodeposition of polypyrrole nanorods. The resulting electrode is mechanically strong enough to withstand the tortures of repeated bending, cutting, or puncturing, and is readily assembled into wearable SCs and energy cloth with outstanding practicability, for example, safety and breathability. It is foreseeable that our work will inspire a series design of wearable electronics based on the fascinating gilding art.
