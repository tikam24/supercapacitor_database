Mesoporous α-Fe2O3 nanowires have been prepared through solid-state thermal conversion of ferrous oxalate dihydrate precursor for supercapacitor application. The possible growth mechanism of the FeC2O4·2H2O nanowires was proposed based on a series of time-dependent experiments. The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the mesoporous α-Fe2O3 nanowires were calculated to be about 70.6 m2 g−1 and 2.5 nm, respectively. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the as-prepared mesoporous α-Fe2O3 nanowire electrode delivers a high specific capacitance up to 267.5 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and good cycle performance (87% capacitance retention under 2000 cycles). The excellent supercapacitor performance of the α-Fe2O3 nanowires can be ascribed mainly to the unique mesoporous structure with large specific surface area, which provide fast electron/ion transfer path as well as large reaction surface area.
