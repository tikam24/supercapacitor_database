Abstract: Lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LIHCs) are gaining more attention and applications because they break the performance limitations of supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, the difference of energy storage mechanism between anode and cathode is a problem that must be faced by Li-ion hybrid capacitors. The selection of suitable anode and cathode materials is one of the effective ways to solve this problem. Here, we synthesized hollow spherical perovskite fluoride NaNiF3 by a simple and safe method. The specific capacity of NaNiF3 is 142 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 A·g−1 for 1000 cycles. The mechanism in the cycling of NaNiF3 electrodes was investigated using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which is typical of the conversion reaction. Meanwhile, the NaNiF3//activated carbon (AC) Li-ion hybrid capacitor assembled and showed better energy density (69 Wh·kg−1) and power density (5699 W·kg−1). Its capacity retention after long cycling was 79%. The use of NaNiF3 expands the choice of electrode materials for LIHCs and extends their practical applications.
