As the second most abundant organic polymers in nature, lignin demonstrates advantages of low cost, high carbon content, plentiful functional groups. In recent years, lignin and its derivatives, as well as lignin-derived porous carbon have emerged as promising electrode materials for energy storage application. In this review, recent progress on the design and fabrication of lignin-based electrode materials for energy storage application is summarized. We begin with a brief summary of the separation process and basic chemistry of lignin. Then, the latest development on the fabrication of lignin-based electrodes for supercapacitors and batteries is elaborated separately. Finally, we propose the current challenges and future prospects of the lignin-based electrodes for advanced energy storage devices.
