Scientists at Stanford University have replaced the Li with Al to create the first Al-based battery that is fast-charging, long-lasting, and inexpensive. The Stanford team developed a unique cathode material to pair with the Al-metal anode, a three-dimensional graphitic foam, which enables fast anode diffusion and intercalation, and speeds battery charging. The aluminum-graphite battery has an energy density of about 40 Wh/kg, which is comparable to that of Pb-acid and Ni-metal halide batteries, and a high power density of â‰¥ 3,000 W/kg, which is similar to the power density of a conventional supercapacitor. The scientists constructed battery cells inside flexible pouches. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of Al at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloraluminate anions in the graphite.
