Energy storage system becomes one of key components in the medium voltage grid with the ever-increasing development of renewable energy resources. This paper proposes an improved modular multilevel converter(IMMC) where symmetrical super capacitor energy storage banks are interfaced to the three-terminal power unit through a Buck/Boost converter. Six typical operation modes are taken into account and the control algorithms such as state of charge(SOC) equalization and sub-module capacitor balance based on carrier phase shift sine pulse width modulation(CPS-SPWM) are developed. Finally., the analysis and control strategies are verified through the MATLAB/Simulink simulation results and down-scaled prototype experimental results.
