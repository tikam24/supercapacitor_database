This paper introduces a new angular position sensor that measures 3 mm (diameter) by 0.5 mm (thickness); and it is therefore a MEMS scale sensor. The sensor's operating principle is variable capacitance; however, unlike ordinary variable capacitance transducers, the new sensor is based on the concept of creating a variable Ultracapacitor (or Supercapacitor). One degree of rotation in the present sensor results in a capacitance variation of 1.5, which is very substantial by comparison with other types of variable capacitance transducers of the same dimensions. The sensitivity of this new sensor is therefore substantially high. It will be suitable for applications that require a MEMS-scale transducer and high sensitivity. [2021-0168]
