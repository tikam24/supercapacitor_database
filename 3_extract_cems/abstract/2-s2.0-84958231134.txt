Flower-like copper cobaltite (CuCo2O4) nanosheets anchored on graphite paper have been synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method followed by a postannealing treatment. Supercapacitor electrodes employing CuCo2O4 nanosheets exhibit an enhanced capacitance of 1131 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 compared with previously reported supercapacitor electrodes. The CuCo2O4 electrode delivers a specific capacitance of up to 409 F g-1 at a current density of as high as 50 A g-1, and a good long-term cycling stability, with 79.7% of its specific capacitance retained after 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1. Furthermore, the as-prepared CuCo2O4 nanosheets on graphite paper can be fabricated as electrodes and used as enzymeless glucose sensors, which exhibit good sensitivity (3.625 μA μM-1 cm-2) and an extraordinary linear response ranging up to 320 μM with a low detection limit (5 μM).
