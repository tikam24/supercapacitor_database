Super capacitor is an energy storing device which stores energy in the form of charge. Super capacitor is a step forward in the field of electrical energy storage devices. It is widely used in applications such as hybrid vehicles, renewable energy sources, defense, etc. Development of super capacitors has allowed electronics market to produce portable power devices that are easily chargeable and effectively durable. Current collectors, binders, adhesives and separators play important role in the making and the performance standards of super capacitors. Trials with various current collectors along with suitable binders have been tried by various researchers with its current carrying capacity, but there is a need to investigate further with respect to its electrode material holding capabilities. It is also required to investigate the need for adhesive in super capacitors for binder free electrodes of super capacitors. The work presented is related to experiments with binders, current collectors and adhesives used in super capacitors.
