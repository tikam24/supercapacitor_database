Herein, we report a nanoarchitectured nickel molybdate/carbon fibers@pre-treated Ni foam (NiMoO4/CF@PNF) electrode for supercapacitors. The synthesis of NiMoO4/CF@PNF mainly consists of a direct chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of dense carbon fibers (CFs) onto pre-treated Ni foam (PNF) as the substrate, followed by in situ growth of NiMoO4 nanosheets (NSs) on the CF@PNF substrate by means of a hydrothermal process. The NiMoO4/CF@PNF electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance (5.14Fcm-2 at 4mAcm-2) and excellent cycling stability (97% capacitance retention after 2000cycles at 10mAcm-2). Furthermore, we have successfully assembled NiMoO4 NSs//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitors, which can achieve an energy density of 45.6Whkg-1 at 674Wkg-1, and excellent stability with 93% capacitance retention after 2000cycles at 5mAcm-2. These superior properties hold great promise for energy-storage applications. Fibers and foam: The synthesis and analysis of a nanoarchitectured nickel molybdate/carbon fibers@pre-treated Ni foam (NiMoO4/CF@PNF) electrode is reported (see figure). The electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance and excellent cycling stability. These superior properties hold great promise for energy-storage applications.
