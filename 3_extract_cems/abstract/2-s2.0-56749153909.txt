Hydrous ruthenium oxide, which exhibits both protonic and electronic conduction, is incorporated in the cathode electrocatalyst layer of the membrane electrode assembly for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The supercapacitive behavior of ruthenium oxide helps realize a fuel cell-supercapacitor hybrid. Platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are deposited onto carbon-supported hydrous ruthenium oxide and the resulting electrocatalyst is subjected to both physical and electrochemical characterization. Powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy reflect the hydrous ruthenium oxide to be amorphous and well-dispersed onto the catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data confirm that the oxidation state of ruthenium in Pt anchored on carbon-supported hydrous ruthenium oxide is Ru4+. Electrochemical studies, namely cyclic voltammetry, cell polarization, intrinsic proton conductivity, and impedance measurements, suggest that the proton-conducting nature of hydrous ruthenium oxide helps extend the three-phase boundary in the catalyst layer, which facilitates improvement in performance of the PEFC. The aforesaid PEFC operating with hydrogen fuel and oxygen as oxidant shows a higher power density (0.62 W cm2 @ 0.6 V) in relation to the PEFC comprising carbon-supported Pt electrodes (0.4 W cm2 @ 0.6 V). Potential square-wave voltammetry study corroborates that the supercapacitive behavior of hydrous ruthenium oxide helps ameliorate the pulse-power output of the fuel cell.
