Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived nanoarchitectures have special features, such as high surface area (SA), abundant active sites, exclusive porous networks, and remarkable supercapacitive performance when compared to traditional nanoarchitectures. Herein, we propose a viable strategy for the synthesis of hollow manganese nickel selenide spheres comprising nanosheets supported on the nickel foam (denoted as MNSe@NF) from the MOF. The MNSe nanostructures can demonstrate enriched active sites, and shorten the ion-electron diffusion pathways. When the MNSe@NF electrode is used as a cathode electrode for a hybrid supercapacitor, the electrode reflected impressive supercapacitive properties with a high capacity of 325.6 mA h g−1(1172.16 C g−1) at 2 A g−1, an exceptional rate performance of 86.6% at 60 A g−1, and remarkable longevity (3.2% capacity decline after 15 000 cycles). Also, the assembled MNSe@NF∥AC@NF hybrid supercapacitors employing activated carbon on the nickel foam (AC@NF, anode electrode) and MNSe@NF (cathode electrode) revealed an impressive energy density of 66.1 W h kg−1at 858.45 W kg−1and an excellent durability of 94.1% after 15 000 cycles.
