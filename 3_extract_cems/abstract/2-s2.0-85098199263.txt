The proceedings contain 46 papers. The topics discussed include: hardware in the loop verification of a fast backup protection scheme for embedded MVDC links within distribution networks; a soft-starting method for dual active bridge converters; method of determining operation voltage of dispersed photovoltaic generator; a verification on a zero-current detection method of interleaved boost chopper with high frequency operation; autonomous dc microgrid consisting of triple active bridge converters; grid flexibility dispatch by integrated control of distributed energy resources; power electronics for a LVDC-microgrid with local PV production and electrolytic converter; a local voting protocol based cooperative DC community microgrids; and supercapacitor assisted data center power architecture for 380 V DC-microgrid.
