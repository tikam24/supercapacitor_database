MnO2 nanoparticle was produced using liquid coprecipitation method, nanorod and nanowire were produced using hydrothermal method and annealing. Scanning Electron Microscope(SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS) were used to examine the morphology and the elements of samples. The diameter of particle, rod and wire are about 300nm, 200-300nm and 50-70nm. The electrochemical characteristics were tested using galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. The results demonstrat that the prepared MnO2 have a good pseudocapacitance behavior and power characteristic. The specific capacitor (SC) is up to 260.09F/g.
