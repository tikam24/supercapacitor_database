Co2O3/graphene composite was prepared by hydrothermal method. Co2O3 was prepared by chemical method from CoCl3Â·(H2O)6. The structure was characterized by XRD, Raman and SEM. The results show that the prepared samples have complete crystallization and can reflect the XRD characteristic peaks of corresponding phases, and the Raman pattern of the samples not only reflects the characteristic peaks of Co2O3, but also shows excellent characteristics at the 2D peaks which can reflect the good separation of graphene monolayer structure. Microstructure observation of the samples showed that Co2O3 was rod-shaped and short columnar embedded or flat on graphene substrates. The electrochemical tests show that the composite has excellent electrochemical properties and the mass specific capacitance reaches 240 F/g at the scanning rate of 50 mV/s.
