The article is devoted to the development and research of a supercapacitor based on an aqueous electrolyte. The review of the current state in the field of energy storage is carried out. The processes occurring in the supercapacitor are considered. Sheets of paper with different carbon concentrations have been created. The design of the housing has been developed with the possibility of replacing the plates and electrolyte. This is an advantage in the process of conducting experiments. According to the results of the study, a prototype supercapacitor based on NaCl electrolyte with a capacity of 9F and a maximum output voltage of 1.2 V is presented.
