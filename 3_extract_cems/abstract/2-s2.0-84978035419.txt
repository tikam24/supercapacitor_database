Nanohole graphene oxide (NHGO) was obtained in a homogeneous aqueous mixture of graphene oxide (GO) and H2O2 at 120 °C. Supercapacitors were fabricated as the electrode material by using NHGO. A specific capacitance of 240.1 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 m KOH electrolyte and specific capacitance remained 193.6 F g−1 at the current density of 20 A g−1. This was attributed to reducing the inner space between the double-layers, enhanced ion diffusion and large specific surface area. Supercapacitor prepared with NHGO electrodes also exhibited an excellent cycle stability.
