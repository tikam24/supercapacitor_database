Rational design of electrode materials is an important means to improve the performance of supercapacitors. In this paper, CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite is prepared by hydrothermal treatment and sintering treatment using ZIF-67 as a self-supporting template. The CoMoO4@Co3O4 electrode shows an excellent specific capacity of 2003 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and the capacity retention after 5000 cycles can reach 68% at a current density of 10 A g−1. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor composed of CoMoO4@Co3O4 composite and activated carbon (AC) shows an energy density of 56 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1 and the capacity retention of 80% after 15,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the use of ZIF-67 as a self-supporting template to suppress the volume expansion and fragmentation of the CoMoO4@Co3O4 electrode during charge and discharge.
