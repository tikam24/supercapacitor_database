Redox methods represented by Hummers’ method are the most frequently-used pathways to prepare graphene, but to date still very low-efficient, because of its time-consuming washing and hard reduction process. Here we report an intermittent microwave-exfoliated non-expansive graphite oxide (GtO) process to prepare a wrinkled graphene with a high reduction degree (C/O: 19.0), a high defect degree, and a high specific surface area (1333.7 m2 g−1). Findings show that the non-expansive GtO without water washing indicates an almost 100% exfoliated success rate during this intermittent microwave process. The obtained graphene shows easy dispersity in organic solvents, and excellent supercapacitor performance in specific capacitance, rate capacity, and especially in cycling lifetime with no decay after 80,000 cycles at 30 A g−1. Consequently, this special microwave process successfully solves the problems of tedious washing and hard reduction in redox methods, thus exponentially boosting the efficiency of preparing graphene.
