This research reports on the effect of fabric structure, fiber shape and size, and polymer type on loading efficiency and electrical resistance of binder-free CNT coatings. COOH-functionalized CNT dispersions were applied onto nonwoven fabrics via multiple cycles of immersion coating. Among a variety of polyamide (PA6) fabrics, CNT uptake was highest for those with an open web structure. Among those with an open structure, fiber size showed an inverse relationship with CNT loading. Various polymer types were examined. CNT showed excellent adhesion with PA6, polyester (PET) and cotton fibers, and low resistance levels of ~ 50 ohms could be reached after two cycles. Among these, cellulose fibers resulted in the highest uptake, possibly due to surface area and functionality. Supercapacitor electrodes were also fabricated and tested. Double layer capacitance of CNT was shown to be independent of polymer type (~50 F g-1 on the basis of CNT mass). Pseudocapacitive MnO2 was electrodeposited onto CNT-coated PET fibers, resulting in a higher specific capacitance (~400 F g-1 on the basis of MnO2 mass).
