Four kinds of high specific surface area micropore activated carbons (ACs) for supercapacitor were prepared by traditional methods. BET, cyclic voltammogram and galvanostatic charge/discharge were used to analyse the pore structure and capacitance performance of the ACs. The results show that the ACs have a maximal specific surface area of 2496 m2/g and a high rate of micropore with wide diameter. At a current density of 5 mA/cm2, a specific capacitance of 307 F/g is reached. The power property of the ACs was excellent. The specific capacitance of the ACs were mainly contributed by the specific surface area of the micropore. Contribution of mesopore to the specific capacitance is very little. The main performance of mesopore is to improve the power property. In order to achieve both high specific capacitance and high power density, AC for supercapacitor should has as much as micropore with wide diameter and appropriate amount of mesopore with narrow diameter.
