The traditional workover rigs have some obvious drawbacks of operating system, including low efficiency, serious noise pollution and emissions. Therefore, an electric workover rig power compensation system (PCS) is proposed to solve these problems, and supercapacitors energy storage is used to resolve the power limitation of wellsites transformer. A controlled charging method for supercapacitors is used in PCS to achieve fast charging and meet operation time requirements. The voltage and current of PCS is monitored by the control unit (CU) in real time. A power compensation control strategy is developed to realize the steady power output of PCS, and the operation states of PCS are divided into standby, charging, energy supply mode and failure mode. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed PCS.
