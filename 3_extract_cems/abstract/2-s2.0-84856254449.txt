Supercapacitor charge storage media were fabricated using the semiconducting polymer poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) that were helically wrapped with ionic, conjugated poly[2,6-{1,5-bis(3-propoxysulfonicacidsodiumsalt)}naphthylene] ethynylene (PNES). These PNES-wrapped SWNTs (PNES-SWNTs) enable efficient dispersion of individualized nanotubes in a wide range of organic solvents. PNES-SWNT film-modified Pt electrodes were prepared by drop casting PNES-SWNT suspensions in MeOH; high stability, first-generation PProDOT/PNES/SWNT composites were realized via electropolymerization of the ProDOT parent monomer (3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) in a 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide/propylene carbonate solution at the PNES-SWNT-modified electrode. The electrochemical properties of PProDOT and PProDOT/PNES/SWNT single electrodes and devices were examined using cyclic voltammetric methods. The hybrid composites were found to enhance key supercapacitor figures of merit (charge capacity and capacitance) by approximately a factor of 2 relative to those determined for benchmark Type I devices that exploited a classic PProDOT-based electrode material. The charge/discharge stability of the supercapacitors was probed by repeated rounds of cyclic voltammetric evaluation at a minimum depth of discharge of 73%; these experiments demonstrated that the hybrid PProDOT/PNES/SWNT composites retained ∼90% of their initial charge capacity after 21-000 charge/discharge cycles, contrasting analogous data obtained for PProDOT-based devices, which showed only 84% retention of their initial charge capacity. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
