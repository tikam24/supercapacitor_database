A series of uniform composite networks consisting of CuO nanosheets (NSs)/single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were fabricated through a facile and green method with the aid of electrostatic interaction in aqueous solution. The capacitance was investigated by using various electrochemical methods including cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant-current galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The CuO NSs/SWCNT networks show better specific capacitance (137.6 F g-1) by CV at a scan rate of 2 mV/s compared to 71.0 F g-1 of CuO NSs, and 25.3 F g-1 of SWCNT. The CuO NSs/SWCNT electrodes exhibit good cycling stability with effective specific capacitance of 59.3 F g-1 after 1000 cycles in a 6 M KOH aqueous solution at a current density of 5 A g-1, which is over two times as 25.1 F g-1 of CuO NSs electrodes. CuO nanowires/SWCNT interpenetrating networks were also successfully prepared, demonstrating a significant improvement of specific capacitance as well as cycling stability. It is obvious that the homogenous dispersion of SWCNT in CuO NSs solution remarkably improves their electrochemical performance. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
