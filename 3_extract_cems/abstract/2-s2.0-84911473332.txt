Hybrid electrodes of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) and manganese oxide (MnO2) were synthesized using a fast surface redox reaction of potassium permanganate under facile immersion methods. The HPC/MnO2 hybrids had a number of micropores and macropores and the MnO2 nanoparticles acted as a pseudocapacitive material. The synergistic effects of electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC)-induced capacitance and pseudocapacitance brought about a better electrochemical performance of the HPC/MnO2 hybrid electrodes compared to that obtained with a single component. The hybrids showed a specific capacitance of 228 F g1 and good cycle stability over 1000 cycles.
