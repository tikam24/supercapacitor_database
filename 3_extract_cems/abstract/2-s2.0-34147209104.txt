Manganese oxide/carbon powders have been prepared by reduction of acidic KMnO4 by carbon. The influence of the type of carbon [active carbon (AC), meso-carbon microbeads (MCMB), and flexible graphite (FG)] as well as the presence of Ni2+, Co2+ or Er2+/Er3+ ions on the structure and electrochemical properties of the resulting manganese oxide/carbon powders was investigated. The structure and surface morphology of the manganese oxide/carbon powders were examined by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. It was shown that AC has a higher reducing power than either FG or MCMB. Results of CV experiments showed that the manganese oxide/carbon powders possess excellent capacitive properties, with the specific capacitance measured by cyclic voltammograms reaching a maximum of 117 F/g before doping. After doping with Ni2+ and Co2+ ions, the specific capacitance showed an increased value of 185 F/g.
