The present work reports the use and application of a novel protic ionic liquid (triethylammonium bis(tri fluoromethylsulfonyl)imide; NEt3H TFSI) as an electrolyte for symmetric planar micro-supercapacitors based on silicon nanowire electrodes. The excellent performance of the device has been successfully demonstrated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical characterization of this system exhibits a wide operative voltage of 4 V as well as an outstanding long cycling stability after millions of galvanostatic cycles at a high current density of 2 mA cm-2. In addition, the electrochemical double layer micro-supercapacitor was able to deliver a high power density of 4 mWcm-2 in a very short time pulses (a few ms). Our results could be of interest to develop prospective on-chip micro-supercapacitors using protic ionic liquids as electrolytes with high performance in terms of power and energy densities.
