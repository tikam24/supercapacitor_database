Multilayer films of polyaniline (PANI) and graphene oxide (GO) were deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode for supercapacitor application. The graphene oxide was synthesized using chemical method. The X-ray diffraction study confirms the formation of graphene oxide. The supercapacitive behavior of the PANI and PANI-GO electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques in 1 M H2SO4 solution. The electrochemical analysis confirms that the multilayer film has improved specific capacitance compared to pure polyaniline film. The specific capacitance of 201 F/g and 429 F/g was achieved for PANI and PANI-GO multilayer electrode. High electrochemical performance of the PANI-GO electrode could be due to increasing active sites for the deposition of polyaniline provided by large surface areas of graphene oxide sheets and the synergistic effect between polyaniline and graphene oxide. These results demonstrated the importance and great potential of graphene oxide in the development of high-performance energy-storage system based on polyaniline.
