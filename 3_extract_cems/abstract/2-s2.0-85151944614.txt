This paper considers fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) including a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell as the main energy source, and lithium-ion battery and ultra-capacitor as energy storage systems to support the fuel cell. The two important objectives are to share the current demand of the traction motor among the energy sources and maintain the stability of the DC-bus voltage. The current sharing is based on an energy management scheme. A passivity-based control (PBC) approach is proposed to achieve current tracking based on the energy management and regulate the DC-bus voltage. The PBC is a nonlinear control approach that guarantees the stability of a closed-loop system by making it passive. The feasibility of the proposed control method is evaluated in MATLAB/Simulink.
