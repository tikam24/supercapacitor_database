Manganese silicate/graphene oxide (MnSiO3/GO) composite was successfully synthesized using GO, manganese chloride and sodium silicate through a facile precipitation method. The results show MnSiO3 nanoparticles are closely dispersed on GO sheets, suggesting the formation of a united composite. This composite exhibits a large specific surface area of 161 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 0.8728 cm3 g-1. MnSiO3/GO composite displays high electrical conductivity and fast ion and electron transport, which can improve the electrochemical performance of MnSiO3. To be specific, MnSiO3/GO composite delivers the specific capacitance as high as 262.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is higher than that of MnSiO3 (168.8 F g−1) and GO (4.6 F g−1). This finding proves that MnSiO3/GO composite can be considered as a promising candidate material applied to high-performance energy storage device.
