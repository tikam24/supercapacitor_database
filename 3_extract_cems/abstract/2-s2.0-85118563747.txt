This work presents an active thermal management system (TMS) for building a safer module of lithium-ion capacitor (LiC) technology, in which 10 LiCs are connected in series. The proposed TMS is a forced air-cooled TMS (ACTMS) that uses four axial DC 12 V fans: two fans are responsible for blowing the air from the environment into the container while two other fans suck the air from the container to the environment. An experimental investigation is conducted to study the thermal behavior of the module, and numerical simulations are carried out to be validated against the experiments. The main aim of the model development is the optimization of the proposed design. Therefore, the ACTMS has been optimized by investigating the impact of inlet air velocity, inlet and outlet positions, module rotation by 90â—¦ towards the airflow direction, gap spacing between neighboring cells, and uneven gap spacing between neighboring cells. The 3D thermal model is accurate, so the validation error between the simulation and experimental results is less than 1%. It is proven that the ACTMS is an excellent solution to keep the temperature of the LiC module in the desired range by air inlet velocity of 3 m/s when all the fans are blowing the air from both sides, the outlet is designed on top of the module, the module is rotated, and uneven gap space between neighboring cells is set to 2 mm for the first distance between the cells (d1) and 3 mm for the second distance (d2).
