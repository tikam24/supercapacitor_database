Increasing energy demands and rapid depletion of fossil fuels has led the scientifi c community to shift their attention towards the development of renewable energy conversion and appropriate storage devices. Supercapacitors are promising energy storage devices with several attracting characteristics such as high power density, excellent reversibility and high cycling stability. In the construction of supercapacitors, graphene-based conducting polymers nanocomposites have been identifi ed as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. Among all the conducting polymers, polypyrrole-based graphene nanocomposite is a popular choice due to its attractive features such as, strong electrical properties, ease of preparation, lowcost, environmental stability and large scale processability. Th is chapter focuses on the preparation and fabrication of graphene-polypyrrole nanocomposite and their performance in the supercapacitor application.
