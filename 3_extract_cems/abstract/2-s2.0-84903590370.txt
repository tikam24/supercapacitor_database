Nitrogen-doped porous carbon is prepared by carbonizing polyaspartic acid under inertia atmosphere without template and activation. The powder X-ray diffraction, element analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and N2 adsorption-desorption tests show that the morphologies and structures of the nitrogen-doped carbon samples deeply depend on carbonization temperature. Electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance of the PASP700 sample obtained at 700 °C is 166.1 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and after 5000 charge/discharge cycles it still remains 97% which exhibits an excellent cycling stability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
