We have explored electrochemically deposited pervoskite nanocrystalline porous bismuth iron oxide (BiFeO3) thin film electrode from alkaline bath for electrochemical supercapacitors. The pervoskite BiFeO3 nanocrystalline thin film electrode showed comparable specific capacitance of 81 F g-1 and electrochemical supercapacitive performance and stability in an aqueous NaOH electrolyte to that of commonly used ruthenium based pervoskites.
