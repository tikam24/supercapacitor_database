A facile, rapid one-pot microwave heating technique in solid state is introduced to prepare crystalline Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanoparticles without any post-reaction. The microwave irradiation was operated with a power of 900 W for 20 min. Structure and morphology of the product were characterized using XRD, Raman, SEM, EDS, TEM and SAED analyses. The XRD, Raman and EDS analyses showed the formation of a pure kesterite phase of CZTS. SEM and TEM images revealed uniform particulate morphology with an average particle size of 38 nm and a single-phased crystalline SAED pattern. The electrochemical measurements of the as-synthesized product revealed a good nature of energy storage with a specific capacitance of 185 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. Such multi-components materials can offer as an inexpensive and nontoxic candidate for mass production of supercapacitor and energy storage systems.
