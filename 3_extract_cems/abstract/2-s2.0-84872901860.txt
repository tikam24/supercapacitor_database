Design of a contactless power transfer system with supercapacitor based primary energy storage for electric vehicle application is described in this paper. The contactless power transfer system which uses inductively coupled coils to transfer power over a large air gap has been developed. Compensation topologies and the operational frequency of power transfer system have been studied in order to obtain maximum efficiency and high power transfer capability. An experimental setup is built using the design considerations so derived and design parameters for such a system is laid out. Finally, a microcontroller charge control mechanism is implemented to operate the system in a safe region and avoid over charging of supercapacitors. Â© 2012 IEEE.
