With the wide popularization of 5 G network, the application of miniaturized electronic equipment is being gradually developed, but limited by energy storage technology. Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have become the possible direction to solve this problem because of their unique properties. Graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes are very suitable materials for preparing MSCs. However, graphene oxide will overlap due to van der Waals force, and carbon nanotubes will be entangled. In order to solve these problems, reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotube composite films were prepared by liquid-air interface self-assembly and hydroiodic acid reduction. Planar MSCs with weight ratios of 5:1, 10:1 and 15:1 were prepared by photolithography, and the MSCs of 15:1 show the best comprehensive performance with the area capacitance of 0.905 μF cm−2, the energy density of 0.125 nWh cm−2, the power density of 2263.31 nW cm−2, the time constant of 38 ms, and the capacitance retention of 91.2%.
