This paper proposes a integrated starter and generator(ISG) braking control method considering battery condition. Recently, hybrid brake which combines mechanical brake and electric brake causes from ISG regenerative operation has been researched in automotive application for efficient and fast braking operation. However, previous works for hybrid brake are focus on braking performance improvement, this can deteriorate the current flowing through battery, it can cause reducing the battery life time. In order to improve this, another previous works use DC/DC converter and ultracapacitor to regulate the battery current. However, it increases cost and size. This paper firstly analyze the DC-link current ripple of inverter drive. After that, analyze the affection of this current ripple during in constant current (CC) and constant voltage control (CV) operation. Finally, a novel regenerative torque control method of ISG considering battery condition will be illustrated. Proposed control method is verified by experimental results.
