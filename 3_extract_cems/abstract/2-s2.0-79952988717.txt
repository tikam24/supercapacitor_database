The tasks of harvesting, transmitting, and storing the energy required to meet global demands are some of the most pressing needs we will face in the near future. Scientists are seeking new technologies to generate renewable and clean energy resources. Nanofiberous materials with high surface areas and porosities have attracted significant attention in recent years and are considered to be promising candidates to address these critical issues. Nanofibers can be produced by many techniques. Of these, electrospinning is a particularly low cost and versatile method. This paper highlights research into the use of electrospinning to create materials suited for four major energy-related applications: (1) fuel cells, (2) dye-sensitized solar cells, (3) Li-ion batteries, and (4) supercapacitors. In addition, electrospun nanofibers used in other areas, such as thermoelectrical and piezoelectric materials, are also discussed. Specific attention is given to the material properties that have been achieved through electrospinning and what limitations of existing processes offer opportunities for future research.
