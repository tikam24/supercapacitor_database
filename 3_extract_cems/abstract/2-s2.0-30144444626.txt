This paper presents a test of a 500 W polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell connected with a power electronic converter. The aim of this device is to develop fuel cell dynamic models and to study converter structure and control to adapt fuel cell to an electrical power train. The design of the converter is first discussed before presenting different experimental results involving thermodynamic and mechanical phenomena of the PEM fuel cell. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.
