This study describes the use of electrodeposited nanostructured hybrid nickel-cobalt hexacyanoferrate in electrochemical supercapacitors. Herein, various compositions of nickel and cobalt hexacyanoferrates (Ni/CoHCNFe) nanostructures are electrodeposited on an inexpensive stainless steel substrate using cyclic voltammetric (CV) method. The morphology of the electrodeposited nanostructures is studied using scanning electron microscopy, while their electrochemical characterizations are investigated using CV, galvanostatic charge and discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the nanostructures of hybrid metal cyanoferrate, shows a much higher capacitance (765 F g-1) than those obtained with just nickel hexacyanoferrate (379 F g-1) or cobalt hexacyanoferrate (277 F g -1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirm the favorable capacitive behavior of the electrodeposited materials. The columbic efficiency is approximately 95% based on the charge and discharge experiments. Long cycle-life and excellent stability of the nanostructured materials are also demonstrated during 1000 cycles. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
