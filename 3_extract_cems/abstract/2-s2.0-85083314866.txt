Cellular bilayer and its membrane have been mimicked and for decades, e.g., to synthesize amphiphilic carriers for controlled release. Here we report using nanosized cellular microtubules (MT) as scaffolding template and amphiphilic cytomembrane fragment to self-assemble with hydrophobic carbon nanotubes (MWNT). The hybrid was then cross-linked to form a conductive scaffold. Polyaniline (PANI) was finally added to the nanocomposite to enhance conductivity. Being an electrode, the obtained cell-based conductive gel raise interfacial surface area, increase the conductivity of the material, and enhance the energy density and power density of the material with a relatively low MWNTs concentration (less than 4.8 wt%). The cell-based supercapacitor reaches a specific capacitance of 209.2 F/g and thus the fabricated cell-based electrode achieves a conductivity of 38Scmâˆ’1. The cellular electric device exhibits great potential for future implantable bio-device and bio-electronic interface applications.
