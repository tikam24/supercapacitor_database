The disadvantages resulting from changes in energy production of photovoltaic generation plants, justify the search for power injection systems capable of damping them. In this project, an injection system capable of storing energy necessary to moderate the fluctuations in the generated power is presented. We explore the performance and control of the energy storage system built with supercapacitors, which are charged and discharged through a bidirectional DC-DC converter connected between the photovoltaic cells and the inverter.
