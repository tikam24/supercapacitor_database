In this study, a facile hydrothermal method was employed to fabricate polyaniline (PANI)/rGO/NiPbTiO3 nanocomposites for electrode material to enhance the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors. The synthesized composites were analyzed with Field Emission Scanning Electron (FE-SEM) Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometry (XPS) which confirmed the required structure and composition of composites. A highest value of capacitance 1180 F g−1 was achieved at 0.5 A g−1 owing to the synergistic effects. Moreover, our PANI/rGO/NiPbTiO3 nanocomposites showed high operation stability with ~91% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles with a maximum specific energy of 40 Wh kg−1. Consequently, this study demonstrated a reliable synthesis approach to prepare nanocomposite materials that can be employed as promising electrodes for superior energy storage.
