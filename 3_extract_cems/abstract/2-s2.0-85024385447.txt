The nonlinear loads create a wide range of current harmonics in the system. Such loads can make distortions on the output voltage profile, influence on the fuel cell (FC) performance, and endanger safe operation of the FC unit. In this paper, new strategies for power-following and AC voltage control have been developed. The proposed system consists of the ultracapacitor (UC) bank and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) supplying nonlinear AC loads. The power tracking strategy is based on the Fourier analysis of total load demand. The Fourier analysis is used as an effective tool to eliminate destructive effect of current harmonics on the PEMFC output current. To supply the nonlinear AC loads under sinusoidal voltage with the fast response, a dynamic model for the inverter control loop is also presented. This model is used to enhance the input reference tracking and reject input/output disturbances. The simulation outcomes confirm the desirable PEMFC performance against nonlinear load disturbances. In addition, the output AC voltage is kept sinusoidal and has low deviations under nonlinear load variations.
