This paper analyses the impact of non-idealities on the performance of an ultracapacitor based bidirectional DC/DC converter. In particular, this work analyses the impact of ON state resistance of the MOSFET switches on the performance of bidirectional DC/DC converter. It is shown that, under particular operating conditions, the ON state resistance of the MOSFET can have a significant impact on the performance of th DC/DC converter and can cause an unstable response. An analytical expression is derived to identify the operating conditions under which the non-idealities can have a significant impact on the performance of the DC/DC converter. Simulation results are presented to aid the analysis reported in this paper.
