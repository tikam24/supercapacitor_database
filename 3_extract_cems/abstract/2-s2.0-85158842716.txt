An attempt has been made here to develop a novel 3D-like shape Cu4SnS6 flower with the support of MWCNT composite that can be used as an electrocatalyst for asymmetric supercapacitor, reduction of tri-iodide to iodide (I3−/I−) in DSSCs and overall water-splitting applications. Electrochemical findings show that Cu4SnS6/MWCNT electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performance, evidencing a high specific capacitance (755 F g−1 at 2 A g−1), outstanding rate capability and cycling stability (89% after 2000 cycles at 15 A g−1). The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor i.e., Cu4SnS6/MWCNT//MWCNT displays an outstanding energy density of 87.81 W h kg−1 at an ultra-high-power density of 3600 W kg−1. It is found to be an effective electrocatalyst for the reduction of I3−/I− in DSSCs, notably the efficiency reached is 6.05% which is comparable to the typical Pt. In addition, the optimized Cu4SnS6/MWCNT catalyst demonstrates better oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, low overpotential, and high electrochemical stability. The results show that the Cu4SnS6/MWCNT hybrid is an efficient tetrafunctional electrocatalyst for future energy storage/generation/conversion devices.
