Uniform NiS2 hollow nanoprisms have been controllably synthesized by a facial sacrificial template method including two-step refluxed reactions. The morphology of the hollow NiS2 prisms can be easily tailored by the low cost nickel complex template. With unique hollow structure, efficient electron, and ion transport pathway as well as single crystal structure, the NiS2 hollow prisms electrode exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive performance in LiOH electrolyte. It can deliver a specific capacitance of 1725 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1 and 1193 F g-1 even at a current density of 40 A g-1. Furthermore, the materials also present an amazing cycling stability, that is, the specific capacitance can increase from 1367 F g-1 to 1680 F g-1 after 10 000 cycles of charge-discharge at the current density of 20 A g-1.
