Micro-grid consisting of Photovoltaic (PV) arrays, Wind Turbine Generator (WTG), Fuel Cell, Supercapacitor and Electrolyzer (EL) serving a village load is modeled and implemented in Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS). Operating scenarios under fluctuating load conditions using an appropriate control strategy are simulated and analyzed. The advantages of using RTDS for micro-grid studies are presented. Â© 2009 IEEE.
