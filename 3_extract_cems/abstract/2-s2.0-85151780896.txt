Here we present an electrochemically efficient, perovskite series with general formula, La1-xNdxNiO3 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15) for use as electrode material in supercapacitors, prepared using cost effective sol–gel auto-combustion method. X-ray diffraction confirmed the phase development and crystal structure parameters of synthesized samples were determined. Well-defined and uniformly distributed nano-spheres, nano-rods, and nano-size particles were observed using field emission scanning electrode microscopy. The at.% and wt% of the elements in the samples were verified to exist in accordance with their stoichiometric ratios. A detailed electrochemical performance of the novel composite samples was determined using cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical analysis signified that La0.85Nd0.15NiO3 has surpassed all other composite samples depicting the highest specific capacitance of 64.381 F/g at a lower scan rate of 0.01 Vs−1 through cyclic voltammetry. At the same time, galvanic/discharge, the power density and energy density values came out to be 846.56 W/kg and 20.92 Wh/kg, respectively. This detailed study validates that the composites' pseudo-capacitive nature tends to enlarge their horizon in supercapacitor-based applications.
