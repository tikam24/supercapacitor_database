We report a simple and scalable strategy to synthesize mesoporous NiO with nickel oxide nanoparticles of 3-6 nm crystalline walls and 4-5 nm pore diameter with the assistance of MoO42- as templating agent at room temperature. The product has a moderately high surface area of 294 m2 g-1 and a high specific capacitance of 2418 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, which indicates its promising potential as supercapacitor. Mesoporous NiO was synthesized at room temperature. Nickel oxide nanoparticles having 3-6 nm crystalline walls and pores of diameter 4-5 nm were prepared with the assistance of MoO42- as templating agent. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
