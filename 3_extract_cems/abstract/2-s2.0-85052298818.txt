Nowadays, wind energy conversion systems (WECSs) are widely employed in stand-alone systems for providing power to isolated loads, as well as in distributed generation systems, microgrids, and smart grids. In all of these applications, appropriate energy management processes must be performed for maximizing the energy produced by the wind turbines and transfer the generated energy to the consumer with high efficiency and required power quality. In this chapter, an overview of modern energy management techniques for WECS is presented, in terms of both the hardware architecture employed and the control methods that are applied.
