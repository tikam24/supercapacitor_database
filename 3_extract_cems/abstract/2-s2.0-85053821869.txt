Corn silk is a waste material obtained from corn that contains carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. Interestingly, corn-silk-derived carbon (CSC) after activation is found to possess larger specific surface area (2550 m2 g-1) and appreciable pore volume (0.95 cm3 g-1). In the present investigation, CSC electrodes are used to fabricate symmetric coin and pouch cells individually and investigated for electrochemical performance in half and full cell assembly systematically. Half-cell performance of CSC exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 256 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1. The subsequently assembled symmetric coin type sodium-ion capacitor (SIC) delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 126 F g-1 at 0.3 A g-1, and the pouch cell delivers 135 F g-1 at the same current density. Symmetric capacitors are found to withstand high current densities up to ∼3 A g-1 with nominal capacitance values, thus qualifying the suitability of CSC for SIC applications. A maximum specific energy of ∼109 Wh kg-1 and a specific power of ∼12.16 kW kg-1 have been realized from the symmetric SICs. Feasibility of the fabricated devices for practical application has been demonstrated by glowing LEDs and by running a clock for 25 min.
