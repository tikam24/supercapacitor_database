A facile chemical precipitation method is used to prepare both lanthanum hydroxide [La(OH)3] and neodymium hydroxide [Nd(OH)3] nanopowders in an ambient temperature without the addition of any surfactants. Both rare-earth hydroxides nanopowders are characterized by X-ray diffraction and FE-SEM analysis. The supercapacitor performances of La(OH)3 and Nd(OH)3 electrodes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical AC-impedance and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. It revealed that Nd(OH)3 electrode possesses a high specific capacitance (Csp) than La(OH)3 electrode. Hence, an asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated and denoted as Nd(OH)3||AC in 6 M KOH as the electrolyte soaked in the electrospun poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane as the separator, which exhibited an energy density of 18.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 796 W kg−1.
