2D MXene-based nanomaterials have attracted tremendous attention because of their unique physical/chemical properties and wide range of applications in energy storage, catalysis, electronics, optoelectronics, and photonics. However, MXenes and their derivatives have many inherent limitations in terms of energy storage applications. In order to further improve their performance for practical application, the nanoengineering of these 2D materials is extensively investigated. In this Review, the latest research and progress on 2D MXene-based nanostructures is introduced and discussed, focusing on their preparation methods, properties, and applications for energy storage such as lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, lithiumâ€“sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors. Finally, the critical challenges and perspectives required to be addressed for the future development of these 2D MXene-based materials for energy storage applications are presented.
