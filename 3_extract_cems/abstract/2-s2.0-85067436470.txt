In this study, ionic liquids (IL) containing carboxyl and different alkyl chains were fabricated and used to dope polyaniline (PANI). The results revealed that IL@PANI composites could be facilely obtained via template-free polymerization of aniline using ammonium persulfate as the oxidant. The as-prepared IL@PANI composites were measured by FT-IR, XPS, and SEM. Electrochemical performances of IL@PANI nanocomposites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results indicate that the alkyl chains of ILs have an important influence on the morphology and capacitance performance of IL@PANI electrode materials. With the shorter alkyl group in ILs, IL@PANI materials presented higher specific capacitance. Especially, 1-vinyl-3-carboxymethyl-imidazolium chloride ([VCMIm]Cl)@PANI composite presented the highest specific capacitance. Cycling performance measurement demonstrated that 82% capacitance retention could be achieved after 1000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. Therefore, our strategy provides a new technique for PANI nanocomposites with tunable morphology and high performance.
