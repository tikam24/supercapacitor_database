Non-aqueous gel electrolytes based on an alginate (Alg) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolim tetrafluoroborate (EMImBF4) were prepared for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs). The transparent colorless gel sheet has high mechanical intensity and high retentivity of ionic liquids enough to construct EDLC cells. According to charge/discharge measurements, the model EDLC cell with an Alg/EMImBF4 gel shows high discharge capacitance in spite of using a gel-state electrolyte, implying that high affinity of alginate for an activated carbon electrode leads to a decrease in the electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance. A test cell with Alg(3%)/EMImBF4 maintains its coulombic efficiency over 99.8 % during 4,000 cycles. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
