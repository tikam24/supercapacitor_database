A novel method to fabricate graphene paper with folded structured graphene sheets is described. When used as an electrode for LIBs and supercapacitors, the as-prepared graphene paper can show much higher performances compared to conventional graphene paper fabricated by a flow-directed assembly method. The unique graphene paper obtained here is promising to act as a new kind of flexible electrode for wearable or rolling-up devices. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
