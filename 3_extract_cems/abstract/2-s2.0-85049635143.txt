An effective synthesized method of Fe2O3/CNTs composite was reported using Fenton's reagent method under the microwave irradiation. Fe2O3 nanoparticles were uniformly anchored on the surface of CNTs forming the Fe2O3/CNTs shell-core hierarchy architecture. Consequently, the Fe2O3/CNTs hybrid electrode displayed an excellent electrochemical performance in the symmetric supercapacitor. A high capacitance of about 204 F/g was obtained at current density of 0.5 A/g, and the Fe2O3/CNTs electrode exhibited high energy density of 28.3 Wh/kg at power density of 1 kW/kg. The excellent electrochemical performance of Fe2O3/CNTs composite is regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
