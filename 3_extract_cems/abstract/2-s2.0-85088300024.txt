In this study, we have prepared MnO2 microfiber using Rotary-Jet Spin (RJ-Spin) to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes. The viscous suspension of MnO2-polyvinyl alcohol (MnO2-PVA) is allowed through small holes of a rotating head under the action of centrifugal force to form metal oxide fiber. Because of good interconnection between the individual redox active sites, the microfiber offers high specific capacitance of 663 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 with excellent long-term cyclic stability. A two electrode asymmetric device is fabricated which demonstrates maximum specific capacitance of 135.6 F g−1 with a maximum power density of 3.2 kW kg−1 and maximum energy density of 56.7 Wh kg−1.
