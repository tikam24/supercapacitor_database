Supercapacitors are considered to be the most promising power source to meet the pressing requirements of energy storage. Supercapacitive electrode materials, which are closely related to the high-efficiency energy storage, have provoked more interest. Herein, we present a high-capacity supercapacitor material based on the nitrogen-doped micro-mesoporous carbon material, which is synthesized by employing urea-formaldehyde resin as carbon and nitrogen sources, zinc chloride as a porogen and SBA-15 as a hard template. With high surface area, abundant porosity and nitrogen-doped, the composite material exhibits a reversible specific capacitance of 226.3 F g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A g-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and maintains a better high-class capacitance retention capability. These results show that nitrogen-doped micro-mesoporous carbon material represents a promising alternative to efficient electrode material for supercapacitors.
