We have successfully fabricated and tested the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes consisting of Ni(OH)2 nanosheets coated on NiCo2O4 nanosheets grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) current collectors. When the NiCo2O4 nanosheets are replaced by Co3O4 nanosheets, however, the energy and power density as well as the rate capability of the electrodes are significantly reduced, most likely due to the lower conductivity of Co3O 4 than that of NiCo2O4. The 3D hybrid composite Ni(OH)2/NiCo2O4/CFP electrodes demonstrate a high areal capacitance of 5.2 F/cm2 at a cycling current density of 2 mA/cm2, with a capacitance retention of 79% as the cycling current density was increased from 2 to 50 mA/cm2. The remarkable performance of these hybrid composite electrodes implies that supercapacitors based on them have potential for many practical applications. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
