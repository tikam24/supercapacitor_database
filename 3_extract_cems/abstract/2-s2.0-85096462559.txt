We report a novel, green, scalable technique to synthesize binder-free, high-purity conductive composite comprising activated carbon (AC), manganese dioxide nanorods (MnO2), and reduced graphene oxide sheets (rGO) for flexible supercapacitors with outstanding electrochemical performance. UV pulsed laser irradiation of GO-based composite dispersion (AC/GO or MnO2@AC/GO) in ethanol aqueous medium was used to induce a photocatalytic reduction of GO and simultaneous anchor AC particles or AC loaded MnO2 nanorods (MnO2@AC) on the reduced GO sheets (rGO) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. rGO sheets serve as a large surface area, conductive binder to enhance the ion adsorption, electrical conductivity, and mechanical flexibility of supercapacitor electrodes. This laser-induced photocatalytic reduction method was used to prepare two different rGO-based colloidal composites AC/rGO (CG) and MnO2@AC/rGO (MCG). The prepared rGO-based colloidal composites were used to fabricate symmetric supercapacitors (CG//CG and MCG//MCG) and asymmetric supercapacitors (MCG//CG) in which MCG is the positive electrode and CG is the negative one. All prepared rGO-based supercapacitors demonstrated significant improvement in their electrochemical performance compared with rGO-free AC based supercapacitors. The enhancement in the electrochemical properties of rGO-based supercapacitors could be attributed to the intrinsic characteristics of rGO, such as high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and super mechanical flexibility. Our approach is a one-step, scalable, cost-effective synthesis technique to produce all binder-free AC/rGO based composites for flexible energy-storage devices.
