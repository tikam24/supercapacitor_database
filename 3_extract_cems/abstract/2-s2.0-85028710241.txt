An in-situ synthetic route is designed to prepare manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosphere supported on graphdiyne oxides (GDYO) that is applied as electrode material for supercapacitors. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the MnO2@GDYO composite has a specific capacitance of 301 and 170 F g−1 at the current density of 0.2 and 10 A g−1, which is prior to the supercapacitor performance of MnO2@GDY. The cyclic stability test presents that MnO2@GDYO has a 98% initial capacitance retention even after 3000 charge-discharge cycles. The attractive supercapacitor performance of the composite material MnO2@GDYO make it potentially a promising candidate for future energy storage systems.
