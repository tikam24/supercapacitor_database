The electrochemical performances of raw and surface-fluorinated graphite powders used as anode in Li-ion battery have been studied. The fluorination obtained from F2 gas mainly concerns the surface of the particles for TF2≤300°C For higher temperature, important modifications of the bulk structure were observed. When they are used as anode in Li-ion battery, fluorinated graphite powders exhibit better electrochemical performances than raw graphite notably due to an increase of the surface area and surface defects which allow the storage of a higher amount of lithium into the host lattice. These results have been confirmed by impedance measurements performed in delithiated state: a drastic decrease of both the charge transfer resistance and the resistance related to the SEI layer was observed for TF2 ≤300°C. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
