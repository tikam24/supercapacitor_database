Our previously reported mathematical model for a mixed oxide nanoparticulate-based supercapacitor containing RuO 2•xH 2O and MO 2•yH 2O (M being another suitable transition metal) was analyzed. Both double-layer and faradaic processes responsible for charge/discharge were considered. The effects of the intrinsic factors, unit cell length, state of charge, and the exchange current densities of the electrochemical processes of the constituents on the performance of the model supercapacitor were clarified. Compensation effects where each constituent compensates the shortcomings of the other at specific conditions of discharge are analyzed in the light of the model. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.
