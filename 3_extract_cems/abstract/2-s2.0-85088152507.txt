Polyaniline (PANI)/Camphorsulfonic acid (CSA)/ copper oxide (CuO) nanocomposite was synthesized by in-situ chemical oxidation method. PANI nanocomposites were characterized by ultra violet absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis.). The optical studies show that the absorption exhibits a red shift in the visible region and optical band gap was found decreased from 2.55 eV to 2.61 eV with increasing the CuO concentration. The DTG results are shows enhanced thermal stability with increasing the CuO nano concentration. These results are suggesting PCC composite is a prominent candidate for supercapacitor properties and optoelectronics devices applications.
