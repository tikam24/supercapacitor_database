An asymmetric conducting polymer/polyoxometalate (POM) supercapacitor was designed using polypyrrole/phosphomolybdic acid and poly(3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene)/phosphotungstic acid as electrode materials. Performance characteristics were measured by cyclic voltammetry and constant current discharge. Energy density and power density were increased by a factor of 3 and 50, respectively, over symmetric conducting polymer/POM systems. Â© 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
