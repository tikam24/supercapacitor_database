Herein, coal tar pitch (CTP) derived nitrogen and sulfur co-doped porous graphene-like carbon (NSPC) is performed by an ammonium sulfate-assisted chemical blowing strategy. Afterward, NSPC was activated by KOH to form a-NSPC features a bubble-like structure with a thin porous shell and a well-balanced porous ratio. Serving as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the capacitance of a-NSPC was 368 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Meanwhile, the prepared materials exhibit excellent cycling stability after 10,000 cycles. This work may not only prepare superior electrode materials but also provide a feasible strategy for large-scale production of high-performance and low-cost electrode materials.
