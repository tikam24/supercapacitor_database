The electric vehicle is an environment friendly device, because its operation does not generate toxic gases. In this paper, its traction elements are described. An axial permanent magnet motor is used, with its electronic converter and controller. Likewise, a hybrid storage system based on batteries and a ultracapacitor is studied for using in an electric vehicle, with the purpose of electrical power supply. Through simulations their charging and discharging processes are analyzed, before building a prototype.
