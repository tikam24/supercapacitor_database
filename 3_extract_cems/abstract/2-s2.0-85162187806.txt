The evolution in the field of energy storage devices has gained the scrutiny of many researchers due to their inevitable applications in everything from convenient electronic devices to electric vehicles. The choice of materials for energy storage devices is a crucial step in enhancing their overall performance. Although traditional materials had acceptable performance traits, they face enormous environmental problems with synthesis, consumption, and disposal. Due to their negative consequences on the environment, the management of most conventional materials and products is a major concern. Hence, the development of Bio-polymers (BPs) to address the problems caused by conventional materials is currently attracting substantial scientific attention, which has prompted an evolution to eco-friendly products and materials. BPs are developed from the bioresources available in nature and show substantial potential among high-performance energy storage applications. The fundamental objective of this review is to comprehensively investigate the types, properties, and biodegradability of BPs, preparation techniques, modification strategies, and their applications in energy storage devices. The addition of nanoparticles enhances the overall performance of the BP and is one of the finest modification strategies. From the data analyzed so far, Cellulose Acetate (CA), Starch, and Chitosan (CS)-based BPs were used in a substantial number of researches on Batteries, Supercapacitors (SC), and Electric Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC) making up around 60 %, 29.9 %, and 40 % of the entire studies of BPs in energy storage application respectively. Additionally, limitations, challenges, and future outlooks of BPs in different applications are identified and effectively addressed towards the end of this review.
