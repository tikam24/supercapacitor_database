In the motor-driven system, the utilization of a supercapacitor energy storage unit contributes to energy saving. However, the multi-link time-delay in the system makes the supercapacitor unable to immediately track and respond to the sharp change of motor power. This will cause the large DC bus voltage fluctuation, the peak current at the power grid side, and unnecessary energy loss. In this paper, a power advance prediction control strategy considering multi-link time-delay is proposed. The multi-link time-delay mechanism in the system is analyzed, in particular for the different conditions of motor power change. Afterward, with the motor speed, torque, and the inverter acceleration/deceleration rate obtained in advance, the motor steady power and power change rate are predicted. In the dynamic process, by adjusting the tracking rate in real time, the motor reference power function is derived. The reference current of the supercapacitor is given online, so as to match the power between the motor and the energy storage unit. Both simulation and experimental results verify the rationality and validity of the proposed control strategy. In the dynamic process, the system stability and energy utilization are successfully improved in comparison with multi-parameter collaborative power prediction control and double closed-loop control.
