Abstract: The boron-doped three-dimensional (3D) cubic ordered mesoporous carbon (B-OMC) is prepared by the decomposition of acetylene and triisopropyl borate on Fe-KIT-6 at 700 Â°C via in house developed simple bubbler-assisted chemical vapour deposition setup. The small-angle XRD and HRTEM analysis confirmed that the resultant material possesses a 3D cubic structure with an Ia3d space group and highly ordered mesopores that are arranged in regular intervals, respectively. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm revealed a surface area of about 301.07 m2/g and average pore size of around 4.57 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms that the boron atoms on the carbon nanostructure can be doped successfully. The electrochemical performance of the B-OMC shows a high specific capacitance of 329 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s and 297 F/g at a current density of 0.2 A/g, excellent cycling stability of 97%, and low resistance in 6 M KOH. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor device (B-OMC//B-OMC) with 1 M Na2SO4 reveals a relatively high energy density (10.27 Wh/kg) and power density (300.59 W/kg). Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor exhibited good cyclic stability with specific capacitance retention of 88.4% after 10,000 consecutive cycles, even with a high potential window of 2.0 V.
