In this work, uniform hierarchical mesoporous 3D-urchin-like Bi2S3@2D-nanosheet g-C3N4 was synthesized via a superficial hydrothermal method. The prepared pristine Bi2S3, g-C3N4, and 3D-Bi2S3@2D-g-C3N4 composite samples were extensively studied for their electrochemical performance and exhibited superior battery-type behaviors. The results highlight that the optimized 3D-Bi2S3@2D-g-C3N4 composite sample exhibits a high areal capacity of 41.53 μA h/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2 and a good rate capability of 62.77% along with a remarkable capacity retention of 94.86% after 5000 cycles. The improved performance can be attributed to the good beneficial features of the synergistic effect, mesoporous structure, and lower dissolution. It offers a higher specific surface area, enriches electroactive sites, increases electronic/ionic conductivities, and reduces the interfacial resistance. Furthermore, the solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) were assembled by two similar electrodes of 3D-Bi2S3@2D-g-C3N4 sandwiched between the KOH and PVA gel electrolyte. The fabricated SSC device provides a high areal capacity of 25.40 μA h/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2. Furthermore, the SSC delivers a maximum power density of 1495 μW/cm2 and an energy density of 3.17 μW h/cm2 with a good cyclic retention of 83.84% after 7500 cycles. This work also demonstrates the practical applicability of realizing red-light-emitting diodes by interconnecting two SSCs in series.
