Supercapacitors (SCs) have been regarded as 'bridges' between traditional capacitors and batteries, and the integrated performance of SC is essentially determined by its electrode materials. It is found that the capacitance of pseudocapacitive electrode materials can be ten times higher than that of carbon-based electrode materials. As one of the most promising electroactive materials, binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) and their corresponding composites have been widely studied for energy storage due to their rich redox properties involving multiple oxidation states and different ions. This review presents an extensive description of BTMO materials and the most commonly used synthetic methods. Furthermore, several notable BTMOs and their composites in the application of SCs are reviewed and their prospect and direction of development as well as the scientific problems remaining to be solved are pointed out.
