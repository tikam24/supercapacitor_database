Hybrid energy storage system configuration, novel to the authors' knowledge, is introduced. Interleaving the super capacitor between the electrostatically sensitive devices (ESDs) and DC-link capacitor enables the supercapacitor to directly handle all power demands in transient or steady state mode. Differentiation regarding the nature of the power demand is eliminated thus reducing the system's control complexity. Sliding-mode DC-DC control method is adapted to address the voltage variations and sustain the desired output voltage. The proposed system is implemented and verified via Matlab Simulink using a practical test case for household energy back up system. This new system can be integrated to PV power generation systems.
