The structure and growth of molecular NaCl crystals in bulk and in a narrow, nanometer-sized apolar confinement are examined by explicit-water molecular dynamics computer simulations. It is demonstrated that fast crystallization and subsequent diffusion-controlled cluster growth in bulk is triggered by supersaturations that exceed a certain threshold value. In confinement, simulated in a pseudo grand canonical setup, salt is shown to be expelled from the narrow apolar slab region, and the effective ion concentration inside the nanoconfinement is always considerably lower than the reservoir salt concentration so that no fast crystallization takes place. For very small slab widths (d<1.5 nm) salt is almost entirely expelled while water remains in the slab, indicating a capillary evaporation phenomenon for the polar ions. If forced into the apolar confinement by simulating in a strictly canonical setup, we find stable crystals only if at least three crystalline planes fit into the slab, which happens above a 2-nm slab width. In this case the (100) plane of the bulk crystal is oriented parallel to the apolar surface delimited by a subnanometer thin hydration layer. This work presents molecular-level insight of salt crystallization in apolar confinements of a nanometer scale with possible implications in double-layer supercapacitor physics and geological salt weathering.
