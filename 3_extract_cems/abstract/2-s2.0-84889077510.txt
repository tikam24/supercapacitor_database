In order to examine the potential application of non-stoichiometric molybdenum oxide as anode materials for aqueous micro-supercapacitors, conductive MoOx films (2 x 2.3) deposited via RF magnetron sputtering at different temperatures were systematically studied for composition, structure and electrochemical properties in an aqueous solution of Li 2SO4. The MoOx (x ≈ 2.3) film deposited at 150 °C exhibited a higher areal capacitance (31 mF cm-2 measured at 5 mV s-1), best rate capability and excellent stability at potentials below -0.1 V versus saturated calomel electrode, compared to the films deposited at room temperature and at higher temperatures. These superior properties were attributed to the multi-valence composition and mixed-phase microstructure, i.e., the coexistence of MoO2 nanocrystals and amorphous MoOx (2.3 < x 3). A mechanism combining Mo(IV) oxidation/reduction on the hydrated MoO2 grain surfaces and cation intercalation/extrusion is proposed to illustrate the pseudo-capacitive process. © 2013 National Institute for Materials Science.
