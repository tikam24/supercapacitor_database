A new conductive hydrogels based on PVA/GO/SA/PANI (PGOSAP) are prepared for application in electrode of flexible supercapacitors. The conductive hydrogels exhibit excellent mechanical properties with a elongation at break of 220% and tensile strenght of 3.3 MPa. Furthermore, the flexible supercapacitor is fabricated from the conductive hydrogels have special significance in fabricating deformable. In this work, multi network structure conductive hydrogel with no deformation and has been prepared. Taking advantage of the synergistic effects of PVA and SA the hydrogel can form without crosslinker and the crystallization area of composite hydrogel smaller than that of single material, thus providing more channels for electrolyte transfer. Finally, a novel one-piece integrated flexible supercapacitor based on PGOSAP hydrogel was assembled. The results show that, there was no displacement or lamination between electrolyte and electrode after 3500 cycles. The novel one-piece integrated flexible supercapacitor with excellent mechanical properties is expected to broad prospects for fabricating deformable flexible supercapacitors.
