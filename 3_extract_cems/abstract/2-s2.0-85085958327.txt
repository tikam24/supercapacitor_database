Eco-friendly and efficient energy production and storage technologies are highly demanded to address the environmental and energy crises. Compared with the extensive study of energy conversion, the study of energy storage is relatively lagging far behind. Porous organic polymers (POPs) involving crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and amorphous conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) have been recently proposed as attractive electrode materials for energy storage devices including supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries. Herein, recent development and essential design guidelines of POPs as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors and rechargeable batteries are discussed at length with particular focus on the synthetic methods, the working mechanism, and the structureâ€“property relationships of POPs, which will provide a deep understanding of the intrinsic characteristics of POPs. Future prospects and challenges of POPs as electrode materials for energy storage devices are also discussed at the end.
