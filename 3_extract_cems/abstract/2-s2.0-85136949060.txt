Increase in electric mobility in recent years brings higher demands in battery production and performance. Battery aging still raises big concerns among the general public. One of the possible solutions to improve battery life is to reduce load on the battery by using hybrid battery storage system, which consists of battery and supercapacitor. Different topologies of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) are discussed in this paper, including semi-active topology which was modeled in Matlab/Simulink. Methodology for battery life estimation is proposed which allows viability assessment of different sizes of modular traction batteries. Battery aging is investigated on empirical equivalent circuit model. Created model also allows testing of new energy management strategies before their implementation.
