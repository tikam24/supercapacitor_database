The energy crisis and global warming are two of the greatest challenges that our society is facing nowadays, requiring an immediate solution that involves the develop-ment of clean, efficient, sustainable and cheap energy-stor-age devices. These energy-storage devices are highly desira-ble for applications in electrical vehicles, portable electronic devices, and power grids, etc. The electrochemical per-formance of the devices largely depends on the chemical compositions and structures of the electrode materials. Gra-phene/ polymer hybrid nanocomposites have gained great attention as electrodes for energy storage because of their excellent mechanical, electrical and electrochemical properties, originating from the synergistic effect of the two components. In this review, we present a general overview and recent advances of graphene/polymer nanocomposites as high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. Major challenges to be tackled and future perspectives are also highlighted.
