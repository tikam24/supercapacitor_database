The challenge of redox-active molecules for electrochemical capacitors is that they are easy to detach from the substrate during long-term charge-discharge cycles. In this work, redox-active molecule 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAQ) is anchored on amino functionalized biomass porous carbon (FWS) via strong hydrogen bonding interaction. The protophilic C = O sites on the DAQ provide additional faradaic pseudocapacitance for biomass carbon-based electrode through fast redox reactions. In addition, the surface functionalization of porous carbon enhanced the interaction between the porous carbon and DAQ molecule, which inhibited the detachment of DAQ and significantly improved the electrochemical stability of the composite electrode. The optimized DAQ@FWS composite exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 424.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a stable capacity retention of 93.1% over 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which is higher than unfunctionalized biomass porous carbon-based composite electrode (71.6% after 10,000 cycles). Meanwhile, DAQ@FWS composite maintains a high capacitance of 300.4 F g−1 even at 30 A g−1. Density functional theory calculations and detailed electrochemical analysis further elucidate the binding interactions of DAQ with FWS and charge storage mechanisms. Furthermore, coin-type symmetric supercapacitor based on DAQ@FWS exhibits excellent energy density (36.4 Wh kg−1 at 700.5 W kg−1), power density (7.001 kW kg−1 at 27.0 Wh kg−1) and durable cycling stability (capacitance retention is 88.3% after 10,000 cycles). Thus, amino functionalization of biomass porous carbon to anchor redox active organic quinones is promising as an effective strategy to fabricate superior performance supercapacitor electrode material.
