An efficient environmentally friendly purely-physical ice-microcrystal pore-forming strategy, consisting of three steps including the water-swelling biomass process utilizing N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, freeze-drying and one-step carbonization, was developed to prepare a biomass-derived super-flexible high-performance carbon film electrode capable of being repeatedly folded.
