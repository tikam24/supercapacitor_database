Aiming at the recovery and utilization of regenerative braking energy and harmonic control in electrified railway, this paper proposes an energy storage method based on railway power regulator to solve the above problems. In this paper, the harmonic extraction method is analyzed, and a super capacitor energy storage control strategy is proposed to suppress the characteristic harmonics of the traction network. In the control part of the railway power regulator converter, the multiple quasi-proportional resonant controller is used to control the characteristic harmonics of the traction network. In this paper, super capacitor is used as the energy storage medium of the energy storage system to recover and utilize the regenerative braking energy of the train. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by simulation test. The results show that the proposed energy storage scheme and its control strategy can effectively recover the regenerative braking energy, reduce the grid side power fluctuation, and effectively suppress the characteristic harmonics of the traction grid side.
