A multilayered carbon nanosphere (CNS)/manganese oxide (MnO2) nanofilm is fabricated by a newly developed layer-by-layer (LBL)–post-infiltration approach. The multilayered architecture effectively shortens the length over which ions diffuse, and the nanoscaled carbon/MnO2 interface provides an interconnected pathway for electron conduction. MnO2 acts not only as the redox center for charge storage, but also as the spacer between the LBL-assembled multilayers for more rapid electrolyte transport. A specific capacitance (based on MnO2) of 1134.0 F g−1 is achieved at a loading of 5.22 μg cm−2 in a neutral electrolyte. This strategy provides a promising approach for fabricating high-power and high-energy electrochemical capacitors with precise control of electrode thickness on geometric device surfaces.
