In view of the shortcomings of pure electric vehicle with a single energy source in terms of battery life and protection of power battery, supercapacitor is used as auxiliary energy source to form a dual energy source system, and effective energy management strategies are used to reduce the consumption of power batteries and to protect the power battery from the impact of high current to extend its service life. An energy management strategy based on rule control and fuzzy control is designed to optimize the energy management of the dual energy sources system. The effectiveness of the strategy is verified through the simulation of CRUISE and MATLAB/Simulink software. The simulation results show that the fuzzy control strategy has a better energy management effect. Compared with a single energy source and a rule-based strategy, the state of charge (State of charge, SOC) consumption of the power battery is reduced by 2.2% and 0.5% under the Driving conditions of passenger cars in China (CLTC-P) respectively. The peak value of output current has been reduced by 39.8% and 22.7% respectively.
