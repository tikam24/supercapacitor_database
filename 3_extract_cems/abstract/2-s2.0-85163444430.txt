A low ESR supercapacitor could be easily used as a lossless voltage dropper in applications such as linear voltage regulators to significantly enhance the end-to-end efficiency of the converter. Useful examples of 12–5, 5–3.3, and 5–1.5V linear converters with extra low-frequency-based energy circulation with single supercapacitor or supercapacitor arrays are discussed with experimental details. Technique is called supercapacitor-assisted low-dropout (SCALDO) regulator.
