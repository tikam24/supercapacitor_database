Activated carbons (ACs) were prepared by microwave-assisted heating of bituminous coal with KOH as activation agent in different gas media for supercapacitors. The pore structure parameters of ACs are obtained by using nitrogen adsorption technique. ACs prepared in static nitrogen, flowing nitrogen and carbon dioxide are denoted as ACStatic-N2, AC Flowing-N2, ACFlowing-CO2. The specific surface area of ACFlowing-N2 is the biggest among the three ACs, which reaches 1201 m2g-1 with total pore volume being at 0.64 cm3 g-1. The specific capacitance of ACFlowing-N2 electrode and energy density of ACFlowing-N2 capacitor is the biggest among the three AC samples with specific capacitance being at 302.6 F g-1 and energy density being at 10.1 Wh kg-1 after 400 cycles. The microwave-assisted KOH activation of coal is an efficient approach to the preparation of ACs for supercapacitors.
