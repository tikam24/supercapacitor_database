Cobalt oxide and yttrium doped cobalt oxide films are produced with spraying method. The films are coated on glass and indium tin oxide substrates at 450 °C. The obtained films have been examined by X-ray diffractometer and scanning electron microscopy devices. In this examination, yttrium doping is seen to cause deterioration in crystal scructure. Moreover, films’ electrochemical features have been studied. The electrochemical measurements of samples are performed with cyclic voltammetry, electrodes supercapasitor curves and impedance spectrometers have been measured. Electrochemical super capasitor performance test has been measured in 6 M KOH for electrolyte and has been studied with the speed of 0.1 V/s. It has been calculated that yttrium doping increases capacity and the maximum capacitance value is measured as 296 F/g.
