This study investigates the synthesis and application of boron nitride quantum dot (BNQD) covalently bonded reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid materials as a novel electrode material for supercapacitors. Because of the p-doping as well as the enhanced hydrophilicity and interfacial bonding force enabled by the hybridization of amine-functionalized boron nitride quantum dot (A-BNQD) with rGO via the chemical coupling reaction, the A-BNQD/rGO shows improved charge carrier density, wettability of electrolyte, and durability. As a result of the synergistic effects, the A-BNQD/rGO as a supercapacitor electrode shows much higher specific capacitance compared to those of rGO and raw BNQD/rGO at a current density of 1 A g−1. Further, the A-BNQD/rGO shows high cycling stability, maintaining almost 94.38%, even after 10,000 cycles due to the enhanced interfacial bonding force between the A-BNQD and rGO. Besides, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibits high specific capacitance (90 F g−1@1 A g−1), an energy density (12.5 Wh kg−1@0.5 kW kg−1), and good cycling stability. This result suggested that the fabricated A-BNQD/rGO has great potential as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
