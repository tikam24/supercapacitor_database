Nanostructured spinel LiMn2O4 and super P composite with much enhanced electrochemical performance especially ultrahigh rate capability as the cathode for aqueous hybrid supercapacitors is synthesized by ball milling commercial LiMn2O4 particles together with super P. The as-prepared composite delivers a high capacitance of 306 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and superb rate ability of 228.6 F g−1 at 40 A g−1 in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The capacitance of the nanostructured composite is 3.5 times higher than that of pristine LiMn2O4 even being charged and discharged 80 times faster. The excellent performances are ascribed to the nanosized LiMn2O4 well dispersed into the conductive carbon matrix. LiMn2O4 and super P composite//active carbon hybrid supercapacitor is assembled and the energy density can reach up to 21.58 Wh kg−1 at 293.16 W kg−1 and 13 Wh kg−1 at 5200 W kg−1. The hybrid device also shows an excellent cycling performance, which retains 85% of the initial capacitance after 4500 cycles. This work provides an effectively facile way to produce high performance LiMn2O4-based cathodes for hybrid suercapacitors in practical applications.
