This work studies the production of electricity by a photocatalytic fuel cell and its storage in a supercapacitor. We propose a simple construction, where a third electrode bearing activated carbon is added to the device to form a supercapacitor electrode in combination with the support-ing electrolyte of the cell. The photocatalytic fuel cell is based on a CdS-sensitized mesoporous TiO2 photoanode and an air cathode bearing only nanoparticulate carbon as an oxygen reduction electrocatalyst.
