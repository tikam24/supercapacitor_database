We present the development of novel electrochemical supercapacitor and sensor based on silver (Ag) nanoparticles coated graphene oxide (GO). 10-20 nm diameter of Ag nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of graphene oxide through the chemical reduction method. Ag-coated GO nanohybrids were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, electrical and an electrochemical analysis for the energy storage (supercapacitors), energy conversion (solar cells) and sensor applications. It is found that nanohybrid electrodes showed good specific capacitance and electrochemical sensing performance in comparison to pristine GO. The improvement in the electrochemical characteristics can be attributed to the sensitizing effect between Ag nanparticles and GO. These GO/Ag hybrid transparent conducting films also show low resistance and good transmittance, suggesting they are good electrodes for the opto-electronic devices (e.g. solar cells).
