Helical carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) assembly structure possesses huge development prospects in sorts of applications. Here we report a facile yet versatile strategy for synthetic HCNFs assembly structures (Sn-HCNFs) from Sn-based metal-organic framework (Sn-MOF) via an ethanol flame method (EFM) in atmospheric environment. As Sn-MOF is burned in ethanol flame, HCNFs grow on the surface of Sn-MOF progressively, forming an assembly structure with SnO2 core and HCNFs-forest shell. The process of Sn-HCNFs formation is also investigated by a series of experiments, which demonstrate that, in ethanol flame, Sn-MOF is first converted to SnO2, and then SnO2 catalyzes the formation of Sn-HCNFs. Furthermore, our strategy can also be extended to the preparation of various MOFs-based HCNFs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/carbon nanofibers (CNFs) assembly architectures. By electrochemical tests, Sn-HCNFs as electrode materials in supercapacitors exhibit superior electrochemical performances than pure HCNFs. The supercapacitors with the Sn-HCNFs electrode can remain the energy density of 21.67 Wh kg−1 at a very high-power density of 5000 W kg−1. Our strategy provides an alternative route to acquire various HCNFs or CNTs/CNFs assembly structures conveniently and will stimulate further researches on preparation and applications of them.
