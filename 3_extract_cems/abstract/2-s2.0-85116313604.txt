This work presents the differential flatness-based energy management strategy for stand-alone Photovoltaic (PV) system with high energy density - battery and high-power density- supercapacitor with DC load. The fluctuation in DC bus voltage is due to the variation in generation of PV power and load Power requirement. This causes the frequent charging /discharging profile of the battery which ultimately reduces the life cycle and increase the internal temperature of the battery. This drawback can be overcome by adopting the flatness-based control technique. In this technique, the supercapacitor converter maintains the DC link voltage constant and the battery converter provides the constant current with the distribution of solar power. Due to constant charging/discharging of battery the thermal run-away problem like leak, smoke, gas venting, rapid disassembly, flames etc., can be eliminated. Decoupling of load power and battery power significantly increase the battery life cycle and maintain the internal temperature of battery within the optimum of 20 °C to 40 °C. In order to achieve efficient charging/discharging of Supercapacitor (SC), Dynamic Temperature Dependent SC Model (DTDSCM) is considered. To verify the performance of the control technique, simulation is carried out in the Mat lab Simulink and it is tested for daily load profile.
