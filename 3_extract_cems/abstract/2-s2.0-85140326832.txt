A supercapacitor (SCap)/Battery combination leads to development of an efficient energy storage system (ESS). This combination further enhances the performance of the battery by reducing the burden, especially at peak load conditions. In this work, the Energy Management (EM) based model is developed and implemented to the basic solar power-based (SPB) electric vehicle (EV) model. In any type of EM model predicting the driver cycle of EV is one of the main obstacles. The basic structure has been developed with Solar panels, SCap, Battery, DC-DC Converters, and proper control models. Irradiance and temperature are the main sources of power for the solar panel to generate, to run the connected load. In this, static load with constant power has been considered and three different case studies are examined as per the proposed control method. The Battery feeds the load and SCap since there is no power available from two sources, this will be done in case one. In the second case study, PV only supplies power to two sources and the load. In the third case, no power is considered until a certain period, so the battery only sends power to the load when PV and SCap cannot provide power. In order to accomplish this, MATLAB/Simulation models are obtained and validated for the power-sharing between solar panel, battery, and SCap in relation to the power availability conditions at the source level.
