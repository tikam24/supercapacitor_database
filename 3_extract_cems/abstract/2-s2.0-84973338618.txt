The electrical characteristics of hybrid super capacitor were evaluated by synthesizing LTO (Li4Ti5O12) using TiO2 having a hydrogen titanate nanowire form. Preparation of the hydrogen titanate nanowire was implemented by using TiO2 having size of 60 nm and NaOH, and performing synthesis at 70 °C for 6 h with a sonochemical method. LTO compound was synthesized at 150 °C for 36 h and at 180 °C for 36 h respectively by using the hydrogen titanate nanowire and LiOH·H2O as starting materials with a hydrothermal method. The final LTO compound was synthesized at 700 °C for 6 h using a solid-state method. As a result of manufacturing the hybrid super capacitor using LTO synthesized at 180 °C for 36 h with the hydrothermal method, a capacity of 198 mA·h/g has been achieved compared to a theoretical capacity of 172 mA·h/g of existing LTO, and thus, the capacity has been increased by about 13%. Further, such excellent cycle performance has ensured its possibility as a high-capacity capacitor.
