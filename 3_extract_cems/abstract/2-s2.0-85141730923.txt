The 0D-Ag/2D-g-C3N4/3D-TiO2 nano-composite materials were fabricated by simple and mass production method. It involves the combination of incipient wetness impregnation and thermal spreading techniques. By changing the order of impregnation and thermal spreading, silver nanoparticles with “on-top” and “embedded” morphologies could be selectively controlled. The thermal spreading followed by impregnation (TS-IM) leads to the “on-top” structure [Ag/g-C3N4/TiO2] while, the reverse order (IM-TS) produces the embedded silver nanoparticles [g-C3N4/Ag/TiO2]. The 16%Ag/g-C3N4/TiO2 (TS-IM) sample exhibited the best performance due to the presence of very small and highly dispersed silver nanoparticles over g-C3N4/TiO2 sample. The loading of silver not only doubled the specific capacitance but also stabilized the recycling performance against deactivation. This study reveals easy and performance tunable synthesis of Ag/g-C3N4/TiO2 nano-composite materials towards energy-storage applications. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
