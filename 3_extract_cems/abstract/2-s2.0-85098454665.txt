The present analysis focuses on the synthetic methods used for the application of supercapacitors with various mysterious architectures derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). ZIFs represent an emerging and unique class of metal-organic frameworks with structures similar to conventional aluminosilicate zeolites, consisting of imidazolate linkers and metal ions. Their intrinsic porous properties, robust functionalities, and excellent thermal and chemical stabilities have resulted in a wide range of potential applications for various ZIF materials. In this rapidly expanding area, energetic research activities have emerged in the past few years, ranging from synthesis approaches to attractive applications of ZIFs. In this analysis, the development of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes and recent strategies to produce them, including the synthesis of various heterostructures and nanostructures, are analyzed and summarized. This analysis goes via the ingenuity of modern science when it comes to these nanoarchitecture electrodes. Despite these significant achievements, it is still difficult to accurately monitor the morphologies of materials derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) because the induction force during structural transformations at elevated temperatures is in high demand. It is also desirable to achieve the direct synthesis of highly functionalized nanosized materials derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and the growth of nanoporous structures based on ZIFs encoded in specific substrates for the construction of active materials with a high surface area suitable for electrochemical applications. The latest improvements in this field of supercapacitors with materials formed from ZIFs as electrodes using ZIFs as templates or precursors are discussed in this review. Also, the possibility of usable materials derived from ZIFs for both existing and emerging energy storage technologies is discussed. This journal is
