As renewable resources are increasingly used and integrated with the grids, the power stability and frequency stability issues have become more concerned in the power system. An integrated Renewable Energy Sources (RES) model is connected to the DC bus through KY-Boost Converter (KY-BC). The DC bus is connected to Resistive—R, Inductive—L, and Capacitive—C type loads and tested. The Energy Storage Device (ESD) connected in parallel with RES will also supply the DC bus during the peak demand. This paper makes a comparative analysis between the performance of the conventional PI and Fractional order PID controller. Both open-loop and closed-loop systems are composed, displayed, and recreated utilizing MATLAB-Simulink, and their outcomes have been observed. The proposed approach gives an enhanced voltage output to the DC grid.
