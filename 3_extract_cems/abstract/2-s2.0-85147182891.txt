A supercapacitor is a high-capacity device that interfaces electrolytic capacitors and batteries by possessing a capacitance value significantly larger than conventional capacitors but with lower voltage limits. Nickel hydroxide is a potential material exhibiting tempting properties such as high specific capacitance, various oxidation states, morphologies, and large surface area. However, various limitations must be overcome, such as increasing the current density and improving the stability after doping of vanadium in Ni(OH)2 material-doped Ni(OH)2microflowers were successfully fabricated using a chemical bath deposition process in this study. XRD studies show hexagonal crystal structure with γ-phase of Ni(OH)2. The presence of V=O at peak positions 1023, and 923 cm−1 reveals in the FT-IR study. Increased interlayer distance demonstrates the presence of vanadium ions between the superior and inferior layers of Ni(OH)2. The 0.3% V-doped Ni(OH)2 electrode displayed a remarkable specific capacitance of 1456.8 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2 and high performance with 88.17% capacity retention at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 over 2000 cycles.
