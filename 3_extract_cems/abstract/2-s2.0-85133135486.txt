NiCo(OH)4-NiO composite electrode materials were prepared using hydrothermal deposition and electrophoretic deposition. NiCo(OH)4 is spherical and flowerlike, composed of nanosheets, and NiO is deposited on the surface of NiCo(OH)4 in the form of nanorods. NiCo(OH)4 has a large specific surface area and can provide more active sites. Synergistic action with NiO deposits on the surface can provide a higher specific capacitance. In order to study the influence of hydrothermal reaction temperature on the properties of NiCo(OH)4, the prepared materials of NiCo(OH)4-NiO, the hydrothermal reaction temperatures of 70 °C, 90 °C, 100 °C, and 110 °C were used for comparison. The results showed that the NiCo(OH)4-NiO-90 specific capacitance of the prepared electrode material at its maximum when the hydrothermal reaction temperature is 90 °C. The specific capacitance of the NiCo(OH)4-NiO-90 reaches 2129 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and remains 84% after 1000 charge–discharge cycles.
