Supercapacitors, which serve as a kind of novel energy storage devices, are proven a promising solution for developing miniaturized, flexible, wearable electronics. Lightweight thin film electrodes that can be implemented is a potential developing orientation. Nevertheless, insufficient device energy density impedes its practical applications. To elevate device energy density, complicated assembly of nanostructured two-dimensional electrodes is a useful technique but results in high cost. Herein, we report a magnetic-assisted technology to fabricate tailorable, tractable, and flexible NiCo oxyfluoride non-woven cloth (NOC) for cathode, which can reveal superior electrochemical performance and excellent mechanical flexibility. A superb high areal capacitance up to 3.07 F cm-2 and no significant capacitance decay after 5000 cycles reveal the great potential in practical applications of the NOC electrodes.
