Here an efficient preparation of porous carbon monolith by freeze drying of wax gourd and following carbonization without any activating processes is reported. The obtained porous carbon monolith features high specific surface area, low density, and excellent mechanical strength. Directly using as an all-carbon electrode without any binder and conductive additives, it displays an outstanding performance with specific capacitance of 357 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 . Fabrication as a symmetric supercapacitor, its capacitance retains 78.5% after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at 2 A g −1 .
