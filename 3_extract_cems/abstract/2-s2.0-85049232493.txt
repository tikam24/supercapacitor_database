This paper presents a novel Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) topology based on Inductive Power Transfer (IPT) with integrated Super Capacitor (SC) energy storage. The proposed topology is suitable for dynamic charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs), where large power transients must be processed without placing excessive strain on the utility grid or the EV battery. This topology extends the functionality of a typical LCL tuned bi-directional IPT system by adding the ability to store energy in a SC in a controlled manner. Operation of the system is described in terms of the switching patterns and control variables required to transfer energy between the input, output, and the SCs. A mathematical model that predicts the overall transfer of power between the input, output, and SCs is presented along with simulated performance of the proposed system to validate the model under a variety of typical operating conditions.
