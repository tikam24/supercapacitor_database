The Co3O4 anchored on the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was fabricated via a facile co-precipitation method with MOFs/g-C3N4 as precursor. The as-prepared Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite delivers a high specific capacitance of 780 F g−1 at the current density of 1.25 A g−1 in 2 M KOH solution and the capacitance value retain 80% after 1000 cycles with the current density of 3 A g−1. The capacitance of Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite is much greater than the bare Co3O4 with 419 F g−1 at the current density 1.25 A g−1. The investigation suggests that the excellent performance of capacitance may be assigned to as-prepared Co3O4/g-C3N4 composite, which could be a potential and outstanding electrode material in electrochemical energy storage devices.
