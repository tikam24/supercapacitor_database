Herein, we report a facile and low-cost electrodeposition approach for the synthesis of Copper Cobaltite (CuCo2O4) nanosheets on indium doped tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates. The crystal structure and morphology of the material are characterized by X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, Raman spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The synthesized CuCo2O4 nanosheets are composed of numerous nanoparticles and showed enhanced electrochemical activity for the glucose sensing and supercapacitor applications. The non-enzymatic glucose sensing performance of the nanosheets exhibits sensitivity of 8.25 μAμM−1 cm−2, linear range of detection of 5–110 μM and response time of 15 s towards glucose molecules. Similarly, supercapacitor fabricated using the CuCo2O4 nanosheets as the active electrode shows high specific capacitance of 100 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with remarkable cycling stability.
