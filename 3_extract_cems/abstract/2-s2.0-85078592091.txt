Invited for this month's cover picture is the group of Prof. Shuai Wang from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, China). The cover picture shows the fabrication of N-doped porous vertical graphene nanomesh arrays (NVGMs) on flexible carbon cloth substrate and the decoration of MnO2 nanosheets and polypyrrole films on the NVGMs to develop two types of hierarchical nanohybrid electrodes for flexible asymmetric supercapacitor.
