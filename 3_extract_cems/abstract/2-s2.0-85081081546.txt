Here, we demonstrated a unique symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device architecture based on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and nitrogen-doped RGO (N-RGO) electrodes. The RGO/N-RGO SSC shows a wide voltage window (2.2 V), high energy density (106.3 W h kg-1), and ultra-high power density (15184.8 W kg-1). The RGO/N-RGO SSC also delivers outstanding stability of 95.5% over 10 000 galvanostatic charging-discharging tests and 90.5% over 8 h of voltage holding tests. Additionally, this work explores a better understanding of leakage current and self-discharge mechanisms, which justifies the excellent state of health of the RGO/N-RGO SSC device.
