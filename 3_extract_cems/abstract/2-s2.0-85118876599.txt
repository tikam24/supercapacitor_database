Hybrid Electric Vehicle utilizes secondary source of electrical energy for recharging the battery during vehicle operation. Regenerative power which is obtained from the conversion of kinetic energy of motion into electrical energy and returns to battery is one of the important sources of improving fuel efficiency. Battery is the major source in an Electric Vehicle (EV), where mileage of EV depends on it and also the power obtained from battery gets consumed by the various loads in EV other than motor. Such energy consumption also becomes barrier for the main rotary part to consume its energy from battery units. To enhance the battery performance, in this paper the battery is energized by the regenerative power and to eliminate the power consumed by other loads from battery super capacitor is used to provide energy for mini loads other than motor. Super capacitors are the high energy capacitors which can store an incomparably greater amount of energy than conventional capacitors and it has the potential to improve the Hybrid Electric Vehicle energy storage system.
