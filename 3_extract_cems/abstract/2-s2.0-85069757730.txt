In this work, solvothermally grown ZIF-67 MOF crystals were utilized as single source molecular precursor, which were transformed into porous Co3O4 nanoparticles through a simple calcination treatment. The crystal structure of ZIF-67 was also authenticated by single crystal x-ray analysis. Further, Co3O4 nanoparticles were incorporated as supercapacitor electrode. The results show that ZIF-67 derived Co3O4 nanoparticles deliver an appreciable specific capacitance (190 F g−1 at 5 A g−1) with high capacitance retention (71.42% after 5000 cycles). The comparison with previous state-of-the-arts highlights the importance of MOF derived nanomaterials for achieving superior electrochemical performance.
