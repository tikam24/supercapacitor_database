Wearable electronics require flexible supercapacitors with specially fabricated electrode materials, i.e., foldable and freestanding. Although activated carbon is the most used electrode’s active material for aqueous supercapacitors, it is a challenge to pack the particulates into flexible electrodes. Typically, polytetrafluoroethylene binder and polymeric flexible substrate are used, rendering a large amount of inactive-material. Here, we successfully fabricated multiwalled carbon nanotube/activated-carbon (MWCNT-AC) freestanding sheet via a scalable surface-engineered tape-casting technique to be used as a flexible electrode for aqueous supercapacitors. Instead of focusing on improving MWCNTs as active materials, the sheets act as a conducting matrix that binds together the activated-carbon particulates. MWCNT-AC has a specific capacitance of 135.17 Fg −1 (123.9 Fg −1 after 1000 cycles) at 1 Ag −1 from − 0.8 to 0.2 V vs. Hg/HgO (in three-electrode cell). [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
