With the increasing demands of sustainable development society and emerging industries for energy storage technology, energy-storing devices have always been the primary driving force for the revolution of equipment performance. Lithium-ion supercapacitors have attracted more attention possessing both notable advantages of supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, among which electrode materials are the key to improve their performance. Particularly, V6O13 as the positive electrode of lithium-ion batteries with excellent electrochemical performance has been widely studied. This paper introduces the studies on the application of V6O13 cathode in supercapacitors for the first time. Importantly, the preparation and modification methods of V6O13 are reviewed with reference to its use in lithium-ion batteries, and the possibility of its application in lithium-ion supercapacitors is put forward.
