Energy storage and conversion are critical components of modern energy systems, enabling the integration of renewable energy sources and the optimization of energy use. These technologies play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development. Supercapacitors play a vital role in the development of energy storage systems due to their high power density, long life cycles, high stability, low manufacturing cost, fast charging-discharging capability and eco-friendly. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has emerged as a promising material for supercapacitor electrodes due to its high surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and good stability. Its unique layered structure also allows for efficient ion transport and storage, making it a potential candidate for high-performance energy storage devices. Additionally, research efforts have focused on improving synthesis methods and developing novel device architectures to enhance the performance of MoS2-based devices. This review article on MoS2 and MoS2-based nanocomposites provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in the synthesis, properties, and applications of MoS2 and its nanocomposites in the field of supercapacitors. This article also highlights the challenges and future directions in this rapidly growing field.
