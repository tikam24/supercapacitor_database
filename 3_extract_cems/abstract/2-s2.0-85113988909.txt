In this work, power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) simulation was used to explore the use and control of energy storage resources within a limited-inertia power system. The system of interest includes a diesel generator, pulsating loads, and battery-based and ultra-capacitor-based energy storage. Using PHIL simulation, the generator, loads, power converters, and the developed energy management control were simulated on a real-time simulator, and a battery module and ultra-capacitor module were interfaced to the simulated system. The battery and capacitor were scaled to represent the full battery and capacitor banks through the PHIL interfaces, and a number of experiments were carried out to explore the performance of the system.
