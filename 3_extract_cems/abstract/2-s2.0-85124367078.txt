The self-restacking of graphene nanosheets inevitably compromises the electrochemical performance of conventional graphene-based materials. Herein, to solve this problem, we prepared a new type of three-dimensional porous aerogel with partially unzipped multiwalled carbon nanotubes inserted into graphene nanosheets via a reduction-reaction-induced self-assembly process. In the resulting aerogels, the inner carbon nanotubes (CNTs) tightly attach to the unzipped outer graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), which bridge with the graphene nanosheets. These interconnections bring them excellent electrical contact; the CNTs act as spacers to prevent the restacking of adjacent graphene nanosheets, and the abundant interconnected pores in the aerogels provide large channels for charge transfer. Accordingly, the aerogels exhibit a specific capacitance of 348.4 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1, with capacitance retention remaining at 89.7% at a current density of 2 Ag−1 after 5000 cycles. The results show that the aerogels are promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
