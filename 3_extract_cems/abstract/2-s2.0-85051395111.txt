Here, a straightforward strategy is illustrated for the preparation of Ni,CoOH-rGO/NF electrodes for superb energy density supercapacitors. The Ni,CoOH-rGO/NF electrode indicates a remarkable electrochemical performance including a supreme specific capacitance (SC) (4047 F g−1) and remarkable capability of rate compared with previously reported nickel-cobalt oxides/hydroxides electrodes. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by the Ni,Co-OH/rGO and FeS2-rGO represents the considerable SC of 405.5 F g−1, an energy density (ED) of 144 Wh kg−1, a power density (PD) of up to 8 kW kg−1, and a superb long cycle life (only 7.5% loss after 20000 cycles). We have also successfully assembled a symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) based on Ni,CoOH-rGO/NF electrodes using a PVA–KOH gelled electrolyte. The SSC reveals a good SC of 763.75 F g−1, a superior ED of 106.10 Wh kg−1 and a remarkable long-term cyclic stability (only 10.17% loss after 20000 cycles).
