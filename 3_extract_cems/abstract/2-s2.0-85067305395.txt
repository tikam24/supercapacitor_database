Rechargeable batteries are essential elements for many applications, ranging from portable use up to electric vehicles. Among them, lithium-ion batteries have taken an increasing importance in the day life. However, they suffer of several limitations: safety concerns and risks of thermal runaway, cost, and high carbon footprint, starting with the extraction of the transition metals in ores with low metal content. These limitations were the motivation for an intensive research to replace the inorganic electrodes by organic electrodes. Subsequently, the disadvantages that are mentioned above are overcome, but are replaced by new ones, including the solubility of the organic molecules in the electrolytes and lower operational voltage. However, recent progress has been made. The lower voltage, even though it is partly compensated by a larger capacity density, may preclude the use of organic electrodes for electric vehicles, but the very long cycling lives and the fast kinetics reached recently suggest their use in grid storage and regulation, and possibly in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The purpose of this work is to review the different results and strategies that are currently being used to obtain organic electrodes that make them competitive with lithium-ion batteries for such applications.
