In this work, we used the mixed solution of manganese acetate and sodium sulfate to deposit manganese dioxide on the three-dimensional porous nickel foam that was previously soaked in alcohol, and then the effects of solution concentrations on their capacitance properties were investigated. The surface morphology, microstructure, elemental valence and other information of the material were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. The electrochemical properties of the material were tested by Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Chronoamperometry (CA), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), etc. The MnO2 electrode prepared at lower concentrations can respectively reach a specific capacitance of 529.5 F g-1 and 237.3 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 and 10 A g-1, and after 2000 cycles, the capacity retention rate was still 79.8% of the initial capacitance, and the energy density can even reach 59.4 Wh Kg-1, while at the same time, it also has a lower electrochemical impedance (Rs = 1.18 , Rct = 0.84 ).
