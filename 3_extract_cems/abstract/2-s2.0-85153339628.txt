This study presents the development of a high-performance supercapacitor based on a porous zinc metal–organic framework-based electrode (Zn-MOF). The Zn-MOF was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence, and UV–vis spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements were used to investigate the performance of the Zn-MOF-based supercapacitor. The results show that the Zn-MOF-based electrode exhibits a high energy density of 5.213 Wh kg−1, a high power density of 479.96 W kg−1, and a capacitance of 58.6F g−1. This work provides a unique strategy for fabricating transition metal–organic framework materials and utilizing them as a potential application for high-performance supercapacitors.
