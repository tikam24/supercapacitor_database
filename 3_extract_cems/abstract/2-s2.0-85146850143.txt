Despite the fact that electronics over the past decades has been developing with great intensity. Modern industry needs to master new high-tech solutions to create efficient power-supply systems and energy storage devices for high reliability equipment. Various fields of science and technology are increasingly faced with tasks that require the use of accurate and stable devices. In this regard, there is a problem of assessing the quality and performance of electronic components in real operating conditions. The main purpose of this article is to assess the feasibility of incoming quality control of chemical current sources using the example of supercapacitors. The article presents an experimental method for determining the main characteristics of storage devices by conducting controlled charge-discharge cycles. Seven different supercapacitor fabricators participated in the experiment The studies were carried out using a specially designed hardware-software complex. The results obtained in the course of measurements and calculations show the importance of quality control of supercapacitors.
