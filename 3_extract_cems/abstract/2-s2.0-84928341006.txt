This paper presents a hybrid energy storage system (HES) composed of battery and ultracapacitor. Regenerative braking energy recovery can be effectively achieved with this system combining permanent magnet synchronous motor driving system. The performance of the battery and ultracapacitor is significantly different in the HES, and thus reasonable distribution between battery and ultracapacitor for output or input of energy is needed. In order to realize the allocation strategies of the HES, it should be connected to DC link through appropriate power electronic interface. Detailed analysis is carried out in respect of energy recovery system based on power electronic interface circuit and the energy load distribution scheme in this paper. The simulation is done on Matlab/Simulink, and then results prove that the HES works well.
