The paper presents an analytical model for sizing supercapacitors as part of a hybrid power supply. The load is assumed to be modeled by its power over time requirements. Approximating the theoretical curve as combinations of constant and linearly increasing power segments equations are obtained for the supercapacitor current as a function of its initial and final voltage. This allows for sizing the supercapacitor for wide variety of application. The model is verified by means of simulation and experimental results.
