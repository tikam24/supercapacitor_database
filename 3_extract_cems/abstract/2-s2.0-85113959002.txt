Polypyrrole film was electrodeposited onto nickel alloy and stainless-steel substrates to be assessed as a supercapacitor electrode. Double layer supercapacitor electrodes were electrochemically characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and charge/discharge. It was observed that the polypyrrole electrodeposited onto stainless steel and nickel alloy electrodes provided an outstanding specific capacitance of 1400 F/g and 1030 F/g and energy density of 583.33 Wh/kg and 429.16 Wh/kg, respectively. The electrode structure and morphological properties of polypyrrole films was studied by the scanning electron microscope.
