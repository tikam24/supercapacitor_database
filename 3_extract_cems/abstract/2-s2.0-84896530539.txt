We discuss the theoretical approaches for various electrochemical capacitor systems via performance-potential estimation in regard to specific energy and power densities. Typical energy storage systems, such as symmetric capacitor system and asymmetric capacitor system, are classified with the symmetry of the electrodes (symmetric/asymmetric), and the types of electrolytes (aqueous/organic). Energy and power densities of each system are theoretically calculated using various factors and coefficients for performance comparison. Then, theoretical modeling for the BatCap system is conducted to indicate the electrochemical performance of this new concept device followed by consideration of ideal structure of the BatCap electrode material. Conclusively, this study successively indicates the performance of each energy storage system depending on the specified conditions of the electrodes and electrolyte which consist of the energy storage systems.
