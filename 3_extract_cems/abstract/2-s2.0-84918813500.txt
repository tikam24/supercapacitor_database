Titanate nanotube with functional hydroxyl groups and high specific surface area is synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition. Then, hydrous ruthenium oxide-titanate nanotube matrix is constructed simultaneously with hydrous ruthenium oxide molecules come into being. Based on the as-prepared matrix, a supercapacitor is fabricated and the electrochemical properties are explored. The charge specific capacitance reaches 462 F/g at the power density of 5.6 W/g. The capacitor also exhibits a good cycling performance, significant power character and keeps up more than 90% when the power density elevated from 5.6 W/g to 56 W/g. The obtained results reveal that hydrous ruthenium oxide-titanate nanotube is an ideal material for supercapacitor because of its matrixstructure and 1-D titanate nanotube, which enhance the utilization of hydrous ruthenium oxide and improve the power character of the composite.
