In this paper, the effects on specific capacitance and other electrical properties of supercapacitor electrodes synthesized with different hydrothermal growth time are discussed. Carbon nanotubes/nickel hydroxide hybrid electrodes were proposed via a low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis method. The concentration of nickel hydroxide set to 0.5 M and a hydrothermal reaction time of 30 min, exhibited a high specific capacitance of 912.22 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s in a 3 M KOH electrolyte. The CNTs/ Ni(OH)2 also exhibited excellent charge/discharge property with 84% of its specific capacitance kept after 1000 cycles at the current density of 1 A/g.
