The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the strong demand for renewable energy source stimulate the development of energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Supercapacitors have been receiving intensive attention from research and development to industrialization due to their great potential to meet the demand of both high energy density and power density. As the most frequently used electrode materials for supercapacitors, carbonaceous materials attract more and more interests because of their high surface area, electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and low cost. Furthermore, a carbon electrode should possess an appropriate pore size distribution for fast electrolyte ion transportation. In this chapter, recent progresses on porous nonocarbon-based electrode materials for supercapacitor applications are summarized. First, a general introduction is given to several typical supercapacitors, including electrical double layer (EDL) capacitors, pseudo-supercapacitors, asymmetrical supercapacitors, and micro-supercapacitors. Then the impact of the specific surface area and pore size on the performance of EDL capacitors is analyzed in detail. In addition, the current status of high performance porous nanocarbon materials for supercapacitors, including activated carbons, templated carbons, carbide-derived carbons, and graphene-based materials, are discussed. These porous nanocarbon materials promise great potential in not only improving the supercapacitor performances but also unraveling the related mechanisms. At the end of this chapter, the future trends of supercapacitors with high energy and power density are proposed.
