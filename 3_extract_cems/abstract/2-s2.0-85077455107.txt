MoS2@C/CNTs is synthesized and applied as electrode of supercapacitors. Few-layer MoS2 nanosheets, with amorphous carbon located at both the surface and interlayers, grow on the CNTs surface and form coaxial nanocable structure MoS2@C/CNTs. The intercalated amorphous carbon broadens interlayer spacing of MoS2 (002) planes, which provides both electron and ions transmission path as well as protection to volume change of MoS2 during electrochemical processes. The MoS2@C/CNTs electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, such as high specific capacitance and excellent cyclic stability. The specific capacitance is 335 F/g at current density of 1 A/g and capacitance retention ratio of 127% is achieved after 40000 cycles.
