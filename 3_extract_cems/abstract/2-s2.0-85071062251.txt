In this study, PPyNT/NiOx nanocomposites were synthesized by simple and fast microwave method. Samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, synthesized PPyNT/NiOx nanocomposites were electrochemically characterized using galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. Results showed the highest specific capacitance of 192 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is significantly higher than that of pristine PPyNT (106 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Surprisingly, the specific capacitance could be further increased by 158% (304 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) after 480 cycles. The cycling stability with nearly 100% of the initial capacitance value over 2000 cycles at 1 A g−1. The composite electrode material has great promise to achieve large-scale industrial production for supercapacitors. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor device based on the PPyNT/NiOx//active carbon showed a maximum gravimetric energy density of 10.74 Wh kg−1 and power density of 0.19 kW kg−1.
