The humic acid/graphene composite material was produced by heating reduction method with hydrazine hydrate using humic acid extracted from lignite and graphene oxide prepared from natural graphite. The morphology and microstructure of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical tests. The results show that the humic acid was uniformly dispersed in the graphene sheet to form a sandwich porous framework structure, which could shorten the path of electrolyte propagation and transportation. When the current density was 50 mA/g, the composite material HRGO-0.1 exhibited high specific capacitance (185 F/g) as an electrode material with low resistivity and a good capacitance ratio.
