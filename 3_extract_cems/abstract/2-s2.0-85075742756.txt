With the advances in the development of next-generation electronics, transparent and stretchable energy storage devices have received great attention due to their suitability for wearable electronics. However, it remains a great challenge to realize devices with high storage capacity and high degree of stretchability. This report describes a simple process for the fabrication of supercapacitors with areal capacitance of ~3.68 mF/cm2 and transmittance of ~60% of with high cycling stability tested over 8000 charging and discharging cycles. Extremely long MnO2/Au nanofiber networks electrode based on electrospinning is fabricated. This structure of the electrode enables the device to be highly stretchable. Additionally, the porous nature of MnO2 as well as the multilayer stacking structure of MnO2/Au nanofibers electrode enhances the areal capacitance of devices. As a prototype device, the supercapacitor in this study suggests a promising application for next-generation energy storage devices in transparent and wearable electronics.
