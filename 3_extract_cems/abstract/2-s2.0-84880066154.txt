An amorphous MnO1.9 thin film was deposited by magnetron sputtering with manganese as the target. The morphology and structure of the deposited MnO1.9 thin film were investigated. The MnO1.9 thin film presented amorphous structure in X-ray diffraction measurement. In transmission electron microscopy, it was revealed that the MnO1.9 particles distributed homogenously on the copper substrate and the diameters of particles were less than 10 nm. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatical discharge-charge curves indicated that the MnO1.9 thin film had regular capacitive behaviors and delivered a maximum capacitance of 50.2 mF/cm2 μm and 23.3 mF/cm2 μm under 0.1 mA/cm 2 and 1.0 mA/cm2 current densities, which demonstrated that the amorphous MnO1.9 thin film was a potential good electrode material for supercapacitor application. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
