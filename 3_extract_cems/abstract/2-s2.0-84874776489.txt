The purpose of this work was to investigate and improve the performance of supercapacitor cells with carbon-based nanocomposite electrodes. The electrode structure comprised activated carbon (AC), four types of multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs) and two alternative polymer binders, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Electrode fabrication involved various stages of mixing and dispersion of the AC powder and carbon nanotubes, rolling and coating of the AC/MWNT/binder paste on an aluminium substrate which also served as current collector. The organic electrolyte utilised was 1M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) fully dissolved in propylene carbonate (PC). All devices were of the electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC) type, incorporating four layers of tissue paper as separator material. The surface topography of the so fabricated electrodes was investigated with scanning electrode microscopy (SEM). Overall cell performance was evaluated with a multi-channel potentiostat/galvanostat/impedance analyser. Each supercapacitor cell was subjected to Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) at various scan rates from 0.01 V/s to 1 V/s, Charge-Discharge at a fixed current steps (2 mA) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) with frequency range from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. It was established that an AC-based supercapacitor with 0.15%w/w MWNT content and 30 μm roll-coated, nanocomposite electrodes provided superior energy and power and energy densities while the cells was immersed in the electrolyte; well above those generated by the AC-based EDLC cells. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
