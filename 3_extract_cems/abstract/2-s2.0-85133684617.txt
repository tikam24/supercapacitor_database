The key to improving the energy density of supercapacitors is to enhance the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials by optimizing the preparation process and rationally designing the material structure. In this work, hexagonal Co3O4 are derived by calcination of the precursors in the air, which are used as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. The specific capacity of the hexagonal Co3O4 electrode reaches 216.4 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. It is worth mentioning that it achieves a capacity retention rate of 112.5% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.5%, after 10,000 cycles.
