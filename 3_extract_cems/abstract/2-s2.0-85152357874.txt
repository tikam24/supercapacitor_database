In this article, we describe the design of a flexible solid-state hybrid supercapacitor (FSSHSC) using mixed metal telluride NiLaTe microfibers (MFs) atop Ni foam (NF). The goal of the study is to examine the effect of counter metal ions Ni and La, in addition to Te, in the formation of longer one-dimensional (1-D) architecture. The NiTe MFs and La2Te3 microrods (MRs) were synthesized and compared with bimetallic telluride. La exhibit's slower reaction kinetics than Ni when reacting with Te due to the different crystal structural stability of La2Te3 (cubic phase) and Te (hexagonal phase). Three-electrode investigations incorporating aqueous potassium ferrocyanide (KFC) reveal that the electrochemical performance of NiLaTe MFs is doubled compared to the typical aqueous KOH electrolyte alone. The presence of the redox pair [Fe(CN)6]3−/[Fe(CN)6]4− allows for faster ion transport inside the active electrode surface, which improves electrochemical performance. The FSSHSC device was fabricated, comprising NiLaTe as the positive, activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode, and PVA-KOH-KFC gel, which acts as an electrolyte and a separator. The device performance was compared to that of a liquid system as well as one without a redox additive gel system. The significance of polymer-based gel and KFC for device construction is briefly reviewed. The final built device NiLaTe//AC in gel + KFC system has a maximum areal capacity of 65.6 μAh cm−2 (60.0 mA h g−1) at a current density of 2 mA cm−2, a maximum energy density of 45.5 Wh Kg−1 (52.36 μWh cm−2), and a maximum power density of 5488.7 W Kg−1(6312.0 μW cm−2). Furthermore, the device outperforms the cyclic stability for 10,000 cycles with an 80.1 % capacity retention and exhibits excellent flexibility at different bending angles. The assembled FSSHSCs device successfully illuminates an LED bulb for 70 s.
