Current paper presents the design and construction method for a supercapacitor stack starting from energy requirement for a certain application. Relaying on catalog specifications, computations are performed in order to establish the necessary number of capacitor cells and their disposal. Voltage balancing circuits are analyzed for series connected supercapacitor groups. Electrical characteristics of the obtained module are presented when using a balancing circuit with rectifier diodes. Obtained results are compared with design requirements. Â©2010 IEEE.
