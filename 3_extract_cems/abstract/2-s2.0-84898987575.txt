Highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (NPs) and abundant functional N-species were integrated into ultrathin carbon nanosheets by using a facile and economical sol-gel route. Embedded- and anchored-type configurations were achieved for the dispersion of Ni NPs in/on N-rich carbon nanosheets. The anchored-type composite exhibited outstanding pseudocapacitance of 2200 Fg -1 at 5 Ag-1 with unusual rate capability and extraordinary cyclic stability over 20000 cycles with little capacitance decay. Aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors fabricated with this composite cathode demonstrated a high energy density of 51.3 Whkg-1 at a relatively large power density of 421.6 Wkg-1, along with outstanding cyclic stability. This approach opens an attractive direction for enhancing the electrochemical performances of metal-based supercapacitors and can be generalized to design high-performance energy-storage devices.
