The bridge molecule thiourea (TU) enforced polyaniline (PANI) growing on activated carbon fiber (ACF) is applied to synthesize polyaniline-thiourea-activated carbon fiber (PANI-TU-ACF) through surface activation, hydrothermal treatment and electrochemical deposition processes for wearable braidable-supercapacitor. Experimental measurement and theoretical calculation demonstrate that PANI-TU-ACF involves amide bonding interface between ACF and TU and hydrogen bonding interface between TU and PANI, thus confirming the formation of bridging structure. The absorption spectrum red-shift of N–H vibration peak keeps in agreement with the declined bonding energy of N–H bond achieved by partial atom potential simulation calculation, which proves the formation of hydrogen bonding in PANI-TU-ACF. PANI-TU-ACF exhibits larger N(E) value and lower HOMO-LUMO energy gap than PANI-ACF, indicating its higher electrical conductivity. PANI-TU-PANI shows more lowered interface energy than PANI-ACF, suggesting its higher stability. PANI-TU-ACF electrode delivers excellent capacitance of 563.8F/g at 1 A/g and cycling stability of 89.1 % for 2000 cycles. Wearable braidable-supercapacitor based on PANI-TU-ACF electrode delivers energy density of 62.9 Wh kg−1 at power density of 800 W kg−1, maintains high capacitance retention of 90.13 % after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The interfacial bonding strengthened PANI-TU-ACF with excellent performance displays potential in wearable supercapacitors.
