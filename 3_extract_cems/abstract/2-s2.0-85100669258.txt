The hierarchical ultrathin nanostructures are excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their large surface area and their ability to promote ion and electron transport. Herein, we investigated nine l-amino acids (LAs) as inductive agents to synthesize a series of CoNi-OH/LAs materials for energy storage. With the different amino acids, the assembled CoNi-OH/LAs form a lamellar, flower-shaped, and bulk structure. Among all materials, the ultrathin flowerlike CoNi2-OH/l-asparagine (CoNi2-OH/l-Asn) exhibits an excellent specific capacity of 405.4 mAh g-1 (2608 F g-1) and a 100% retention rate after 3000 cycles. We also assembled asymmetrical supercapacitor CoNi2-OH/l-Asn//N-rGO devices, which demonstrated an energy density of 64.9 Wh kg-1 at 799.9 W kg-1 and superlong cycling stability (82.4% at 10 A g-1) over 5000 cycles.
