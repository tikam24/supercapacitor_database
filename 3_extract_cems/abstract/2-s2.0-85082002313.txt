MnO2 and MnO2-based composites have been considered as the best potential electrode materials for supercapacitors due to various advantages such as high theoretical specific capacitance, wide potential window, less corrosion issues, low cost, and eco-friendliness. However, their applications are limited by reason of poor electrical conductivity leading to lowering of electrochemical performance. Incorporation of noble metal nanoparticles to the MnO2-based active materials is a prospective approach to solve this problem. In this chapter, we review the hybridization of MnO2 with noble metals nanoparticles (Ag nanoparticles and Au nanoparticles). Effect of nanohybrids on the properties of MnO2-based materials as well as electrodes will be discussed.
