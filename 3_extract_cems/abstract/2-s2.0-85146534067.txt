Graphene has recently received a great deal of attention as a result of the remarkable properties it possesses. In the scientific literature, numerous applications for graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been reported. These studies give way for the exploration and development of graphene-based materials that can be used in industry in a broad variety of new and exciting ways. By conducting a thorough analysis of the recent literature based on graphene based technologies, it is important to discuss compositions of materials and draw attention to the most promising results and applications that have been developed. In this article, a wide range of graphene-based composites, as well as their methods of preparation, and applications, in photocatalysts, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries, are discussed.
