Energy security is the topmost priority for an individual as well as the governments. As of now, the energy i.e., chemical energy, solar energy, thermal energy, and others are stored in batteries. But there are some limitations for the storing and using the energy from batteries. They have higher energy density but lower power density. To overcome this problem, we can consider the properties exhibited by the supercapacitor. This supercapacitor is the advanced version of a capacitor that has high power density and comparable energy density to cater to the fast charging and discharging operations. In this paper, the history, evolution, fabrication, evaluation, and applications of supercapacitors are analysed along with the difference of Supercapacitors with batteries, capacitors, and fuel cells. With the supercapacitors, energy storage problems can be solved in the electronic devices and its usage in various sectors.
