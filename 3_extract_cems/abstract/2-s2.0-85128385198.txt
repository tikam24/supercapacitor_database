To improve system efficiency and reduce the risk of working life reduction caused by the adverse operation conditions of fuel cell, an adaptive Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) energy management strategy with the fuel cell performance degradation consideration was proposed for the fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid power system in the city bus. The off-line PMP energy distributions of the fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid power system in five different driving conditions were analyzed, and the relation between the initial value of the costate variable and the difference of state variable of the energy management system, i.e., the state-of-charge difference of the supercapacitor, between the beginning and the end, was obtained. The corresponding relation between the initial value of the costate for online PMP and state-of-charge could be interpolated. Integrating with the normal equation of the PMP, the instant costate variable was obtained, and thus the adaptively updating costate variable in the online PMP leading to keep up state-of-charge could be formulated. Choosing the fuel cell performance degradation, the power change rate, number of start-stop, and maximal power of the fuel cell as the constraints of the energy management system, the fuel cell power change rate was further formulated as a penalty term in the cost function of the adaptive PMP to meet the energy management constraints as well as achieve better fuel economy. The controller hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation test was carried out to validate the practical efficacy of the proposed energy management strategy.Research results show that, under the bus condition SC03 and New York City cycle condition (NYCC) that are different from the costate variable formulation used typical operation conditions, the adaptive PMP energy management can make the terminal state-of-charge approach the target value, and compared with the off-line PMP, the losses of fuel economy are only 1.27% and 0.94%, respectively. Under the China bus driving cycle (CBDC) comprehensive test condition that is different from the operation conditions used for the costate determination and cost function weighting adjustment, the proposed adaptive optimal energy management strategy can implement the energy distributions of fuel cell and supercapacitor under the provided constraints, and the fuel economy can keep up 90.76% compared with the off-line optimization. Under the CBDC and NurembergR36 test conditions, the average errors between HIL and numerical simulations are less than 5%. Consequently, the proposed adaptive optimal energy management strategy considering the performance degradation of fuel cell can implement the high operation of the hybrid power system with the potential of a long working life.
