Nanocrystalline cobalt oxide material has been successfully synthesized via ultrasonication-precipitation method. The obtained material shows the cubic phase and spherical size agglomerated morphology as confirmed by the powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy measurement. The electrochemical performance of the modified electrode has been analyzed systematically. The electrode material exhibits higher specific capacitance of 530 F/g at 1 A/g current density in 1M KOH electrolyte, which is a potential electrode material for charge storage (pseduocapacitor) applications.
