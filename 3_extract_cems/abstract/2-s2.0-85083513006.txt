A high production efficiency synthesis method was used to produce a stacked vanadium nitride nanoparticle structure with an inexpensive raw material as an anode material and high surface area polystyrene was used the cathode material for lithium ion hybrid capacitors. The Li-HCs cell displayed an excellent specific capacitance of 64.2 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.25 A·g-1 and a wide potential window of 0.01 to 3.5 V. Furthermore, the device exhibited a high energy density of 109.3 W·h·kg-1 at a power density of 512.3 W·kg-1 and retained an energy density of 69.2 W·h·kg-1 at a high power density of 3 498.9 W·kg-1 at 2 A·g-1. Due to the short synthesis time and simple raw materials, this method is suitable for industrial production.
