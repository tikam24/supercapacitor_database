A special family of polymers known as conducting polymers (CPs) is able to carry charge via conjugated double bonds. CPs are intricate dynamic structures that capture the interest of those working in the field of intelligent materials. Electrical stimulation can cause significant changes in the electrical, mechanical, and chemical features of CPs. Nanocomposites made of CPs have been used in sensors, batteries, flexible electronics, and supercapacitors (SCs). A supercapacitor is a device used to store electrical charge through electrostatic and electrochemical processes. They have the potential to replace conventional batteries and capacitors. They have been used in the automotive, railways, military, renewable, and power industries. The development of electrical parameter models, reliability testing, and industry norms are all challenges that SCs are now dealing with. In this article, the introduction of supercapacitors (SCs), the potential of different types of CPs-based nanocomposite materials in the electrode material of SCs, current studies, future perspectives, opportunities, and challenges have been discussed.
