In this study, we designed mixed metal oxides with doping compound nano-constructions as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). We successfully prepared the Fe-dopant with NiCoOx grown on nickel foam (Fe-dopant@NiCoOx@NF) through a simple hydrothermal route with annealing procedures. This method provides an easy route for the preparation of high activity SCs for energy storage. Obtained results revealed that the Fe dopant has successfully assisted NiCoOx lattices. The electrochemical properties were investigated in a three-electrode configuration. As a composite electrode for SC characteristics, the Fe-dopant@NiCoOx@NF exhibits notable electrochemical performances with very high specific capacitances of 1965 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, and even higher at 1296 F g−1 and 30 A g−1, respectively, which indicate eminent and greater potential for SCs. Moreover, the Fe-dopant@NiCoOx@NF nanoneedle composite obtains outstanding cycling performances of 95.9% retention over 4500 long cycles. The improved SC activities of Fe-dopant@NiCoOx@NF nanoneedles might be ascribed to the synergistic reactions of the ternary mixed metals, Fe-dopant, and the ordered nanosheets grown on NF. Thus, the Fe-dopant@NiCoOx@NF nanoneedle composite with unique properties could lead to promising SC performance.
