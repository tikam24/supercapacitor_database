When a dump truck brakes, it is difficult to effectively absorb the braking energy due to the transient mutation of braking energy. At the same time, braking energy production is too high to store easily. Focusing on these problems, this paper proposes a new type of two-stage series supercapacitor and battery (SP&B) hybrid energy storage system (ESS). Using the characteristics of supercapacitors, which can charge and discharge quickly with large currents, the system combines the supercapacitors with a battery with a high energy storage capacity. This allows sudden large currents to be absorbed and released rapidly, while large amounts of energy can be stored. This system can also reduce the charge and discharge times of the SP&B to meet the working requirements of dump truck braking while improving the service life of the system. After completion of the research and implementation of the proposed SP&B hybrid ESS, a laboratory dynamic model was set up as an experimental platform and vehicle operation experiments were performed. The obtained results show that the energy recovery efficiency of the hybrid ESS can reach 53.5%, which can realize both security and stability for dump truck braking energy recovery and utilization (BER&U) systems.
