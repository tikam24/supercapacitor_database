MOFs (metal-organic frameworks) are ideal precursors for constructing hierarchical structures utilized for energy storage, gas separation/capture, and waste adsorption. ZIF-67, a widely used MOF, can be converted to a Ni-Co-LDH battery-type electrode in Ni(NO3)2ethanol solution for supercapacitor application. Herein, ZIF-67 was treated with Ni(NO3)2ethanol solution at different soaking time periods. All products exhibited hierarchically porous hollow nanocages and were characterized to illustrate the conversion process and the effects of ZIF-residuals on the electrode performance. The results indicated that the ZIF residuals drastically influenced the ionic diffusion efficiency of electrolyte ions within the electrode and faradaic resistance between the electrolyte/electrode interfaces. The optimized Ni-Co-LDH-4.5 h electrode presented a remarkable charge storage behavior with a specific capacity of 732 C g−1at the current density of 1 A g−1and maintained its 68.3% capacitance (500 C g−1) at 25 A g−1. The fabricated all-solid state asymmetric supercapacitor presented a remarkable energy density of 45.33 W h kg−1at the power density of 395.13 W kg−1. The cycling test indicated that 78.55% of the initial capacitance was retained after 8000 cycles, illustrating the remarkable long-life performance.
