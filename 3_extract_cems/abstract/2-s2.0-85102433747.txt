Lithium-Ion Capacitor (LIC), a hybrid energy storage device, is believed to be an ideal option for energy storage device applications due to its properties with high specific energy and high specific power. In this study, LIC's cathode material is made of activated carbon derived from sugarcane bagasse prepared by the carbonization process at 500OC for 60 minutes and activation process utilizing KOH as an activating agent at varying temperatures and varying ratios of carbon to KOH mass. This paper also compares the material characteristic and electrochemical performance. In this paper, full cells of LIC are fabricated using activated carbon as the cathode material and LTO as the anode material. Sugarcane bagasse activated carbons are characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET). The electrochemical performance of LIC is obtained from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (CD). Sugarcane bagasse activated carbon (SBAC) produces a high specific surface area with values from 1095 m2/g to 3554 m2/g. The assembled LIC can produce a maximum specific capacitance of 31.94 F/g, the highest specific energy of 35.49 Wh/kg, and high specific power of 2954.36W/kg.
