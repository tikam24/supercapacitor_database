MXene, a new member from 2D materials possesses high conductivity, large interlayer spacing, hydrophilic nature and large surface area. An approach to synthesize 2D MXene from its precursor "MAX" is proposed at room temperature. MAX belongs to the family of ternary layered carbides and nitrides. A proof of successful etching of aluminium from MAX and exfoliation of MXene is illustrated. Characterizations such as SEM and XRD for microstructures and structural changes are performed to confirm the etching of A layer. From the benefits of large interlayer spacing between M and X layer of MXene, multi-layered MXene is further delaminated to few layered MXene sheets using organic polymer DMSO. The possibility of synthesising MXene from liquid phase exfoliation can be further used in supercapacitor application.
