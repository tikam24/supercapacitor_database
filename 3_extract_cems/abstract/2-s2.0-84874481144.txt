A large scale of wind power integration can have negative impacts on the power grid due to randomness of wind power. How to smooth out the fluctuation of wind power using energy storage device has made improvements recently. The deficiencies in smoothing wind power fluctuation with single type of energy storage device are analyzed. A hybrid energy storage system consisting of supercapacitor and storage battery group is designed accordingly, and the control scheme for this hybrid system is also proposed to realize power smoothing. The proposed control scheme divides compensation power signal into a high-frequency signal and a low-frequency signal. In this way, the deficiencies in smoothing wind power fluctuation with single type of energy storage device can be made up to a certain extent. Besides, the dispatching expectation is taken into account in the smoothing process. Simulation results show that the designed hybrid energy storage system and proposed control scheme can smooth out the wind power fluctuation properly.
