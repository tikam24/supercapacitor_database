In this study, a rapid, facile, and environment-friendly microwave-assisted method followed by annealing for synthesizing the quasi-cuboidal CoV2O6 is developed. The as-prepared samples manifest high supercapacitor properties with a specific capacitance of 223 F g-1, good rate capability, and superior cycle stability, retaining 123.3% capacitance when the number of cycles reaches 15,000 after determined by electrochemical tests. More importantly, the quasi-cuboidal CoV2O6 for the first time is introduced into the supercapacitor as a kind of electrode material. The superior electrochemical performance of the quasi-cuboidal CoV2O6 will render the metal vanadium oxides as new and attractive active material for promising application in supercapacitors.
