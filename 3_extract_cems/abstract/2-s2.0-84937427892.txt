For the purpose to solve the problem that the standard PSO has disadvantages such as earliness, easily trapped in local best and low searching precision, the improved simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) algorithm were proposed based on particle swarm optimization algorithm that fusing simulated annealing algorithm, and which is applied to capacity optimization of hybrid energy storage units in wind/solar generation system. The optimization results showed that the algorithm can effectively reduce improvement of the investment and operation cost of hybrid storage unit under the prerequisite for satisfying the load demand, and the correctness and validity of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated.
