The hierarchical Ni3(PO4)2/Co3(PO4)2 nanocomposites were fabricated by one step hydrothermal technique via immersing Ni2+ and Co2+ with PO43-. Varing the cations, e.g., Na2HPO4, K2HPO4 and (NH4)2HPO4, the morphological changes of leaf, rod and platelet morphology of prepared nanocomposites were observed due to the Kirkendall effect modifying the nanomaterial structure via interdiffusion of transition metal atoms with phosphate ions source. The developed bimental phosphates displayed enhanced activity in dye degradation and supercapacitive performance. The Ni3(PO4)2/Co3(PO4)2 composite as an effective catalyst was applied for degradation of Rhodamine B by PMS activation. The maximum dye degradation efficiency was about 97% after 40 min. The prepared composite effectively produced sulfate radicals even after fifth cycle. In addition, the cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance analysis were investigated in 1 M Na2SO4 neutral electrolyte. The electrochemical investigations clearly indicated the Ni3(PO4)2/Co3(PO4)2 composites enhanced super capacitive performance with good stability nature. Hence, the bi-functional activities of Ni3(PO4)2/Co3(PO4)2 have the potential candidate to the water purification and energy storage applications.
