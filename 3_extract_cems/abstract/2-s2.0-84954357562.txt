Herringbone, platelet, and tubular carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were synthesized by catalytic chemical vapor deposition using methane, propane, and ethylene as carbon precursors. Alumina-supported nickel and iron catalysts were used for the syntheses. The resultant CNFs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen sorption at 77 K. The performance of a CNF-based supercapacitor working in 6 mol L−1 KOH was analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the CNFs ranged between 150 and 296 m2 g−1. An increase in the CNF diameter was accompanied by a decrease in the BET surface area. A comparison of the porous textures and the structure types of the CNFs demonstrated that the performance of the CNF-based supercapacitor is enhanced primarily by the exposed edges of the graphitic layers on the CNF surface, followed by the specific surface area. Among the studied CNFs, the highest capacitance value, 26 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, was obtained for the platelet-type CNFs. Tubular CNFs exhibited the lowest capacitance value, which increased from 4 to 33 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 upon air treatment at 450 °C. The presence of exposed graphitic edges on the air-treated CNT surface and an increase in the specific surface area are considered to be responsible for the enhancement of the capacitor performance.
