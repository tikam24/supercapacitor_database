Supercapacitors have gained significant attention as energy storage devices due to their high specific power, fast chargeâ€“discharge rate and extended cycling stability. Recent research focuses on the search for new electrode materials to enhance the specific capacitance of supercapacitors. Conducting polymers (CPs) and metal oxides (MOs) are being extensively tested as electrode materials in supercapacitors. CPs have poor cycling stability and low mechanical strength but are easy to process, while MOs exhibit easy availability, variable oxidation states and possess high specific capacitance, but they are somewhat difficult to process. Therefore, combining both (CP) and (MO) in a composite offers better results for the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. This review mainly focuses on the discussion of CP/MO based nanocomposites recently reported for supercapacitor applications. The collective information presented in this report will provide researchers a view into the latest developments in this field. The continued research on this topic will reveal further potential applications of CP/MO composites.
