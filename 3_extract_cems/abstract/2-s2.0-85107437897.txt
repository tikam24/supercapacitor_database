We report a template method by rationally designing a self-supported Ni3S2 nanosheet-wrapped ZnO nanorod (Ni3S2@ZnO) standing vertically on Ni foam surface. In this work, an organic molecule of 2-methylimidazole (2-MI) using as a structural director, which is commonly used in metal–organic frameworks(MOFs), has been adopted to link those Ni3S2 nanosheets forming a shear-wall structure. This special morphology with multi-dimension (2D with 1D) exhibits advantages on the high capacitance of about 3546 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Besides this, Ni3S2@ZnO can deliver an extraordinarily capacitance of 1872 F g−1 even at a high current density of 25 A·g−1, which in the meantime displayed a good capacity retention of 70.3% after 10,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor was then constructed, performing a quite stable capacitance of about 197 F g−1 at a high current density of 15 A g−1 for 5000 cycles and a sufficient energy density of 140 Wh kg−1, which proves its potential on lighting up six red LEDs in practical usage.
