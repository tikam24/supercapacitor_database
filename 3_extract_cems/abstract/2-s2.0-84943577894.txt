Wireless power transmission is one of the few viable techniques to power up implantable medical devices (IMDs) across the skin without any direct electrical contact between the energy source and the IMD. There are also other wirelessly powered applications with various levels of power requirements from nanowatts in wireless sensors and radiofrequency identification (RFID) tags, milliwatts in near-field communication (NFC), watts in mobile electronics, and kilowatts in electric vehicles. High power transfer efficiency (PTE), robustness against nearby objects and coil misalignments, and extended power transfer range are highly desired in all of these applications.
