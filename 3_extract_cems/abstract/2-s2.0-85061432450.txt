2D MXene materials are of considerable interest for future energy storage. A MXene film could be used as an effective flexible supercapacitor electrode due to its flexibility and, more importantly, its high specific capacitance. However, although it has excellent electronic conductivity, sluggish ionic kinetics within the MXene film becomes a fundamental limitation to the electrochemical performance. To compensate for the relative deficiency, MXene films are frequently reduced to several micrometer dimensions with low mass loading (<1 mg cm −2 ), to the point of detriment of areal performance and commercial value. Herein, for the first time, the design of a 3D porous MXene/bacterial cellulose (BC) self-supporting film is reported for ultrahigh capacitance performance (416 F g −1 , 2084 mF cm −2 ) with outstanding mechanical properties and high flexibility, even when the MXene loading reaches 5 mg cm −2 . The highly interconnected MXene/BC network enables both excellent electron and ion transport channel. Additionally, a maximum energy density of 252 µWh cm −2 is achieved in an asymmetric supercapacitor, higher than that of all ever-reported MXene-based supercapacitors. This work exploits a simple route for assembling 2D MXene materials into 3D porous films as state-of-the-art electrodes for high performance energy storage devices.
