With the increasing energy demand and the overconsumption of fossil fuels, renewable energy-storage devices with higher efficiency are of great interest. In particular, supercapacitors have recently gained significant attention due to their excellent charge-discharge performance, long-term cycle lifetimes, and high specific power. In addition, supercapacitors could also make up the difference in energy and power between batteries and traditional capacitors. In the future, the promising family of transition metal oxides (TMOs) will play a significant role in environmentally friendly, low-cost, and high-powered energy storage. Furthermore, one-dimensional (1D) and one-dimensional-analogue nanostructures could remarkably enhance the characteristic properties of TMOs. In this review, we focused on the recent progress in the preparation and electrochemical properties of the next-generation supercapacitors.
