This paper proposes a new application of the performance improvement of grid voltage for the double-fed induction generator, the brushless double-fed induction generator and the brushless double-fed reluctance generator. In order to enhance the performance of the wind energy system, three local electrical storage systems are associated with a Li-Ion battery, a supercapacitor and a hybrid rechargeable electrical energy storage. These storage systems can compensate for the variation of the power demand. Also, the fluctuation in the generated electrical energy is occurred due to different wind speed in the wind energy system. The originality of this study inclines in the new application by using the hybrid rechargeable electrical energy storage in the back-to-back converter of wind energy conversion system. The proposed controls are the active-reactive control for rotor side converter, the direct power control for grid side converter to operate the double-fed generators. The performance of the three local electrical storage system shows that the proposed hybrid local storage system has better energy management, higher efficiency and lower total harmonic distortion of the grid voltage.
