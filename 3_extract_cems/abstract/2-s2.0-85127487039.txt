Optimization of novel quaternary composites is requisite to design the highly stable electrodes with excellent specific capacitance for hybrid supercapacitors. In this regard, 2D layered metal dichalcogenide based quaternary composite MoS2/SnS2/reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline-40% (MS/SS/RGO/PANi-40%) has been synthesized by adopting the hydrothermal reaction followed by the in-situ polymerization process of aniline. XRD result of MS/SS/RGO/PANi-40% manifests the mutual occurrence of hexagonal MoS2, SnS2, and RGO along with emeraldine salt form of PANi. SEM micrograph elaborates the interconnection of PANi fibers and clusters of RGO over the hierarchical microspheres of MoS2 and plate-like morphology of SnS2. N2 sorption analysis affirms the mesoporosity of the quaternary composite. The electrochemical results describe that MS/SS/RGO/PANi-40% based electrode owns superb capacitance (986.5 F/g at 30 A/g), exceptional energy (67.1 Wh/kg at 30 A/g), and power (17687.9 W/kg at 50 A/g) through GCD analysis as well as this composite retains capacitance of about 91% after 10,000 continuous cycles at 40 A/g. Moreover, the CV analysis presents the exceptional specific capacitance â‰ˆ 1701.4 F/g at 10 mV/s while the EIS study demonstrates the minimum ohmic resistance. Conclusively, all these superior electrochemical results promote the utilization of this optimized quaternary composite as a proficient and novel electrode for composite hybrid-type supercapacitors.
