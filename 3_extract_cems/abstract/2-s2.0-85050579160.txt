Platanus leaf-based activated carbon (PLAC) was synthesized through high temperature carbonization and KOH chemical activation, using dry platanus leaves as raw materials. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques were used to characterize the morphology, composition, specific surface area and pore size distribution of the PLAC. The cyclic voltammetric (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterizations were performed with a three electrode electrochemical system, to study the supercapacitor electrode performance of the PLAC. The result shows that the PLAC electrode obtained under 800℃ carbonization and KOH chemical activation has specific capacitance of 266 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1, and it can remain 97.0% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles at 5 A·g-1, demonstrating good electrode properties.
