The demand for producing the sustainable energy resources has been efficiently increasing due to the rapid consumption of fossil fuels and world's population explosion. The storage of these resources plays an important role for future generation electronics. The solar energy storage is accomplished by pairing of two distinct devices, (i) the device that captures solar light and converts it into electrical energy such as solar cell/photovoltaic cell, and (ii) the device which stores this produced electrical energy such as electrochemical capacitor or supercapacitor. These two individual devices can be coupled to develop a photovoltaic cell integrated supercapacitor, known as solar electrochemical capacitor, which can be more preferable due to its unique properties like enhanced electrochemical performance giving high specific capacitance, high energy and power density. The present paper mainly reviews the solar electrochemical capacitor development, its present scenario, different active materials used, adapting different synthesis methods, different electrolytes and its performance that gives improved efficiency in a low cost is discussed. Finally, the challenges involved in coupling the individual devices, enhancing specific capacitance, maintain good cyclic stability and future scope is discussed.
