Nanostructured electrodes are at the forefront of advanced materials research, and have been studied extensively in the context of their potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Here, we report on the properties of core-shell (gold-polypyrrole) hybrid nanowires and their suitability as electrodes in electrochemical capacitors and as electrocatalysts. In general, the specific capacitance of electrochemical capacitors can be increased by faradaic reactions, but their charge transfer resistance impedes charge transport, decreasing the capacitance with increasing charge/discharge rate. The specific capacitance of the hybrid electrodes is enhanced due to the pseudocapacitance of the polypyrrole shells; moreover, the electrodes operate as an ideal capacitive element and maintain their specific capacitance even at fast charge/discharge rates of 4690 mA/cm3 and 10 V/s. These rates far exceed those of other types of pseudocapacitors, and are even superior to electric double layer-based supercapacitors. The mechanisms behind these fast charge/discharge rates are elucidated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and are ascribed to the reduced internal resistance associated with the fast charge transport ability of the gold nanowire cores, low ionic resistance of the polypyrrole shells, and enhanced electron transport across the nanowire's junctions. Furthermore, the hybrid electrodes show great catalytic activity for ethanol electro-oxidation, comparable to bare gold nanowires, and the surface activity of gold cores is not affected by the polypyrrole coating. The electrodes exhibit improved stability for electrocatalysis during potential cycling. This study demonstrates that the gold-polypyrrole hybrid electrodes can store and deliver charge at fast rates, and that the polypyrrole shells of the nanowires extend the catalytic lifetime of the gold cores.
