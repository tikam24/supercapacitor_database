Implantation of complex dc-power network is one of the main research topics in more electric aircraft (MEA). In such applications, small and light systems are required and so optimization of passive elements, such as dc-bus capacitance and filtering inductance, is an important issue. It is known that the reduction of dc-bus capacitance may lead to instability of an MVdc network. So, if no stabilizer is used, the risk of instability must be considered, while designing the system passive elements. In this paper, we will first study the small signal stability of an MVdc network composed of three loads: an inverter supplying a permanent magnet synchronous motor, a dc/dc converter feeding a resistive load, and a supercapacitor controlled by a bidirectional dc/dc converter. Then, we will propose a large-signal-stabilizing system to ensure global stability by generating proper stabilizing power references for the whole system. The contribution of the loads to network stability is adjustable. The validity of the proposed method will be confirmed by experimentations. Â© 2011 IEEE.
