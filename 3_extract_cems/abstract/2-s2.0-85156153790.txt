Nowadays, commercial electric double-layer supercapacitors mainly use porous activated carbons due to their high specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. A feature of carbon materials is the possibility of obtaining them from renewable plant biomass. In this study, fungi (Fomes fomentarius) were used as a bio-template for the preparation of carbon fibers via a combination of thermochemical conversion approaches, including a general hydrothermal pre-carbonization step, as well as subsequent carbonization, physical, or chemical activation. The relationships between the preparation conditions and the structural and electrochemical properties of the obtained carbon materials were determined using SEM, TEM, EDAX, XPS, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic measurements, and EIS. It was shown that hydrothermal pretreatment in the presence of phosphoric acid ensured the complete removal of inorganic impurities of raw fungus hyphae, but at the same time, saved some heteroatoms, such as O, N, and P. Chemical activation using H3PO4 increased the amount of phosphorus in the carbon material and saved the natural fungusâ€™s structure. The combination of a hierarchical pore structure with O, N, and P heteroatom doping made it possible to achieve good electrochemical properties (specific capacitance values of 220 F/g) and excellent stability after 25,000 charge/discharge cycles in a three-electrode cell. The electrochemical performance in both three- and two-electrode cells exceeded or was comparable to other biomass-derived porous carbons, making it a prospective candidate as an electrode material in symmetrical supercapacitors.
