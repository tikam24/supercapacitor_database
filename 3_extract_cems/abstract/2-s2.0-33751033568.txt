Novel vehicle technologies are imposing modified requirements to electrical storage systems. These technologies are electrical energy management as well as the various stages of powertrain hybridization. This paper characterizes the associated vehicle attributes. Changed requirements to the electrical stoarge system are derived, in particular: long cycle life, high dynamic charge acceptance particularly for regenerative braking, and robust service life in partial state of charge. The battery technologies under consideration (lead/acid battery with liquid or absorptive glass-fibre mat electrolyte, nickel/metal-hydride battery, lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor) are discussed with respect to their potentials for the various advanced applications. Aside from new cell technologies, growing importance is ascribed to the integration of the storage device into the controls of electrical system and powertrain. This requires, even for 12 Volt lead/acid batteries, complex but cost-optimized battery monitoring systems.
