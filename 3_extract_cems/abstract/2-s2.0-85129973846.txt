Three-dimensional (3D) Mo-doped nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) mesoporous nanostructures on Ni foam were successfully synthesized via the solvothermal method, which showed superior properties for energy storage and conversion. As an electrode for supercapacitors, 3D Mo-doped Ni3S2 mesoporous nanostructures demonstrated a 604.4 Î¼Ah cm-2 specific capacity and good cycling stability. Furthermore, Mo-doped Ni3S2 mesoporous nanostructures exhibited superior hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction properties and good cycle stability for water splitting. At 1.41 V, the electrolyzer made up of Mo-doped Ni3S2 mesoporous nanostructures reached the 10mA cm-2 catalytic current density, demonstrating outstanding long-term durability. Furthermore, the physical characterization results and mechanism of the 3D Mo-doped Ni3S2 were investigated. Therefore, the study presents the great promise of the 3D Mo-doped Ni3S2 mesoporous nanostructures in energy conversion and storage.
