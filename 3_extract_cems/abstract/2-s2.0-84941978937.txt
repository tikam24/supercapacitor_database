Simonkolleite (Zn<inf>5</inf>(OH)<inf>8</inf>Cl<inf>2</inf>Â·H<inf>2</inf>O) nanoplatelets has been deposited on nickel foam-supported graphene by using an efficient microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. The three-dimensional (3D) porous microstructure of the as-fabricated nickel foam-graphene/simonkolleite (NiF-G/SimonK) composite is beneficial to electrolyte penetration and ions exchange, whereas graphene provide improved electronic conductivity. Structural and morphological characterizations confirmed the presence of highly crystalline hexagonal-shaped nanoplatelets of simonkolleite. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) of the NiF-G/SimonK composite revealed that the SimonK nanoplatelets were evenly distributed on the surface of NiF-G and interlaced with each other, resulting in a higher specific surface area of 35.69m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup> compared to SimonK deposited directly on NiF 17.2m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the NiF-G/SimonK composite exhibit a high specific capacitance of 836Fg<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 1Ag<sup>-1</sup>, and excellent rate capability and cycling stability with capacitance retention of 92% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
