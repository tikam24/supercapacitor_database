In this work, cobalt oxide thin films were prepared by electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. The influence of the substrate temperatures on properties of film was investigated. Phase transformation of cobalt oxide thin films due to the effect of different substrate temperature was also observed. Cyclic voltammetry was used to measure the performance of cobalt oxide supercapacitor. At higher substrate temperature, the cobalt oxide thin films exhibit the high specific capacitance due to the effect of phase transformation in cobalt oxide films.
