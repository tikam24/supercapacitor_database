In this paper, a pouch supercapacitor with a structure of mesoporous carbon, ionic liquid (EMIMBF4) and aluminum foam (capacity 40 F) was constructed, and its performance in the 2.7 V, 65â„ƒ, 1500 h aging experiment was evaluated. The capacitance of the supercapacitor attenuates about 10% and the internal resistance increases less than 40% after the 1500 h aging. Its performance is compared with the conventional acetonitrile-based pouch. Although the latter exhibits low initial internal resistance, gases in large amounts are produced and the capacitance attenuation ratio and the internal resistance increase ratio are higher under the high temperature cycling condition, compared to the ionic liquid-based pouch. The above comparison shows that ionic liquid-based electrolyte exhibits excellent cycling performance under the assistance of three dimensional conductive and thermal conductivity structure of aluminum foam. In addition, the advantage of non-toxic, low volatile point of ionic liquids would provide the intrinsic safety as used in enclosed spaces, such as in the elevators of skyscrapers.
