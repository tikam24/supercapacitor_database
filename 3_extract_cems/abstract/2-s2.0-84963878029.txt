This paper discusses electrical performances of the micro supercapacitor such as cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge between two different structure of electrodes. The microsupercapacitor was constructed of Polypyrrole (Ppy) coated nickel electrode as current collector and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as solid state electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the microsupercapacitor such as cyclic voltammetry also typically known as I-V curve and a typical time based charge discharge curve were investigated with different structured of electrode which is interdigital electrode and planar electrode for the same layout. In Comsol Multiphysics ver. 4.2a, the Secondary Current Distribution and Transport of Diluted Species has been selected as the Application module. I-V curve for the micro supercapacitor with the two structured of electrodes was simulated. The transport of a reduced and an oxidized species is described by time-dependent mass transfer principles for diffusion under dilute conditions. The maximum current response for the interdigital electrode is 5.5 A/m and for the planar electrode is 0.025 A/m. For the interdigital electrode, the maximum voltan achieved at 0.5 V same for the planar electrode with different time. Discharging process for interdigital and planar electrode occurred when the value of voltage decreasing and back to zero at 1s and 10 s respectively.
