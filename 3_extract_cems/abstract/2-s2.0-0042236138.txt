The chemical syntheses and properties of seven conducting polymer/polyanion composites are reviewed, and results on the use of two of these materials (PPY/PSS and PEDOT/PSS; PPY = polypyrrole, PSS = poly(styrene-4-sulphonate). PEDOT = poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)) in supercapacitors are presented. Use of a conducting polymer/polyanion supported catalyst in a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell is reported for the first time. Four of the composites (PPY/Nafion, PEDOT/Nafion, polyaniline/PSS and poly(3-methylthiophene)/PSS) are previously unreported as chemically synthesized powders.
