The nanocomposite material was synthesized by sonicating the dispersion of exfoliated graphite (EG) and Zinc nano-particles obtained by roller vibration milling at room temperature. The microstructure of the nanocomposite material (EG/ZnO/Zn) was studied with the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microcopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy (Raman). The results reveal that the composite electrode material contains both Zn and ZnO, which grow on the surface and the interlayer of the exfoliated graphite equably. Rod-like nano ZnO is hexagonal wurtzite structure, about 20 nm in diameter. The capacitive performance of the nano composite is analyzed through cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry tests. The results show sonicated exfoliated graphite; EG/ZnO/Zn composite, as compared with raw exfoliated graphite, exhibit an improved capacitance of 147 F/g with good charge/discharge behavior. While, both the chemisorption of underpotential deposition and the redox reaction compose the pseudocapacitance.
