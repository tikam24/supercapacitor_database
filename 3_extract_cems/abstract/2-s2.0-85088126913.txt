Biomass-based activated carbon material (BAC) is essentially an extraordinary material that can be used for various applications such as wastewater treatment, cancer treatment, energy storage devices and so on. The aim of this study is to synthesize the activated carbon using Deccan Hemp core fiber and to study the surface morphology and electrochemical characterization of the electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Carbonization was done at 400°C for 1 hour in the presence of nitrogen gas with a flow rate of 200ml/minute. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as the activating agent in the synthesis of activated carbon. The carbon obtained after carbonization was impregnated with KOH in the ratio 1:2 (C: KOH) ratio. Activation of the carbon is done at 550 °C for 75 minutes. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results show that the surface area, pore volume and Mean pore diameter were 237.07m2/g, 0.1095cm3/g, and 1.8467nm respectively. SEM Images show the gradual formation of the pores and XRD result indicated the broad diffractions and revealed the amorphous structure. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitor electrodes were studied by using CH Instruments Electrochemical Analyser.
