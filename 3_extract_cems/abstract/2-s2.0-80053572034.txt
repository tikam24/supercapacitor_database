Mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs) with the diameters of 0.5-2.0 μm, main mesopore sizes of 2.6-4.0 nm and specific surface areas of 449-1212 m 2 g -1 are synthesized by a novel hydrothermal emulsion-activated method. The typical MCMs as electrode materials have a specific capacitance of 157 F g -1 at a high current density of 10.0 A g -1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. The resultant MCMs electrode materials with high current charge and discharge capability in 6 M KOH aqueous solution provide important prospect for electrode materials in supercapacitors which could offer high power density for electric vehicles. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
