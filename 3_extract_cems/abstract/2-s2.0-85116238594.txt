A feasible process to synthesize porous graphene with ultra-high surface area is presented in this paper. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from Sri Lankan graphite via the modified hummers method. Then, GO was subjected to a chemical activation process to produce graphene with a mesoporous structure, where KOH was used as the activation agent. The influence of the critical activation process parameters on the specific surface area of graphene was studied. The obtained optimum activated graphene sample showed a high specific surface area of 1602 m2/g. Therefore, it would be a promising material for super capacitor applications.
