Porous nitrogen-doped carbons derived from biomass wastes are considered as promising materials for energy storage devices. Herein, a novel and scalable synthesis route for preparation of these materials from sugarcane bagasse waste is demonstrated. The synthesis process includes a hydrogel intermediate in which delignified bagasse and polyacrylamide networks are interlaced in molecular scale and calcium acetate serves as a hard template within the polymeric chains. After pre-carbonization and chemical activation of the hydrogel, porous nitrogen-doped carbon with high surface area of 1834.3 m2 g−1 and considerable pore volume of 1.03 cm3 g−1 was obtained with nitrogen and oxygen contents of 3.6% and 14.5%, respectively. The fabricated supercapacitor electrode demonstrated high specific capacitance of 241 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density with capacitance retention of 96.5% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g−1. In a symmetrical two-electrode cell, the porous nitrogen-doped carbon demonstrated high energy density of 14.8 W h kg−1 at power density of 1001.6 W kg−1, which is comparable to many nitrogen-doped carbon materials found in the literature.
