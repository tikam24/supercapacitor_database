Carbon nanonets exhibit a tremendous potential as electrode materials for supercapacitor. Herein, we report a facile approach to synthesize crumpled carbon nanonets from anthracene oil by calcium carbonate template strategy coupled with in-situ potassium hydroxide activation. The resultant crumpled carbon nanonets feature net-like structures with hierarchical short pores, possessing a high specific surface area up to 1822 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume up to 4.11 cm3 g−1. As the electrode for symmetric supercapacitor, crumpled carbon nanonet exhibits a high specific capacitance of 266 F g−1 and energy density of 113.1 Wh kg−1 at 0.05 A g−1, and a good cycle stability with 93.6% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at 5 A g−1 in 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ionic liquid electrolyte. This work may provide a novel strategy to prepare the crumpled carbon nanonets for high-performance energy storage devices.
