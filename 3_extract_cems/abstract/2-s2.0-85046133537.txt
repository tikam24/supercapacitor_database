Graphene is a form of carbon that has high electrical conductivity, a planar structure and substantially high surface area, thereby having the potential for more storage of electrostatic charge for high energy supercapacitors (SC). In this paper, the recent developments on the fabrication of graphene by means of photo-reduction of graphene oxide will be overviewed. The main advantage of the photo-process is that it does not rely on the use of chemicals or high temperature. For example, KrF excimer laser irradiation process for the fabrication of N-doped graphene from graphene oxide will be illustrated and the performance of laser reduced N-doped graphene when it is used as electrode active materials in supercapacitors will also be evaluated.
