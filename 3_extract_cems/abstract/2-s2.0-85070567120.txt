Large-size composite carbon nanotubes/polyaniline as supercapacitor electrode material has been investigated for optimization of the areal specific capacitance. Polyaniline, as conductive polymer, is synthesized on the structure of carbon nanotubes by an in situ method. Thicker the composite electrode and higher polyaniline loading increase the gravimetric and volumetric specific capacitance. It is noticeable that this report's areal specific capacitance can reach approximately 6.5 F cm-2.
