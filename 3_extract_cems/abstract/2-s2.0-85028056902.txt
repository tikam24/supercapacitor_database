Hollow Mn–Cu–Al layered triple hydroxides nanocomposite synthesized using microwave assisted technique possess an immense potential as a high performance electrode material for forthcoming generation energy storage warehouse. The layered triple hydroxide nanocomposite structure possesses a furry morphology with mesoporous nature. The electrochemical performance evinces the idiosyncratic architecture with highly mesoporous nature plays a prominent character in achieving high capacitance with superior life cycle stability. This structure not only supports for adequate reaction sites and also speed up electrolyte ions to reach the reacting sites. The Mn–Cu–Al layered triple hydroxide retains 93.46% of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles and having an equivalent series resistance of 0.701 Ω. Prominently, the assembled symmetric solid state supercapacitor device using Mn–Cu–Al layered triple hydroxide delivers a high energy density (101.75 W h kg−1) at a power density of (900 W kg−1). The results show the symmetric supercapacitor made from Mn–Cu–Al layered triple hydroxide nanocomposite to be a propitious candidate for energy storage applications.
