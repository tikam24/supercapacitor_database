This paper presents a microactuator suitable for driving microfluidic valves for biomedical applications, which features zero-energy consumption between actuations with bistate latching. Wireless power transfer based on inductive magnetic field coupling and wireless control over a communication link across the same channel are proposed for the actuator. The actuation is based on electropermanent magnets which combine hard and semi-hard magnets to form an electrically triggered bi-stable latching. A practical actuator is designed and built, which demonstrated that only a short current pulse with a magnitude of 1.7A and width of 120Î¼s is needed to toggle the actuator states. This leads to an energy consumption of 2.5mJ per actuation, and there is no need for power to maintain the states. In addition, a supercapacitor energy buffering circuit is developed to meet the peak current requirement for actuation using a low power rating inductive power supply. The final system is proven to be energy efficient, flexible, and safe for microfluidic applications.
