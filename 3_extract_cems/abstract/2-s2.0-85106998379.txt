Direct current microgrids are attaining attractiveness due to their simpler configuration and high-energy efficiency. Power transmission losses are also reduced since distributed energy resources (DERs) are located near the load. DERs such as solar panels and fuel cells produce the DC supply; hence, the system is more stable and reliable. DC microgrid has a higher power efficiency than AC microgrid. Energy storage systems that are easier to integrate may provide additional benefits. In this paper, the DC micro-grid consists of solar photovoltaic and fuel cell for power generation, proposes a hybrid energy storage system that includes a supercapacitor and lithium–ion battery for the better improvement of power capability in the energy storage system. The main objective of this research work has been done for the enhanced settling point and voltage stability with the help of different maximum power point tracking (MPPT) methods. Different control techniques such as fuzzy logic controller, neural network, and particle swarm optimization are used to evaluate PV and FC through DC–DC boost converters for this enhanced settling point. When the test results are perceived, it is evidently attained that the fuzzy MPPT method provides an increase in the tracking capability of maximum power point and at the same time reduces steady-state oscillations. In addition, the time to capture the maximum power point is 0.035 s. It is about nearly two times faster than neural network controllers and eighteen times faster than for PSO, and it has also been discovered that the preferred approach is faster compared to other control methods.
