The evolution of "smart life,"which connects all internet-of-things (IoT) microdevices and microsensors under wireless communication grids, requires microscale energy storage devices with high power and energy density and long-term cyclability to integrate them with sustainable power generators. Instead of Li-ion batteries with a short lifetime, pseudocapacitors with longer or infinite cyclability and high-power density have been considered as efficient energy storage devices for IoT. However, the design and fabrication of microscale pseudocapacitors have difficulties in patterning microscale electrodes when loading active materials at specific points of the electrodes using conventional microfabrication methods. Here, we developed a facile, one-step fabrication method of micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) through the in situ formation of Co metals and the reduced graphene oxides (rGOs) in a one-pot laser scribing process. The prepared Co/rGO MSC thus exhibited four times higher capacitance than the rGO MSC, due to the Faradaic charge capacitance behavior of the Co/rGO composites.
