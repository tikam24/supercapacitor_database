Nickel oxide nanorods were synthesized simply using Aloe vera extract solution and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction and the morphology of synthesized NiO nanorods were investigated by using of scanning electron microscopy technique. The electrochemical feature and specific capacitance of NiO nanorods were investigated by cyclic voltammetry method, and the results showed the high specific capacitance of NiO nanorods (about 1965 Fg −1 ). Also, the catalytic activity of NiO nanorods on the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry analysis. The results indicated that addition of NiO nanorods increased the heat of decomposition of AP from 450 Jg −1 to 1450 Jg −1 and decreased the temperature of high-temperature decomposition step from 420 °C to about 351 °C. Also, the rate constant (k) enhanced from 5.7(± 0.2) × 10 −3 to 1.4(± 0.2) × 10 −2 s −1 in the presence of NiO nanorods via catalytic path.
