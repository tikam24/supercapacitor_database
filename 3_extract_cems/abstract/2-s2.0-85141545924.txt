In this study, we synthesized 2D-carbyne by a simple chemical route coated on nickel foam. To this carbyne coated nickel foam, FeCo2O4 was grown by the solvothermal process to serve as a nanohybrid electrode for asymmetric supercapacitor applications. This nanohybrid electrode has shown high specific capacitance due to the large surface area, high electrical conductivity and improved rate characteristics. The specific capacitance of FeCo2O4 @Carbyne nanohybrid electrode was about 2584.8 Fg−1 at the current density of 3 Ag−1. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor device assembled using FeCo2O4@Carbyne and activated carbon (FeCo2O4@Carbyne || AC) shows better performance with an energy density of about 93.12 Wh Kg−1 at a high-power density of 2.25 kW kg−1 with a capacitance decay of approximately 26 % even at 5000 cycles. These outcomes provide a new approach for the development of asymmetric supercapacitors with superior characteristics.
