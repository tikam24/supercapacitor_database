This work presents a novel control technique for proportional power sharing among parallel VSCs connected to an islanded Microgrid in a distributed generation system consisting of Photovoltaic (PV) and Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) as two micro-sources. For tracking the maximum solar energy, a Seeker Optimized Fuzzy based Dynamic PI (FSOA-DPI) controller is implemented for the Modified Perturb and Observe MPPT method. Again, for the optimum cost management of the Microgrid system, DPI controller based decentralized Virtual Impedance Drooping (VID) technique is implemented for suitable load sharing between the two hybrid micro-sources. An Energy Storage System (ESS) regulated by FSOA-DPI controller is also proposed for this Microgrid system to ensure the better transient and sub-transient stability during fault occurrence. The dynamic response and stability of the system with proposed method is compared and contrasted with conventional PI controller based method during load sharing for ensuring the robust control under conditions of nonlinear load and faults. The harmonic analysis has been carried out by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the values indicate that the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is well within the prescribed IEEE standard limits. Validation and justification of the improvements achieved by the proposed controller are realized using Matlab/Simulink environment.
