We work and report the synthesis, spectroscopic results, and crystal structure of the title compound (H2L1), in this manuscript. The crystal structure of the title compound was determined using the X-ray diffraction method. This compound crystallized in the monoclinic system, space group P21/c. There is a trans configuration in the molecule, formed according to the C = N bond. The N–H…O, O–H…N hydrogen bond interactions and a weak C–H…π interactions stabilize the molecules in the lattice. The supercapacitive performance of H2L1-modified GCPE electrodes was tested for the first time and resulted in 192.65 F g−1 supercapacitance and 26.76 Wh kg−1 specific energy values at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. It is anticipated that H2L1 contributes the electrochemical performance and will be a very promising material for energy storage applications. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
