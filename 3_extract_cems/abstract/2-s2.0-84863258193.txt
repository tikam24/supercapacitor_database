The fluff (flower pollen) of chinar tree was carbonized to prepare carbon microtubes (CMTs) due to their natural micro-tubular structure. The as-prepared CMTs were well characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The outer diameters of CMTs are in the range of 20~30 μm and the wall thickness is about 1 μm. Many micro- and meso-pores exist in their outer and inner walls, and the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area is 265 m2·g-1. The CMTs were demonstrated to show a typical characteristics of electrochemical double layer capacitance, indicating their potential in supercapacitors.
