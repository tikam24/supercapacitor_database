A novel Î±-MoO3/TiO2 composite electrode material for high performance supercapacitor applications was synthesized using a facile electrodeposition technique. The surface morphology, microstructure, chemical composition and chemical states of the electrode material were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry tests, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were employed to analyze electrochemical behavior. The results demonstrate that a very high capacitance (43.42 mF cm-2) can be achieved at a scan rate of 20 mV s-1 in 1 M aqueous Na2SO4 solution and good capacitance behavior even after 3000 continuous charge-discharge cycles, indicating potential applications as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
