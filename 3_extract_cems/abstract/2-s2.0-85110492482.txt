In this report, we investigated softener use for the exfoliation of graphite and activated graphite to yield Exfoliated Graphite (EG) and Exfoliated Activated Graphite (EAG). As synthesized EAG shows potential application in energy storage devices afterwards. First time, the cirrasol NYP softener was used to exfoliate activated graphite to yield EAG in mild sonication. We got a very good stable dispersion of EAG in water in a concentration up to 10 mg/ml for more than 31 days. After exfoliation, the obtained dispersed EAG used as electrode material in three electrode set up to check the maximum specific capacitance. Using the CV technique, the exfoliated graphite shows a maximum specific capacitance of 118 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate. Whereas, EAG showed maximum specific capacitance of 174.6 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate. It indicates that the EAG is better energy storage material compared to the EG. It can be used in various applications in energy storage devices like supercapacitor.
