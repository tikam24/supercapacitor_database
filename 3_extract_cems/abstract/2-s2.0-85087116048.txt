In this study, a facile one-step calcination-free approach is introduced to synthesize the copper-cobalt oxide octahedron-like structure (CCOOS). The as-prepared CCOOS on carbon fiber electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1737 F g−1 (694.4 C g−1, 192.9 mAh g−1) at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling stability. The excellent supercapacitor performance is ascribed to the electroactive surface of Cu and Co oxide and the fast electron and ion transport in the mesoporous structure. The electrode exhibited a high energy density of 45 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 7727 W kg−1. The reaction involved green synthesis without further post-heat treatment. The successful synthesis was considered to be simple and cost-effective, which supports the viability of this composite as an alternative activated material for high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
