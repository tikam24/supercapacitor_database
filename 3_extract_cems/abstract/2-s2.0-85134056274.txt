Electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices have been swiftly developed in recent years. Stimuli-responsive EES devices that respond to different external stimuli are considered the most advanced EES devices. The stimuli-responsive EES devices enhanced the performance and applications of the EES devices. The capability of the EES devices to respond to the various external stimuli due to produced advanced EES devices that distinguished the best performance and interactions in different situations. The stimuli-responsive EES devices have responsive behavior to different external stimuli including chemical compounds, electricity, photons, mechanical tensions, and temperature. All of these advanced responsiveness behaviors have originated from the functionality and specific structure of the EES devices. The multi-responsive EES devices have been recognized as the next generation of stimuli-responsive EES devices. There are two main steps in developing stimuli-responsive EES devices in the future. The first step is the combination of the economical, environmental, electrochemical, and multi-responsiveness priorities in an EES device. The second step is obtaining some advanced properties such as biocompatibility, flexibility, stretchability, transparency, and wearability in novel stimuli-responsive EES devices. Future studies on stimuli-responsive EES devices will be allocated to merging these significant two steps to improve the performance of the stimuli-responsive EES devices to challenge complicated situations.
