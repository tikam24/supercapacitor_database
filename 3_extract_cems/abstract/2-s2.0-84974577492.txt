Highly dispersed crystalline/amorphous LiFePO4 (LFP) nanoparticles encapsulated within hollow-structured graphitic carbon were synthesized using an in situ ultracentrifugation process. Ultracentrifugation triggered an in situ sol-gel reaction that led to the formation of core-shell LFP simultaneously hybridized with fractured graphitic carbon. The structure has double cores that contain a crystalline LFP (core 1) covered by an amorphous LFP containing Fe3+ defects (core 2), which are encapsulated by graphitic carbon (shell). These core-shell LFP nanocomposites show improved Li+ diffusivity thanks to the presence of an amorphous LFP phase. This material enables ultrafast discharge rates (60 mA h g-1 at 100C and 36 mA h g-1 at 300C) as well as ultrafast charge rates (60 mA h g-1 at 100C and 36 mA h g-1 at 300C). The synthesized core-shell nanocomposites overcome the inherent one-dimensional diffusion limitation in LFP and yet deliver/store high electrochemical capacity in both ways symmetrically up to 480C. Such a high rate symmetric capacity for both charge and discharge has never been reported so far for LFP cathode materials. This offers new opportunities for designing high-energy and high-power hybrid supercapacitors.
