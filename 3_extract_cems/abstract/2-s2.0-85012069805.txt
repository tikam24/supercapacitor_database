A unipolar pulse electrodeposition method was employed to controllably synthesize nanosheet type NiCo LDH. The effect of concentration rate of Ni(NO3)2/Co(NO3)2 preparation solution on crystalline structure, morphology and supercapacitive performance was investigated systematically. Experimental found that the morphology and composition of NiCo LDH was highly depend on the Ni2+/Co2+ molar ratios of preparation solution; and the obtained Ni0.76Co0.24 LDH materials showed small nanosheet size and uniform distribution on carbon fiber electrode. Ni0.76Co0.24 LDH electrode was evaluated for supercapacitor application, which revealed a high specific capacitances of 2189.8 and 1908.8 F g−1 at the current density of 1 and 30 A g−1 respectively and a good cycle stability, retaining 70.3 % of the initial capacitance after 20000 charge and discharge cycles at 50 A g−1. Moreover, the Ni0.76Co0.24 LDH electrode exhibits a high energy density of 76 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 250 W Kg−1 and a high power density of 7500 W Kg−1 at energy density of 66 Wh Kg−1. The as-prepared Ni0.76Co0.24 LDH as positive electrode for asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits excellent energy density of 4.1 Wh Kg-1 at a power density of 4000 W Kg-1.
