The TiN nanowire arrays (TiN NWAs) were prepared by hydrothermal treatment of Ti foil and subsequent nitridation through ammonia annealing, on which Ni(OH)2 was electrodeposited to form hierarchical TiN@Ni(OH) 2 core/shell nanowire arrays (TiN@Ni(OH)2 NWAs). The electrochemical behaviors of TiN@Ni(OH)2 NWAs were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge, which shows very high specific capacitance (2680 F g-1 at 6 A g-1 in 2 M KOH aqueous solution) and good rate capability (54% capacity retention at 60 A g-1). These results demonstrate that the TiN@Ni(OH)2 NWAs nanostructure is very promising for high performance supercapacitors. Â© 2013 The Authors.
