Degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), synthesis of advanced electrode materials, and treatment of heavy metal wastewater are important issues in energy and environment fields, which may be realized simultaneously through a multi-in-one interface strategy. Herein, an in situ S-doped alkynyl carbon material (SACM) was synthesized by co-milling hazardous endosulfan and CaC2. The solvent-free mechanochemical process is efficient, feasible, and green, whereby endosulfan is destructed completely under mild conditions without hazardous products and intermediates. The resultant SACM is a unique alkynyl-linked carbon skeleton with in situ S doping and multilayered structure. Furthermore, the SACM exhibits high supercapacitor performances with remarkable cycling stability and high specific capacitance (232.3 F cm-3), as well as excellent Hg(II) adsorptivity with pseudo-chemosorption behavior and high Hg(II) adsorbance (675.7 mg g-1). This work provides an integrated solution for the efficient degradation of hazardous endosulfan and a green synthesis of functional ACMs.
