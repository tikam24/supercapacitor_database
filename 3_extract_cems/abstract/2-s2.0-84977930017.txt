A hierarchical porous carbon fiber with high nitrogen doping was fabricated for high-performance supercapacitor. For the purpose of high nitrogen retention, the porous polyacrylonitrile fiber was treated by hydrazine hydrate, and then underwent pre-oxidation, carbonization, and activation in sequence. The resulted material exhibited high nitrogen content of 7.82 at.%, large specific surface area of 1963.3m2 g-1, total pore volume of 1.523cm3 g-1, and the pores with size range of 1-4nm were account for 49.1%. Due to these features, the high reversible capacitance of 415F g-1 and the good performance in heavy load discharge were obtained. In addition, the amazing cyclability was observed after 10,000 circles without capacitance fading.
