This paper proposes a multilevel hybrid control scheme, including grid control and node control, for an islanded 48-V solar photovoltaic-based low voltage dc microgrid that aims to overcome the drawbacks of centralized and decentralized control schemes. The analyzed microgrid includes a 35-kW rooftop solar system as the main power source at bus-1 with battery storage, 5-kW hybrid energy storage system (Vanadium Redox flow battery with super capacitor) at bus-2, and variable loads such as electrical vehicles at bus-3. In the case of a central failure, the proposed hybrid control scheme is capable of seamlessly switching between high bandwidth communication and low bandwidth communication channels of communications to implement a distributed control scheme. The central supervisory controller is responsible for updation of grid characteristics and sending/receiving information to/from local node controllers, which are responsible for bus voltage regulation and energy management. The control hierarchy features optimized and safe operation (charge and discharge) of storage devices in dc microgrids. The paper also demonstrates the application of battery-supercapacitor systems to absorb system transients during load changes. The simulation showcases the continuous flow of information and decision processes via each level of control while simultaneously taking into consideration the constraints of each subsystem. The scheme has been simulated in MATLAB/Simulink environment for various case studies to evaluate system robustness. Further, the proposed scheme has been tested experimentally with its prototype and its results are explored.
