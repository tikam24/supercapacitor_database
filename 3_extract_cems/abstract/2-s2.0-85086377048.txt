Black powders were prepared from chimney soot by means of treatment with different solvents and drying. The powders were used to prepare inks, which were deposited on copper foils. The as prepared electrodes were assembled as supercapacitor structures with KOH as electrolyte. The charge-discharge characteristics were measured to evaluate the electrical capacitance and to compare the technology for soot treatment. The soot was studied as a source before and after treatment using IR spectroscopy, XRD and SEM EDX.
