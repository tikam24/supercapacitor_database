In this work, an in-depth investigation was performed on the properties of the half-bridge current-source (HBCS) bidirectional direct current (DC)-to-DC converter, used to interface two DC-link voltage sources with a high-voltage-rating mismatch. The intended implementation is particularly suitable for the interfacing of a supercapacitor (SC) module and a battery stack in a hybrid storage system(HSS) for automotive applications. It is demonstrated that the use of a synchronous rectification (SR) modulation scheme benefits both the power-stage performance (in terms of efficiency and reliability) and the control-stage performance (in terms of simplicity and versatility). Furthermore, an average model of the converter, valid for every operating condition, is derived and utilized as a tool for the design of the control system. This model includes the effects of parasitic elements (mainly the leakage inductance of the transformer) and of the converter snubbers. A 3 kWprototype of the converter was used for experimental validation of the converter modeling, design, and performance. Finally, a discussion on the control strategy of the converter operation is included.
