Ocean wave energy is an emerging renewable source of energy which can be used for generation of electricity for sustainable development. In this work, a wave energy generation system for the paddle type of wave energy converter in standalone system, is discussed. The wave energy is generated by a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with low cost power architecture. To smooth the oscillating output power from the generator a hybrid energy storage system comprising of battery and super-capacitor is proposed. Smooth dc power can be directly fed to the load or can be controverted to ac to supply to the ac load. The system control is simulated and experimentally validated with an emulated wave energy converter in experimental setup. The driving speed for the WEC emulator is chosen to be a sinusoidal wave with dominant frequency of actual sea-wave.
