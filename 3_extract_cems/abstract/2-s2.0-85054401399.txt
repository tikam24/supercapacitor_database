This chapter discusses the evaluation of the key parameters of lithium-ion batteries for power assist and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle applications on the basis of reference tests set up by the US Advanced Battery Consortium-Department of Energy; a battery case study is used to highlight the analysis procedure. The chapter then briefly summarizes the main characteristics of lithium-ion batteries already on the market and under development, with emphasis also given to the safety of each battery-chemistry. The use of supercapacitors (ultracapacitors) in parallel with the batteries to increase both performance and battery life is also discussed, and limits and future developments of lithium-ion batteries and of supercapacitors are included. Finally, a short discussion is provided about the on-road transportation of the future.
