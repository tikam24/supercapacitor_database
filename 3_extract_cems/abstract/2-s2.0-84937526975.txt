Tin dioxide (SnO2) aggregation nanostructures with uniform pores were synthesized through a gas–liquid interfacial reaction driven by solvothermal means. The aggregated particle sizes of this structure can be rationally controlled via adjusting the volume ratios of ethylene glycol and distilled water. Investigation reveals that the more the water was in the mixed solvent the bigger the particles formed in the same reaction time duration, but with the porous distribution unchanged, which may be attributed to the coordination between F− and Sn4+ to orderly adjust the hydrolysis rate of Sn4+. This architecture exhibits excellent cycling stability as an electrode for supercapacitors (97 % capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 1 A g−1 after the first 80 cycles decay).
