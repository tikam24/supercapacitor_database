Graphene-based nanocomposites assume different architectures depending on manufacturing process, e.g., paper-like structures received great success for supercapacitor application due to their outstanding electrical and thermal conductivity. Recently, a nacre-like architecture, named nanolaminate, attracted the attention of scientists since it should be considered as bulk material.There are several micromechanics models for the prediction of the elastic properties of nanocomposite materials, based on the geometry, orientation of the filler, elastic properties of the filler and matrix. The stiff constituent phases (graphene platelet) in the structural materials bonded together by the soft constituent phases result in the so-called brick-and-mortar (B-and-M) structure. The effect of filler properties will be discussed by considering the analytical and numerical procedures available in literature for bidimensional filler composites. Several critical physical mechanisms may affect the reinforcing effects, including the agglomeration, stacking up, and rolling up of graphene sheets.
