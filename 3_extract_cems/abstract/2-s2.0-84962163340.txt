A facile approach to transform benzoate into porous few-layered graphene (PFLG) sheets under very mild reaction conditions (800 Â°C, without high-vacuum) was proposed. The obtained porous few-layered graphene (PFLG) sheets with high BET surface area of 1240 m2/g and a pore volume of 1.18 cm3/g was employed as electrodes for supercapacitor. A high specific capacitance of 202 F/g was achieved, and a slow decay rate of 3.8% per cycle during 1000 cycles was detected.
