Lithium polymer batteries are high-powered lithium batteries used for electric vehicles and also in unmanned micro air vehicles. They have high energy density, high over current rating and can deliver several times the rated current of the battery. This paper presents the performance of lithium polymer battery when a brushless dc motor is connected as load and how the performance is enhanced when super capacitor is connected along with the battery to feed the load. Super capacitors are electric double layer capacitors which possess high power density but low energy density compared to batteries. Performance of lithium polymer cell can be enhanced considerably by introducing a Super Capacitor; generally in parallel with the power source Super capacitors can deliver a large amount of power for a transient period which is very important at the time of starting of the load. Analysis with practical results is presented in this paper.
