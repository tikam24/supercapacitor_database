A highly oriented and densely packed Co-Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheets thin-film electrode has been successfully fabricated by drying a transparent colloidal suspension of Co-Al LDHs nanosheets on a pretreated indium tin oxide-coated glass plate substrate. The electrochemical investigations show that this thin-film electrode has good supercapacitor behavior with a high specific capacitance of up to 2000 F cm3 (667 Fg), a good electrochemical stability, and a high-rate capability. These excellent electrochemical properties obtained can be attributed to the special microstructure of the thin-film electrode. This thin-film electrode may be a potential electrode for thin-film supercapacitors. Â© 2007 The Electrochemical Society.
