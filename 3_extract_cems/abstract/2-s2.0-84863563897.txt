Due to the high power density of supercapacitors, it is adopted in electric vehicles to essentially guarantee to recover more regenerative energy. However, there is still not a valid set of measurement methods to gauge the energy absorbed from regeneration system, the measurement and evaluation system for regenerative energy require to be investigated in order to estimate the performance of electric vehicles. Based on the analysis of the regenerative braking energy system of a supercapacitor truck, a measurement and evaluation system for recycling energy in the braking process is established. Meanwhile, the experiments of supercapacitor vehicle under various braking condition are carried out. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed braking energy recycling measurement method. © 2011 by ASME. © 2011 by ASME.
