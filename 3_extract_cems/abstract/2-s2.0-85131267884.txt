In this work, single bond directly linked COF-like conjugated microporous polymer NDTT is constructed via Stille coupling with thiophene-substituted naphthalene diimides and triazine, showing fair crystallinity. NDTT is utilized as an electrode for supercapacitor applications, exhibiting promising performance with excellent capacitance reaching 425.3 F g−1 under a current of 0.2 A g−1
