Electrode materials derived from transition metal oxides have a serious problem of low electron transfer rate, which restricts their practical application. However, chemically doped graphene transforms the chemical bonding configuration to enhance electron transfer rate and, therefore, facilitates the successful fabrication of Co2Ni3ZnO8 nanowire arrays. In addition, the Co2Ni3ZnO8 electrode materials, considered as Ni and Zn ions doped into Co3O4, have a high electron transfer rate and electrochemical response capability, because the doping increases the degree of crystal defect and reaction of Co/Ni ions with the electrolyte. Hence, the Co2Ni3ZnO8 electrode exhibits a high rate property and excellent electrochemical cycle stability, as determined by electrochemical analysis of the relationship between specific capacitance, IR drop, Coulomb efficiency, and different current densities. From the results of a three-electrode system of electrochemical measurement, the Co2Ni3ZnO8 electrode demonstrates a specific capacitance of 1115 F g-1 and retains 89.9% capacitance after 2000 cycles at a current density of 4 A g-1. The energy density of the asymmetric supercapacitor (AC//Co2Ni3ZnO8) is 54.04 W h kg-1 at the power density of 3200 W kg-1.
