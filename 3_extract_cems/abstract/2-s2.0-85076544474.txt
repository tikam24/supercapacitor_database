In order to fabricate a highly efficient super capacitor, a noble material, graphene oxide (GO), is synthesized by simple electrochemical synthesis method. The chosen source material is an ordinary graphite rod extracted from Nippo battery. Raman spectroscopy as well as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy affirms the formation of highly pure GO. The super capacitor is fabricated with prepared graphene oxide based electrodes and ionic liquid as electrolyte and tissue paper as separator. The prepared cell shows promising results, a high capacitance value of 78.82 F g−1 at 20 mV s−1 scan rate. The prepared cell is also tested after 30 days in order to determine its stability and performance.
