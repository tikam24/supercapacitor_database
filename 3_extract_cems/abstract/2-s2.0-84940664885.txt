Iron oxides are promising to be utilized in rechargeable alkaline battery with high capacity upon complete redox reaction (Fe<sup>3+</sup> Fe<sup>0</sup>). However, their practical application has been hampered by the poor structural stability during cycling, presenting a challenge that is particularly huge when binder-free electrode is employed. This paper proposes a "carbon shell-protection" solution and reports on a ferroferric oxide-carbon (Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-C) binder-free nanorod array anode exhibiting much improved cyclic stability (from only hundreds of times to >5000 times), excellent rate performance, and a high capacity of ≈7776.36 C cm<sup>-3</sup> (≈0.4278 C cm<sup>-2</sup>; 247.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, 71.4% of the theoretical value) in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, by pairing with a capacitive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film cathode, a unique flexible solid-state rechargeable alkaline battery-supercapacitor hybrid device (≈360 μm thickness) is assembled. It delivers high energy and power densities (1.56 mWh cm<sup>-3</sup>; 0.48 W cm<sup>-3</sup>/≈4.8 s charging), surpassing many recently reported flexible supercapacitors. The highest energy density value even approaches that of Li thin-film batteries and is about several times that of the commercial 5.5 V/100 mF supercapacitor. In particular, the hybrid device still maintains good electrochemical attributes in cases of substantially bending, high mechanical pressure, and elevated temperature (up to 80 °C), demonstrating high environmental suitability.
