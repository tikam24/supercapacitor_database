Holey graphene, formed by generating in-plane pores in its basal planes can deliver efficient electrochemical performance due to low resistant pathways and short ion diffusion channels. However, generating holes in graphene's basal planes is a challenging task due to its exceptional mechanical properties which often require toxic and expensive processing methods. In this work, a facile, cost-effective, scalable, and environmentally friendly green approach is adopted to produce holey graphene nanosheets for the supercapacitor application. The fabricated holey graphene electrode exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 226 F/g in the three-electrode system and a specific capacitance of 62 F/g, an energy density of 10.37 Wh/kg, and a power density of 1388 W/kg in the solid-state symmetric device configuration.
