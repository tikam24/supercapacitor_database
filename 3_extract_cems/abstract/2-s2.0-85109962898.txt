Active electrodes of transition metal selenides attract extensive consideration in energy storage application because of its improved electrochemical performances. In this study, evolution of flower like MnSe2@MoSe2 was subsequently synthesized through one pot hydrothermal route. Growth of combined composite exposed flowerlike morphology with looser corrugated nanospikes increases surface area for redox reaction which reduces ionic diffusion pathway and improves supercapacitor performance in three-cell configurations. The best performed (MMS-3) electrode exhibited 719 Fg−1 specific capacitance and retained 99.78% capacity retention over 2000 cycles. Furthermore, as an asymmetric MnSe2@MoSe2//AC device delivered significant 75 Whkg−1 energy density at 747 Wkg−1 power density. Besides, asymmetric (MMS-3)//AC device maintained 99.16% capacity retention after constant 2000 charge discharge cycles. In a small-scale practical demonstration, MnSe2@MoSe2//AC device illuminated red LED and displayed improved electrochemical performance. Hence, both Mn (manganese) and Mo (molybdenum) mutual role promotes more affluent redox chemistry, which is beneficial for higher electrochemical activity. Thereby, Se provided greater number of electroactive sites that can aid maximum utilization of electrolyte ions.
