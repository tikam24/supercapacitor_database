Hydrogels made of cross-linked polyacrlyamides (cPAM) and conducting materials made of polyanilines (PANIs) are both the most widely used materials in each category. This is due to their accessible monomers, easy synthesis and excellent properties. Therefore, the combination of these materials produces composites which show enhanced properties and also synergy between the cPAM properties (e.g., elasticity) and those of PANIs (e.g., conductivity). The most common way to produce the composites is to form the gel by radical polymerization (usually by redox initiators) then incorporate the PANIs into the network by oxidative polymerization of anilines. It is often claimed that the product is a semi-interpenetrated network (s-IPN) made of linear PANIs penetrating the cPAM network. However, there is evidence that the nanopores of the hydrogel become filled with PANIs nanoparticles, producing a composite. On the other hand, swelling the cPAM in true solutions of PANIs macromolecules renders s-IPN with different properties. Technological applications of the composites have been developed, such as photothermal (PTA)/electromechanical actuators, supercapacitors, movement/pressure sensors, etc. PTA devices rely on the absorption of electromagnetic radiation (light, microwaves, radiofrequency) by PANIs, which heats up the composite, triggering the phase transition of a thermosensitive cPAM. Therefore, the synergy of properties of both polymers is beneficial.
