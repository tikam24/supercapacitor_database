Supercapacitors have shown great potential as a possible solution to the increasing global demand for next-generation energy storage systems. Charge repositioning is based on physical or chemical mechanisms. There are three types of supercapacitorsâ€”the electrochemical double layer, the pseudocapacitor, and a hybrid of both. Each type is further subdivided according to the material used. Herein, a detailed overview of the working mechanism as well as a new method for capacitance enhancement are presented.
