Using a redox-mediated neutral electrolytic system (0.5 M Na2SO4+ 0.5 M K4FeCN6), a ternary hybrid of Ni(OH)2-MnO2-rGO as a supercapacitor electrode was investigated. The hybrid electrode was synthesized by adopting a simple hydrothermal approach. The phase of the α-Ni(OH)2 and γ-MnO2 was confirmed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), as well their incorporation was observed by High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The hybrid electrode in the redox system has demonstrated appealing performance due to the improved charge transfer capability of redox-active K4FeCN6, and hence, a high specific capacitance of 870 Fg-1 was found within the potential window of 0-1.0 V at 1 Ag-1 current density. As well, a high energy density of 30.2 Whkg-1 was found by using a symmetrical two-electrode setup. On top even after 5000 cycles, this supercapacitor has shown 92% of capacitance retention while maintaining 95% Coulombic efficiency. From a comparative perspective, the electrode was also tested on neutral Na2SO4, KOH, and H2SO4 electrolytes.
