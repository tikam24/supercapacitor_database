An essential part of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the Energy Storage System (ESS). This paper describes a tool, named Tool for Energy Storage System Synthesis (TESSS), that automatically transforms ESS demands to cost-effective ESS design candidates. The following statements characterise the tool: • Mathematical modelling and optimisation are essential ingredients; • The handled ESS technologies are batteries of various types, supercapacitors and combined ESSs. Combined ESSs include both battery and supercapacitor cells. • The optimal design is pointed out by a cost function and requirements. The cost function includes investment cost, wear cost and costs due to energy losses. Examples of requirements are minimal power, maximum package volume and voltage. • TESSS is user friendly and extremely computation efficient owing to its compiled C code. To exemplify the practical use of the tool, two case studies are also presented in this paper. Copyright © 2009, Inderscience Publishers.
