Hierarchical dumbbell-like Fe3O4/C powder was synthesized for the supercapacitor electrode by the solvothermal reaction and subsequent calcination. Resultantly, the reversible capacitances of the three-electrode and symmetric two-electrode capacitors were 490.2 F/g and 210.2 F/g, respectively, higher than those in literatures, possibly due to the unique hierarchical dumbbell-like structure with the easier access and penetration of the electrolyte to the electrode. Moreover, the symmetric Fe3O4/C two-electrode system exhibited the remarkable cycle stability at 5.0 A/g and high energy density of 34.3 Wh/kg at 1003.9 W/kg, indicating high feasibility for the application in high-performance supercapacitor.
