Nowadays, microgrid energy storage system is in great demand in order to compensate the demand-generation mismatch. In this study a new control design strategy is presented to improve voltage stability in energy storage system of DC microgrid. Motivated by various control design approaches available in the literature, a simple low pass filter control design strategy is proposed for battery and ultra-capacitor discharge in fluctuating load conditions. A low-pass filter control design is proposed in this study to establish an ultra-capacitor reference current to keep the DC bus voltage under stable operations. In order to show the efficacy of the proposed control strategy different cases have been considered when battery alone is connected in energy storage system, secondly when battery along with ultra-capacitor and low pass filter are connected. It is observed that the proposed controller exhibits comparatively better performance with the benefit of simple implementation and it increases battery life by making the battery current rise and fall quite smoothly.
