Porous interconnected carbon nanosheets (PICNs) with high electrochemical performance were prepared by doping urea and a co-hydrothermal precursor derived from soybean stalk (SS) and nickel nitrate. The specific surface area and average pore diameter of the as-synthesized PICNs are 2226.29 m2 g−1 and 1.89 nm, and their N and O contents are 5.08% and 9.4%, respectively, which is beneficial for increasing pseudocapacitance. Furthermore, the doping of the metal Ni increases the graphitization degree of the PICNs and promotes the conversion of pyridine-N to graphitized-N. Therefore, the PICNs possess a high specific capacitance of 407 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, a high capacitance retention of 78.62% even at 20 A g−1, and an outstanding cycling stability (over 93% retention rate after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles). Moreover, an energy density of 36.11 W h kg−1 is achieved at a power density of 517.8 W kg−1 during a two-electrode system test, and a retention rate of 87.5% is obtained after 10,000 cycles. This co-hydrothermal treatment as well as nitrogen-doping approach for preparing porous interconnected carbon from SS not only represents an alternative strategy for carbon-based supercapacitor materials but also provides a new option for the utilization of waste SS.
