In the field of civil and military vessels, marine electric propulsion systems have broad prospects for development. In this paper, the equivalent models of battery and super capacitor are established, the appropriate parameters are designed, and the characteristics of lithium battery and super capacitor are simulated and analyzed. By designing the topology of hybrid energy storage system, formulating the control strategy based on Super capacitor SOC. Finally, simulating the DC bus voltage fluctuation in the two typical working conditions of forward and backward rotation of marine propulsion motor and sudden impulse load. The simulation results show that the hybrid energy storage system can significantly improve the stability of DC bus voltage.
