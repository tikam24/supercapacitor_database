Novel nanoporous nitrogen-enriched carbon materials were prepared through a simple carbonization procedure of well-defined block copolymer precursors containing the source of carbon, i.e., polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and a sacrificial block, i.e., poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PBA). The preparation of nitrogen-enriched nanocarbons with hierarchical pore structure was enabled by the high fidelity preservation of the initial phase-separated nanostructure between two polymer blocks upon carbonization. Supercapacitors fabricated from the prepared carbons exhibited unusually high capacitance per unit surface area (>30 μF/cm2) which was attributed to the pseudocapacitance resulting from the high nitrogen content originating from the PAN precursor. Electrochemical availability of the nitrogen species was also evident from the results of oxygen reduction experiments. The hierarchical pore structure and the high nitrogen content in such materials make them particularly promising for use in supercapacitor and electrocatalyst applications. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
