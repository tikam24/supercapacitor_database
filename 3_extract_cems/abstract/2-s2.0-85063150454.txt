Fe 3+ and H + co-doped PANI/GO (graphene oxide) composites with different iron dopant ratio depending on the starting FeCl 3 (GOPNI-1, GOPNI-2, GOPNI-3 and GOPNI-4) are prepared. The formations of composite samples are investigated by some characterization techniques such as XRD, ATR-IR, UV–Vis spectrophotometer and thermal properties by TGA. While, the Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm for (GOPNI-3) shows high specific surface area 48.7 m 2 g −1 depending on Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Owing to the high surface area as well as the synergistic effect between polyaniline and graphene oxide the electrochemical performance of (GOPNI-3) shows high specific capacitance 1610.09 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in 1 M H 2 SO 4 acidic aqueous electrolyte. A symmetric supercapacitor device (SCs) with superbly electrochemical performance is fabricated using GOPNI-3 electrodes. The symmetric device exhibits high specific capacitance 810.88 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in which the maximum energy density and power density of 18.02 Wh Kg −1 and 189.68 W kg −1 , respectively. Moreover, the SCs device shows good cycling stability (67.1%) after 1000 cycles at a scan rate 200 mV s −1 .
