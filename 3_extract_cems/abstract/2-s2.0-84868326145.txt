Micropopous chicken feather carbon (CFC) severing as electrode materials for the first time is prepared via the activation with KOH agent to different extents. The structure and electrochemical properties of CFC materials are characterized with N2 adsorption/desorption measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The obtained results show that CFC activated by KOH with KOH/CFC weight ratio of 4/1 (CFCA4) possesses the specific surface area of 1839 m2 g-1, average micropore diameter of 1.863 nm, and exhibits the highest initial specific capacitance of 302 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1 in 1 M H2SO4, and that even after 5000 cycles, CFCA4 specific capacitance is still as high as 253 F g-1. Furthermore, CFCA4 also delivers specific capacitance of 181 F g-1 at current density of 5 A g-1 and 168 F g -1 at current density of 10 A g-1. Accordingly, the microporous activated carbon material derived from chicken feather provides favorable prospect in electrode materials application in supercapacitors. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
