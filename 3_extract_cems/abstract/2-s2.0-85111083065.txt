In the present work, we report the comparative study of structural and electrical properties of MWCNTs/SnO2 nanocomposites synthesized by hydrothermal and co-precipitation routes. The focus of current study is the uniform decoration of SnO2 nanoparticles on the surface of pristine MWCNTs which encorage for the better crystalinity and electrical conductivity in a desired range by optimizing the amount of MWCNTs so that these could be utilized for gas sensing, optoelectronics, and hydrogen storage applications. The structural parameters were calculated using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra, whereas morphological studies were analysed with the help of field emmision scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope (TEM). TEM analysis confirmed the orderly distribution of SnO2 nanoparticles on the outer surface of MWCNTs via hydrothermal route instead of co-precipitation route. Electrical conductivity of the MWCNTs/SnO2 nanocomposites synthesized using hydrothermal method is better than those prepared via co-precipitation route. These nanocomposites have potential applications in the field of supercapacitor, hydrogen storage device, gas sensor, etc.
