Firstly, porous honeycomb graphene is prepared by using polystyrene microspheres as template. Then the porous graphene/PANI supercapacitor materials are synthesized by in-situ polymerization in the dispersion system of porous honeycomb graphene and using ammonium persulfate and β-MnO2 respectively as oxidant. The micromorphologym structure, composition and electrochemical performance of the materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrochemical workstation. The results show that the prepared carrier material has a honeycomb structure and the porous graphene/PANI materials using β-MnO2 as oxidant have better electrochemical properties.
