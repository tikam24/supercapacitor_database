Hydrothermal synthesis is one of the most usually used approach for the synthesis of nanomaterials. In hydrothermal synthesis, the controlled morphologies of nanomaterials are obtained in low- or high-pressure conditions, in a wide temperature range ranging from room temperature to relatively high temperatures. Transition metal cobaltites MCo2O4 (where M[dbnd]Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn) and their graphene-based composites have been considered as promising electrode materials in the field of supercapacitor and energy storage devices as they possess high electron transport capability and high charge storage by means of multidimensional morphological structures. The present article is focused on hydrothermally synthesized MCo2O4 and their graphene-based composites as electrode material in the field of a supercapacitor. The different MCo2O4 and their graphene-based composites with reaction parameters along with their morphology are summarized. Furthermore, electrochemical supercapacitor performance based on different nanostructures has been discussed.
