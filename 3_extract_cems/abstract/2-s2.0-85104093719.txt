The energy crisis and environmental protection issues have prompted the rapid development of new materials for energy storage equipment. In this paper, a flower-like NiCoMn trimetallic hydroxide grown on foam nickel has been obtained by one-step hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) assisted solvothermal method. The unique flower-like structure and integration of three metals provide super-fast electron transfer and electrolyte ion diffusion, so a super specific capacitance of 2432 ​F ​g−1 is obtained. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by NiCoMn trimetallic hydroxide and biochar (BC) material exhibits a high energy density of 52.9 ​Wh kg−1 and its specific capacitance only decreases 13.7% after 5000 cycles. This strategy is an effective method to prepare flower-like hydroxide materials with excellent capacitive properties and can be extended to other compounds.
