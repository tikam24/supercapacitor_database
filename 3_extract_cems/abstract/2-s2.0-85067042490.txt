A novel type of sulfur-doped graphene fibers (S-GFs) were prepared by the hydrothermal strategy, the in situ interfacial polymerization method and the annealing method. Two S-GFs were assembled into an all-solid-state fibriform micro-supercapacitor (micro-SC) that is flexible and has a high specific capacitance (4.55 mF·cm−2) with the current density of 25.47 µA·cm−2. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of this micro-SC kept the rectangular shape well even when the scan rate reached 2 V·s−1. There is a great potential for this type of S-GFs used in flexible wearable electronics.
