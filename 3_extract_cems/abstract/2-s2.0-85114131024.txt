Wearable and flexible electronics research has recently boomed for applications such as health monitoring and smart portable electronic devices. Considering the advances in flexible and wearable electronics, a suitable energy autonomy has become a critical issue for powering these devices. This paper presents the electrochemical and supercapacitive characterization and performance of a wristband architecture supercapacitor fabricated using graphite -polyurethane epoxy as an active electrode. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibits an aerial capacitance of 5.38 mF/cm2. The corresponding energy and power density of the device is 3.7Î¼Wh cm-2 and 1.15 mW cm-2 respectively. The obtained performances of supercapacitor demonstrate that it could be potentially used as efficient energy source for any wearable health monitoring sensor device.
