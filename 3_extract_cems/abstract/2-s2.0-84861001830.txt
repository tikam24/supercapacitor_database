RuO 2 embedded polyaniline electrodes were prepared by electrodeposition. PANI electrode was electrochemically deposited on tantalum sheet. Then RuO 2 particles were embedded on film layer of polyaniline. RuO 2/polyaniline electrode was annealed at 80°C for 12 h. Microstructure and morphology of RuO 2/polyaniline were characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectrometer and scanning electron microscopy. Structure of the composite with amorphous phase was verified by X-ray diffraction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results confirmed that counter ion had been incorporated into PPy matrix. Analysis by scanning electron microscopy revealed that during grain growth of RuO 2/PANI, due to its porous morphology, PANI provides a large surface to the growing RuO 2. The electrochemical performances of RuO 2/polyaniline electrode are calculated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technology. RuO 2/polyaniline electrode reveals high specific capacitance (474 F g -1), ideal cyclical stability and smaller charge transfer resistance (2.24 Ω). The good property for RuO 2/polyaniline electrode is due to fine RuO 2 particles embedded in the PANI of big surface area. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
