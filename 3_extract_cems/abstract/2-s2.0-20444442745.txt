The use of supercapacitors to drive white light emitting diodes (LED) used in camera flash lights is discussed. Supercapacitors with combined high capacitance provide the pulse power required by the LED without exhausting the battery. Due to the low ESR and high C, the supercapacitor across the output looks like a short circuit at power-up. In torch mode, the supercapacitors supports the battery to power the GPRS module and other high power consumption circuits through field effect transistors (FET) labeled RF PA PWR.
