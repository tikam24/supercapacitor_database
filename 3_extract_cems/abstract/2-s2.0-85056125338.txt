In this paper, CoxNi(1−x)(OH)2 with various molar ratios of Ni/Co is synthesized through chemical treatment. Effects of Ni/Co molar ratios on microstructure and property of CoxNi(1−x)(OH)2 are explored. It is found that electrochemical property of the Co–Ni hydroxides could be optimized for a Ni/Co molar ratio of 1. The obtained Co0.5Ni0.5(OH)2 exhibits the most hollow out structure and preferable electrochemical performance as electrode material in hybrid supercapacitor. The interconnected and porous architecture built by thin nanosheets of Co0.5Ni0.5(OH)2 facilitates ion diffusion and electron transportation. The experiment results further show that the property decay during charging/discharging may be caused by the collapse of structure.
