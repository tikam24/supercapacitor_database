An advanced supercapacitor material based on nitrogen- doped porous graphitic carbon (NPGC) with high a surface area was synthesized by means of a simple coordination- pyrolysis combination process, in which tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), nickel nitrate, and glucose were adopted as porogent, graphitic catalyst precursor, and carbon source, respectively. In addition, melamine was selected as a nitrogen source owing to its nitrogen-enriched structure and the strong interaction between the amine groups and the glucose unit. A low-temperature treatment resulted in the formation of a NPGC precursor by combination of the catalytic precursor, hydrolyzed TEOS, and the melamine-glucose unit. Following pyrolysis and removal of the catalyst and porogent, the NPGC material showed excellent electrical conductivity owing to its high crystallinity, a large Brunauer- Emmett-Teller surface area (SBET=1027 m2g-1), and a high nitrogen level (7.72 wt%). The unusual microstructure of NPGC materials could provide electrochemical energy storage. The NPGC material, without the need for any conductive additives, showed excellent capacitive behavior (293 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1), long-term cycling stability, and high coulombic efficiency (>99.9% over 5000 cycles) in KOH when used as an electrode. Notably, in a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor, NPGC energy densities as high as 8.1 and 47.5 Whkg-1, at a high power density (10.5 kWkg-1), were achieved in 6m KOH and 1m Et4NBF4-PC electrolytes, respectively. Thus, the synthesized NPGC material could be a highly promising electrode material for advanced supercapacitors and other conversion devices. Â© 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH& Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
