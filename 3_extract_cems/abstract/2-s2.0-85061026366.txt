The NiMoO 4 sheets were grown on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) using a very simple chemical precipitation method. The prepared g-C 3 N 4 /NiMoO 4 can be used as the electrode material of supercapacitors and exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1275 F g −1 at 0.25 A g −1 owing to the interconnected structure and presence of N by the incorporation of g-C 3 N 4 . In addition, the g-C 3 N 4 /NiMoO 4 //rGO hybrid supercapacitor was assembled by employing g-C 3 N 4 /NiMoO 4 and rGO as positive and negative electrode respectively. The assembled hybrid device can exhibit good electrochemical performances, such as the specific capacitance of 146 F g −1 , energy density of 90 Wh kg −1 and accepted cycle stability with 70% capacitance retention after 4000 continuous cycles. These results powerfully demonstrate that the prepared g-C 3 N 4 /NiMoO 4 can be applied as a potential candidate in the electrode material of supercapacitors.
