Manganese oxide (MnOx) has been electrodeposited on the nickel foam-supported carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and fabricated as the supercapacitor electrode. The three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous microstructure of the as-fabricated MnOx/CNT/Ni-foam electrode is beneficial to electrolyte penetration and ions exchange, whereas CNTs provide improved electronic conductivity. The MnOx/CNT/Ni-foam electrode with MnO x loading mass of 100 μg shows a high specific capacitance (SC) of 462 F g-1 with good long cycle stability at a current density of 5 A g-1, suggesting that it is a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode. © 2011 The Electrochemical Society.
