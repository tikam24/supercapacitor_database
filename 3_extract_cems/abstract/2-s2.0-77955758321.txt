The advantages of supercapacitors at the starting of internal combustion engines (ICE), as a complementary source to classical batteries, are nowadays certitudes: the significant extension of battery life span, the reduced volume and weight, meeting the environmental demands and lowering starting time and energy. The paper intends to develop a model of the electrical behavior of the assembly supercapacitor-starter driven by the ICE crankshaft, model allowing reasonable estimations of supercapacitors characteristics used for ICE starting. The development of the model was based on real signal analysis on a conventional battery-starter starting system. Â©2010 IEEE.
