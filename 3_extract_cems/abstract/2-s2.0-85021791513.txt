A modern society is not sustainable unless means other than plants are developed to harvest and store the sunâ€™s energy and to deliver that energy as clean electric power without the pollutants from hydrocarbon combustion or the thermodynamic constraints on the efficiency of conversion of heat energy. A convenient long-term energy store of electrical energy as chemical energy that is delivered back as electrical energy is the rechargeable battery; the efficiency of the energy conversions in a battery is not constrained by thermodynamics other than by the heat loss associated with the internal battery resistance. conventional rechargeable cell uses an aqueous electrolyte, either alkaline or acidic, in which H+ is the working ion. With an alkaline electrolyte, the charged cathode is a layered NiOOH into which H+ is inserted reversibly on discharge to create Ni(OH)2. Since an alkali metal is immiscible with an organic-liquid electrolyte, dendrites commonly form and grow during plating across an alkali-metal/organic-liquid interface; the dendrites can grow across a thin electrolyte to the cathode to give an internal short-circuit with incendiary consequences if the electrolyte is flammable. As a result, batteries containing an organicliquid electrolyte do not use a solid alkali-metal anode. Electric power can also be stored in an electric-double-layer capacitance at an electrode/electrolyte interface. This strategy is used in an electrochemical capacitor, commonly called a supercapacitor. Much work has been devoted to the development of a viable sulfur cathode in an organic-liquid electrolyte.
