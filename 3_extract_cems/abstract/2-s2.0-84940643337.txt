A scalable production of high surface area nanoporous carbon material (∼2994 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) with good distribution of micro-, meso- and macro-pores was hydrothermally synthesized using both cheap polymers and graphene foam as carbon sources. The as synthesised material shows a unique interconnected porous graphitic structure. The electrochemical double-layer capacitor fabricated from this nanoporous carbon material exhibited a superior supercapacitive performance of 188 F g<sup>-1</sup> at current density 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>. This corresponded to areal capacitance of 6.3 μF cm<sup>-2</sup> coupled with a high energy of 0.56 μWh cm<sup>-2</sup> (16.71 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>) and a power density of 13.39 μW cm<sup>-2</sup> (401 W kg<sup>-1</sup>) due to extended potential window of 1.6 V in KOH aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, no capacitance loss after 10,000 cycles was observed, owing to the unique structure and large surface area of the active material. The outstanding performance of this material as supercapacitor electrode shows that it has great potential for high performance energy-related applications.
