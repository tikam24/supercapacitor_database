Aqueous Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) have attracted extensive interest as a promising energy storage candidate beyond Li-ion hybrid technology due to their highly abundant Zn resources and exemplary safety. However, it is still challenging to achieve high energy and power density of electronic devices simultaneously. In this study, biomass-derived (from pine needles) microporous and N, O co-doped carbon (PNMNC) with a large specific surface has been constructed using a carbonization-activation method. The assembled ZHSCs with PNMNC electrodes can exhibit excellent specific capacitance, good rate performance, and outstanding cyclic stability. This study shows biomass-derived carbon materials can be promising in electrochemical energy applications with their unique pore structures and natural doping.
