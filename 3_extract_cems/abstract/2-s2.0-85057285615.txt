Three-Dimensional (3D) porous graphene, a kind of carbon material with in-plane nanopores and hierarchical pores formed between graphene layers, have attracted tremendous interests in application of supercapacitors due to their large specific surface areas, superior conductivity, unique porous structures and diversified compositions. Combining the advantages from both porous materials and graphene, 3D porous graphene has been regarded as an idea scaffold to build hierarchical hybrid with comprehensive electrochemical energy storage performance by introducing other substances. In this review, we aim to summarize the recent advances in fabricating 3D pure self-supported graphene-based porous structures with micro-, meso-, and macro-porous features and investigate the structureâ€“property relationships, and their application in supercapacitors are also discussed.
