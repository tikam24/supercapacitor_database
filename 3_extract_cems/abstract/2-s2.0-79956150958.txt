Graphene that had nanomeshes, only one to two graphene layers, and specific surface areas of up to 1654 m2 g−1 was produced on gram-scale by template growth on porous MgO layers. Its unique porous structure gave excellent electrochemical capacitance (up to 255 F g−1), cycle stability and rate performance. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
