Transition metal dichalcogenides especially molybdenum and tungsten disulfides have gained immense attention of the researchers worldwide, owning to their structure and properties similar to that of graphene. Versatile properties such as high surface area, resistivity, stability, good mechanical strength, easy charge transfer, feasibility in synthesis of these nanoparticles and tailorable band gap has made them widely applicable in different fields such as catalysis, sensing, adsorbent, lubricants, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitor and solar light harvesting. This review has focused on synthesis and applications of different heterostructure based on MoS2 and WS2 in the area of chemical sensing. The main idea of this review is to motivate the designing of an efficient and economical nanomaterial based on MoS2 and WS2 for detection of different pollutants.
