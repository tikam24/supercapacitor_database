Supercapacitors based on charge storage at the interface between a high surface area carbon nanotubes electrode and (C2H5)4NBF4/AN electrolyte were assembled. The performance of the capacitor depends not only on the materials used in the cells but also on the construction of the cells. From a constant charge-discharge test, capacitance of 175 F and ESR of 28 mÎ© was obtained for supercapacitor module. The performance of CNTs capacitors for high power sources used in electronic equipment was described. Values for the specific energy and specific power of 1 Wh/kg and 0.37 kW/kg, respectively, were demonstrated for a module with 5 V operating voltage. A hybrid power source consisting of lithium ionic battery and supercapacitor module was demonstrated to power successfully a simulated power load encountered in GSM portable communication equipment. Addition of a supercapacitor to the power train of a cellular phone results in significantly more energy from the battery being used by the load.
