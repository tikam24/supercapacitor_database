Sandwich-like ZIF-8 nanocrystal derived N-doped carbon decorated graphene sheets are developed through in-situ growth and followed by a thermal annealing treatment. The sandwich-like N-doped carbon decorated graphene sheets (NCGs) contain graphene substrate and the carbon nanoparticles with 30–50 nm in size. The sandwich-like NCGs generate a large specific surface area of 816.4 m2 g−1. With the high surface area and nitrogen doping, the as-fabricated NCGs as electrode materials for supercapacitor exhibit high specific capacitance of 225.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, an enhanced rate capability and excellent electrochemical stability with 96.8% retention after 10000 cycles even at 10 A g−1. The symmetry supercapacitor based on NCGs delivers an energy density of 12.7 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 447 W kg−1. When the power density increases to 15126 W kg−1, the energy density can still keep 6.5 W h kg−1. Furthermore, the symmetry supercapacitor shows an excellent cycle stability with 96.6% capacitance retention at 2 A g−1 after 10000 cycles.
