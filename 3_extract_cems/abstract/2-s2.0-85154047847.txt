The development of energy storage devices is crucial for diverse applications, including transportation and power generation. The use of carbon-based electrode materials has attracted significant attention for improving the performance of such devices owing to their outstanding conductivity, stability, and diverse structures, which can satisfy the demands of electrochemical energy devices. Specifically, polymer-derived carbon materials (PDCMs) have attracted considerable attention as electrode materials owing to their abundance, structural diversity, and low cost. Various carbon materials with desirable nanostructures and surface modifications have been engineered from different polymers via suitable synthesis and activation processes for application as high-performance electrodes. This review systematically summarizes the classifications and advantages of various PDCM synthesis methods. Furthermore, the applications of PDCMs and their composites as electrodes in supercapacitors and batteries are discussed in detail. Finally, technological directions and potential research prospects are suggested to advance the practical applications of PDCMs.
