Gold (Au), silver (Ag), and palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed amorphous carbon composites have been prepared successfully by Green synthesis method using the reducing agent extracted from Cissus quadrangularis stem (CQS). The presence of antioxidant compounds in CQS extract is responsible for reducing and capping metal nanoparticles. The synthesized nanocomposites exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacterial strains. Electrochemical performance of the composites is evaluated in symmetric two-electrode configuration. At a power density of 1 kW kg −1 , the symmetric supercapacitor based on Au nanoparticle dispersed carbon electrodes exhibits an energy density of 7.1 Wh kg −1 .
