Flexible energy storage systems and electromagnetic pollution have become issues that need to be resolved in equipment research and development due to the widespread use of portable electronic devices and 5G networks. MXene is competent for supercapacitors and electromagnetic wave absorbers through sensible composite and microstructure design. Herein, Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 Hollow Nanosphere Decorated Ti3C2Tx MXene (CuMnHS@MX) was prepared by simple electrostatic self-assembly. Hybrid membranes can be quickly prepared by vacuum-assisted filtration. CuMnHS@MX exhibits excellent electromagnetic wave absorption performance and electrochemical energy storage properties. High specific capacitance (2089 mF/cm2 at 2.5 mA/cm2) and excellent cycle stability (99.89% after 8000 cycles) are achieved, which are attributed to the increased interlayer spacing and improved interlayer ion transport efficiency. When assembled into symmetrical flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor (SC), the device has a specific capacitance of 382.9 mF/cm2 and an energy density of 53.18 μWh/cm2 at a power density of 277.8 μW/cm2. Meanwhile, CuMnHS@MX has advantageous absorbing properties. When the thickness is 4 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) is −53.42 dB at 6.08 GHz. Adjustable absorbing property is achieved, and the absorbing energy efficiency can cover X and most C, Ku bands. These excellent EMA properties are derived from the 3D structure and rich dipole/interface polarization. CuMnHS@MX is a promising bifunctional material for electrochemical energy storage and electromagnetic wave absorption.
