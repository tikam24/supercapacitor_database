Supercapacitor performance of hybrid nanostructure (graphene-zinc antimonate) was explored, in which the 2D graphene and 1D zinc antimonate nanostructures were prepared by probe ultrasonication and precipitation methods respectively and the nanocomposites were fabricated in two different weight ratios by simple homogenous magnetic stirring method. Crystal structure, vibrational modes and synergistic interactions were studied through XRD, SAED and Raman spectral investigations. Morphology and interatomic features were viewed through FESEM and HRTEM investigations. Optical absorption, band gap and emission properties were analyzed through UV-DRS and PL studies and the fabricated nanostructure can anchor as charge trappers and charge recombination inhibitors. XPS spectral studies were confirmed the chemical composition of respective elements as well as chemical interactions between two different quantum nanostructures. The electrochemical tests were carried out using CV, GCD and EIS measurements. The fabricated nanostructures exhibit EDLC behavior with a maximum specific capacitance of 228.57 F/g and 1470.25 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte that was obtained due to the synergistic interaction between graphene and ZSO nanorods and non-aggregation effect. Cycling tests were measured at a current density of 5 A/g for 2000 charge/discharge cycles and the prepared composite nanostructure exhibits a better electrochemical stability which was supported by AC impedance studies. These diversified properties make the hybrid nanostructures as an efficient electrode material in supercapacitors.
