In this study, we report a facile chemical synthesis of a novel MnCo2S4/halloysite (HNTs) nanoflakes decorated on nanotubes which coated on Ni foam via a screen-printing technique. The MnCo2S4 thin films were prepared using a coprecipitation method which demonstrate battery kind of behavior. The MnCo2S4/HNTs-based electrode shows a specific capacity of 359 mAh g−1 at 5 mV s−1 with excellent cycling stability. Furthermore, the symmetric system exhibits an outstanding energy density and power density of 6.98 Wh kg−1 and 1976.0 W kg−1, respectively. The results obtained with the MnCo2S4/HNTs composite in a symmetric system indicate that this composite material can potentially be used as an alternative electrode material for electrochemical energy storage.
