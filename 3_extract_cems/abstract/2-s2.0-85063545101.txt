The article gives a comparative analysis of different types of electric drives. Describing a possibility of using a hybrid electrical energy storage based on storage batteries and supercapacitors of high power is justified as one of the ways to prevent short-term power failures caused by short circuits in external power supply networks. Created simulation models of the high power battery, supercapacitor battery and hybrid storage was constructed to evaluate the efficiency of this method.
