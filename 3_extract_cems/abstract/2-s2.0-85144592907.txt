The work is focused on the analysis of the thermoelectric generator based on the thermoelectrical effect. The aim idea of the future is to further hybrid integration with semiconductor structures, event. used of nanotechnology. The work is focused on the use of heat of thermally stressed semiconductor structures with subsequent generation of electrical energy, such as GaN semiconductors designed for the automotive industry. The analysis is performed for 4 types of thermoelectric generators (TEG), obtaining energy and storing it in a supercapacitor. The aim was to verify the possibility of using thermoelectric effect, verifying properties using model, determine the essential characteristics, finding the optimum load, output voltage and output power achieved. The operation control of the thermoelectric generator was realized with the circuit LTC3108. We used thermoelectric batteries as a heat energy converter (TEC1-12707, TEC1-071080, TEG-127020 a TEG-127009).
