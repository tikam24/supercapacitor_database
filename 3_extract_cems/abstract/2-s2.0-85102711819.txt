Spinel-type ZnCo2O4 electrode material is synthesized by hydrothermal method and calcination treatment, and the influence on the target material is explored by changing reaction time and temperature during the synthesis process.XRD, SEM, CV and constant current charge-discharge test are employed to determine the structure, characterization and performance of the material.Results show that the porous ZnCo2O4 pleated microspheres synthesized at a reaction time of 7 h and a reaction temperature of 120℃ exhibits a regular shape with an average diameter of 10-12 μm, and also exhibits better electrochemical performance.
