With the rapid development of portable devices, polymer electrolytes with high safety performance are receiving widespread attention. The polymer electrolytes applied in supercapacitors in recent years were introduced in this review, including all-solid-state polymer electrolytes, gel polymer electrolytes, porous polymer electrolytes, composite polymer electrolytes and redox polymer electrolytes capable of providing pseudocapacitance, and the characteristics and research progress were also discussed in details. It was proposed that the development of organic composite gel polymer electrolytes with wide voltage window, high ionic conductivity, high mechanical strength and light weight will be the trend in the field of electrolytes for supercapacitors in the future. Polymer electrolyte with excellent comprehensive performance will play an important role in the field of new energy resources such as supercapacitors.
