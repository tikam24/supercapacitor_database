Supercapacitors have received an increasing interest from the power electronics community due to their high power density and compact size. These advantages make them good candidates for high-performance applications, such as electric/hybrid vehicles. In transportation application, the calendar phase presents an important part in the supercapcacitor life cycle. Understanding the aging calendar behavior allows us to manage well the aging parameters, as the operating temperature and the bias voltage. In order to achieve this goal, an investigation has been conducted on supercapacitor aging calendar conditions. Various tests are carried-out on 12 supercapacitors under 3 bias voltages (2,8V, 2,9V, and 3V) and 4 temperatures (55째C, 60째C, 65째C, and 70째C) until the limit of aging is reached for each supercapacitor. The supercapacitors' resistances and capacitances evolution are studied to establish the aging rate law with respect to the aging parameters variation.
