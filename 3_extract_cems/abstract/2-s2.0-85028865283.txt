This paper discusses the reduction of the maximum power demand of shore-to-ship cranes from the supply power system by the implementation of ultracapacitors and flywheels that locally store up and compensate a rate of the power demand, and by a power optimization tool that shaves the maximum peak of a cranes' group, coordinating their duty cycles. These reductions can lead to reduced electrical infrastructure system resulting installation and operating expenses for operating shore-ship cranes. The concept presented in the paper is encouraging port facilities developments and modernization to make sustainable microgrids based upon four (l) pillars using leveled, less, local, and load (lele-lolo).
