In the paperwork models of converters for energy storage elements have been developed. The models are made by using the software: LTSpice and Matlab. The results from the studies are compared with results obtained from a real experimental model. Specific output circuits for supercapacitor cells charging have been modeled. These models are applicable in different power circuits for similar applications. When a large number of specific parameters in the models must be taken into account the model can be further developed.
