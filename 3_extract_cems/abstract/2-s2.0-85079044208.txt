Fiber-type supercapacitors (FSC) have attracted much attention as efficient energy storage devices for soft electronics. This study proposes the synthesis of polypyrrole (PPy) on carbon fiber (CF) using electropolymerization as the energy storage electrode for FSC. Effects of the electrolyte, applied current, and time of electropolymerization for synthesizing PPy on CF are investigated. The configuration of the electrochemical system is also studied to better understand the electropolymerization of PPy. The highest specific capacitance (CM) of 308.2 F/g are obtained for the PPy electrode prepared using 0.5 M pyrrole and 0.3 M NaClO4 as the electrolyte at 40 mA for 20 min. The FSC assembled with PPy electrodes and the polyvinyl alcohol/H3PO4 gel electrolyte shows a CM value of 30 F/g and the energy density of 5.87 Wh/kg at the power density of 60.0 W/kg. Excellent cycling stability with CM retention of 70% and Coulombic efficiency higher than 98% in 3000 times charge/discharge process, and the good bending capability with CM retention of 153% and 148%, respectively, under the bending angle of 180Â° and the bending times of 600 are achieved. This work gives deeper understanding of electropolymerization and provides recipes for fabricating an efficient PPy electrode for soft energy storage devices.
