An on-chip micro-supercapacitor (μ-SC) based on Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) has been developed by Hot-wire chemical vapor process. First, finger patterned electrodes of Al were made on a silicon nitride coated Si wafer and SiNWs were then grown selectively on the Al electrodes. μ-SC performance has been tested in an ionic electrolyte and a capacitance of 13 μF/cm2 has been obtained by the μ-SC. The resulted μ-SC can be exploited to store the harvesting energy in micro-electro-mechanical-systems and coupled with battery for peak power leveling. Low temperature growth of SiNWs at 350 °C makes it suitable for prospective flexible electronics applications.
