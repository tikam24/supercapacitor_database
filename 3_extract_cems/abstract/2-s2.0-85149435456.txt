Heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials show promise for use as supercapacitor electrodes, but the tradeoff between surface area and the heteroatom dopant levels limits the supercapacitive performance. Here, we modulated the pore structure and surface dopants of N, S co-doped hierarchical porous lignin-derived carbon (NS-HPLC-K) via self-assembly assisted template-coupled activation. The ingenious assembly of lignin micelles and sulfomethylated melamine into a magnesium carbonate basic template greatly promoted the KOH activation process, which endowed the NS-HPLC-K with uniform distributions of activated N/S dopants and highly accessible nanosized pores. The optimized NS-HPLC-K exhibited a three-dimensional hierarchically porous architecture composed of wrinkled nanosheets and a high specific surface area of 2538.3 ± 9.5 m2/g with a rational N content of 3.19 ± 0.01 at.%, which boosted the electrical double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. Consequently, the NS-HPLC-K supercapacitor electrode delivered a superior gravimetric capacitance of 393 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Furthermore, the assembled coin-type supercapacitor showed good energy-power characteristics and cycling stability. This work provides a novel idea for designing eco-friendly porous carbons for use in advanced supercapacitors.
