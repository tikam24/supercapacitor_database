An environmental approach is needed in the production of activated carbon as electrode material in supercapacitor applications. Activated carbon provides high specific surface area and well-developed pore structures. These circumstances compromise high electrochemical performance for supercapacitor. Therefore, this research focusses on fabricating the activated carbon derived from garlic peels through the chemical activation of potassium hydroxide under various concentrations, combined with 1-integrated stage pyrolysis. The morphology of activated carbon was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), embedded in energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) for analyzing the elemental status. The crystalline degree of the activated carbon was observed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical performances of cell supercapacitor-based-ACM electrodes were evaluated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging-discharging (GDC). The activated carbon was prepared in monolithic form without binder materials and shows a sponge liked-porous structure with high electrochemical performance, including specific capacitance of 204 F g−1, with energy and power of 28.58, 71.16 W kg−1 under current densities 1 A g−1, in the 2-electrode system of 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The results showed that using an environmental approach in the production of activated carbon monolithic derived from garlic peels has high electrochemical performance.
