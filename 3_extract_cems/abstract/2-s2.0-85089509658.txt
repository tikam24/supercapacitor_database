A compound electrode of carbonaceous materials and NiCo2O4 is extensively studied because of higher capacitance and better rate capability compared to those of pure NiCo2O4. However, the tedious preparation process, harsh synthesis condition, high consumption, and especially limited electrochemical property by using modifiers hinder its practical application. Herein, modifier-free electrodes (C/NiCo2O4) with various morphologies based on D-ribose are successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal-calcination method. D-ribose concurrently acts as carbon source and structure-directing agent. The structure of NiCo2O4 changes from the nanosheets into nanowires after adding D-ribose. Each element is evenly distributed throughout C/NiCo2O4, significantly improving the electrical conductivity. Furthermore, there is a strong interaction between carbon and NiCo2O4, which keeps the structure stable. Benefiting from the structural characteristics, the C/NiCo2O4 composites display the improved electrochemical performance. Remarkably, the maximum specific capacitance of C/NiCo2O4-2 is 1583.9 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 in 3 M KOH aqueous solution, and it exhibits remarkable rate capability of 1354.8 F g−1 even at 20 A g−1. After 20,000 charge-discharge cycles at 20 A g−1, a high capacity retention of 90.6% can be achieved. The C/NiCo2O4-2 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. In addition, a dynamic growth mechanism of C/NiCo2O4 under the coordinate bond of metal ions with D-ribose is discussed in the paper.
