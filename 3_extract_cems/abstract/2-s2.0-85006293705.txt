Three-dimensional carbon nanotube (CNT) networks with high porosity and electrical conductivity have many potential applications in energy and environmental areas, but the network structure is not very stable due to weak inter-CNT interactions. Here, we coat a thin polyaniline (PANI) layer on as-synthesized CNT sponge to obtain a mechanically and electrically stable network, and enable multifunctional applications. The resulting CNT/PANI network serves as stable strain sensors, highly compressible supercapacitor electrode with enhanced volume-normalized capacitance (632 F/cm3), and reinforced nanocomposites with the PANI as intermediate layer between the CNT fillers and polymeric matrix. Our results provide a simple and controllable method for achieving high-stability porous networks composed of CNTs, graphene, or other nanostructures.
