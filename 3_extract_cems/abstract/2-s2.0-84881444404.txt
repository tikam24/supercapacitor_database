We present a facile and scalable method for the rapid production of reduced graphene oxide (RG-O) by ionic liquid-assisted microwave chemistry. Microwave irradiation of graphite oxide (GO) in an ionic liquid (IL) enables the rapid reduction of GO within 15 s, producing RG-O containing the IL within their porous structures. The reduced graphene oxide prepared by IL-assisted microwave irradiation (mRG-O) electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼135 F g-1, which can be attributed to the open architecture of the mRG-O filled with IL moieties. A supercapacitor made with mRG-O in an IL electrolyte operated at a voltage of 3.5 V and showed a high energy density (∼58 W h kg-1) and power density (∼246 kW kg-1).
