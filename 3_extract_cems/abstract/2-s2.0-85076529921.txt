Enhancing the energy density and power density of the supercapacitor has long been the hot topic in the field of new energy storage devices, in which electrode materials including those for anodic and cathodic play a key role. This paper prepared IrO2–ZnO nanoelectrode by thermal decomposition method, analyzed the relationship between the capacitive properties and structures of the electrodes in detail. The results shown that electrodes prepared at 370 °C exhibited an intensive redox action, relatively low charge transfer resistance and high capacitance value of 487 F g−1 due to the plenty active sites provided by its large specific surface area and IrO2–ZnO nano-particles distributed evenly in the amorphous structures. A binder-free asymmetric supercapacitor working in H2SO4 solution was assembled with RuO2–MoO3/Ti and IrO2–ZnO/Ti as cathodic and anodic respectively. It exhibited energy densities of 10.9 W h kg−1 and 2.1 W h kg−1 when the power density was 26.7 W kg−1 and 267.5 W kg−1 respectively. Furthermore, it's the first time to detect energy density and power density in acid solution of RuO2–MoO3/Ti cathode without using of binding materials, which is likely to become an important method to produce such pseudocapacitor in an industrial scale.
