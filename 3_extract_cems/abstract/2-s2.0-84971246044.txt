Honeycomb-like NiMn layered double hydroxide nanostructures have been successfully grafted on carbon cloth via a simple hydrothermal synthesis, which show good electrochemical performance with 2.687 C cm-2 (2239 F g-1) at a current density of 5 mA cm-2. It is notable that this honeycomb-like nanostructure could supply sufficient electrochemically active sites for effective redox reactions. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor with good flexibility is fabricated based on this NiMn-LDH electrode. Over 110% of the initial capacitance is retained after repeating 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 3 mA cm-2. The honeycomb-like NiMn-LDH flexible electrode with good performance proposes a new pathway for flexible energy storage devices.
