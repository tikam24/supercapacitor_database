This paper proposes a novel DC-bus voltage control technique for a connected-autonomous electric vehicle (CAEV) using a hybrid supercapacitor-battery energy storage system. The verification by simulation of the control system that manages the current flow from the supercapacitor by using a rule-based algorithm within a CAEV is described. A feedforward compensator is included within the control scheme to suppress DC-bus voltage excursions under highly variable driveline torque conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system has been verified by the case of CAEV being subject to a real-world driving cycle and acceleration/deceleration modes in order to reflect realistic electric vehicle powertrain operations.
