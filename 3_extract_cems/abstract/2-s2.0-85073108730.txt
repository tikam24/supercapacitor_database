Electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance are very significant for energy storage devices. However, single structured electrode materials present poor conductivity and cycling stability. In this work, we prepare MnO2@NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays by a simple hydrothermal method. The as-fabricated product exhibits a specific capacitance of 452.1 C g-1 at 10 A g-1. The assembled device keeps 82.1% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles and delivers an energy density of 31.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 2241.6 W kg-1. This superior electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the unique spatial structure, demonstrating potential application in next generation micro/nanodevices.
