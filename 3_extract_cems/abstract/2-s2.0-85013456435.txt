We have successfully synthesized a metal-organic framework and then researching its structure and morphology by scanning electron micrographs (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, we fabricated Zn0.65Ni0.35O by using the metal-organic framework as precursor for supercapacitor. The Zn0.65Ni0.35O electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 471.1 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which still remained at 81.3% over 1000 cycles.
