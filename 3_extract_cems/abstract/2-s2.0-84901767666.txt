Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is presented as a "greener" alternative to commonly used supercapacitor binders, namely polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The key advantages of using PVP are that it is non-toxic and soluble in ethanol and it can be used to spray coat or drain cast activated carbon (AC) electrodes directly on a current collector such as aluminum foil - in contrast to PTFE that requires rolling or PVDF that requires toxic N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The electrodes with the best mechanical stability incorporated 3.5 mass% of 1.300.000 g mol-1 PVP. Compared to PTFE or PVDF, the resulting pore volume was significantly higher and the specific surface area significantly larger when using PVP (normalized to the amount of AC). A good electrochemical performance was observed in organic electrolytes for AC-PVP electrodes: 112 or 97 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 in 1 M TEA-BF4 in propylene carbonate or acetonitrile, respectively. The performance stability was comparable to PTFE-bound electrodes when adjusting the maximum cell voltage to 2.5 V while preserving the manufacturing features of PVDF-AC films. (Electro)chemical stability is shown by electrochemical testing and infrared vibrational spectroscopy for propylene carbonate and acetonitrile. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
