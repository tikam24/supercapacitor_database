N-doped porous carbon nanosheets were prepared from glucose with g-C3N4 derived from dicyandiamide as a self-sacrificed template, which have a high nitrogen content of 12.01 at.% and a specific surface area of 492.7 m2 g−1. The unique structure allows for exhibiting high specific capacitance of 250.64 F g−1 and excellent rate capability.
