MOFs (Metal-organic frameworks) emerging as newest materials with porous structure and ease to synthesize results in new material growth with enhanced surface area. Nanocrystalline copper-metal organic framework (Cu-MOF), cobalt-metal organic framework (Co-MOF), and copper/cobalt metal organic framework (Cu/Co MOF) nanocomposite have been synthesized via superficial cost-effective hydrothermal method by using trimesic acid in order to restrict nano-particle growth. X-ray powder diffraction of the synthesized material indicates a reduction in the c-lattice parameter for Cu/Co nanocomposite to value 8.062 Å. Existence of oxygen, copper, chromium, and cobalt inside the Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite is indicative of successful nanocomposite synthesis whereas surface morphology gives a fall in particle growth resulting value 3.53 nm. PL (Photoluminescence) spectra showing reduction in peaks whereas Raman spectra demonstrate the presence of both copper and cobalt peaks inside the nanocomposite. Electrochemical studies were analyzed using IM KOH as an electrolyte resulting in enhanced specific capacitance of 228 Fg−1 for Cu-MOF, 280 Fg−1 for Co-MOF, and 935.8 Fg−1 for Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite respectively. Galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) analysis reveals power density value increment from 1092 Wkg−1 to 2495.5 Wkg−1 for Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite with energy density value decreases to 45.2 WhKg−1 allowing rapid ions transport at electrode/electrolyte interface suggesting Cu/Co MOF nanocomposite as a high performance electrode material with maximum storage capacity in supercapacitors.
