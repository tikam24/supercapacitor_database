Electrodes of different morphology, i.e., nanospheres (NSs) and nanorods (NRs), made by chemically depositing indium oxide (In2 O3) on indium-tin oxide substrates were investigated for their electrochemical supercapacitive properties. The presence of nanosized pores and voids in In2 O3 electrode of NRs caused increase in redox reaction active sites, and ultimately, inner and outer charges than that of NSs In2 O3 electrode. Due to the combined effect of double-layer and pseudocapacitance, the specific capacitance of In2 O3 electrode composed of NRs was higher (105 Fg) than that of NS (7.6 Fg).
