Lignin as the second most abundant natural polymer was applied to prepare a hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) for supercapacitors (SCs). Direct activation with various KOH dosages was applied to obtain HPC. Both pore size distribution and electrochemical performance were evaluated and compared to optimize the KOH dosages. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy were also applied to better understand the structure change of HPC with KOH dosages. High gravimetric capacities (Cg) of 268 and 162 F g−1 were obtained in aqueous and organic solutions, respectively. Excellent rate and cycle performance demonstrated the stable structure of HPC. Energy density could reach as high as 40.89 W h kg−1 in organic solution. Besides, it was also concluded that a high Cg can be obtained with low KOH dosage in aqueous solution while high KOH dosage was needed in organic solution. In a word, lignin was indeed a suitable precursor for the preparation of HPC in SCs.
