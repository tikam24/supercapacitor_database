Using polyurethane foam as template, we introduce a facile method to synthesize cost-effective macroporous nickel-shell (NS) which plays vital role in the synthesis of α-Ni-Co(OH)2. Nanofibrous morphology of α-Ni-Co(OH)2 is obtained by the aid of polyethylene glycol (structure directing reagent) and no precipitating agent is used. Our results indicate that no metal (Ni/Co) hydroxides can be synthesized if NS is isolated from the reaction vessel which ensures the role of NS in formation of α-Ni-Co(OH)2 nanofibres. Prepared α-Ni-Co(OH)2@NS electrode shows a typical enhanced interlayer spacing (∼8.0 Å) which results in significantly high specific capacitance (2962 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1). Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor cell (α-Ni-Co(OH)2@NS‖α-Ni-Co(OH)2@NS) exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 668 F g−1 with coulombic efficiency ∼98% over 3000 charge/discharge cycles at high current density (4 A g−1). The energy and power density obtained for α-Ni-Co(OH)2@NS‖α-Ni-Co(OH)2@NS cell are 18.2 Wh kg−1 at 242 W kg−1 and 1980 W kg−1 at 5.5 Wh kg−1 respectively. Moreover, in asymmetric supercapacitor using lacey reduced graphene oxide nanoribbon (LRGONR) as a negative electrode, a remarkable increase in energy (107 Wh kg−1 at 1610 W kg−1) and power density (7 kW kg−1 at 42 Wh kg−1) is observed.
