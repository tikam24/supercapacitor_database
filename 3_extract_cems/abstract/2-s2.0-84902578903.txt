Electrochemical impedance analysis is performed to predict the rate capability of two commercial activated carbon electrodes (RP20 and MSP20) for electric double-layer capacitor. To this end, ac impedance data are fitted with an equivalent circuit that comprises ohmic resistance and impedance of intra-particle pores. To characterize the latter, ionic accessibility into intra-particle pores is profiled by using the fitted impedance parameters, and the profiles are transformed into utilizable capacitance plots as a function of charge-discharge rate. The rate capability that is predicted from the impedance analysis is well-matched with that observed from a charge-discharge rate test. It is found that rate capability is determined by ionic accessibility as well as ohmic voltage drop. A lower value in ionic accessibility for MSP20 is attributed to smaller pore diameter, longer length, and higher degree of complexity in pore structure. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
