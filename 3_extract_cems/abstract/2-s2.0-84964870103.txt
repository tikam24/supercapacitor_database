In recent years, the use of wind turbines in distributed generation (DG) systems has been constantly growing. This involves the use of adaptive systems to avoid affecting the stability of the network during load or wind of variations and standalone situation. The aim in this paper is listing types of energy storage systems most currently used, their performance and characteristics. Then, a 25Kw wind machine simulated in PSCAD software with a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) with a six pulses back-to-back converter linked to a grid. The wind turbine is presented with and without a battery or supercapacitor as storage systems on its link DC with a bidirectional DC-DC converter controlled to improve performance. Last, simulations of voltage and power results and conclusions are presented.
