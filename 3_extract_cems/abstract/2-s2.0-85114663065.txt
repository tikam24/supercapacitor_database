Herein, a novel N and O co-doped three dimensional (3D) hybrid carbon aerogel (CA) was prepared by a two-step carbonization technology, i.e. preoxidation process (240 °C, air atmosphere) and carbonization process (600∼1000 °C, nitrogen atmosphere). It was found that the peroxidation process could improve the thermostability and heteroatoms content during the carbonization. The obtained CA samples inherited their original morphology of “string-bead” network and had a higher heteroatoms content, while the control samples did not. We focused on the application of this CA in either lactate oxidase-modified, super-capacitive and oxygen reductive electrodes. The fabricated lactate-powered integrated electronic skin could produce a maximum power density of ca. 1.3 mW cm−2, which allowed powering a multiplexed metabolic electronic in situ. The sample of CF-PVA-PANI800 showed the highest specific capacitance of 427.2 F g−1 at a discharge specific current of 0.5 A g−1. The synergistic effect of the N functionalities endowed the sample of CF-PVA-PANI900 with similar electrocatalytic activity to a 20 wt% commercial Pt/C catalyst for ORR. This fabrication strategy of carbon aerogel may provide a new alternative for preparing more heteroatom-doped 3D carbon materials in future.
