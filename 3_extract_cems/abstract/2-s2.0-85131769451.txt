The fast development of wearable electronics has propelled the research focusing on in-plane energy storage garments. The mechanical stability of textile devices is vital for their sustainable utilization in daily life. Herein, a NiCoB based in-plane textile device with excellent electrochemical and mechanical performances is achieved via combining screen printing and electroless deposition strategies. The upper layer of NiCoB with a continuous micro-balls structure can effectively disperse the central stress under bent state, well protecting the bottom Ni coating. Thus, the two-layer structure ensures the electric and electrochemical stability even suffering a mechanical loading. At the same time, the NiCoB is capable of providing considerable energy storage performance with a high capacitance of 883.3 mF cm-2 under 5 mV s-1. Coupling with a synthesized ZIF-C negative material, the in-plane micro-supercapacitor (MSC) also exhibits great performances in both energy storage and mechanical stability. It can deliver a specific capacitance, a power density, and an energy density of 155.3 mF cm-2, 1.09 mW cm-2, and 42.27 Î¼Wh cm-2, respectively, while sustaining a 1000 bending cycle with little capacity decay. This flexible in-plane MSC textile can be a powerful candidate for future integrated smart garments and will provide some enlightenment in developing composited textile devices with perfect mechanical performance.
