Non-grid-connected wind power water-electrolytic hydrogen production system is an effective solution to wind power curtailment. However, the stability of the Source power supply is affected by the intermittent and volatility of the wind energy, which will lead to low efficiency of hydrogen production on the Load. In this paper, a novel non-grid-connected Source-Load collaboration wind-hydrogen system is proposed to adapt to the variation of wind energy, which directly connects the Source wind turbines and the Load hydrogen production devices through a DC bus with a super capacitor group and auxiliary AC grid power supply. For the system, quasi-Z-source rectifiers with a wide DC voltage adjustment range are developed for the Source and a modular proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolytic hydrogen production array is designed for adjusting the Load capacity. The basic architecture and the modelling method of the Source, the Load and DC bus are analyzed. A control strategy for the system is put forward to regulate the size of the PEM array with three different operating modes and DC voltage collaboratively, by which the power flow management between the Source and the Load can be realized according to the wind power variation. Finally, two cases are carried out in the presence of diffident randomly varying wind power. The results show that the proposed non-grid-connected Source-Load collaboration of the wind-hydrogen system can maximize wind energy utilization of the Source and increase the efficiency of hydrogen production of the Load in the case of wind power fluctuations.
