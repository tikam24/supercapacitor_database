Manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanowires with diameter about 30-70 nm is achieved via a two-step process: first, template-free cathodic electrodeposition from aqueous solution of Mn(NO3)2 on steel substrate and followed by heat treatment. The temperature-annealed sample was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methods and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the MnO2 sample was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry in Na 2SO4 solutions. The sample showed excellent supercapacitive behavior. The specific capacitance (SC) of 237 F g-1 in a potential window of 0-0.9V was obtained at the scan rate of 2 mV s -1. The SC calculated from the chronopotentiometry data is about 246 F g-1. The SC was decreased by 16% after 1000 cycles. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
