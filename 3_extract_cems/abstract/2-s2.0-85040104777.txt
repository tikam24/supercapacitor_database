This paper focuses on power management strategy for a hybrid system involving the Fuel Cell (FC) as the main power source and the Supercapacitors (SCs) as the auxiliary power source. An innovative Passivity-based Control (PBC) strategy with multi-equilibrium states is proposed. The hybrid system is modeled as a Port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system and then the operating modes and the corresponding multi-equilibrium states of the hybrid system are analyzed. Additionally, the proposed PBC is designed based on Interconnection and Damping Assignment (IDA) method and the stability of the closed-loop system is proven theoretically. The simulation results show that the proposed PBC could stabilize the DC bus voltage without any steady state errors and reasonably balance the power distribution between the FC and the SC.
