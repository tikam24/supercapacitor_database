In this paper, a Fuzzy Logic Self Tuning PI (FPI) controller is designed for a supercapacitor based energy storage system (ESS) in a railway traction system. The aim is to automatically tune the PI controller gains, by means of fuzzy rules, in order to enhance the dynamic performance of the power flow control. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, a simulation is carried out in the MAT-LAB/SIMULINK environment of the overall system. The results show that the proposed controller is able to achieve a good performance in terms of reference tracking and response time when compared with the conventional PI controller.
