A mathematical model of the frequency converter power part with a PWM inverter and energy storage device with a DC/DC converter is given. The models of PWM inverter and DC/DC converter are based on the continuous approximation principle of switching functions. Single-loop, double-loop and three-loop types of control systems for energy storage devices are considered. The structures and parameters of controllers were obtained by the synthesis method of subordinate control systems with a modular optimum tuning. The research aim is to identify the static and dynamic properties of control systems with an energy storage device as a part of an electric drive operating in the intermittent mode. The simulation results and comparative estimation of the control systems characteristics are given. The results can be useful in the development of control systems for energy storage devices.
