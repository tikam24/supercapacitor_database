Flexible electronics have a wide range of applications in wearable and multifunctional electronics. Consequently, technologies for flexible energy storage need to be developed for flexible electronic devices. Here, we develop a facile fabrication technique utilizing vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs), which enables highthroughput fabrication of flexible supercapacitors. Our unique technique ensures a strong adhesion between VACNTs and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which facilitates a stable charge/discharge under varied strains. The measured capacitance is 170 Î¼F/cm2 at a high scanning rate of 1 V/s. In addition, the strong adhesion between VACNTs and PDMS enables the structure to sustain various bending strains. The capacitance under bending strains was found to be consistent under the bending angle varying from 0 to 180 degrees.
