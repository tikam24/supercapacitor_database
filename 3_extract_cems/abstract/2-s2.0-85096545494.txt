The niobium nitride nanotubes were prepared on niobium foil by anodic oxidation combined with ammonia reduction nitridation. The effect of reduction nitriding temperature on the phase, morphology and electrochemical properties of the nanotubes were investigated by XRD, XPS, SEM and electrochemical measurements such as CV, GCD and EIS. The results show that niobium nitride phase in the form of niobium oxide nitride appears after reduction nitriding. When the reduction nitriding temperature is 700 ℃, the structure of nanotube is uniform array. The inner diameter of the nanotube is about 35 nm, the thickness of the tube wall is about 12 nm, the length of the nanotube is about 1.5 μm. Therefore, the intrinsic impedance and charge transfer resistance of the sample are low, and the specific capacitance is 400 μF/cm2 as the current density is 0.1 mA/cm2.
