There is strong interest in vehicles powered by batteries to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions and reduce oil consumption. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has developed the UltraBatteryT M to provide the automotive market with a safe, efficient and affordable energy-storage device that meets the high-rate partial-state-of-charge (HRPSoC) duty required from hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The UltraBatteryT M comprises a supercapacitor integrated with a lead-acid cell. The technology has been taken up by the Furukawa Battery Co., Ltd., Japan, and the East Penn Manufacturing Co., Inc., USA, and is under mass production for both HEV and renewable energy applications. This chapter reviews: (1) the early failure mechanism of conventional lead-acid batteries under the HRPSoC duty, and (2) the operating principles and the capability of the UltraBatteryT M to overcome such failure. The UltraBatteryT M is under evaluation by many carmakers worldwide, and it has been adopted in both the Honda Odyssey Absolute and the Honda StepWGN as original equipment.
