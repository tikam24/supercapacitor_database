This letter presents a new zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) isolated dc-dc converter which combines a boost half-bridge (BHB) cell and a full-bridge (FB) cell, so that two different type of power sources, i.e., both current fed and voltage fed, can be coupled effectively by the proposed converter for various applications, such as fuel cell and supercapacitor hybrid energy system. By fully using two high-frequency transformers and a shared leg of switches, number of the power devices and associated gate driver circuits can be reduced. With phase-shift control, the converter can achieve ZVS turn-on of active switches and zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-off of diodes. In this letter, derivation, analysis, and design of the proposed converter are presented. Finally, a 25-50 V input, 300-400 V output prototype with a 600 W nominal power rating is built up and tested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed converter topology. Â© 1986-2012 IEEE.
