Many applications such as supercapacitors require high quality graphene as well as gram-scale produc-tion. In the present work, we report a gram-scale, environment-friendly method to produce reducedgraphene oxide by short time ball milling. The results of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spec-troscopy, Raman shift, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicate thatgraphene oxide was reduced after ball milling and exfoliated into graphene. Meanwhile, the electro-chemical properties of such graphene as electrode materials were obviously enhanced. The maximumcapacitance is as high as 212 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 in 1 M H2SO 4.Enhanced performance of supercapacitorelectrode based on this graphene is mainly attributed to better conductivity which will promote theestablishment of both double-layer and pseudocapacitance due to their rich edge functionality after ballmilling.
