For a developed dual-planetary hybrid system, the supper capacitor was selected as the only power resource and the parameters of ultra capacitor were matched. Based on fuzzy control theory and the target fuel economy, the optimal curve of the engine control strategy was proposed and the concrete implementation method was given. To verify the actual effect of the control strategy, a trial bus was tested on the bench. The results show that in a typical city driving cycle, the engine working points are highly accorded to the target curve and overcome the problems in traditional control, such as engine speed fluctuation and high fuel rate. The fuel consumption of fuzzy control algorithm of the vehicle is 21.44 L/100 km. Compared with the traditional PI control algorithm, the economizing rate increases 4.88%.
