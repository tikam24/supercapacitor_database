A general template-assisted electrochemical approach was used to synthesize three-dimensional ordered Ni core–NiO shell inverse opals (IOs) as electrodes for supercapacitors. The Ni–NiO IO electrodes displayed pseudo-capacitor behavior, good rate capability and cycling performance. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
