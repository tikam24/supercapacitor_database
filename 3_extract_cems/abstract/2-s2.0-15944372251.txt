Chromium doped Nano-MnO2 were synthesized by low temperature solid-state reaction. The characterization and performance of samples were studied by X-ray diffraction. The results show that the product is the mixture of α-MnO2 and γ-MnO2, the specific capacitances of pure MnO2 and chromium doped MnO2 are 95 F/g and 163 F/g. The results of the cyclic voltammograms and the constant current charge/discharge curves show that the ratio of chromium in samples has greater effect on the electrochemical capacity, the better discharge capacity can be obtained when the mole ratio of Mn to Cr is 100 and the discharge capacity of MnO2 electrodes is 70% higher.
