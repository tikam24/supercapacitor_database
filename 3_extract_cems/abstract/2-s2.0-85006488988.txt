In order to realize the modular design of the microgrid, this paper proposed a new modular topology for the AC-DC mixed microgrid. In that topology, the AC microgrid unit and the DC microgrid unit were packaged together by the back-to-back converter. The battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system was connected to the DC bus of back-to-back converter. By the reasonable design on the battery-supercapacitor hybrid system, the energy storage system could supply the rapid power and energy support for the microgrid spontaneously. The mathematical model and the control algorithm of that microgrid topology were studied. By the simulation analysis, it can be concluded that AC-DC mixed modular microgrid topology could operate steadily on both the grid-connected mode and the isolated mode. Furthermore, we can conclude by the simulation that the designed modular microgrid could operate uninterrupted when the microgrid topology switched from the grid-connected mode to the isolated mode. The seamless switching became the natural property for the modular microgrid. As a result, the modular microgrid topology can be considered as a usual power/load module to realize the friendly power interaction with the power grid.
