Three-dimensional NiCo2O4 nanoflowers have been directly grown on a stainless steel substrate surface, using a facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) technique. The deposited thin films were characterized for their structural, morphological and electrochemical properties by using XRD, SEM, cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge methods. The 3D NiCo2O4 nanoflowers were used as working electrode to measure the supercapacitor performance. The 3D NiCo2O4 nanoflowers exhibit high specific capacitance of 543 Fg-1 at current density 1 Ag-1. The capacitance loss was 9.4% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 3 Ag-1. This shows a good cycle stability and high rate capability of 3D NiCo2O4 nanoflowers. From this investigation it can be concluded that the low cost and environmental friendly CBD technique could be used to deposit efficient 3D NiCo2O4 nanoflowers for supercapacitor application.
