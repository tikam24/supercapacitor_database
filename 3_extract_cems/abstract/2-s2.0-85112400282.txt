Hierarchical structured ‘0D+ 2D+ 2D’ multidimensional nano carbon bowl (CB)-Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2)-Graphene (CB@MoS2/Graphene) hybrid is a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage. The semiconcave hollow carbon bowl (CB) with a high specific surface area can increase more active sites for uniform growth of MoS2 nanosheets. The unique bowl-shaped structure also helps to increase the contact area between adjacent particles, shorten the transmission distance of electrolyte ions and improve the rapid charge and discharge performance of the material. To further overcome the poor conductivity of pure MoS2 and efficiently display its energy storage performance, the hierarchical CB@MoS2/Graphene ‘0D+ 2D+ 2D’ multidimensional structured electrodes were synthesized by the hydrothermal method. As a ‘conductive bridge’, graphene was wrapped outside the surface of the CB@MoS2 to form a continuous conductive network channel in the GO-MoS2-CB hierarchical structure for better charge and ion transport. Moreover, the CB@MoS2 can also be used as a ‘spacer’ for graphene, alleviating the agglomeration of graphene sheets and providing part of the electric double-layer capacitance. When was used as the electrode material for supercapacitors, CB@MoS2/Graphene can obtain a better electrochemical property than CB@MoS2 and CB. The specific capacitance of CB@MoS2/Graphene can reach 588 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and 398 F g−1 at high current density of 10 A g−1, respectively. In addition, the 2D graphene nanosheets can not only improve the electrical conductivity, but also can be used as a buffer to alleviate structural changes during the long-term charging and discharging process, improving the cycling performance. The capacitance retention of CB@MoS2/Graphene is enhanced to 83.9% after 5000 cycles.
