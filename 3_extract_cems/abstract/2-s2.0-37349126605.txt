Spherical carbon aerogels (SCA) have been synthesized by a sol-gel process involving inverse emulsion polymerization of formaldehyde with 2, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid with the aid of K2CO3 as a catalyst. The morphology and surface properties of the materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption measurements. The influence of varying synthesis conditions, such as the drying method (supercritical drying or ambient drying) and catalyst concentration, on the specific capacitance of SCA when used as an electrode in supercapacitors was investigated. It was found that SCA synthesized with a molar ratio of 2, 4-dihydroxybenzoic acid to K2CO3 (nD/nC) of 100 with supercritical drying had the highest BET surface area of about 467 m2/g and a pore size centered at 2.5 nm. At a current load of 50 mA/g, a specific capacitance of 142 F/g was obtained using this sample. Supercapacitors based on SCA were found to exhibit good cycling stability and power density.
