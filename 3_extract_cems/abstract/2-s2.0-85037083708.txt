Nickel cobalt sulfides (NiCo2S4) with different morphologies have been synthesized and used as pseudocapacitive materials. Particles, sheets and hollow spheres can be easily synthesized with different components of reagents or chemical reaction time. Benefits from the hollow structure, the electrolyte can diffuse easily into active material and result in a lower resistance. The electrochemical performances of NiCo2S4 depend on the morphologies, among which the hollow NiCo2S4 spheres exhibit the highest specific capacitance of 756 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1, and longer cycle stability. This method may give some suggestion to synthesis of hollow particles and enhancement of electrochemical capacitors.
