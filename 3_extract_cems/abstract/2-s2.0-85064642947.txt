Cauliflower-like ZnWO 4 @WS 2 composite was synthesized on the surface of nickel foam using a low cost and facile two-step hydrothermal method and evaluated as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. The electrochemical properties of the ZnWO 4 @WS 2 electrode were examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ZnWO 4 @WS 2 redox-active material delivered a high specific capacitance of 1280.7 F g −1 at a current density of 3 A g −1 in a three-electrode configuration. In addition, the ZnWO 4 @WS 2 electrode material showed acceptable long cycle-life stability with 88.41% specific capacitance retention after 3000 cycles at a current density of 6 A g −1 , which is superior to that of the ZnWO 4 electrode. The higher electrochemical properties were attributed to the synergistic effect and high surface area. The superior electrochemical performance of cauliflower-like ZnWO 4 @WS 2 composite materials highlights their potential to meet the requirements of practical electrochemical energy storage applications.
