This paper proposes a hybrid multi-port bidirectional converter system for hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). The proposed hybrid multi-port topology consists of a battery bank, an ultra capacitor bank and an IC engine coupled to an alternator, sharing a common DC link. A high gain converter is used as DC-DC converter interface in the proposed topology. A novel control strategy for the closed loop operation of the proposed topology is also presented. The control strategy is validated using time domain simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC. A hardware prototype is built to validate the performance of the high gain DC-DC converter.
