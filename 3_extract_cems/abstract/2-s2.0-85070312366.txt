Electrochemical double-layer (EDL) capacitors operating at high charge/discharge rates are an important class of electrochemical energy storage devices. Aqueous EDL capacitors show great potential for use as inexpensive devices with much higher power; however, their energy density is severely limited by the narrow electrochemical window of water (1.23 V) and the small specific capacity of the electrodes. Here, we develop a high-voltage aqueous supercapacitor based on a highly concentrated Li+ aqueous electrolyte (hydrate melt) and a two-dimensional titanium carbide MXene electrode. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal the existence of dense hydrated Li+ in the interlayer space of the deeply charged MXene, which is realized by the wide electrochemical window of a hydrate-melt electrolyte. The hydrate-melt electrolyte together with the large-capacitance MXene Ti2CTx improves the performance of an aqueous lithium-ion supercapacitor, offering a promising strategy for advanced aqueous capacitors.
