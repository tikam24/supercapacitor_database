Three dimensional graphenes are most desired to deliver the unique nano-sized properties of graphenes to the macro-scale, yet their practical production remains insufficient. Herein we establish a general synthesis approach, i.e. ammonium-assisted chemical blowing via foaming sucrose into the bubble networks of sucrose-derived polymers, to effectively produce three dimensional strutted graphenes (SGs). SG consists of interconnected mono-/few-layered graphene membranes scaffolded by graphitic struts without restacking or agglomeration, which thus fully exposes the huge surface and possesses appropriate porosity. The SG is further applied as additive/binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors, which realize the high energy density of 50Whkg<sup>-1</sup> and the high maximum-power-density of 340kWkg<sup>-1</sup> due to the large surface area, excellent interconnectivity and porosity. The mass-produced self-supporting SG would open up a wide horizon and enable the abundant potentials of graphenes for promising large-scale applications.
