The development of carbon materials with desirable textures and new aqueous electrolytes is the key strategy to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Herein, a deep eutectic solvent (DES) was used for in situ templating of a carbon material. A carbon material was characterized (XRD, N2-physisorption, FTIR, SEM and EDS) and used as an electrode material for the first time in multivalent-based supercapacitors. In situ templating of carbon was performed using a novel DES, which serves as a precursor for carbon and for in situ generation of MgO. The generation of MgO and its roles in templating of carbon were discussed. Templating of carbon with MgO lead to an increase in surface area and a microporous texture. The obtained carbon was tested in multivalent-ion (Al3+ and Mg2+) electrolytes and compared with H2SO4. The charge-storage mechanism was investigated and elaborated. The highest specific capacitance was obtained for the Al(NO3)3 electrolyte, while the operating voltage follows the order: Mg(NO3)2 > Al(NO3)3 > H2SO4. Electrical double-layer capacitance (versus pseudocapacitance) was dominant in all investigated electrolytes. The larger operating voltage in multivalent electrolytes is a consequence of the lower fraction of free water, which suppresses hydrogen evolution (when compared with H2SO4). The GCD was experimentally performed on the Al(NO3)3 electrolyte, which showed good cyclic stability, with an energy density of 22.3 Wh kg−1 at 65 W kg−1.
