Designing advanced electrode materials with porous structures and prominent electrochemical activity could be a novel approach toward improving the energy density of supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, the construction of hollow MnCo2S4 nanowires decorated with NiFeLDH nanosheets (MCS@NFLDH) as a promising binder-free electrode for SCs using the effective sulfurization and hydrothermal procedures is introduced. Furthermore, the MCS@NFLDH electrode texture wrapped by graphene (rGO) sheets would take the benefit of superior structural properties and amazing electrochemical performances. The MCS@NFLDH@rGO electrode reflects a considerable capacity of ≈327.3 mAh/g, a substantial rate capability of 73.2% at 20 A/g, and superior robustness. With the well-constructed nanostructures, a corresponding asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device based on MCS@NFLDH@rGO (positive electrode) and active carbon (AC) (negative electrode) was assembled and tested. Most importantly, the device reflects a satisfactory energy density of ≈47.98 Wh/kg and an exceptional robustness. Accordingly, this work opens up the opportunities for the well-design of binder-free electrodes for utilization in SCs and other energy storage devices (ESDs).
