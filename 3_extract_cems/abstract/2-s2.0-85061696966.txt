In view of the problem that the current power failure event can not be reported in time, the technical solutions and advantages and disadvantages of power failure event reporting based on carrier and micro power wireless dual-mode communication are analyzed. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of NB-IoT technology, the overall design scheme of active reporting of power failure events based on NB-IoT technology is proposed. The power supply design scheme is proposed in the case of power failure, and the calculation method of super capacitor capacity and the selection method of super capacitor are given. The power failure event system identification program, NB-IoT communication connection establishment program, power failure data collection and reporting procedure, and power failure event reporting processing program are designed to ensure real-time, accurate and reliable reporting of power outage events.
