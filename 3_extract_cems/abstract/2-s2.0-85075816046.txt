Hierarchical Ni0.66Co0.34-LDH heterostructures are designed as electrode materials in this work. The ultrathin Ni0.66Co0.34-LDH nanosheets are decorated uniformly on Cu(OH)2 nanowire backbones, providing richness active sites, open ion channel, and conductive- and binder-free heterostructure for electrochemical energy storage. At the current density of 5 ​mA ​cm−2, the as-prepared Ni0.66Co0.34-LDH heterostructure electrode displays a specific capacitance of 17740 ​mF ​cm−2 (2367.3 ​F ​g−1), higher than that of Ni–Co LDH directly deposited on copper foam substrate (1390 ​mF ​cm−2). Additionally, an excellent rate capability (13880 ​mF ​cm−2 vs 20 ​mA ​cm−2) and remarkable cycling stability (88.9% vs 10 ​000 cycles) are obtained. Furthermore, the maximum energy density can arrive to 0.813 ​mWh cm−2 (power density of 8 ​mW ​cm−2 for the assembled solid-state Cu(OH)2@Ni0.66Co0.34-LDH//AC asymmetric cell. These prominent performances might be aroused by its special hierarchical core/shell heterostructures. These findings properly promote the design novel nanostructures for the advanced electrodes.
