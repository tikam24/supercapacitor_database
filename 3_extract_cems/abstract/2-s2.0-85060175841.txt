The article analyzes the operation of a traction drive with a capacitive energy storage during the electric vehicle traction mode. The proposed simulation model makes it possible to estimate the system operability, as well as represent the characteristics of the energy storage and the drive by a diagram. Conclusions were made about the capacitive energy storage applicability as a buffer energy source.
