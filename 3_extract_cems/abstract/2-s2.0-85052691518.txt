Supercapacitor, playing an important role in distributed micro-grid and new energy vehicles, has advantages of high power density and long operation life. In order to further improve the energy density, a lithium-ion supercapacitor with advantages of lithium ion batteries and supercapacitor was proposed. However, disadvantages of high cost and immature technology limit its large-scale application. On the basis of the basic principle of lithium-ion supercapacitor, we divide it into three categories, and review the research status of electrode materials. Moreover, we summarize the existent problems and the trend of the development of composite material, and present the focus of electrode material research in the future composite materials, MOFs materials and flexible materials.
