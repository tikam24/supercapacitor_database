The advent of microgrid technology and recent trends in control engineering largely facilitate the seamless inclusion of clean energy into the conventional power system. This paper presents a distributed control strategy using DC bus signalling (DCBS) applied to a DC microgrid comprising of solar PV, battery, Supercapacitor and fuel cell. The DCBS method dictates the instant and mode of operation of each node (source/storage device along with its respective converter) merely based on the local information measured at the converter output terminals. Further, at the converter level, a dual loop control with virtual resistance emulation is employed to properly address the issue of line voltage drop which would otherwise result in unintended operation of the system nodes. In addition, a Demand Side Management (DSM) strategy that uses the DC bus voltage to curtail loads during N-1 operation of the microgrid is presented. The DC microgrid along with the DCBS control is modelled and analyzed using MATLAB/SIMULINK and is validated for its performance in real-time on an experimental DC microgrid setup.
