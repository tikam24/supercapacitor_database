Modern manufacturing lines are very sensible to power quality disturbances whereas voltage disturbances have been clearly identified as major problems to sophisticated continuous-process-based industries. Topic of power quality is also of crucial importance for the widespread application of renewables and deep penetration of energy sources of distributed power generation. Due to the insufficient ability of batteries to absorb power surges and spikes and to deliver high energy bursts, batteries based uninterruptible power supply systems (UPS) are simply purely suited for short-term bridging by power drop or spike compensation. To handle power surges and short-term power outages the energy market needs supercapacitors with their significant benefits in power- and peak-assist. Supercapacitors are reliable, maintenance-free, short-time power source with long lifespan and are suitable to avoid the effect of voltage twist and of electrical noise or to buffer short-term outages on the power grid. Some fields of application as well as design of Supercapacitor based systems have been presented taking into account specific technical requirements on power quality systems.
