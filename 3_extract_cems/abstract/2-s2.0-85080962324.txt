Stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely used to generate electrical power in rural areas. Transients in solar radiation affect the electrical power generated by solar stand-alone PV systems. Solar stand-alone PV systems strictly require energy storage units like batteries to compensate the solar power deficiency. The batteries have the quality to store electrical power with a high-energy ratio, but their capacity is limited. Supercapacitors, however, have a high power density with a low-energy density. A combination of both these energy storage devices is required to be connected in a suitable configuration so as to cater to the power demand and power quality concerns of the solar stand-alone PV systems. This work identifies such four different types of hybrid batteries and supercapacitor topologies for solar PV applications. For every topology, MATLAB/Simulink model is developed to investigate the system performance under the same input radiation and load conditions. A new fuzzy hybrid control algorithm (FHCA) for the best topology is also proposed to further optimize the performance of the system. The mathematical expressions of battery and supercapacitor sizes are also formulated. On analysing the simulation results for current, voltage and power stabilities, the best suited topology for any input weather condition is also proposed.
