To obtain excellent electrode material with high capacitive property, the nanoscale porous graphite carbon was prepared via a sample coordination-pyrolysis method from renewable biomass starch. The nanostructure of the PGC-based materials were characterized by XRD, Raman, TEM and BET methods. The result exhibits that PGC has high BET surface area (SBET=1187 m2/g) and superior graphitization. While being adopted as a supercapacitor electrode, PGC shows excellent electrochemical performance: a high specific capacitance of 249 F/g, outstanding cycle durability over 99.97% after 5000 cyles, an high energy density of 46.79 Wh/kg at a high power density of 10500 W/kg. Thus, the synthesized PGC material was very promising as an electrode material for high-power supercapacitors.
