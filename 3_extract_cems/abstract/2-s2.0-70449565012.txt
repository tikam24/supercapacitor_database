Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) composite with stable and high electrochemical activity was fabricated by chemical and electrochemical polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) on a PET fabric in sequence. Effects of polymerization conditions on the following characteristics of the composite were studied: electrical conductivity and surface morphology. The electrochemical properties were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry and cyclic charge/discharge experiments. The specific volume resistivity, electrical conductivity and specific discharge capacitance of the composite were 0.034 Î©-cm and 25 S/cm, and 54.5 F/g, respectively.
