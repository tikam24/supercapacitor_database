CuBr (tu)3 nanowires (tu: thiourea) was prepared by a facile mechanochemical green method for the first time and their application as electrode for supercapacitors is also studied. The as-prepared CuBr(tu)3 nanowires show length of around 4 μm and width of 50～60 nm. Those nanowires exhibited high specific capacitance of 1408 F·g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV·s-1 and 1683 F·g-1 at current density of 10 A·g-1 in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. This study provides a simple, efficient, and environmental strategy to fabricate novel nanoscale electrode materials constructing metal-organic frameworks.
