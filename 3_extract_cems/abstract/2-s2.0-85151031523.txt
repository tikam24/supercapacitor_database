The hybrid device, an eventual energy storage device, synchronizes the high-rate capability and power from supercapacitors and exceptional energy from batteries. Initially, we synthesized strontium sulfides, polyaniline, and strontium sulfide/PANI. These electrodes were functionalized initially in three electrode configuration employing 1 M KOH electrolytic medium. Among all the electrodes, the SrS/PANI has revealed astonishing results in comparison to its counterparts. To elaborate its practical applications, a hybrid device was fabricated manifesting high specific capacity values of 424.8 C/g (5 mV/s) and 252.56 C/g (0.7 A/g). Also, maximum energy of 59.6 Wh/kg was acquired by the device while having power of 595 W/kg. The assembled hybrid device was inspected to study its storage mechanism separately by using Dunn's model which validates theoretically the experimental outcomes. These results justify the exceptional performance of SrS/PANI composites, therefore can be recognized as novel promising contender for battery-supercapacitor applications.
