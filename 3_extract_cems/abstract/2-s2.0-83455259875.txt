A novel architecture of nickel current collector (NCC) is fabricated cost-effectively by electrospinning. An ultrathin MnO 2 coating is electrodeposited on to the NCC and the resultant nano-networks of MnO 2 shell/NCC core are used as supercapacitor electrodes. Excellent electrochemical performance is revealed at a high charge/discharge rate. The cyclic voltammetry measurements show that the current is stable even at a scan rate as fast as 200 mV s -1. A capacitance of 214 F g -1 is obtained by galvanostatic testing at a current density as large as 20 A g -1, which is much higher than that of MnO 2 coated Ni foam.
