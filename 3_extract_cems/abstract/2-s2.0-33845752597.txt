Ni(OH)2 electrode doping with Co was prepared on porous nickel by electrochemical co-deposition technology. Capacitance performance of C/Ni(OH)2 supercapacitor was studied in the ethanol and water with volume ratios 3:7, 1:1, 7:3, respectively and water solution. XRD and EDS analysis indicates that the product is Î±-Ni (OH)2 doping with Co. Charge-discharge tests show that the supercapacitor can acquire the best characteristics in the ethanol and water with volume ratio 1:1, and the single electrode specific capacitances can reach 850 F/g and 600 F/g at 4 mA/cm and 32 mA/cm, respectively. SEM images show that such Ni(OH)2 particles exhibit a honeycombed structure, which increases specific surface area contacted between the active material and electrolyte and makes electrochemical reactions more fully, so that the utilization ratio and the value of discharge specific capacitance of the active material are increased gready.
