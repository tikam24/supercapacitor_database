This paper presents the supercapacitors (SC) behavior characterization using the temperature combined to the frequency of the dc-current ripples called here electro-thermal stress. To characterize the evolution of the resistance and the capacitance of the SC, the authors have evaluated the impact of the state of charge (SoC), the number of cycles, the temperature, and the temperature combined to the frequency of the dc-current ripples. This approach enables to show the variations of the SCs resistance and capacitance according to the real constraints imposed by application. The main contribution of this paper is focused on the SCs aging characterization and modeling, using the electro-thermal stress. The experimental tests of the SC characterization and modeling are based on the charge/discharge operations, using the fluctuating and no-fluctuating dc-current waveforms. The proposed model takes into account the variations of the resistance and capacitance of the SC according to the temperature, the frequency of dc-current ripples and the SoC. The terminal voltage of the SC obtained from the proposed model is close to the experimental result, with an error about 1%. So, the proposed model is satisfactory to predict the SCs behavior during the charge/discharge operations using a fluctuating dc-current combined to a variable temperature and SoC.
