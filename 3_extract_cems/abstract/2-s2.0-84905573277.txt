Thread-like electronic devices have attracted great interest because of their potential applications in wearable electronics. To produce high-performance, thread-like supercapacitors, a mixture of stable dispersions of single-walled carbon nanotubes and conducting polyaniline nanowires are prepared. Then, the mixture is spun into flexible yarns with a polyvinyl alcohol outer sheath by a one-step spinning process. The composite yarns show excellent mechanical properties and high electrical conductivities after sufficient washing to remove surfactants. After applying a further coating layer of gel electrolyte, two flexible yarns are twisted together to form a thread-like supercapacitor. The supercapacitor based on these two yarns (SWCNTs and PAniNWs) possesses a much higher specific capacitance than that based only on pure SWCNTs yarns, making it an ideal energy-storage device for wearable electronics. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and polyaniline nanowires (PAniNWs) are spun into flexible yarn from a dispersion by a one-step process. Thread-like supercapacitors assembled from this yarn electrode can provide promising energy storage devices for wearable electronics. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
