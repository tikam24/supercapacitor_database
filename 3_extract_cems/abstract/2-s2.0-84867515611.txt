We demonstrate a facile synthesis of hierarchically driven single crystalline ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2) nanorods on few-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a simple thermal treatment from the hydrated RuO 2 precursors at 250 °C. We also describe the fundamental electrochemical behavior of RuO 2-CNTs 1-dimensional (1-D) hetero-nanostructures for their possible application as supercapacitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
