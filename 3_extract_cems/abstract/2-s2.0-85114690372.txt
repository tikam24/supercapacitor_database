For the past few years, two-dimensional materials have attracted widespread attention owing to their special properties and potential applications. It is well-known that graphene, transition metal disulfide compounds (TMDC), carbon nitride, transition metal carbonitrides (Mxenes), silene and hexagonal boron nitride are typical two-dimensional materials. Compared with these traditional two-dimensional materials, two-dimensional MOF is favored by numerous researchers because of its unique structure. Based on the unique metal ion and organic ligand coordination of MOF and two-dimensional layered structure, the applications of two-dimensional MOF were getting serious, including catalysis, supercapacitor, gas adsorption/separation, sensors and so on. This review presents a relatively comprehensive summary of the design & synthesis and applications of two-dimensional MOF over the past few years. Furthermore, the opportunities and challenges have been discussed to supply a promising prospect to this field.
