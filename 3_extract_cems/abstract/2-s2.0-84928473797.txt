A novel transparent supercapacitor with a photoactive layer and a capacitive structure integrated into one device is presented here. This device has achieved the combined abilities of self-charging under illumination and self-storage of photogenerated electrical signals. The photogenerated current density is about 2 mA g<sup>-1</sup>. The specific capacitance is about 140 F g<sup>-1</sup>. Its photosensing can function without an external bias voltage given by a heavy power source, so it has great potential to be integrated into portable equipment. Moreover, this device can be easily assembled through a packaging-free process by using all-solid-state gel electrolytes.
