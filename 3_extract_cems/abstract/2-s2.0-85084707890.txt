Carbon materials have been widely used in fabricating supercapacitors. However, their capacitive performance is poor but can be improved by means of heteroatom doping and increasing active sites. Herein, a green and facile strategy is introduced to synthesize a heteroatom carbon/CeO2 nanoparticles complex (HCCN-x, including C, N, O, and Ce elements) using a natural plant, yellow bean sprout, as the carbon source. According to the results, the calcination temperature provides great influence on the electrochemical properties of HCCN-x. In comparison with HCCN-600 and HCCN-700, the HCCN-800 electrode exhibits outstanding performance with the gravimetric capacitance being up to 752 F g-1 and the capacitance retention remaining 97.5% after 10 Â»000 cycles. Besides, the HCCN-800 electrodes are also assembled in the symmetric supercapacitors with the energy density being 25.5 Wh kg-1. Our research opens up a novel avenue for designing of biomass carbon composites in energy conversion and storage utilization.
