Biomass-activated carbon materials are promising electrode materials for lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LiCs) because of their natural hierarchical pore structure. The efficient utilization of structural pores in activated carbon is very important for their electrochemical performance. Herein, porous biomass-activated carbon (PAC) with large specific surface area was prepared using a one-step activation method with biomass waste as the carbon source and ZnCl2 as the activator. To further improve its pore structure utilization efficiency, the PAC was doped with nitrogen using urea as the nitrogen source. The experimental results confirmed that PAC-1 with a high nitrogen doping level of 4.66% exhibited the most efficient pore utilization among all the samples investigated in this study. PAC-1 exhibited 92% capacity retention after 8000 cycles, showing good cycling stability. Then, to maximize the utilization of high-efficiency energy storage devices, LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA), a promising cathode material for lithium-ion batteries with high specific capacity, was compounded with PAC-1 in different ratios to obtain NCA@PC composites. The NCA@PC-9 composite exhibited excellent capacitance in LiCs and an energy density of 105.45 Wh kg-1 at a high power density of 13.3 kW kg-1. These results provide guidelines for the design of high-performance and low-cost energy storage devices.
