Harmful gas leakage often occurs in the engine room of ocean-going ships. Among these harmful gases, NO2 gas accounts for a high proportion. Generally, sensors for detecting NO2 gas in the machinery space have problems such as small detection range, poor sensitivity, and poor stability. Therefore, we present a novel self-powered sensing prototype using electronic printing. This prototype consists of a flexible thermoelectric film and a flexible gas sensor. At 80K temperature difference, the maximum output voltage and power of the prototype reached 102.5 mv and 64.5Î¼w, respectively. The prototype can charge the supercapacitor (5.5 V, 0.47uF) to 5.5 v in 10 minutes. The sensitivity, selectivity and repeatability of gas sensor in different concentration gas environment were studied. The results show that in the range of 20 -100 ppm, the detection current of NO2 concentration curve is approximately linear. The prototype has good stability and repeatability. After 1,000 flexibility tests, the prototype still has high flexibility. After connecting the boost circuit, the prototype can drive the single chip microcomputer to realize the self-power supply and danger. This study provides a new way for the monitoring of harmful gases in the ship engine rooms.
