Herein, binder-free Co 3 O 4 @NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide (Co 3 O 4 @LDH) core-shell hybrid architectural nanowire arrays were prepared via a two-step hydrothermal synthesis route. LDH nanosheets possessing a large electroactive surface area uniformly dispersed on the surface of Co 3 O 4 nanowires were successfully fabricated allowing for fast electron transport that enhances the electrochemical performance of LDH nanosheets. Co 3 O 4 @LDH nanowire arrays of 2 to 1.5 molar ratio (Co 3 O 4 :LDH) exhibit high specific capacitance (1104 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 ), adequate rate capability and cycling stability (87.3% after 5000 cycles), attributed to the synergistic effect between the robust Co 3 O 4 nanowire arrays and LDH nanosheets.
