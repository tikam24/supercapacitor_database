Graphene is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs) due to its large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and chemical and mechanical stability. It is a single-atom thick substrate that may be used for the growth of functional nanomaterials and can have synergistic effects with other materials to greatly improve the specific capacitance of SCs. Recently, numerous studies have been carried out with graphene-based composites as SC electrodes. In this article, we will first review briefly the parameters and factors that affect the performance of SCs, and then discuss various types of graphene-based composite materials for SC electrodes, including graphene-conducting polymer composites, graphene-transition metal oxides/hydroxides/sulfide composites, graphene-heteroatoms composites, graphene-other carbonaceous nanomaterial composites, and graphene-based ternary composites. Lastly, the perspective of the critical issues for high performance SCs based on graphene composites will be discussed.
