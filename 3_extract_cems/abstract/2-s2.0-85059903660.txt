A novel high-performance electrode material based on fluoro-functionalized graphene oxide (GOF)/polyaniline (PANI) composites was synthesized via in situ polymerization of monomer in the presence of GOF. The composite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the field emission scanning electron micrographs. The electrochemical properties of the composites were measured based on cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and AC impedance spectroscopy. When the obtained composites with a mass ratio is 3% GOF/PANI, the results showed that GOF as a support material provides additional electron transfer paths, as well as active sites, for the electrochemical redox reaction of PANI, which helps to increase its pseudocapacitance. A specific capacitance of 502 F·g -1 was obtained at a current density of 1.0 A·g -1 in 1 mol·L -1 H 2 SO 4 , as well as excellent cycling stability with 95% of its initial capacitance after 600 cycles. These encouraging results illustrate the exciting potential for high-performance, electrical energy storage devices based on this new class of carbon material.
