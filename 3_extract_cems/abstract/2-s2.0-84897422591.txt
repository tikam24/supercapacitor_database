Three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical hybrid nanomaterials (GNR-MnO 2) of graphene nanoribbons (GNR) and MnO2 nanoparticles have been prepared via a one-step method. GNR, with unique features such as high aspect ratio and plane integrity, has been obtained by longitudinal unzipping of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). By tuning the amount of oxidant used, different mass loadings of MnO2 nanoparticles have been uniformly deposited on the surface of GNRs. Asymmetric supercapacitors have been fabricated with the GNR-MnO2 hybrid as the positive electrode and GNR sheets as the negative electrode. Due to the desirable porous structure, excellent electrical conductivity, as well as high rate capability and specific capacitances of both the GNR and GNR-MnO2 hybrid, the optimized GNR//GNR-MnO2 asymmetric supercapacitor can be cycled reversibly in an enlarged potential window of 0-2.0 V. In addition, the fabricated GNR//GNR-MnO2 asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits a significantly enhanced maximum energy density of 29.4 W h kg-1 (at a power density of 12.1 kW kg-1), compared with that of the symmetric cells based on GNR-MnO2 hybrids or GNR sheets. This greatly enhanced energy storage ability and high rate capability can be attributed to the homogeneous dispersion and excellent pseudocapacitive performance of MnO2 nanoparticles and the high electrical conductivity of the GNRs.
