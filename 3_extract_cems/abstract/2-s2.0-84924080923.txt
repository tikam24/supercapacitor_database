Supercapacitors were prepared using either two polypyrrole (PPy) composite electrodes or one PPy composite and one activated carbon electrode. The PPy composite electrodes were either freestanding paper-like sheets or PPy films printed on graphite ink coated aluminium/PET laminate substrates, using Cladophora algae derived cellulose as the substrate or binder, respectively. The specific capacitance of the PPy electrodes was found to be about 200 F g-1 depending on the manufacturing method, yielding supercapacitors with capacitances between 0.45 and 3.8 F and energy efficiencies of over 90%. For an asymmetric device with activated carbon positive electrode and PPy negative electrode a capacitance loss of 5% was seen after 14300 cycles.
