In this paper, the power of the energy harvesting circuit using the PVDF (Polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric sensor transformed by vortex was analyzed. For power analysis, a general bridge diode rectifier circuit and a P-SSHI (Parallel Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Inductor) rectifier circuit with a switching circuit were used. The P-SSHI circuit is a circuit that incorporates a parallel synchronous switch circuit at the input of a general rectifier circuit to improve energy conversion efficiency. In this paper, the output power of general rectifier circuit and P-SSHI rectifier circuit is analyzed and verified through theory and experiment. It was confirmed that the efficiency was increased by 69 % through the experiment using the wind. In addition, a circuit for storing the harvested energy in the supercapacitor was implemented to confirm its applicability as a secondary battery.
