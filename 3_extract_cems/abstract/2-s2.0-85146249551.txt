Supercapacitors are one of the emerging energy devices due to the evolution in modern technologies which involve fast charging mechanisms with long-lasting stability and good retentivity. A hybrid quaternary composite of transition metal oxide consisting of MnO2, NiO, CuO nanospheres and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was synthesized by a fusion method with enhanced supercapacitive behaviour. This nanocomposite was subjected to various structural, functional, morphological and electrochemical characterizations and further fabricated into a symmetric supercapacitor with benefiting and facile design. The electrochemical studies were carried out under electrolytes with different pH and mole concentrations both under 3-electrode and 2-electrode systems. The highest specific capacitance of 816.51 F/g was obtained with energy and power densities of 72.57 W h/kg and 0.5 kW/kg. The highest power density of 2.5 kW/kg was achieved corresponding to the current density of 5 A/g. Excellent cyclic retention of 86.46% was achieved after 5000 cycles proving long-term cyclic stability under 1 M KOH. Unfolding the nanocomposite to be a virtuous reference for supercapacitorsâ€™ future.
