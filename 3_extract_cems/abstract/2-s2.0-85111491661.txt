Carbon fiber via electrochemical and hydrothermal activation (EACF and HACF) treatment is designed and fabricated as supercapacitor electrode material for effective energy storage. HACF with porous surface pit structure shows higher surface area (241.2 m2 g-1) than EACF with smooth surface structure (147.6 m2 g-1), causing the enhanced electrical double layer capacitance. HACF with predominant hydroxyl group is more feasible to introduce additional Faradaic capacitance rather than EACF with predominant carbonyl group and epoxy group. HACF exhibits higher response current density (3.26 A g-1) than EACF (1.92 A g-1) at the same scan rate. The specific capacitance declines from 18.8 to 11.9 F g-1 for EACF and from 28.8 to 18.3 F g-1 for HACF when current density increases from 1 to 10 A g-1, presenting obviously improved capacitance. The corresponding capacitance retention achieves 47.1 % and 48.9 %, presenting similar rate capability. The density-functional theory calculation results indicate HACF exhibits lower band gap, lower interface energy and higher density of states at Fermi energy level than EACF, indicating higher orbital electron cloud distribution and electrical conductivity. The experimental measurement results are well consistent with the theoretical calculation results to prove higher conductivity and electroactivity of HACF. HACF with superior capacitive performance presents the promising energy storage application.
