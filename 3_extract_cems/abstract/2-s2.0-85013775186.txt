The superior cycle life and power density exhibited by supercapacitors stimulate the research interest towards discovering new electrode materials with high specific capacitance and 100% cycle life. Here we demonstrate an enhancement in the electrochemical performance of MoS2@C composite nanofibers with reversibility over 2000 cycles towards supercapacitor application. MoS2@C composite nanofibers are synthesized by carbonization of stabilized electrospun MoS2/PVA composite mat and studied its morphology, composition, and crystal structure through various characterizations. The electrochemical performance of the MoS2@C electrode studied in 6 M KOH electrolyte shows a significant enhancement of specific capacitance than bulk MoS2. The MoS2@C nanofibers exhibit a high specific capacitance of 355.6 Fg−1at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1and long cycling stability with specific capacitance retention of 93% up to 2000 cycles.
