In this work, 3-layered PEDOT/PBEDOT-BT/PEDOT electrode processed by alternated layers of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly[5,5'-bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxin-5-yl)-2,2'-bithiophene](PBEDOT-BT) were prepared by electrochemical layer-by-layer deposition. The electrochemical and structural properties and the capacitive properties of it were investigated through the methods of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, galvanostatical charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. In all cases, the capacitive properties of 3-layered PEDOT/PBEDOT-BT/PEDOT systems were better than those of individual conducting polymers (PEDOT or PBEDOT-BT), which may be caused by the synergistic effects at the interfaces between consecutive layers and the higher porosity of the 3-layered materials. Furthermore, 3-layered PEDOT/PBEDOT-BT/PEDOT electrode has been used to fabricate a symmetric supercapacitor (assembled by two identical electrodes), which showed a high specific capacitance (97 F g-1) and an excellent specific energy (260 Wh kg-1).
