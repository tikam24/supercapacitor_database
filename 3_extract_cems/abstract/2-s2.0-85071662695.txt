Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has great potential for application in supercapacitor applications. Increasing the energy storage capacity in RGO-based supercapacitors is an important issue. We report that using an immersion precipitation for the poly(vinylidene fluoride) binder for the RGO supercapacitor electrodes enhances the energy storage capacity. The specific capacitance was increased by 20∼200% by using this process, resulting in the highest specific capacitance of 167 ± 8 F g-1. Higher increase was observed at higher scan rates and when more PVDF was used for the electrode fabrication. Detailed electrochemical investigation results, scanning electron microscopy results, and energy dispersive spectroscopy results are presented. This simple, environmentally friendly, and low-cost modification of the fabrication process for RGO supercapacitors may be applicable for performance enhancement for large-scale produced RGO supercapacitors.
