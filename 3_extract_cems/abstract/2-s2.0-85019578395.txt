Through the simple hydrolysis of FeCl3 in boiling water, Fe(OH)3 colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) can be achieved that exhibit a highly positively charge. Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets are negatively charged when dispersed in water. Inspired by these fascinating characteristics, a 2D layered α-Fe2O3/rGO hybrid film (FGHF) was fabricated through colloidal electrostatic self-assembly with subsequent vacuum filtration and hydrothermal reduction. In this hybrid film, cubical α-Fe2O3 NPs are well-distributed on rGO sheets, which can provide sufficient active interfacial sites and effectively alleviate the volume variation of α-Fe2O3 NPs during electrochemical reactions. The as-obtained FGHF exhibits a high specific capacitance of 714 F g−1 and an outstanding rate capability of 42.6 % retention at 30 A g−1. Moreover, a flexible supercapacitor was fabricated, which can achieve a high volumetric capacitance of 16.45 F cm−3, leading to an energy density of 1.46 mWh cm−3 and a power density of 199.8 mW cm−3. The flexible nature of the FGHF allows the as-fabricated supercapacitor to remain undamaged with almost no change in capacitive performance when bending up to 180°.
