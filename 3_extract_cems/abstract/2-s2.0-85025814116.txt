We have fabricated a micro-supercapacitor with porous silicon electrodes coated with TiN by atomic layer deposition technique. The coating provides an efficient surface passivation and high electrical conductivity of the electrodes, resulting in stable and almost ideal electrochemical double layer capacitor behavior with characteristics comparable to the best carbon based micro-supercapacitors. Stability of the supercapacitor is verified by performing 50 000 voltammetry cycles with high capacitance retention obtained. Silicon microfabrication techniques facilitate integration of both supercapacitor electrodes inside the silicon substrate and, in this work, such in-chip supercapacitor is demonstrated. This approach allows realization of very high capacitance per foot print area. The in-chip micro-supercapacitor can be integrated with energy harvesting elements and can be used in wearable and implantable microdevices.
