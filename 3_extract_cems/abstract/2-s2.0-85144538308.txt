Supercapacitor, which has a series of advantages such as fast charge and discharge, high specific capacitance as well as good cycle stability, has become an important energy storage device, whose performance mainly depends on the electrochemical properties of electrode materials. Composite nanomaterials with high specific surface area and environmental friendliness are ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this paper, nickel-molybdenum nanosheets were grown on the surface of cobalt hydroxide nanowires on the carbon cloth substrate by a two-step hydrothermal method to achieve CoO@NiMo-O(P) composite nanomaterials after low temperature annealing and phosphorlation. The morphology, structure and chemical valence of the samples were characterized and analyzed by SEM, TEM and XPS. The results of electrochemical tests show that the hierarchical CoO@NiMo-O(P) composites has good capacitance performance. The specific capacitance reaches 1 304.55 F/g at a low current density of 1 A/g, and a capacity retention of 87% is exhibited after 1 000 charge and discharge at a current density of 10 A/g, showing good cycle stability.
