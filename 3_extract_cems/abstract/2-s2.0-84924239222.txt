Co9S8, Ni3S2, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) were combined to construct a graphene composite with two mixed metal sulfide components. Co9S8/RGO/Ni3S2 composite films were hydrothermal-assisted synthesized on nickel foam (NF) by using a modified ′′active metal substrate' route in which nickel foam acted as both a substrate and Ni source for composite films. It is found that the Co9S8/RGO/Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits superior capacitive performance with high capability (13.53 F cm-2 at 20 mA cm-2, i.e., 2611.9 F g-1 at 3.9 A g-1), excellent rate capability, and enhanced electrochemical stability, with 91.7% retention after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles even at a high current density of 80 mA cm-2.
