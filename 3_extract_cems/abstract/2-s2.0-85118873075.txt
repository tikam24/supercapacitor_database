The research on developing cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4)-based materials with high energy and power densities for energy storage devices has sprung up in the field of transition metal silicates (TMSs)-type supercapacitors (SCs). However, the electrochemical performances of the reported Co2SiO4-based materials are not enough desirable owing to the poor conductivity and narrow voltage ranges originated from the intrinsic shortcomings of Co2SiO4. Herein, we design a double-sandwich-like composite, C@Co,CoO/Co2SiO4/rGO/Co2SiO4/C@Co,CoO (denoted as C@Co,CoO/Co2SiO4/rGO) architecture, to improve the electrochemical performance of Co2SiO4, where, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is inside, both sides of rGO are coated by Co2SiO4, and carbon@cobalt/cobalt oxide (C@Co,CoO) are formed on the surface of Co2SiO4. This integrated construction can not only avert the sluggish mass/electron transfer progress caused by the conventional Co2SiO4, C@Co,CoO and rGO multi-phase mixture system, but also improve the cycle stability by protecting Co2SiO4 from the dissolution and structural collapse during the electrochemical process. As expected, the double-sandwich-like C@Co,CoO/Co2SiO4/rGO displays promising electrochemical performances. At 0.5 A·g−1, it achieves the specific capacitance of 360 F·g−1 (324 C·g−1) in the potential interval of − 0.4 V ∼ 0.5 V, and super long lifespan with 88 % after 15,000 cycles. Moreover, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device C@Co,CoO/Co2SiO4/rGO//AC displays the capacitance with 687 mF·cm−2 at 1 mA·cm−2, energy density with 1.373 Wh·m−2 at 1.5 W·m−2, and even shows practical application for lightening the LED bulb. This work provides an idea for the preparation of the integrated double-sandwich-like carbon/TMSs/carbon architecture to boost the electrochemical performance of TMSs.
