A simple method combining extraction operation and thermo-treatment was applied to synthesize a ultra-thin porous carbon film by using α-cellulose solution as precursor. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the structure porous carbon film, and cyclic voltammetry, charging-discharging tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to test the electrochemical properties of the prepared film. The effect of the structure on the electrochemical performance was also investigated. The results showed that the prepared ultra-thin porous carbon film exhibits porous structure with thickness of about 1.5 μm. Moreover, the porous carbon film has a highest specific capacitance of 169 F•g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A•g-1, and a capacitance retention of 80% at 2 A•g-1 after 5 000 cycles. Notably, the Coulombic efficiency kept 100% simultaneously during the process of cyclic charge-discharge.
