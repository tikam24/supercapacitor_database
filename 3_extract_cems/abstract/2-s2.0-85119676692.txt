As an electrochemical energy storage material, transition metal layered double hydroxides (MLDHs) have attracted attention due to tunable two-dimensional structure and low cost. In this study, NiMn-LDH@MWCNT composites with hierarchical structure have been successfully synthesized with simple and economical one-step hydrothermal method. The hierarchical structure of composites was formed by NiMn-LDH nanosheets growing directly on multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). This design not only can maintain excellent network conductive channels, but also increase active sites, enlarge specific surface area, and reduce internal resistance. Our results show that the NiMn-LDH-4 composite exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1863 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 1164 F g−1 when the current density goes up 10 times. This may be attributed to the synergy effect of the hierarchical structure and introduction MWCNT. Moreover, the assembled NiMn-LDH-4//AC device can provide a relatively high specific energy density of 51.5 Wh kg−1 at a high energy density of 455.7 W kg−1 and possess great cycling stability (83.9 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles).
