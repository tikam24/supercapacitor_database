With the increasing consumption of global fossil energy and environmental pollution, the development of green renewable energy and efficient energy storage technology become an urgent problem to solve. Supercapacitors have drawn a great interest for use in wearable electronic devices due to their portability and stable performance. The electrode is very important when preparing a high-performance flexible supercapacitor, which requires good electrochemical performance and flexibility. Graphene and nanocellulose are excellent flexible electrode material for supercapacitors, and nanocellulose is often used as a substrate material for electronic devices because of its good biodegradability, mechanical flexibility and chemical reactivity. In this work, the structure design and assembly method of the nanocellulose-graphene composite materials used for flexible supercapacitors are reviewed. The mechanical ﬂexibility, speciﬁc capacitance, electrochemical performance, cyclic stability, renewability and biodegradability are taken into account, so as to evaluate the performance of the composite materials and to better assess the merits of this material with respect to real applications.
