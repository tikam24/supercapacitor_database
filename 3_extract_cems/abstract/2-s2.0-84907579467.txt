To achieve long-term and stable running of standalone microgrid, a multiple complementary system composed of ultracapacitors, batteries and diesel generators is proposed to coordinate the share of unbalanced power. In order to enhance the overall performance of the multiple system, a double-layer energy management and coordination strategy based on priority and characteristics of different units is proposed. By the power climbing limit control, a coordinative distribution method based on the current state of charge (SOC) of ultracapacitors and real-time volatility is designed. This method is able to standardize the output power of batteries and reduce the frequent fluctuations they understand as well as ensure the energy priority of ultracapacitors. To guarantee sufficient energy of energy storage, the diesel generator is operated to coordinate the running of battery by its SOC. Case studies indicate that the proposed strategy has preferable advantages; meanwhile, it's easy for the real-time and fast distribution algorithm to realize engineering applications.
