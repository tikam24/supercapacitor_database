Efficient materials for electrochemical energy storage have received much attention. Herein we report a green metal-free route to synthesize pyridyl conjugated microporous polymers (PCMPs) as precursors for nitrogen-doped porous carbon microspheres (NCMs) with high surface areas up to 1232 m2 g−1 via a simple carbonization method. The resulting NCMs as supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high specific capacitance of 324 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, and high rate ability (182 F g−1 at 10 A g−1), and excellent cyclability (remained >97 % of initial capacitance at 2 A g−1 after 10000 cycles). This work also presents that molecular engineering of PCMP precursor, pyrolysis temperature and charge/discharge cycling allow the electrochemical energy storage properties of the NCMs to be controlled.
