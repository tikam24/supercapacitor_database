This paper presents a strategy to avoid peak demand rising and energy management due to existing cranes at container terminals (CT). The new generation of the Ship to Shore (STS) cranes installed at the port of Long Beach (POLB) are equipped with the capabilities to absorb up to 90% of the regenerative energy (RE). Hence, a percent of RE is fed into the dc-bus in an STS Crane and deliver to the Ultracapacitor (UC) bank energy storage system (ESS). As an effective method, UC sizing is able to do the local peak shaving in each STS Crane and then with the remaining percent of the RE by the duty cycle coordination for the STS group Cranes the overall peak power minimization in point of delivery has been reviewed based on PSO algorithm. Results in MATLAB shows the two proposed methods can reduce the peak power demand and increase the percentage of the utilization energy factor (UEF) in STS cranes.
