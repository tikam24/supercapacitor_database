This paper reports details of the design, fabrication and characterisation of a solid- state fabric supercapacitor device. The proposed supercapacitors were based on fabric electrodes fabricated with low cost carbon materials via a spray coating technique. The two layer supercapacitors achieved a specific capacitances of 10.6 F.g-1, area capacitance of 71.8 mF.cm-2 and maintained 99% of the initial capacitance after cycling the device for more than 15000 times.
