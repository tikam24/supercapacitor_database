Polyaniline (PAni)/MnWO 4 nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by in situ polymerization method under ultrasonication and the MnWO 4 was prepared by surfactant assisted ultrasonication method. The thermal stability of PAni was determined by TG/DTA (Thermo Gravimetric/ Differential thermal analysis). The structural and morphological features of PAni, MnWO 4 and PAni/MnWO 4 composite was analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images. The electro-chemical properties of PAni, MnWO 4 and its composites with different weight percentage of MnWO 4 loading were studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV) for the application of supercapacitors as active electrode materials. From the cyclic voltammogram, 50% of MnWO 4 impregnated PAni showed a high specific capacitance (SC) of 481 F/g than their individual counterparts of PAni (396 F/g) and MnWO 4 (18 F/g). The galvanostatic charge-discharge studies indicate the in situ polymerized composite shows greater specific capacitance (475 F/g) than the physical mixture (346 F/g) at a constant discharge current of 1 mA/cm 2 with reasonable cycling stability. The charge transfer resistance (R ct ) of PAni/MnWO 4 composite (22 ohm) was calculated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and compared with its physical mixture (58 ohm).
