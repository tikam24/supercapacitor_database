An activated carbon material for electrical energy storage was prepared via the treatment of straw-based carbon with acidic solution. The structures and compositions of the treated carbon were characterized by scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer and Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer. The effect of acidic solution treatment on the electrochemical performance of the carbon was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The results show that the acidic solution treatment causes the dissolution of inorganic substance and the decrease of the silicate content, and the activated carbon exhibits superior electrochemical property. The specific capacitance increases with increasing the treatment time. The cyclic voltammetry curves for the treated carbon shows electrochemical reversibility. The maximum specific capacitance of the treated carbons by an acidic solution is 426.3F/g, which is increased by 50%, compared to the original carbon. The specific capacitance of the activated carbon is 97.2% after 3000 cycles.
