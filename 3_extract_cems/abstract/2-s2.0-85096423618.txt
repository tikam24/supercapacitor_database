In this paper, we present the effectiveness of using dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) in order to mitigate power quality disturbances like voltage sag, swell, short interruption, imbalance and fluctuation in three-phase distribution networks. This work investigates a basic architecture of DVR comprising phase locked loop (PLL) and proportional integral (PI) compensator as control elements and super capacitor as the energy storage device for high power density applications. Super capacitor is superior to the conventional battery storage systems in regard to highly efficient performance during long term and short term disturbances. Phase modulator is used to generate discrete pulse width modulation (PWM) switching signals for an IGBT based voltage source converter. The total harmonic distortion (THD) values during voltage disturbance events are computed considering with and without compensation cases. The performance evaluations of the proposed system are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink Â® and the results corroborate the efficacy of the presented framework.
