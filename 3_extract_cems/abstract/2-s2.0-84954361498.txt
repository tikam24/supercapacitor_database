The facile hydrothermal synthesis of a patronite VS4/single-walled carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide hybrid is reported. Detailed electrochemical investigations of the hybrid revealed an exceptionally high energy density of ca. 174 W h/kg. A comparison of this value with those of other supercapacitor electrodes based on metal sulfides and also some with high energy-density values revealed the potential of the patronite hybrid as a fitting candidate for possible application in energy-storage devices. Charge-discharge stability measurements showed the excellent specific capacitance of the hybrid, which has a retention capability of ca. 97 % after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. High-energy-density supercapacitors based on VS4/carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide (VS4/CNTs/RGO) hybrids are synthesized for possible application as energy-storage devices.
