In this work the effect of concentration of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in the synthesis of Nickel doped Manganese oxide (Ni-MnO2) nanoparticles have been carried out by adopting the sol-gel process. The synthesized products were characterized by XRD, Infra- Red (FTIR) and SEM analysis. The XRD confirms the formation of Ni-MnO2 nanoparticles illustrate peak at 31.4Â°with lattice plane (-231). The IR spectra correspond to the peak at 592 and 846cm-1 attributed to the characteristics peak for Ni-MnO2 nanoparticles. The SEM images for all three Ni-MnO2 nanoparticles for different concentration of CTAB allows us to assess the formation route of nano tentacles from 10mM, 30mM and 50 mM. The configured nano tentacles of Ni-MnO2 nanoparticles presumably leads to more significantly change its properties, particularly in its electrochemical properties show the ways to be suitable candidates for supercapacitor, battery, photo catalytic and fuel cell applications.
