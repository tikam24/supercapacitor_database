Activated ordered mesoporous carbon (AOMC) material was prepared by a one-step carbonization/activation method using SBA-15 as hard template, furfuryl alchohol (FA) as carbon source and ZnCl2 as activation agent. The as-synthesized AOMC possesses hierarchical micro/mesoporous structure and high BET surface area (up to 1465.7 m2 g- 1), which accelerate the ion-transport and charge-transfer during charging/discharging process for supercapacitors. A maximum specific capacitance value of 270 F g- 1 for AOMC electrode at a current density of 1 A g- 1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution was obtained from the charge-discharge curves. Meanwhile, it also exhibited outstanding rate performance (~ 80% capacity retention from 0.5 A g- 1 to 20 A g- 1) and excellent cycling stability (âˆ¼ 94% retention after 5000 continuous charge-discharge cycles). The assembled AOMC-based symmetric cell delivers a maximum energy density of 11.8 Wh kg- 1 at a power density of 450.1 W kg- 1 under a voltage range of 0-1.8 V in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte.
