Developing supercapacitor electrodes with ultra-long cycle life and high specific capacitance is critical to the future energy storage devices. Here, we synthesized manganese dioxide nanoparticles anchored on reduced graphene oxide (MnO2/RGO) aerogel through a simple self-assembled hydrothermal and freeze-drying method. The morphology and structure were characterized by a series of characterization techniques. The 3D MnO2/RGO composite aerogel exhibits a high specific capacitance up to 252 F/g at current density of 1 A/g and 146 F/g even at 40 A/g.A remarkable cycling stability, with 87.8 % of the initial capacitance remained after 10 000 charging/discharging cycles at 20 A/g was also achieved. The high performance is ascribed to 3D graphene aerogel not only provides a good support to stabilize MnO2 but also facilitates the fast ion mobility and electron transfer.In addition, MnO2 can inhibit agglomeration and overlap of GO nanosheet.
