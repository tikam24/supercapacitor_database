The composite thin films of Silver-activated carbon/polyaniline (Ag-AC/PANI) have been deposited on stainless steel substrates by a facile dip coating technique. The formation of Ag-AC/PANI electrode is analyzed by Fourier transform infrared, Fourier transform-Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed the presence of Ag nanoparticles on the porous spongy background of PANI. The highest specific capacitance of 567 Fg-1at 5 mV s-1 and energy density of 86.30 W h kg-1 at 1 mA cm-2 is observed for the Ag-AC/PANI indicating positive synergistic effect of silver, activated carbon and PANI. In which silver nanoparticles help in improving the electronic conductivity and activated carbon enhances the electrochemical stability of the PANI electrodes. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
