The operation of electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices at low temperatures as normal as at room temperature is of great significance for their low-temperature environment application. However, such operation is plagued by the sluggish ions transport kinetics, which leads to the severe capacity decay or even failure of devices at low-temperature conditions. In this review, the difficulties of ions transport in electrolyte, electrolyte/electrode interface, and electrode material at low temperatures are discussed in depth, and the reported strategies to solve the corresponding problems are surveyed subsequently. Finally, the views on how to build high-performance low-temperature-available EES devices as well as their development directions are put forward.
