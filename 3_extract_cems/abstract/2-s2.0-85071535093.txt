Cu-doped Ni-based metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) nanomaterials fabricated through a one-pot hydrothermal reaction were characterized, and their performance as supercapacitor electrode materials was further studied for the first time. The results indicated that the doping of foreign metals and the introduction of K3[Fe(CN)6] in the KOH electrolyte significantly improve the performance of the supercapacitor. The results indicated that the Ni2.6Cu0.4 MOFs material shows the highest specific capacitance (1282 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in mixed 2 M KOH and 0.1 M K3[Fe(CN)6]) and optimal capacitance retention (85.7% after 2000 cycles). This work provides a feasible optimization strategy for the construction of MOFs-based supercapacitor electrode materials with excellent performance, and also provides a reliable experimental and theoretical basis for practical industrial production.
