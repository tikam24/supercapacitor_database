This paper describes dynamic modeling and proportional-plus-integral (PI) controlled based frequency regulation of isolated autonomous hybrid system comprising of different renewable energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) with fuel cell (FC) and diesel engine generator (DEG) along with the energy storage elements such as flywheel energy storage system (FESS) and battery energy storage system (BESS). Large band wind speed based on Van der Hoven's model and wind turbine dynamics is considered in this paper in order to analyze the frequency deviation. Ultracapacitor (UC) as an alternative energy storing element along with PI controllers has been considered in the hybrid systems in order to minimize the frequency deviation. A comparative assessment of frequency deviation for different hybrid systems in the presence of different storage system combinations reflect the improvements of the deviation in frequency profile in the presence of the ultracapacitors (UC) as compared to other storage elements.
