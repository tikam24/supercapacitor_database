In the nanocomposite of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and RuO 2 for supercapacitor electrode materials, upon immersion of the purified MWNT into a RuCl 3 solution, Ru metal having no contribution to pseudocapacitance was unexpectedly formed on the MWNT surface by spontaneous reduction, because of the higher Fermi level of MWNT than the absolute energy level of Ru/RuCl 3 pair. In contrast, no such phenomenon was observed for oxidized MWNT, because of lowered Fermi level and the surface carboxyl groups as protector against charge transfer. The oxidation treatment of MWNT is therefore not optional but rather is an essential process in nanocomposite. Â© 2006 American Institute of Physics.
