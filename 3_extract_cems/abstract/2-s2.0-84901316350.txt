A transparent polymer-hydrogel electrolyte was successfully synthesized on the basis of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a dopant electrolyte was used to dissolve PVA. Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) was then added into the PVA/H2SO4 solution. By analyzing their FTIR spectra, it was found that HEC interacts with PVA/H2SO4 in the form of a three dimensional polymeric network or HEC and PVA/H2SO4 chains existed in the hydrogel-polymer electrolytes. From the AC impedance spectroscopy, it was shown that the hydrogel-polymer electrolyte with 1 wt.% of HEC has the highest ionic conductivity. The highest capacitance of 160 F/g was given by the supercapacitor employing the hydrogel-polymer electrolyte with 1 wt.% of HEC as confirmed by its cyclic voltammetry. Â© 2014 The Authors.
