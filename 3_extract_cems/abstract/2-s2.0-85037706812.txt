Non-aqueous electrolytes (e.g., organic and ionic liquid electrolytes) can undergo high working voltage to improve the energy densities of supercapacitors. However, the large ion sizes, high viscosities, and low ionic conductivities of organic and ionic liquid electrolytes tend to cause the low specific capacitances, poor rate, and cycling performance of supercapacitors based on conventional micropore-dominant activated carbon electrodes, limiting their practical applications. Herein, we propose an effective strategy to simultaneously obtain high power and energy densities in non-aqueous electrolytes via using a cattle bone-derived porous carbon as an electrode material. Because of the unique co-activation of KOH and hydroxyapatite (HA) within the cattle bone, nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous carbon (referred to as NHPC-HA/KOH) is obtained and possesses a mesopore- and macropore-dominant porosity with an ultrahigh specific surface area (2203 m2 g-1) of meso- and macropores. The NHPC-HA/KOH electrodes exhibit superior performance with specific capacitances of 224 and 240 F g-1 at 5 A g-1 in 1.0 M TEABF4/AN and neat EMIMBF4 electrolyte, respectively. The symmetric supercapacitor using NHPC-HA/KOH electrodes can deliver integrated high energy and power properties (48.6 W h kg-1 at 3.13 kW kg-1 in 1.0 M TEABF4/AN and 75 W h kg-1 at 3.75 kW kg-1 in neat EMIMBF4), as well as superior cycling performance (over 89% of the initial capacitance after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g-1).
