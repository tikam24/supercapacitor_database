Supercapacitors have been widely used in both high-power applications and low-power applications due to their excellent power density. In practical applications, multiple su-percapacitor cells are typically connected in series as a stack to satisfy the specified voltage requirement. However, the lifetime of the supercapacitor stack is limited by the weakest cell, which degrades the performance of the supercapacitor stack. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a SoH-aware charging method for supercapacitors with the objective of maximizing the lifetime of the whole stack. The lifetime model of supercapacitors is analyzed and the state-of-health (SOH) of all cells is predicted by the model-predictive-control (MPC) algorithm. Then, an optimization problem is constructed with charging time and individual lifetime to balance the lifetime of all cells. By appropriately allocating the terminal voltages of cells, the lifetime of cells can be balanced and the lifetime of the supercapacitor stack is maximized. A laboratory testbed has been built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiment results show the proposed method can reduce the lifetime differences among cells and prolong the lifetime of the stack by 10% when compared with the classical method.
