Flexible electrode materials with high volumetric capacitance are promising to applications in portable and wearable capacitive storage devices. Here, we utilized the highly flexible and conductive NP-Ag substrate to successfully develop a flexible nanoporous Ag@Co(OH)2 (NP–Ag@Co(OH)2) thin film electrode. After 100 multiple bending cycles, the NP-Ag@Co(OH)2 electrode can keep the original nanostructures and flexibility. The flexible NP-Ag@Co(OH)2 electrode exhibits the high volumetric capacitance of 929 F cm−3 at a current density of 2 A cm−3, which is higher than many reported supercapacitor electrodes. The flexible NP-Ag@Co(OH)2 electrode exhibits good supercapacitor performance even under the bending state. Moreover, the as-assembled NP-Ag@Co(OH)2 symmetric supercapacitor device has high energy density of 20.07 mWh cm−3 at power density of 0.85 W cm−3. The device supercapacitor retains 75% capacitance of the initial value at 2 A cm−3 after 2000 cycles. This work provides an insight into the rational design of the highly flexible, high-performance supercapacitor electrodes with the potential application in portable or wearable energy storage devices.
