We report both a facile, scalable method to prepare reduced graphene oxide hydrogels through the electrodeposition of graphene oxide and its use as an electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. Such systems exhibited specific capacitances of 147 and 223 F g-1 at a current density of 10 A g-1 when using H2SO4 and H2SO4 + hydroquinone redox electrolytes, respectively. This journal is
