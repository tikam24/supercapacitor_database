Three-dimensional (3D) porous Bi2WO6/reduced graphene oxide hydrogels (BWO/rGO HGs) have been prepared via a facile one-pot hydrothermal process for supercapacitor applications. Compared with the pristine Bi2WO6 electrode, the 3D porous BWO/rGO HGs exhibit much higher capacitive performances with a specific capacitance of 268.7 F g−1 at a current density of 0.75 A g−1 and good cycling stability with 81% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at 3 A g−1. The remarkable electrochemical properties could be attributed to unique architecture of 3D porous rGO HGs supported Bi2WO6, which provided an excellent electrical conductivity substrate and more channels for ions diﬀusion. The results indicate that a new synthesis route of 3D porous structure hydrogel loaded binary metal oxide have potential applications in energy storage device.
