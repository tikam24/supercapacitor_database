Ships undertake more than 90% of the logistics and transportation of world trade, but shipping also brings about a large amount of pollutant emissions. According to statistics, 30% and 5% of global pollutants NOx and SOx come from ships. With the continuous introduction of new regulations and policies, green and low-carbon has become the current development trend of ships. The application of new energy power generation through inverter control technology to connect to the ship's power grid is one of the technical approaches, of which photovoltaic power generation technology is representative. Through the review of relevant literature and books, learn the working principles and characteristics of each component of the photovoltaic power generation system, and complete the selection and design of the main equipment of the system according to the needs of ro-ro ships.
