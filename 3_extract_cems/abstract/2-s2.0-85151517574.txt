Micro-supercapacitors have high power density, long lifetime, quick charge, and applications in wearable devices and portable electronics. The functioning of micro-supercapacitors is mainly dependent on the charge storage mechanism in electrodes. A laser is a promising tool to pattern supercapacitor electrodes by photothermal, photochemical, etc. The laser provides a fast, efficient, cheap, and low defect fabrication of supercapacitor. The different laser parameters that affect the final device are discussed in the article. The various processes associated with lasers and their effects on materials are elaborated. Different materials exhibit electric double-layer behavior, pseudocapacitance, or hybrid nature. The progress in laser-derived materials in each type of charge storage mechanism and the final direct laser-based fabrication of supercapacitors focusing on recent areas are mentioned in detail.
