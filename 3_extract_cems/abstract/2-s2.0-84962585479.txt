The supercapacitors are electrical energy storage devices with high power density, low series resistance and they can be charged and discharged millions of times. That makes supercapacitors as promising solution for application in the starting process of the internal combustion engines (ICE). In the paper application of the small capacity ultracapacitor bank with DC-DC converter is analyzed for the ICE starting. The starting process of the ICE is analyzed more delicate to understand starting time and energy. A prototype is designed and tested under real conditions. Experimental results are registered and included in the paper.
