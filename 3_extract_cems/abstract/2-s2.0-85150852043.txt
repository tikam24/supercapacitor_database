Porous carbon nanosheets are currently considered excellent electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. However, their ease of agglomeration and stacking nature reduce the available surface area and limit the electrolyte ion diffusion and transport, thereby leading to low capacitance and poor rate capability. To solve these problems, we report an adenosine blowing and KOH activation combination strategy to prepare crumpled nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanosheets (CNPCNS), which exhibit much higher specific capacitance and rate capability compared to flat microporous carbon nanosheets. The method is simple and capable of one-step scalable production of CNPCNS with ultrathin crumpled nanosheets, ultrahigh specific surface area (SSA), microporous and mesoporous structure and high heteroatom content. The optimized CNPCNS-800 with a thickness of 1.59 nm has an ultrahigh SSA of 2756 m2 g−1, high mesoporosity of 62.9% and high heteroatom content (2.6 at% for N, 5.4 at% for O). Consequently, CNPCNS-800 presents an excellent capacitance, high rate capability and long cycling stability both in 6 M KOH and EMIMBF4. More importantly, the energy density of the CNPCNS-800-based supercapacitor in EMIMBF4 can reach up to 94.9 W h kg−1 at 875 W kg−1 and is still 61.2 W h kg−1 at 35 kW kg−1
