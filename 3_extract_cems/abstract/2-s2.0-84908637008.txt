This article details an approach for the fabrication of MnO2 grafted V2O5 nanostructures to function as supercapacitor electrode. The MnO2 and V2O5 combined to form profitable hierarchical network morphology. Most importantly, both MnO2 and V2O5 contributed to energy storage. This type of synergetic architecture exhibits elevated specific capacitance (450 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1), good rate capacity (251 F g-1 at 5 A g-1) and provides better cycling stability (retaining 89% of capacitance after 500 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor using MnO2 grafted V2O5 and activated carbon (AC) as electrodes was assembled. It exhibits a specific capacitance of 61 F g-1 with an energy density of 8.5 Wh kg-1. The electrochemical feature of MnO2 grafted V2O5 nanostructure can be useful for the fabrication of high performance supercapacitor systems.
