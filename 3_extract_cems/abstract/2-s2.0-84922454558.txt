In this work, we reported a facile approach to prepare a uniform copper ferrite nanoparticle-attached graphene nanosheet (CuFe2O4-GN). A one-step solvothermal method featuring the reduction of graphene oxide and formation of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles was efficient, scalable, green, and controllable. The composite nanosheet was fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which demonstrated that CuFe2O4 nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm were densely and compactly deposited on GN. To investigate the formation mechanism of CuFe2O4-GN, we discussed in detail the effects of a series of experimental parameters, including the concentrations of the precursor, precipitation agent, stabilizer agent, and graphene oxide on the size and morphology of the resulting products. Furthermore, the electrochemical properties of the CuFe2O4-GN composite were studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The composite showed high electrochemical capacitance (576.6 F·g-1 at 1 A·g-1), good rate performance, and cycling stability. These results demonstrated that the composite, as a kind of electrode materials, had a high specific capacitance and good retention. The versatile CuFe2O4-GN holds great promise for application in a wide range of electrochemical fields because of the remarkable synergistic effects between CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and graphene.
