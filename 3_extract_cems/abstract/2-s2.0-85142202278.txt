Here, we assembled a CuCo2-NSs/NiCo2S4 nano-flower clusters hetero-structured materials directly grown on nickel foam. The prepared material showed an extremely high capacitance of 3.10 F cm−2 with excellent reversibility. An important factor in achieving excellent performance is the heterogeneous structure. An asymmetric supercapacitor is constructed by placing CuCo2-NSs/NiCo2S4 and activated carbon electrodes parallel to each other. The asymmetric supercapacitor has a high energy density of 48.2 W h kg−1 at a power density of 245.0 W kg−1 and the capacity retention remains still 98.5% after 7000 cycles.
