In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) network Ag/MnO2/GO/PPy nanocomposite with adjustable micro-mesoporosity was synthesized by effectively controlling the amount of added pyrrole (Py). The Ag/MnO2/GO/PPy-5 nanocomposite exhibits excellent specific capacitance (C = 474.3 F g-1, 5 mV s-1) and high cycle stability (up to 105.3% efficiency after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles). The appropriate micro-mesoporous structure of the 3D graphene-based nanocomposite provides a low-resistance path and a shorter diffusion path for ions, remarkably improving the electrochemical performance of Ag/MnO2/GO/PPy-5 by combining the advantages of these materials. Moreover, the 3D porous structure has strong stability, and evenly dispersed MnO2 and symbiose Ag nanoparticles can afford additional active sites and high conductivity for the nanocomposites.
