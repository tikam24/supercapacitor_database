The most popular energy storage system for renewable energy are batteries modules, due to their high energy density and portable applications, nevertheless, they are unable to release all its stored energy and the high initial current demand on electrical machines like engines or compressors, cause stress in batteries and hence to reduce their life cycle. For that reason, supercapacitors are an excellent complement to batteries, because they can supply the power demand at the current peaks, reducing the stress on batteries. In this work, a supercapacitor module characterization at the hybrid system operation conditions was presented and this characterization was compared with the values obtained for mean of simulation of control considering terms such as ESR (equivalent series resistance) and the effect of DC/DC converters, and based on the considered hybrid system and characterization results an interconnection with a battery bank to decrease the stress in the bank is proposed.a Â© 2013 IEEE.
