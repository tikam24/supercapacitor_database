A fiber asymmetric supercapacitor system is designed with NiCo-LDH nanoflakes and FeOOH nanosheets anchored on electrochemically activated graphite fibers as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. Due to the formation of C[sbnd]O[sbnd]Metal bonding, the oxygen-functionalized carbon on electrochemically activated graphite fibers can bind strongly with NiCo-LDH and FeOOH, which assists in establishing the fast electron transfer routes and fluent ion transport avenues. Both NiCo-LDH and FeOOH anchored on electrochemically activated graphite fibers display a high rate performance, 80% and 87.3% of the electric capacity can be reserved with the current density increasing from 2 to 20 A g−1 and 2 to 10 A g−1, respectively, while the NiCo-LDH and FeOOH deposited on untreated graphite fibers can only retain 45% and 40%. The fabricated novel solid-state fiber asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits an expanded operation potential window of 1.8 V with a maximum energy density (130 W h kg−1) when the power density is 1.8 kW kg−1. Furthermore, a high energy density (81 W h kg−1) is still achieved at a superhigh power density (10.8 kW kg−1). Additionally, a good cycling stability of the solid-state fiber asymmetric supercapacitor can be obtained (90% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles).
