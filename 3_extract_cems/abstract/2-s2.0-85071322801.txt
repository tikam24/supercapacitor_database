In this study, graphene-molybdenum oxide composite materials were prepared via green hydrothermal synthesis method and evaluated as supercapacitor electrodes. The morphology and structure of the composite were examined by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the composite were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) method, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical results show that the composite electrodes possess improved specific capacitance of 122 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, which is about 22% higher that of pure graphene. Additionally, the composite electrodes exhibit good capacitive properties and a high specific energy with superior capacitive retention after 1000 cycles. In contrast to the previously reported systems that are usually complicated and costly, the present work potentially provides a readily scalable technological platform for economic mass production of energy storage devices.
