In this paper, a system for controlling the energy flow of vehicle with multiple energy storages which are used for increasing performance and driving range is presented. For achieving maximal performance and efficiency of energy flow control, traction profile of the route is necessarily known. For observation of a traction profile, Global Navigation Satellite System is used. For energy flow control, three algorithms are presented. The first proposed algorithm uses the whole traction profile of a predetermined route by the driver so the control algorithm can decide the energy of the second energy storage efficient. The second algorithm eliminates the biggest disadvantage of predetermining route, so the algorithm uses traction profile from the memory of stored routes where the vehicle was already driven. If the route was not defined or found in memory energy of secondary energy storage, (supercapacitor) using will be based on the current of primary energy storage (batteries). For verification of proposal algorithms for control of DC/DC converter which is used for energy flow control, inverter and motor were simulated with programmable load and programmable power supply.
