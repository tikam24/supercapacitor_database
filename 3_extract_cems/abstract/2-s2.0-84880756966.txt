Environmentally recycled liginsulfonate were successfully employed for the facile synthesis of mesoporous NiO materials. The XRD, SEM, TEM and N 2 adsorption-desorption analysis were performed for characterizing the structure and surface properties of resultant NiO. The proximate globular structure of lignin macromolecules played an templating role in the formation of mesoporous framework of NiO. The fabricated NiO nanostructures had high specific surface area (193.8 m2/g), large pore volume (0.42 cm 3/g), and narrow pore size distribution making them ideal candidates for supercapacitor applications. CV, ESI and galvanostatic constant-current charge/discharge tests showed that the fabricated mesoporous NiO had high specific capacitance (342 Fṡg-1) and good circulatory stability. Furthermore, the mesoporous NiO showed a good rate capability, which is due to that the ordered mesopores did not limit the ion motion within the pores. The results suggest that resultant NiO mesostructures are a promising supercapacitor electrode material. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
