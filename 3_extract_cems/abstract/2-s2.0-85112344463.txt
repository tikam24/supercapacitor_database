An ionic liquid (IL) 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF4]) was blended with spiro-(1,10)-bipyrrolidinium tetrafluoroborate (SBPBF4) salt and propylene carbonate (PC) to obtain a liquid mixture electrolyte system. The thermodynamic properties of the mixture electrolyte with different molar compositions such as viscosity, density, and electrical conductivity were determined at different temperatures. Infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) are used to calculate and describe the microscopic interactions in the mixture electrolyte system. Then, the IL-based mixture electrolyte was applied in supercapacitor with active carbon electrodes. The supercapacitor performances of the mixture electrolyte including the electrochemical window, the specific capacitance, and the energy density were tested and reckoned by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), and galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) methods, respectively. The interaction analysis and the electrochemical test results indicate that the appropriate addition of IL is a simple and effective way to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrolyte in supercapacitors.
