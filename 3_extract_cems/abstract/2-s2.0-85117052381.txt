The large-scale application of wind power eases the conventional energy shortage's pressure, but it brings great hidden danger to the safe and stable operation of power grid as the wind power does not have the ability of frequency regulation. Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) can effectively respond to the frequency fluctuation when using rotor kinetic energy to participate in the system frequency regulation, but it has the problems of frequency secondary drop and output active power reduction when exiting frequency regulation, besides it can not provide long-term power support. To solve this problem, a coordinated frequency control strategy based on rotor kinetic energy and supercapacitor energy storage is proposed in this paper after analyzing the inertia sustaining capability of rotor kinetic energy. By using rotor kinetic energy and supercapacitor to realize the inertia and droop characteristics like synchronous generator respectively, it can ensure DFIG provide fast and long-term power support when system frequency fluctuates. Besides, supercapacitor is controlled to increase the output active power when rotor kinetic energy exits inertia sustaining, so as to avoid secondary frequency drop caused by the power sudden drop. The tracking curve of rotor speed and output power is changed during the rotor speed recovery, so as to minimize the reduction of output active power.
