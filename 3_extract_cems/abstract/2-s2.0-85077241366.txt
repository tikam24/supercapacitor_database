For energy storage applications, hexylsulfanyl-substituted CoPc and GO-CoPc electrodes were prepared on Ni foam, and then electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated. The GO-CoPc nanocomposite electrode exhibits 56 mFcm-2 at 1.4 mAcm-2 current density. The results show that the GO-CoPc nanocomposite electrode is a promising electroactive material for supercapacitors.
