Microbes are microscopic living organisms that surround us which include bacteria, archaea, most protozoa, and some fungi and algae. In recent years, microbes have been explored as novel precursors to synthesize carbon-based (nano)materials and as substrates or templates to produce carbon-containing (nano)composites. Being greener and more affordable, microbe-derived carbons (MDCs) offer good potential for energy applications. In this review, we describe the unique advantages of MDCs and outline the common procedures to prepare them. We also extensively discuss the energy applications of MDCs including their use as electrodes in supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, and as electrocatalysts for processes such as oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, and hydrogen evolution reactions which are essential for fuel cell and water electrochemical splitting cells. Based on the literature trend and our group's expertise, we propose potential research directions for developing new types of MDCs. This review, therefore, provides the state-of-the-art of a new energy chemistry concept. We expect to stimulate future research on the applications of MDCs that may address energy and environmental challenges that our societies are facing.
