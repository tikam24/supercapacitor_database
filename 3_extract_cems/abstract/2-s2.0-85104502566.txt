Quantum dots are tiny (âˆ¼5 nm) nanoparticles with outstanding electronic, optical, luminescence, and semiconducting properties. Polymer dots are important and unique quantum dots. Polymer dots have been designed and used for advanced hybrid nanomaterials and applications. This review article deliberates scientific trials on design, fabrication, characteristics, and technical solicitations of polymer dot-based nanomaterials. Polymer dots are made from both conducting and non-conducting polymers with appropriate processing techniques. Polymer dots have facile surface modification tendencies. Functional polymer dots have an important use in hybrid/nanocomposite materials. Consequently, polymer dots have been combined with other quantum dots and nanoparticles to form advanced hybrid nanomaterials. Polymer dot-based nanomaterials have unique morphology, conductivity, electrochemical, luminescence, and sensing features. Subsequently, many applications are seen for polymer dot nanomaterials as solar cell, supercapacitor, electronics, probes, gas sensor, biosensor, bioimaging, and drug delivery.
