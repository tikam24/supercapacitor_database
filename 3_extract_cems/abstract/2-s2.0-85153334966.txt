The mismatch between the charging power of the supercapacitor and the braking power of the motor will lead to redundant energy cycling. To accurately track the braking power, a real-time tracking control of braking power using interacting multiple model filter is proposed. Three supercapacitor models are established, and a novel interacting multiple model filter is developed accordingly. The main capacitor voltages of three supercapacitor models interact to obtain the terminal voltage of the supercapacitor. Then the loss function is established with power tracking as the objective. The reference current of the supercapacitor is obtained under the constraints. The comparative experimental results show that with the proposed control strategy, the redundant energy cycling of the system is reduced by 55&#x0025; within one operating cycle.
