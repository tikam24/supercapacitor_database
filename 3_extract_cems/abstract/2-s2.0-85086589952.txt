Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are gradually emerging as one of the most indispensable hybrid energy storage devices. However, it is one main challenge to evade the mismatch of electrochemical kinetics and specific capacity between cathode and anode in LICs. Herein, we have proposed an efficient strategy to prepare the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon spheres (NHPCS) as cathode, which is synthesized by a simple aerosol-spraying pyrolysis using the low-cost phenolic resin as carbon source without any other catalyst or hard template. The NHPCS exhibits porous nanospheres structure with an appropriate nitrogen doping level (3.65 at.%). Benefitting from the two-pronged strategy of N-doped feature and nanostructure engineering, NHPCS achieves a high specific capacity of 74 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and remains 86.5% of initial capacity even being subjected to a high rate of 50-fold. Furthermore, a high-performance LIC has been developed by coupling NHPCS cathode and hard carbon anode, which delivers a maximum energy density of 151 Wh kg−1 and excellent cycle stability (96.3% capacity retention after 3000 cycles). Significantly, such designed porous carbon could not only be convenient for scalable production, but also be served for many other energy storage devices.
