Supercapacitors are entering massively as an important supporting technology for energy storage in various fields of application such as electric vehicles, power grid, renewable energy, and home applications. The reliable operation of these systems requires accurate prediction of the state of health (SOH) of the supercapacitors. This necessitates the development and application of various methods to estimate the lifetime of the supercapacitor during system design and optimization. In this paper, a summary of the main methods for evaluating the SOH of supercapacitors is made, as well as future research directions are outlined.
