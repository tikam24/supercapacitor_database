Simple, binder free, low-cost chemical route has been employed to design CdSe@PbS core-shell surface architecture in thin film form towards electrochemical supercapacitor application. Horizontal chemical bath deposition (H-CBD) was used to grow one-dimensional (1D) Cd(OH)2 nanowires (NWs) template followed by ion exchange to get 1D CdSe NWs. Further, PbS nanoparticles were encapsulated on the surface of CdSe nanowires by using successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Structural, compositional, and morphological studies have been used to confirm and investigate obtain surface architecture. Interestingly, design CdSe@PbS core-shell surface architecture not only offer maximum active sites but also provide smooth and fast electron transfer path exhibiting significant electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 82 mAh g-1 and improved long-term stability. Additionally, symmetric electrochemical supercapacitor device of CdSe@PbS exhibits noticeable energy density of 16.14 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 288 W/kg.
