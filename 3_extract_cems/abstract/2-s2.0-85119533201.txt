Recently, incorporating nitrogen (N) and/or carbon (C) elements into the metal oxide matrix has been considered a promising strategy to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (SCs) as they improve the wettability and conductivity properties. Herein, we synthesized N- and C-rich core-shell-like nickel oxide-nickel carbide (N/C-Ni2O3@Ni3C) composite materials by adopting facile wet chemical approaches, followed by the calcination in the N2 atmosphere. The obtained material exhibited elongated square bipyramidal-like nanostructures. With the synergistic effects of both the core- and shell-like active materials, the optimized N/C-Ni2O3@Ni3C-0.5 (0.5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone) composite material demonstrated good electrochemical performance with a considerable specific capacity of 199.4 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and sustained 5000 charge-discharge cycles by retaining 98.7% of its capacity at 7 A g−1. To explore the practical applicability of the prepared material, a hybrid SC (HSC) was constructed with N/C-Ni2O3@Ni3C-0.5 (positive electrode) and activated carbon (negative electrode). The HSC with the voltage window of 1.6 V exhibited the specific capacitance of 142.3 F g−1, and the maximum energy and power densities of 49.28 Wh kg−1 and 5750 W kg−1, respectively. The capability of HSC to power different electronic appliances was also demonstrated.
