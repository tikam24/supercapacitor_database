In this study, we report a novel biomass-derived porous carbon nanostructures (BD-PCNSs) obtained from Lantana camara stem (LAC) using a simple and low-cost preparation method. LAC biomass was processed with a temperature-controlled hydrothermal precarbonization cum pyrolysis technique and followed by alkaline surface activation to achieve BD-PCNSs. The physicochemical properties for the obtained BD-PCNSs material were confirmed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen sorption isotherms, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As-prepared BD-PCNSs exhibited excellent performances toward supercapacitance and wastewater treatment. BD-PCNSs showed high-specific capacitance ~146 Fg−1 in the aqueous electrolyte with excellent coulombic efficiency, and cyclic retention affirms its green energy storage device fabrication. Also, maximum adsorption capacity (106.4 mg g−1) was achieved for the efficient removal of ibuprofen from wastewater and proven as a promising eco-friendly, and low-cost absorbent material claim its practical applications.
