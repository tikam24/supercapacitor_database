The delicate hierarchical structure of bio-waste is a cost-effective route to develop rational nanostructures for high-performance energy storage device. Bio-waste carbon materials receive extensive attention owing to their excellent physio-chemical properties and economic values. Herein, we demonstrate the facile route for the synthesis of porous carbon material from bio-waste without any physical/chemical activation and studied for supercapacitor application. The synthesized carbon materials exhibit a highest specific capacitance of 121 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in three electrode system and 106 F g−1 in symmetric device at current density of 0.2 A g−1 with specific energy 11.84 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 361.8 W kg−1 with cyclic stability of 100% over 1000 cycles in device configuration. The effect of pyrolysis temperature with exclusion of the activation on the electrochemical performance is elaborated and hence the rational design of economic biomass-derived carbon material is studied for supercapacitor application.
