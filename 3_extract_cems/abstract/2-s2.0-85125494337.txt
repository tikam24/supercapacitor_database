The concept of biorefinery can pave way for shifting to the circular economy by developing unified and multipurpose processes that convert biomass or waste into value-added products. One such waste is water hyacinth, which has the profound effect on the aquatic life as well as poses a challenge across the world for its control. It is the proliferative aquatic weed adversely affecting the environment. However, it has been found that the plant can become a useful source of various chemicals and fuel if used judiciously. Some important groups of phytochemicals like organic acids, sterols, phenolic components, etc. are present in roots, stems, leaves, petioles and flowers of this plant and are known for antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. All these extractives have potential applications in food, pharmaceutical and promoting functional foods. Apart from phytochemicals, water hyacinth is extensively utilized in making fuel, sorbent, biopolymer, carbon fibre, composites, vermicompost and supercapacitor. The concept of biorefinery can be implemented in the effective utilization of water hyacinth due to its potential use in various fields. This review article focuses on various aspects of utilization of water hyacinth, thereby projecting it as a potential biorefinery candidate.
