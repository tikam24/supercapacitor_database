We report the low-temperature (250 °C) synthesis of high-performance hydrophilic carbon black for application as a conducting filler in supercapacitor electrodes. Increased water content, due to the hydrophilicity, maintained the uniform hydration level of MnO<inf>2</inf>/carbon composite electrodes, with good protonic conduction. This results in an increase in the total specific capacitance by 24%. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
