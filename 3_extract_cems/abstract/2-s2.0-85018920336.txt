Porous Mn2O3 microsheet arrays on nickel foam have been prepared by a mild chemical reaction combined with a calcination process. The porous Mn2O3 microsheet arrays are directly grown on the surface of the conductive nickel foam. The porous Mn2O3 microsheet arrays are composed of numerous interconnected nanopores with an average size of about 16 nm. The specific surface area of the porous Mn2O3 materials is 36.34 m2 g−1. The fabricated electrode materials exhibit a high specific capacitance of 566.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and 294.4 F g−1 at a current density of 20 A g−1. The energy density of the porous Mn2O3 microsheet was 19.65 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 124.85 W kg−1 and it was reduced to 10.22 Wh kg−1 at a power of density of 5.00 kW kg−1. The good electrochemical capacitance is ascribed to the interconnected porous structure of the Mn2O3 microsheet, which facilitates electrolyte diffusion and enhances electron transport. The porous Mn2O3 microsheet arrays on nickel foam are a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
