In situ construction of 3D MnCo2O4/graphene composites on a porous framework is a desirable means to improve charge storage and cycling lifetime of energy storage devices. Herein, a bifunctional MnCo2O4/nanographene hybrid composites (B-n-MnCo2O4) with novel self-branching construct are prepared on a macroporous electrically conductive network (MECN) for boosting miniature super-capacitors and sodium ion batteries. The porous B-n-MnCo2O4@MECN electrode provides adequate space to accommodate the large volume change and structural expansion during cycling. As a result, the 1 cm2 electrode boasts a capacitance of ∼7.02 F cm−2/∼2341 F g−1 at 3 mA cm−2. The B-n-MnCo2O4@MECN||AC@Ni-foam supercapacitor with a high energy density (32.0 Wh kg−1, at 6400 W kg−1) has a long lifetime as manifested by only 20% capacitance deterioration after 20,000 cycles. Meanwhile, as an anode in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), B-n-MnCo2O4@MECN has a reversible specific capacity of 541.2 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 and rate capability of 150.0 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1. Nanographene not only provides the conductive network for the self-branching MnCo2O4 to accelerate electron conductivity and ion transport, but also relieves the volume changes during cycling. The strategy and bifunctional materials have a large potential in different types of energy storage devices.
