Prussian blue analogues, Ni3[Fe(CN)6]2-Co3[Fe(CN)6]2-derived flower-like Ni-Co hydroxides coupled with eggplant-derived macroporous carbon tubes, have been prepared by chemical replacement method at room temperature. The composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (801 F g-1), rate stability (68.5 %), and cycle stability. It is indicted that the synergistic effect of the high conductivity of macroporous carbon tubes and flower-like structures contributes to the abundant active redox sites, thus delivering high electrochemical performance. Then, the prepared material in this study could be an ideal candidate as electrode materials for supercapacitor.
