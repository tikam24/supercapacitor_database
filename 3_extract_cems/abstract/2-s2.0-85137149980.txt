To reduce pollution due to the use of conventional fossil fuel, many transportations are going to be electrified, environmental-friendly and zero-emission energy. Among countries with the most electric vehicle user are United State, Norway, and China. About 100,000 of charging outlet for electric vehicle (EV) in United States had been installed to increase the market demand of electric vehicle. As an essential step, the introduction battery is used as the main energy storage for EV, but it weighs heavily and expensive in price as caused by the increased energy storage capacity and improved EV performance. Lifespan of the battery will reduce as it needs to provide high demand of current in acceleration. There is a possibility for the contact charging to cause short circuit during raining as some of the charging port is exposed at open area. The aim of this research is to design a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) of wireless charging system with charge monitor in EV application. The energy storage types chosen were three series 3.7 V, 2000 mAh at 18650 lithium-ion batteries and five series 2.7 V with 50 F ultracapacitors arranged in passive configuration. The system was designed and simulated with Simulink from MATLAB and Proteus 8 to analyse the HESS and the performance of the wireless charging system. The charging time and discharging time of HESS was estimated. The wireless charging system was designed with the output voltage range of 5 V to 13 V and the output current range of 0.5 A to 2.0 A.
