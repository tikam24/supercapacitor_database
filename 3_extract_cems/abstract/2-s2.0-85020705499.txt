This paper presents experimental evaluations on the performance of a hybrid energy storage system to supply urban electric vehicles. The paper starts with a description of nickel chloride batteries and electric double layer capacitors with details on their related advantages. Then, a laboratory test bench is presented to experimentally evaluate the performance of the realized hybrid storage system, obtained through a controlled DC/DC bidirectional power converter, supplying an electric power-train in real operative conditions on standard driving cycles. The main results of this study shows the importance of using that power converter to take advantage of the power characteristics of the super-capacitor and to easily implement on board energy management strategies to increase the whole vehicle performance.
