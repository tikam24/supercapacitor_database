Exfoliated and reduced graphene oxide (MEGO) was fabricated by rapid microwave irradiation. When MEGO was used as the electrode of 17m NaClO4 "water-in-salt" (WIS) electrolyte-based supercapacitors, the cell exhibited stable double layer capacitant behavior up to 2.5V, much higher than the electrochemical stable window of water. The MEGO exhibited high energy density of 22Wh/kg at a power density of 12.5kW/kg, attributable to fast motion of ion clusters in the large space of exfoliated nanosheets in MEGO.
