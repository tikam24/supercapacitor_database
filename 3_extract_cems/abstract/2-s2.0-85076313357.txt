MnO(OH)/Co(OH)2 nanosheets composite electrode material (PMC) for high-performance supercapacitors were synthesized by solvothermal method with a facile pre-reaction process. The pre-reaction process is beneficial for the homogenous reaction and contributes to the formation of a larger specific surface area (180.9 m2 g−1), mesoporous structure, excellent electrical conductivity and therefore superior electrochemical performance. The as-prepared nanostructured PMC exhibits excellent electrochemical properties compared with the MnO(OH)/Co(OH)2 (MC) without the pre-reaction process. The PMC can achieve a specific capacitance of 412.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was nearly double that of the sample MC (236.0 F g−1) without the pre-reaction process. Meanwhile, PMC remains 80.9% of the initial specific capacitance at 10 A g−1 and shows excellent cycle stability retaining 97.6% after 8000 cycles at 10 A g−1. This facile pre-reaction process can be expected to be used for synthesis of other low-cost and high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors.
