Carbon materials have been widely used in designing supercapacitors (SCs) but the capacitance is not ideal. Herein, we synthesize polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes on the basis of a carbon cloth (CC) through a one-step self-degradation template method, and fabricate a CC@PANI NTs-H (CC@PANI nanotubes doping at high temperature) composite electrode by thermal acid doping. The CC@PANI NTs-H electrode obviously exhibits better electrochemical performance with a gravimetric capacitance of 438 F g-1 and maintains 86.8% after 10,000 cycles than the CC@PANI NTs-R (CC@PANI nanotubes doping at room temperature) electrode. Furthermore, we assemble a flexible solid state supercapacitor (FSSC) device with the as-prepared CC@PANI NTs-H composite electrodes, showing good flexibility and outstanding electrochemical performances with a high gravimetric capacitance of 247 F g-1, a large energy density of 21.9 Wh kg-1, and a capacitance retention of 85.4% after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles. Our work proposes a novel and easy pathway to fabricate low-cost FSSCs for the development of energy storage devices.
