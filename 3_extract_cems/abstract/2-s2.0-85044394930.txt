Recent advancement in the field of electrical technology and cyber-physical energy system (CPES) has brought the key towards challenging issues regarding transparency of information management and efficient allocation of energy. This paper is dedicated to a CPES that deals with an electric light rail that involves large number of distributed and globally interconnected supercapacitor energy storage modules, with the aim of efficient fusion of information, control protocol and energy. The autonomous modules estimate local state of energy and share the information via the communication network. A consensus control strategy is proposed to reach the balanced state of energy between these distributed supercapacitor modules with the advantages in terms of increasing efficiency and reducing time consumption of energy transfer. The proposed method enforces the CPES constraints specific to the particular supercapacitor modules in the electric light rails. Experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed state of energy balancing method.
