Various biomass resources have been fabricated and devoted to the application of energy storage. Rice husk is a promising candidate for a supercapacitor, but its conductivity and surface to weight ratio are much poorer than commercial activated carbon. In this paper, the byproduct of rice husk gasification power generation as a raw material was boiled with KOH solution and activated by CO2 to prepare activated carbon. The authors selected the appropriate activation temperature and lye mass fraction to prepare the activated carbon electrode. A scanning electron microscope was used to characterize the surface topography. The porosity of the carbon was detected by nitrogen adsorption. The electrochemical behavior was determined by using galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy techniques. When the activation temperature was 850 Â°C and the mass fraction of the KOH solution was 30%, the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area of the activated carbon reached a maximum value of 1383 m2/g and the specific capacitance was 168 F/g at 250 mA/g with good electrochemical performance.
