Present work describes the preparation of series of binary (chitosan-polyaniline, CP1 to CP7) and ternary (chitosan-graphene-polyaniline, CG1P to CG5P) composites via in-situ polymerization of aniline. The physico-chemical properties of the developed composites were studied. The electrical conductivity of all the composites was measured using four-probe method, and found that among the composites CP5 and CG3P composites showed an excellent electrical conductivity as high as 4.165 × 10−1 and 2.9745 S cm−1, respectively. The electrochemical performance was systematically investigated. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the specific capacitance of CG3P composite was found to be 1519 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution, which is remarkably higher than those of pure PANI (495 F g−1) and CP5 (939 F g−1). Further, it is found that 88% of the initial capacitance of CG3P was retained after repeating 1000 cycles, which demonstrates the excellent cycle life stability.
