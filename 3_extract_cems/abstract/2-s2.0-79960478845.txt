Phosphoric acid doped polyaniline has been synthesized chemically and electrochemically and tested for its specific capacitance properties by constructing a supercapacitor using stainless steel electrodes. Both the samples are characterized by UV-vis, FTIR, XRD and electrochemical methods. The electrochemically grown samples exhibit higher capacitance values in the range of 244-305 F/g. This is due to the higher purity of the electrochemically prepared polymer due to repeated cycling of the potential. Chemically prepared samples show lower capacitance values due to over-oxidation of the polymer and presence of impurities.
