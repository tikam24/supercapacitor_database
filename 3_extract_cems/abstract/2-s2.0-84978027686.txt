In this paper, the Co3O4/graphene composition has been successfully prepared by a facile low-temperature oxidation route using Co(NO3)2 6H2O and general type graphene (GGR) as raw materials. The structure and morphology of as-prepared composite is investigated by X-ray diffractormeter (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results reveal that the sphere-like Co3O4 with the diameter the 300-500 nm uniformly loads on the surface of 2D graphene nanosheet. As the supercapacitor material, the Co3O4/GR composite displays a specific capacitance of 362.6 F/g at a current density of 0.72 A/g, and a capacity retention rate of 108.1% can be reached after 500 cycles. While the bare Co3O4 only delivers a low discharge specific capacitance of 161.6 F/g.
