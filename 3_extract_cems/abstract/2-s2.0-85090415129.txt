In this present work, we have prepared nickel manganese phosphate (NMP) coated with multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a superior electrode for energy storage applications via hydrothermal method. The aimed supercapattery electrode of the MWCNT wrapped nickel manganese phosphate (NMP) is delivered at a high specific capacity of about 812 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1. It is also delivered the good cycling stability with 93% capacity retention over 5000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using NMP:MWCNTs as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode and it can produced high specific capacitance of 380 Cg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. The fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor stores the maximum energy density of 698 Whkg−1 at a power density of 78 Wkg−1. The prominent electrochemical properties will render the metal phosphate as a new cost-effective and attractive active material for promising applications in supercapattery.
