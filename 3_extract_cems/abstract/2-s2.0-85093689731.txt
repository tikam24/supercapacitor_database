Black phosphorus is a potential candidate material for next-generation energy storage devices and has attracted tremendous interest because of its advantageous structural and electrochemical properties, including its large theoretical capacity, high carrier mobility, and low redox potential. However, its practical applicability has remained low owing to its difficult of preparation, large volume expansion during cycling, and poor electronic conductivity. To this end, there have been significant efforts to improve its synthesis methods and electrochemical performance. A number of black-phosphorus-based composite materials have been developed and investigated. Herein, we provide an up-to-date account of the recent progress made in research on black-phosphorus-based materials for use in rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. We review the available synthesis methods and basic properties of black phosphorus and discuss its applicability in Li-, Na-, K-, Mg-, Al-ion and Li-S batteries as well as supercapacitors. We also summarize the existing challenges and future opportunities and offer our perspective on the possible directions for future research in this area.
