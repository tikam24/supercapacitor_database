The use of hybrid sources in the field of electronic vehicles becomes very interesting solution to reduce the weight of the source. The asked question using this kind of sources is how we should manage the power and the energy between the two hybrid components in order to ensure an optimal sizing of the source in terms of weight, volume, autonomy, and aging?. This article presents the sizing of hybrids sources composed with battery and supercapacitor packs. In this study, two management strategies are tested: limitation of power strategy, and filtering strategy. The obtained results with the two strategies will be compared in order to know which strategy allows to reduce the size of the source. Â© 2012 IEEE.
