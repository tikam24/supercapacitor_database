Solar power generation is regarded as the propitious generation method that is used in microgrids. Intermittent nature is one of the major obstruction in the PV system. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) can be used for mitigating this issue. But battery lifespan will be adversely affected due to intermittency of PV. By contemplating this, a hybrid combination of Supercapacitor (SC) and Lithium ion battery with its high energy and power density respectively along with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is introduced here to surmount the limitations of available storage systems. Simulation is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink.
