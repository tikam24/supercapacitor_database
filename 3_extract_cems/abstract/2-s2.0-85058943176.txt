In order to solve the problem in the rapid increase of negative sequence current in public power grid caused by the huge energy generated under regenerative braking condition of G-series high-speed train, a compensation device for railway power controller based on super capacitor energy storage system (SC-RPC) was proposed. By analyzing the electrical model of SC-RPC, the mathematical model of the minimum negative sequence current in public power grid based on SC-RPC under regenerative braking condition was constructed. The model was solved by using improved particle swarm algorithm. The corresponding control strategy was proposed and was verified by simulation. Results show that the SC-RPC can effectively inhibit the negative sequence current generated by regenerative braking. Moreover, it can significantly reduce the negative sequence current and make the power factor greater than 0.9 at the same time, which meets the power quality requirements defined by national standards. The effectiveness of using SC-RPC to inhibit the negative sequence current in public power grid under regenerative braking condition is verified.
