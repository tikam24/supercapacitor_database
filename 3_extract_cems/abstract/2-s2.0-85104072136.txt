Due to increasing fuel prices, the world is moving towards the use of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) because they are environmentally friendly, require less maintenance, and are a green technology. The energy management system (EMS) plays an important role in HEVs for the efficient storage of energy and control of the power flow mechanism. This paper deals with the design, modeling, and result-oriented approach for the development of EMS for HEVs using a fuzzy logic controller (FLC). Batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) are used as primary and secondary energy storage systems (ESSs), respectively. EMS consists of the ultra-power transfer algorithm (UPTA) and FLC techniques, which are used to control the power flow. The UPTA technique is used to charge the battery with the help of a single-ended primary inductor converter (SEPIC) during regenerative braking mode. The proposed research examines and compares the performance of FLC with a proportional integral (PI) controller by using MATLAB (Simulink) software. Three scenarios are built to confirm the efficiency of the proposed design. The simulation results show that the proposed design with FLC has a better response as its rise time (2.6 m) and settling time (1.47 Âµs) are superior to the PI controller.
