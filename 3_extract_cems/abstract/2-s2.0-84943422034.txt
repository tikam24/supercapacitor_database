Supercapacitors are energy boosters for various advanced applications. Carbon nanomaterials based electrochemical double layer capacitors are out-dated due to fewer performances. Redox-type nanocomposite electrodes are promising candidates for high performance supercapacitors. Carbon nanotube/electronically conducting polymer (CNT/ECP) nanocomposite electrodes have achieved much popularity due to their superior electrochemical properties. The nanoscale features of these electrodes have helped to enhance the supercapacitive performance. Among the various CNT/ECP nanocomposites, CNT/polypyrrole nanocomposite electrodes have achieved much importance since they possess high specific capacitance along with high energy density. These electrodes have shown good charge/discharge characteristics along with good environmental and chemical stabilities. Light-weight and flexibility are their added features. These electrodes are very promising candidates for the next generation flexible and wearable electronic devices.
