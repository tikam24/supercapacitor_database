Graphene grabs wide attention in the scientific community as a promising younger member owing to its featured and specific properties for distinct and exciting applications in the field of advanced nanotechnology among many nanomaterials like nanoclay, nano metal oxide, and carbon nanotube. Graphene is the two-dimensional crystalline, highly flexible, strongest, and stiffest carbon nanomaterial ever identified having unique distinctive electrochemical, mechanical, thermal, optoelectronic, and optical properties. The immense application of graphene with short history illustrates its great potential in the diverse fields of electronics, optoelectronics, electrochemical, photovoltaic cells, aerospace, smart, intelligent devices, sensing, flexible supercapacitor electrodes, microelectronics, analytical chemistry, thermal management of high-power-density battery parks, consumer electronics and biomedical applications involving enzyme engineering, biofuel and energy production, enzyme-based bio-sensing and bioassays due to its unique two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb crystal lattice structure, extreme electron mobility, high specific surface area, high thermal and electric conductivity. However, commercial use of graphene will depend on the development of an industrially viable method of fabricating and handling graphene. Present review article highlights the introduction on the term of nanotechnology and graphene synthesis, structure, and its properties. This review article also intends to present comprehensive literature collections on the graphene advanced and technological industrial applications ranging from catalyst, genetic, drug delivery to energy storage devices for the human communities.
