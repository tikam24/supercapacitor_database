Mn-Ni-Co oxide yolk-shelled hollow microspheres have been synthesized through a template-free solvothermal method followed by a post thermal treatment. Owing to the unique structural features, the as-obtained Mn-Ni-Co oxide electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (1173.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), remarkable rate performance and good cycling stability (94% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles at 2 A g−1), demonstrating its great potential for various energy storage devices.
