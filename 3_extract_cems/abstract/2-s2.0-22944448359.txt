Honeywell Specialty Materials has launched a range of high-purity electrolyte and electrolyte solvent systems targeted for use in supercapacitors. The materials, marketed under the Honeywell Electrolyte Systems brand, are fluoroborate salts that use acetonitrile as the solvent. The company has invested about $4 million-$5 million at Seelze to produce the electrolytes at purities suitable for the supercapacitor market. The company's major competitors in the electrolyte market are Osaka-based firms Stella Chemifa and Morita Chemical, which produce the electrolytes with propylene carbonate as the solvent, mainly for the Asian market.
