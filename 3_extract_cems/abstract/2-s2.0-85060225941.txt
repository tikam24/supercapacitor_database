Currently copper sulfide (CuS) has been widely applied for quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSSC) and supercapacitor applications due to its higher electrocatalytic activity. In the present work, two different morphologies of CuS thin films were hydrothermally synthesized on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate by varying the sulfur source concentration and synthesis time respectively. The appearance of high intense Raman peak at 473 cm−1 is attributed to S–S stretching vibration and also confirms that the flower like morphology has a better crystallinity than the wall like morphology. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images display flower and wall like morphologies for CuS films synthesized at 0.5 and 0.7 M thioacetamide, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal that the synthesized CuS films are polycrystalline nature with hexagonal covellite structure. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra illustrate that the film consisting of flower like morphology has the best crystal quality with less atomic defects. The band gap of the films consisting of flower and wall like morphologies is estimated to be 2.02 and 2.24 eV, respectively. Electrochemical analysis depicts the flower like morphology having the best electrocatalytic activity to reduce the oxidized species of sulfur in polysulfide electrolyte. The QDSSC based on flower like morphology has exhibited a better photon conversion efficiency of 1.18 % with lesser charge recombination than another QDSSC. The supercapacitor properties are extensively investigated through CV and galvanostatic charge/discharge analyses for optimized film consisting of flower like morphology.
