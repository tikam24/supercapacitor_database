A series of polymer dots/graphene sheets composites with high densities are prepared and tested for supercapacitors. Polymer dots (PDs) are synthesized by one-step method at room temperature. They can effectively increase surface areas of the composites (almost 10 times), and the functional groups from PDs produce high pseudocapacitance, so that the samples exhibit high specific capacitances (e. g., 364.2 F cm−3 at 1 A g−1) and high cycling stability (e. g., more than 95% of the initial capacity retention over 10 000 cycles at different current densities). The optimal sample is employed to fabricate a symmetric supercapacitor, which exhibits an energy density up to 8 Wh L−1 and a power density up to 11 800 W L−1, respectively.
