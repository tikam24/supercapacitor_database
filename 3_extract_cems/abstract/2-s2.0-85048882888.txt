A novel hybrid supercapacitor based on a composite of acetylene black and MnO2 as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode has been developed. The effect of the electrolyte (K2SO4, KOH and KOH+LiOH) and the concentration of MnO2 in the composite electrode is investigated. A supercap–∞citor using 50 wt.% MnO2/XC composite electrode and mixed KOH electrolyte demonstrates highest and most stable discharge capacitance (about 1400 cycles), as well as a highest effectiveness of the charge-discharge process. This result can be related one hand with the better electroconductivity of KOH solution in comparison to K2SO4electrolyte and on the other - with the presence of Li+ ions, which favors the faradaic charge-transfer reaction.
