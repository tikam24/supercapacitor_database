Hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) should be designed appropriately with an adequate combination of different renewable sources and various energy storage methods to overcome the problem of intermittency of renewable energy resources. Focusing on the inevitable impact on the grid caused by strong randomicity and apparent intermittency of photovoltaic (PV) generation system, modeling and control strategy of pure green and grid-friendly hybrid power generation system based on hydrogen energy storage and supercapacitor (SC) is proposed in this paper. Aiming at smoothing grid-connected power fluctuations of PV and meeting load demand, the alkaline electrolyzer (AE) and proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and SC are connected to DC bus of photovoltaic grid-connected generation system. Through coordinated control and power management of PV, AE, PEMFC and SC, hybrid power generation system friendliness and active grid-connection are realized. The validity and correctness of modeling and control strategies referred in this paper are verified through simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC software platform.
