A novel anode material with a delicate composite structure, which is assembled by growing 3D MoSe2 nanoflowers onto the hierarchically anisotropic carbon architecture, is designed for the first time. The structural superiority and synergistic effects from EDLC and pseudocapacitance endow the free-standing anode with an ultra-high areal capacitance of 1043 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 and high cycling stability. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor device consisting of this anode and a common MnO2-based cathode yields a quite large energy density of 147 Î¼W h cm-2 at the power density of 2 mW cm-2, which is higher than or comparable to that of some Li-ion batteries. These results verify the huge application potential of this new anode for supercapacitors.
