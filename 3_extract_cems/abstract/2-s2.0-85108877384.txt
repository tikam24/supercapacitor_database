The preparation and supercapacitive performance of Incorporated Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) â€“ activated carbon (AC) were studied in this work. The crystalline phase and the presence of desired functional group were revealed through X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infra-red analysis, respectively. The supercapacitive behaviours of the prepared samples were analysed via cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis by means of three-electrode system. CV analysis display a remarkable specific capacitance (Cs) value of 267 Fg-1at 50 mVs-1, by incorporating 20 wt% of TiO2into the AC matrices. With the combined contribution from high conductivity AC and transition metal oxide, the Cs value has been found to increase substantially with respect to AC electrode. Moreover, the addition of 20 wt% TiO2enhanced the electrochemical stability with 90% capacity retention after 100thconsecutive cycles. A notable supercapacitive performance shown by the sample is ascribed to the synergistic effect of electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance produced by the combined matrices.
