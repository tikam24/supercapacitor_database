Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were prepared from graphene oxide (GO) by using piperine as a green reducing agent extracted from Piper nigrum. The obtained rGO had few defects and lacked connectivity between the layers. To overcome these defects, copper oxide (CuO) nanoparticles were synthesized ultrasonically and nanocomposites of rGO–CuO were prepared. The conductivities of the rGO, CuO and rGO–CuO nanocomposites were determined by AC impedance spectroscopy in different electrolytes. Morphology, composition and electronic structure of CuO, rGO and rGO–CuO nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical techniques. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images portrait CuO as a fish caught in the net of rGO layers. The rGO–CuO nanocomposite exhibiting lower resistance and higher capacitance was used in fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes. The specific capacitance of the fabricated supercapacitor was found to be 137 Fg−1. The supercapacitor performance of the nanocomposite electrode is attributed to the synergistic effect of double-layer capacitance of rGO and redox capacitance of CuO nanoparticles.
