An innovative and efficient method for preparation of mesocarbon microbeads (MCMBs) was developed based on the dripping behavior and rheological properties of molten pitch during melt-spinning, where a string of beads was formed after the pitch was extruded from spinnerets and dropped into a receiving solvent (tetrohydrofuran or water). The pitch droplets were first carbonized, then activated by KOH or graphitized at 2 800 °C to prepare A-MCMBs or G-MCMBs, respectively, and these were respectively used as the electrode materials for electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Results showed that both MCMB-W prepared using water as the receiving solvent and MCMB-T prepared using tetrohydrofuran as the receiving solvent had a spherical shape with sizes of 1-2 μm. A-MCMB-T had a high specific surface area (1 391 m2 g−1), micropore volume (0.55 cm3 g−1) and mesopore volume (0.24 cm3 g−1), with a 30% higher specific capacitance than an activated mesophase carbon prepared under the same conditions, and its capacitance retention was significantly improved when it was used as an electrode material for EDLCs. G-MCMB-T had a high degree of graphitization (0.895) and when it was used as an electrode material for LIBs it had a high specific capacity of 353.5 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1. This work reports a new preparation method for MCMBs, which could be used to prepare energy storage materials.
