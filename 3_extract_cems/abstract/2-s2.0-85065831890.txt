In this present work, bismuth molybdate (Bi2Mo2O9)nanoparticles (NPs)were prepared by microwave combustion method using urea as the fuel. The phase formation and purity of the product was identified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR)analysis was adopted to record the functional group of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs. The morphology, purity, size and elemental composition of the sample were confirmed by Scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental mapping, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)analysis and High-Resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM)technique respectively. The UVâ€“visible and photoluminescence (PL)spectra were used to examine optical and electronic behavior of the prepared sample at room temperature (RT). The chemical bonding of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs was studied by Raman spectroscopy. The magnetic properties of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs were examined by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM)at RT. The particle size distribution was examined by X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Electrochemical (EC)properties of Bi2Mo2O9 NPs were investigated by Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD)and Electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS)studies. The specific capacitance (Cs)of prepared Bi2Mo2O9 NPs is 197 F/g at 0.4 A/g with excellent cycle stability of 94% specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. Hence, the results of electrochemical characteristics exhibits excellent performance and have potential application of electrode for energy storage systems.
