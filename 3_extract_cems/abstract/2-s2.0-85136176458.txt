Strategies for carbon-based electrode materials producing from derivation of biomass arouse dramatical interests because of the almost unlimited source, natural heteroatoms doping, large specific surface area and hierarchical porosity structure, which proposes a sustainable path for large-scale energy devices production in facile route. This work utilizes golden imperial chrysanthemum to fabricate in-situ heteroatoms self-doping carbon materials with 2D sheet shape structure, hierarchical porosity, and excellent electrochemical behaviours by using carbonization and alkaline activation. Alkaline activation enhances specific surface area, pore distribution, wettability, and heteroatom active sites construction, which endows derived C-GIC-KOH4 excellent electrochemical behaviours. In the three-electrode system, the capacitance retention of C-GIC-KOH4 can reach 94 % after 10,000 cycles, indicating splendid cycle stability and excellent electrochemical behaviours as electrode materials. In the two-electrode system, the specific capacitance and energy density can reach 165 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte and 25.3 Wh kg−1 at 225 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte respectively, surpassing majority of previous reported biomass derived carbon-based electrode materials. In view of the above-mentioned benefits, this work provides a potential route for sustainable and low-cost carbon-based electrode materials production derived from abundant recourses against fossil fuel and large-scale energy devices application.
