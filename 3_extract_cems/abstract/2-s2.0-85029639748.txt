The strategy of developing new electrode materials, which integrate well with carbon materials or conducting polymers to form a robust synergistic composite, can distinctly boost the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors (SCs). In this study, a novel Ni coordination supramolecular network (CSN) of [Ni2(3,5-PDC)2·(H2O)8·(H2O)2]n (denoted as Ni-PDC, 3,5-PDC = 3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid) was successfully integrated with nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) via a one-step hydrothermal method, forming a superior composite electrode material of Ni-PDC@NG. The Ni-PDC@NG electrode showed a high specific capacitance of 735 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and an outstanding cycling stability (85.3% capacitance retention after 14000 cycles); furthermore, it also maintained a good rate capability by exhibiting a capacitance retention of 53% even at a high current density of 40 A g-1. Significantly, a SC device was assembled with the Ni-PDC@NG electrode as the cathode and an activated carbon electrode as the anode, which not only exhibited a high energy density of 21.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 801 W kg-1, but also retained 45.2% of its initial energy density even at a high power density of 16036 W kg-1. Besides, this as-fabricated device exhibited excellent long-term durability with 97.9% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles.
