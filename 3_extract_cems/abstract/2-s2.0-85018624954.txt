Functionalization and electrodeposition of reduced graphene oxide/hexagonal boron nitride (rGO/h-BN) superlattice was carried out by a novel one-step electrochemical process. The sulfanilic acid azochromotrop (SAA) functionalized and electrodeposited nickel foam (SAA@rGO/h-BN@Ni) electrode showed high specific capacitance of ∼1300 F g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC) using SAA@rGO/h-BN@Ni as positive and thermally reduced GO as negative electrode showed ∼80% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. The ASC showed low relaxation time constant of ∼0.47 ms along with high energy density (∼95.3 W h kg−1) and power density (∼7200 W kg−1) ensuring the utility of SAA@rGO/h-BN@Ni electrode for supercapacitor application.
