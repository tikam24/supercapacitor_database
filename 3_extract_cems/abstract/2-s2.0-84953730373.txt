A modeling and simulation method was proposed for the LiMn2O4/C hybrid supercapacitor. The key parameters of the model were identified with this method and were measured with various precise measuring methods so that avoiding the errors from assumption or parameter reference. Precise charge-discharge curves of a LiMn2O4/C hybrid supercapacitor were obtained by simulation. Experimental verification proves that the charge-discharge curves from simulation and experiment fit well and the relative errors of the charge and discharge time are less than 5%. Finally an MEMS hybrid supercapacitor with 3D-electrode structure was designed and the reaction mechanism inside its micro-electrode was studied using this method.
