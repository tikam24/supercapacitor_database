There has been significant interest in the hybridization of two-dimensional (2D) graphene and one-dimensional (1D) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to form three-dimensional (3D) hybrid structures. This 3-D hybrid structure prevents the re-stacking and aggregation between the graphene and CNTs, maximizes the synergistic effect, and reports excellent functional performance relative to its constituent 2D and 1D structures. This review discusses the methods and current progress of hybridizing graphene and CNTs. The potential and performance of graphene-CNT hybrid material in applications such as supercapacitors and high-performance batteries will be discussed. This review intends to inspire more substantive research on the subject.
