Ultracapacitors have been widely used in urban rail vehicles as the power source because of its high power density. However, it is still a challenge to design a rapid and reliable charging control system for ultracapacitors since the DC-DC converters are highly nonlinear along with hard constraints. In this paper, the piecewise-affine (PWA) model of the ultra-capacitor charging system and a hybrid model predictive control strategy are proposed to address this challenge. The hybrid nature of the converter is taken into account in v-resolution model which can reflect the dynamics of the charging system precisely. Based on the discrete-time model, we formulate and solve a constrained optimal control problem, and the control law is calculated offline using multi-parameter programming method. Simulation and experiment results validate the potential advantages of the proposed scheme.
