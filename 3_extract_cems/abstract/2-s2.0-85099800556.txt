The sulfide derived from Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) with conductive polymer has aboundant electroactive sites and more redox reactive centers, which shows great promising for supercapacitors. Here, the composite of ZIF-67 and polyaniline (PANI) is synthesized by simply stirring (ZIF-67/PANI). Among them, PANI serves as a growth substrate of ZIF-67 for transfer scaffold of electrons and works as a wire to connect nanoparticles, making the conductivity of ZIF-67 improved. Furthermore, sulfur is introduced into ZIF-67/PANI by additional sulfurization (Co3S4/PANI). The introduction of sulfur can promote electron transfer for the low electronegativity. The obtained Co3S4/PANI is applied to supercapacitors and at a current density of 1 A•g−1, the specific capacitance is up to 11 times that of the ZIF-67. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) device exhibits a high specific energy of 40.75 Wh•kg−1 at a specific power of 800 W•kg−1 and displays supercycling stability. After 20, 000 cycles of charge and discharge tests, it still can maintain 88% of initial capacitance at a higher current density of 5 A•g−1. Excellent electrochemical performance indicates that the prepared material possesses good market development prospects and is a promising candidate in energy storage fields.
