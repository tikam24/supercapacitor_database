Composite films consisting of polythiophene (PTh) and graphene oxide (GO) were synthetized by electrochemical polymerization. Consequently, the GO was reduced via cyclic voltammetry to form a reduced composite (PTh/rGO), which presented higher conductivity than PTh. Specific capacitance values were calculated from galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles. At a current density of 0.5 A·g-1, the specific capacitance of PTh/rGO presented a good value (318 A·g-1). However, its behavior was distant from a typical supercapacitor, indicative of a low reversibility during the charge-discharge processes and poor capability as supercapacitor material. Moreover, its stability diminished considerably after repetitive cycling. Experimental conditions of synthesis of PTh/rGO require to be optimized for the application of the composite as electrode material in supercapacitors.
