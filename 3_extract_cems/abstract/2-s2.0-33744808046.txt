Polyaniline is deposited potentiodynamically on a nickel substrate in the presence of p-toluene sulfonic acid and the specific capacitance is estimated. The electrochemical characterisation of the electrode is carried out by means of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments. The specific capacitance is ∼4.05 × 102 F g-1. This indicates the feasibility of the polyaniline-coated nickel electrode for use in electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.
