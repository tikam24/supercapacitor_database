Design and development of high stability supercapacitor electrode materials via simple and low-cost synthesis methods are crucial and have gained considerable attention by researchers in the past few decades. Numerous studies reviewed herein have highlighted a wide variety of attractive transition metal disulfide-based composite electrode materials for symmetric and asymmetric electrochemical capacitors. As representative two-dimensional (2D) layer-structured transition metal dichalcogenides, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) have gained much attention due to their unique properties, such as their high specific surface areas and number of active sites. In this review, detailed literature data is presented, and the electrochemical performances of transition-metal-disulfide-based electrodes fabricated from different configurations, including binary and ternary composites, are discussed. The fundamental concepts of the symmetric and asymmetric electrochemical mechanisms of MoS2 and WS2 are presented.
