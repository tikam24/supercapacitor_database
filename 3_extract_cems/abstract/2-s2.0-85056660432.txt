Stretchable textiles (STs) with both excellent conductivity and great energy storage capacity are crucial for future wearable electronic clothes. Herein, a stretchable Ni@NiCoP coated spandex textile derived from two step electroless deposition method presents perfect conductive and electrochemical performances. It delivers a low square resistance of 0.19 Ω sq−1 and high conductivity of 532 S cm−1. The outer NiCoP alloy layer can effectively enhance the conductivity and stability in daily utilization. Besides, the Ni and Co bimetallic phosphide contributes a high pseudocapacitive performance, with an areal capacitance of 877.6 mF cm−2 and gravimetric capacitance of 713 F g−1. The Ni@NiCoP ST is then constructed into a stretchable asymmetric supercapacitor with excellent mechanical and electrochemical stability. Finally, a self-powered system is assembled onto a lab coat and supplies continuous power for an electronic watch under sunlight illumination, demonstrating the Ni@NiCoP ST possesses promising potential in future wearable energy storage clothes and electronics.
