In this study, carbon-intercalated Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti3C2Tx/C) was prepared through annealing long-chain fatty amines to form carbon interlayers into MXene. With the increase in interlayer spacing due to amine intercalation and enhanced electrical conductivity owing to the in situ formation of carbon between MXene layers, the Ti3C2Tx/C heterostructure exhibited improved electrochemical performances. Specifically, when serving as a supercapacitor electrode material, the Ti3C2Tx/C heterostructure displayed high reversible gravimetric capacitance of 364.3 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. The heterostructures were advantageous for penetration of electrolyte ions into the MXene layers and exhibited excellent electrochemical cycling stability with above 99% retention over 10 000 cycles. The high capacitance and excellent cycling stability demonstrate the great promise of this simple and scalable approach for developing high-performance carbon-based 2D nanomaterials for energy storage.
