Ever-growing demand to develop satisfactory electrochemical devices has driven cutting-edge research in designing and manufacturing reliable solid-state electrochemical energy storage devices (EESDs). 3D printing, a precise and programmable layer-by-layer manufacturing technology, has drawn substantial attention to build advanced solid-state EESDs and unveil intrinsic charge storage mechanisms. It provides brand-new opportunities as well as some challenges in the field of solid-state energy storage. This review focuses on the topic of 3D printing for solid-state energy storage, which bridges the gap between advanced manufacturing and future EESDs. It starts from a brief introduction followed by an emphasis on 3D printing principles, where basic features of 3D printing and key issues for solid-state energy storage are both reviewed. Recent advances in 3D printed solid-state EESDs including solid-state batteries and solid-state supercapacitors are then summarized. Conclusions and perspectives are also provided regarding the further development of 3D printed solid-state EESDs. It can be expected that advanced 3D printing will significantly promote future evolution of solid-state EESDs.
