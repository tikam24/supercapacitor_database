Hybrid systems have gained significant attention among researchers and scientists world-wide due to their ability to integrate solar cells and supercapacitors. Subsequently, this has led to rising demands for green energy, miniaturization and mini-electronic wearable devices. These hybrid devices will lead to sustainable energy becoming viable and fossil-fuel-based sources of energy gradually being replaced. A solar photovoltaic (SPV) system is an electronic device that mainly functions to convert photon energy to electrical energy using a solar power source. It has been widely used in developed countries given that they have advanced photovoltaic (PV) technology that reduces dependence on fossil fuels for energy generation. Furthermore, a supercapacitor is an alternative solution for replacing heavy batteries and it is a system with a prominent high power density and a long life cycle. Its unique properties of high capacitance with low voltage limits lead to this highly in-demand material being incorporated into goods and services that are produced by the electrical and electronics industries. It is another option for grid-based power or large batteries. Since supercapacitors have the ability to store huge amounts of energy, they allow for a novel system that integrates supercapacitors with solar cells in which energy generation and energy storage are combined into one system. This paper explores the common materials that are used for solar cells and supercapacitors, the working mechanisms, the effectiveness of the integrated device and the technical challenges that are encountered when refining this device. Hence, this review serves as a guide for choosing the right materials and methods in order to produce an integrated PV solar cellâ€“energy storage device for various applications.
