Herein, the authors disclose for the first time the synthesis of copper hydrogen phosphate (Cu(HPO4)) material for supercapacitor applications. First, we synthesized Cu(HPO4) by a facile chemical bath deposition (CBD) method and then it was characterized by several physicochemical techniques. The fabricated Cu(HPO4) electrode showed superior capacitive performance of 874F/g at 0.1 A/g of current density. Further, Cu(HPO4) electrode retains a maximum of 93.2% of its original specific capacitance retention over 5,000 galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) cycles.
