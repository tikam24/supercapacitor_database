Optimization of electrode material is one of the most important measures to improve the performance of supercapacitors. Layered double hydroxide electrode materials supported by foam Ni were synthesized by in situ hydrothermal synthesis with CO(NH2)2/NaOH/Na2CO3 as precipitants and inorganic Zn(II) and Al(III) as precursors. The catalytic layer is composed of Zn6Al2(OH)16CO3·4 H2O and Zn4(OH)6CO3·H 2O. Specific capacitance of the electrode materials can reach as high as 1259 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1. Urea in precipitants optimized the composition, structure, and properties of the electrode materials. These encouraging results make these low-cost and eco-friendly materials promising for supercapacitor applications.
