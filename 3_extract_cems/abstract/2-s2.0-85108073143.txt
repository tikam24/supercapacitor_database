Ni(OH)2/RGO composite electrode materials were prepared from nickel nitrate and graphene oxide by one-step hydrothermal reduction using porous nickel foam as substrate, urea as precipitant and hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as dispersant. The morphology and structure of Ni(OH)2/RGO electrode materials were characterized, and the electrochemical properties of the materials were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests. The crystal forms of Ni(OH)2 and Ni(OH)2/RGO were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. SEM images show that the silky RGO sheets are effectively and uniformly distributed on the surface of Ni(OH)2 layer. During the hydrothermal process, Ni(OH)2 sheets grow in situ on the nickel foam, forming a three-dimensional porous multi-layer diversified structure. Compared with pure Ni(OH)2, the specific capacitance of pure Ni(OH)2 at 1 A/g is 1 930 F/g and the specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2/RGO is 2 508 F/g. These results indicate that Ni(OH)2/RGO is a promising electrode candidate material for supercapacitor.
