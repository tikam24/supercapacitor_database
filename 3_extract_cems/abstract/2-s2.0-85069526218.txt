One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures are the exemplary host for fabricating active electrode material for supercapacitors as they have large specific surface area, robust adsorption/desorption capability and outstanding thermal stability, which could assist as support and promoter to anchor noble metal nanoparticles with enhanced electrochemical properties. Herein, pure and MoO3/Pd nanocomposites have been synthesized by simple hydrothermal method. The XRD spectrum of synthesized powder exhibited orthorhombic Î±-MoO3 structure and the calculated average crystallite sizes are 42 nm and 33 nm for pure and MoO3/Pd nanocomposites respectively. The Pd nanoparticles plays a crucial role in controlling the structure. The SEM images showed 1D nanorods like structure with a size of about 100 nm dia and few micrometer length. The TEM images confirm the Pd nanoparticles are incorporated into the 1D MoO3 nanorods. The electrochemical properties of pure and MoO3/Pd 1D nanocomposite electrodes showed pseudocapacitive nature. The MoO3/Pd electrode exhibited high specific capacitance of 501 F g-1 at a current density of 1 mA g-1 with good cycling stability. The high specific capacitance of newly fabricated MoO3/Pd nanocomposite electrode is mainly associated with the synergetic effect between Pd nanoparticles and MoO3 nanorods.
