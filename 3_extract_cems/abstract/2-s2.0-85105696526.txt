Copper-based chalcogenides are becoming popular as electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we report the electrochemical energy storage performance of CuFeO2 and CuFeSe2 synthesized via facile solvothermal method. At 1 A g−1, the symmetric supercapacitors based on CuFeO2 electrodes and CuFeSe2 electrodes exhibit specific capacitance values of 128 F g−1 and 260 F g−1, respectively. Further, CuFeO2 and CuFeSe2 electrodes demonstrate incredible specific energy values of 18 Wh kg−1 and 36 Wh kg−1, respectively, at a specific power of 1 kW kg−1. Moreover, both CuFeO2 and CuFeSe2 electroactive materials result in enhanced capacitive retention of 96% and 97%, respectively, for 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The remarkable electrochemical energy storage performance of both CuFeO2 and CuFeSe2 materials make them potential aspirants for future energy storage systems.
