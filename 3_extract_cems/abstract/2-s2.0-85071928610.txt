The proceedings contain 644 papers. The topics discussed include: small size and highly sensitive differential MEMS accelerometer based on double-ended tuning fork resonators; microfabricated membranes for radiative near field measurements; zero-power acoustic wake-up receiver based on DMUT transmitter, PMUTS arrays receivers and MEMS switches for intrabody links; flexible electret generator for self-powered metal cathodic protection; high sensitive micro flexible thermal sensor for flow separation measurements on airfoil; fabrication of lithium niobate bulk acoustic resonator for 5G filter; UV-LED lithography for millimeter-tall high-aspect ratio 3D structures; a flexible pressure sensor with high sensitivity and broad measuring range; a self-powered UV photodetector using face-to-face zinc oxide nanorod arrays; and high mass-loading and mechanical strength supercapacitor by graphene/carbon fiber composites.
