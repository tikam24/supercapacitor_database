Biochar is a common byproduct from thermochemical conversion of biomass to produce bioenergy. However, the biochar features, such as morphology, porosity and surface chemistry, cannot be well controlled in conventional conversion approaches, limiting the wide application of raw biochar. Aiming to meet the specific requirements, post-modification of raw biochar was frequently conducted to improve the quality. In this review, recent developments regarding post-modification methods of biochar are presented and discussed. Progresses on the applications of post modified biochar as electrode materials for supercapacitors are intensively summarized. This review aims to reveal the key factors that affecting the performance of biochar-based supercapacitors, and provide guidance for rationalizing the modification methods to expand the applications of biochar-based functional materials in supercapacitors.
