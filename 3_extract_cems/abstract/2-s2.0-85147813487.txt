Porous carbon sheets have wide application prospects in many fields, especially in energy storage of supercapacitor due to the features combining both 2D structure and porous architectures. Herein, a self-deposition approach is proposed to obtain N-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (N-MCNs), using 3-aminophenol (3-AF) as precursor and Mg(OH)2 sheet as hard template. This process realizes the direct carbon formation using 3-AF monomer as carbon precursor under the catalysis of hard template avoiding the polymerization and utilization of solvent. The mass ratio of 3-AF to Mg(OH)2 plays an important role in determining the pore structures and the resulting capacitance behavior. The results show that N-MCNs with a mass ratio of 3-AF and Mg(OH)2 of 1:1 have good electrochemical behavior for supercapacitors. This N-MCNs based electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 240 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1, good rate performance (75.4% retention ratio at 20 A·g−1), and high cycling stability with 98.3% initial capacitance retained after 10000 cycles. Symmetric supercapacitors on N-MCNs achieve energy density of 18.2 W·h·kg−1 and power density of 0.4 kW·kg−1 operated within a wide potential range of 0–1.6 V in 1.0 mol·L−1 Na2SO4 solution, exhibiting its potential for electrode materials with high performance.
