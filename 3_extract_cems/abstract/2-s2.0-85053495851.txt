This paper proposes a power sharing scheme for an islanded DC microgrid with Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). In the proposed method HESS is employed with PV ramp rate control, battery is used for the application of supplying the continuous power and supercapacitor is used to respond for instant power fluctuations during transient period. In addition, since the supercapacitor unit supplies or absorbs the transient power, it allows DC link voltage to settle fast and hence achieves a fast DC link voltage regulation. Therefore, stable DC bus voltage is achieved by means of this proposed strategy. The ramp rate control will improve the reliability of the system by reducing the fluctuations in the PV power. The proposed scheme is tested and validated using MATLAB/simulink environment.
