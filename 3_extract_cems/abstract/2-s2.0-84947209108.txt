This paper introduces a simulation model of battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system. The study aims at creating adequate model to investigate the benefits of energy storage system hybridization for an electric vehicle. The experimental tests have been carried out in order to identify the parameters of lithium battery and ultracapacitor. The dynamic models are able to simulate terminal voltage of energy storage including the dependencies on state of charge and temperature.
