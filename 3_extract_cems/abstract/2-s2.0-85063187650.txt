Utilizing renewable and abundant biomass waste to prepare hierarchically porous carbons (HPC) materials with large surface area and good electrical conductivity have received considerable attention recently. In this work, a novel 3D HPC was prepared by a low-cost and facile hydrothermal process, carbonization, and chemical activation from Huiyuan® fruit grain orange (FGO) with expired deadline for the first time. The obtained HPC exhibits a high specific surface area of 2149 m2 g−1 and facilitated charge transfer ability offered by its hierarchical structure. When used as electrodes for supercapacitor, HPC displays a maximum specific capacitance of 452.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which is one of the highest values reported for biomass-derived carbons. Remarkably, the all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor based on HPC-4 exhibits a high energy density of 14.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 140 W kg−1 and outstanding cycling stability (90% capacitance retention after 6000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g−1). HPC-4 should be a promising electrode material for all-solid-state supercapacitor application.
