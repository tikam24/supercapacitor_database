The preparation of N-doped porous carbon (NC-800) is presented via facile mango stone carbonization at 800 °C. The NC-800 material exhibits good cycle stability (the capacity retention is 97.8% after 5000 cycles) and high specific capacitance of 280 F/g at 1 A/g. Furthermore, the assembled symmetric device of NC-800//NCs-800 exhibits about 31.1 Wh/kg of energy density at 800 W/kg in a voltage range of 0–1.6 V. The results of the study suggest that NC-800 may be a promising energy storage material for practical application.
