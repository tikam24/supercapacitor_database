Flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) are promising energy storage devices in wearable electronic systems. They have attracted tremendous attention owing to their unique properties of excellent flexibility, fast charging and discharging capabilities, and durable service life. Herein, the recent developments of electrode materials and device structures of FSCs are introduced in detail. Based on the energy storage mechanisms, the characteristics and research progress of electrode materials, such as carbon materials, transition metal oxides/hydroxides, conductive polymers, and MXenes, are classified and analyzed. The improvement strategy of these materials is emphasized. In recent years, the numerous novel architectures of FSCs have been established for better wearable applications. Thus, this review summarizes the latest progress in the planar, fibrous, and stereo architectures of FSCs in wearable electronics. The influence of the substrate, electrolyte, and structure design on the performance of FSCs is discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects of FSCs in wearable electronic products and the future development direction are prospected.
