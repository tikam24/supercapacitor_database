High electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes largely rely on the smart design of nanoarchitectures with scrupulous combination of different active materials. We present a facile method for the multicomponent design of hierarchical Co9S8 hollow nanotubes (CS NTs) wrapped with Ni-Co layered double hydroxides nanosheets (Ni-Co LDH NSs) core-shell high-performance supercapacitors. The CS NTs serve as an ideal backbone with pentagonal cross-section to enhance the conductivity for acting as a “superhighway” for electron transport, whereas the Ni-Co LDH NSs with high electrochemical activity electrodeposited on the surface of CS NTs provide the electroactive sites and enhance the structural stability for faradaic reaction. The CS NTs@Ni-Co LDH NSs hierarchical electrode presents a high specific capacitance of 1020 C g−1 and high cycling stability of 90.4% after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled with CS NTs@Ni-Co LDH NSs as the anode and active carbon as cathode. The as-fabricated ASC shows high energy density of 50 Wh kg−1 and exhibit superior cyclic stability of 86.4% retention over 5000 cycles, suggesting this electrode is promising for efficient electrochemical capacitors.
