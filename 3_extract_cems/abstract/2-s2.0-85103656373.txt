In this paper, waste hollow fiber filter membrane is used as a carbon source and KOH as an activator under an atmosphere of protective argon gas to prepare hollow fiber filter membrane-based porous carbon material ZKC-T via a high-temperature pyrolysis activation method. Hollow fiber filter membrane-based porous carbon ZKC-T was found to consist of amorphous carbon, with an irregular three-dimensional network interconnecting pore structure, specific surface area of up to 2934 m2 g−1, and a reasonable pore size distribution. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge and discharge tests showed that the hollow fiber filter-based porous carbon material ZKC-700 has excellent electrochemical performance. The carbon material shows a specific capacitance of up to 289 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the material shows good cycle stability; after 5000 charge and discharge cycles, the capacitance retention rate is as high as 92.8%. The hollow fiber filter membrane-based porous carbon prepared by this method exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
