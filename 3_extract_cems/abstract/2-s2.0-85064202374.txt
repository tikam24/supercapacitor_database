The rapid development of the portable and wearable electronics creates a high demand for better performance energy storage devices with high areal capacity as well as excellent flexibility. Herein, a free-standing Ti 3 C 2 /FeOOH quantum dots (QDs) hybrid film has been designed and synthesized by a simple electrostatic self-assembly, where amorphous FeOOH QDs not only act as pillars to prevent restacking of the Ti 3 C 2 nanosheets but also provide considerable capacitance as active materials. The Ti 3 C 2 /FeOOH QDs hybrid film exhibits 2.3 times higher areal capacitance (485 mF cm −2 ) than the pristine Ti 3 C 2 film and good cycle stability (94.8% retention over 5000 cycles) in neutral electrolyte. Moreover, an asymmetric device has been prepared by combining the hybrid film as negative electrode and MnO 2 on carbon cloth as positive electrode, which operates at an output potential difference of 1.6 V. The device delivers the maximum energy density of 40 μW h cm −2 and the maximum power density of 8.2 mW cm −2 with 82% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. The facile preparation process and excellent electrochemical properties of the free-standing Ti 3 C 2 /FeOOH QDs hybrid film make it a promising candidate for constructing high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
