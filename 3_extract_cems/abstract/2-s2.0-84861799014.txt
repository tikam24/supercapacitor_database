Flexible polypyrrole/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite paper was prepared via a facile and one-step chemical oxidation polymerization method. The morphology and microstructure of the obtained papers were characterized by SEM, FTIR, and XRD. GO was confirmed experimentally to be exfoliated and uniformly dispersed in the resulting nanocomposites. The specific capacitance value of the nanocomposite paper has been determined to be about 330 F/g at a scan rate of 100 mV/s, suggesting the possible application of the nanocomposite as a supercapacitor electrode. After 700 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mV/s, only 9 % decrease in specific capacitance as compared to initial value indicates the superior electrochemical cyclic stability of the nanocomposite paper.
