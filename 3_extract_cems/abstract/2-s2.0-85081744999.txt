Abstract: An electroactive material of a pseudocapacitor (PC) electrode based on highly dispersed MnO2 powders and its composites are obtained. The composition and surface morphology of these materials are investigated. The conditions for manufacturing electroactive paste from synthesized powders are determined. Technological methods are developed for the manufacture of the PC electrodes consisting of electroactive paste deposited on a conductive substrate (steel mesh). The electrochemical tests of the developed electrodes in an electrochemical cell are carried out using the method of cyclic voltammetry.
