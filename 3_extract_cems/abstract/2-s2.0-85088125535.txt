In the present study, Polypyrrole (PPy) and nickel oxide incorporated polypyrrole nanocomposites (PPy-NiO) for supercapacitor electrode were prepared using chemical polymerization method in the presence of surfactant camphor sulfonic acid. Furthermore these prepared nanocomposite were characterized using Field emission scanning electron microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurement confirms that PPy-NiO nanocomposite electrode exhibits highest specific capacitance of 421.48 F/g at scan rate of 10 mVs-1 which is much higher than the pure PPy (354.16 F/g) and also it exhibits low charge transfer resistance values of 9.74 Ï‰. The excellent electrochemical performance of the device makes it a potential material for supercapacitor application.
