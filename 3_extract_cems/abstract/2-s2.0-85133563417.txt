The hybrid energy storage system with the battery as the main energy source and the supercapacitor as the auxiliary energy source has been widely applied in the motor-driven system. However, the uncoordinated distribution of energy between energy storage units would cause unnecessary energy loss in the system. The energy recovery and utilization efficiency of the system needs to be further improved. In this paper, a power tracking control strategy considering total energy loss is proposed. The energy flow path of the motoring or generating process is investigated. The energy loss prediction models of the battery, the supercapacitor and the bidirectional DC/DC converter are established, respectively. Afterward, the objective optimization control function is deduced from the perspective of the minimum comprehensive energy loss. Dynamic power distribution ratios are obtained under the constraints. The superiorities of the supercapacitor are fully utilized and the dynamic supply-demand power balance is maintained. The results of simulations and experiments verify that energy recovery and utilization efficiency of the system is increased by 26.4% using the proposed control strategy in one running cycle.
