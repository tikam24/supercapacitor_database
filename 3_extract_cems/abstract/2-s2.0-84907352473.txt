Supercapacitors represent an important strategy for electrochemical energy storage, but are usually limited by relatively low energy density. Here we report a three-dimensional holey graphene framework with a hierarchical porous structure as a high-performance binder-free supercapacitor electrode. With large ion-accessible surface area, efficient electron and ion transport pathways as well as a high packing density, the holey graphene framework electrode can deliver a gravimetric capacitance of 298 F g-1 and a volumetric capacitance of 212 F cm 3 in organic electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that a fully packaged device stack can deliver gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 35Whkg-1 and 49Whl-1, respectively, approaching those of lead acid batteries. The achievement of such high energy density bridges the gap between traditional supercapacitors and batteries, and can open up exciting opportunities for mobile power supply in diverse applications.
