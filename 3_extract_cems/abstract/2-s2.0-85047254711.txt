It is necessary to guarantee the order of write requests being written into the storage device for the filesystem consistency. fsync() guarantees the consistency of the filesystem by the flush-based synchronization technique. There have been the various attempts to improves the performance of fsync(), and some of them contribute to improve the performance of fsync(). Among these attempts, two approaches (F2FS and Supercap-SSD) contribute to decrease of the fsync() overhead. However, we discovered that the huge bottleneck occurs in the process of fsync() when using these two techniques. We identified the cause of this problem is the scanning overhead for the free node IDs, and digitalized the effect of the fsync() performance degradation. Consequently, we proved that the scanning overhead in fsync() of F2FS decreases the I/O performance if the overhead at the FLUSH command diminishes.
