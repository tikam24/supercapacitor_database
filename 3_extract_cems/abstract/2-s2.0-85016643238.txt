A feasible method is used to synthesize hollow mesoporous carbon spheres (HMCSs), which is based on Friedel-Crafts reaction. In this approach, uniform polystyrene spheres (PSs) are coated by a mesoporous silica shell with assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in a colloidal suspension to form a core-shell structure. Then, the PSs cores are dissolved by chloroform and polystyrene molecules adsorb in the mesoporous silica shell to form a hollow cavity. Meanwhile, cross-linking of polystyrene molecules is also proceeding via Friedel-Crafts reaction in the presence of catalyst of anhydrous aluminum chloride. Finally, HMCSs with uniform mesoporous are obtained after carbonization and removing silica. The HMCSs as a supercapacitor electrode exhibit good capacitance and electrochemical stability.
