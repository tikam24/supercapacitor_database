In recent years, carbon dots (CDs) have gained increasing attention owing to their unique properties and enormous potential for several biomedical and technological applications. CDs are biocompatible, have a small size with a relatively large surface area, are photostable, and have customizable photoluminescence properties. This review is divided into the following discussions of CDs: general definitions; an overview of recent reviews; methods of green and classical synthesis; applications in bioimaging, involving supercapacitors, nanocarriers and nanomedicine; toxicological evaluations (including cytotoxic, genotoxic and anti-cancer properties of CDs); their conjugation with enzymes, biosensors, and cell labeling. Finally the remaining drawbacks and challenges of CD applications are highlighted. In this context, this article aims to provide critical insight and inspire further developments in the synthesis and application of CDs.
