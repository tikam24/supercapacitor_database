In this study, galvanostatic electrodeposition techniques were employed for the achieved of new composite polymer: polypyrrole - sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate/poly N-ethylaniline (PPY-AOT/PNEA) coatings on the Co67Cr29W4 alloy electrode surface. The PPY-AOT/PNEA coating has been synthesized on the Co67Cr29W4 alloy electrode by galvanostatic deposition from aqueous solutions 0.1 M NEA, 0.1M PY, 0.01 M AOT and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at various current densities (1mA/cm2, 2mA/cm2 and 8mA/cm2) in different molar ratio. The sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) as a dopant ion used in electropolymerization process be able to a significant influence on the electrochemical activity of the composite polymer. The polymeric composite coatings were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The results denoted that the electroactive behaviors of the composite polymer mainly depend on the molar ratio of monomers, the applied density current and times of electrodeposition. It has been established that the cobalt based alloy substrate had a meaningful influence on the electrochemical activity of the polypyrrole and poly(N-ethylaniline) composite films and that as in the existence of polymeric film, anodization of these modified electrodes obtained in constitution of an oxides complex film and polymeric layers together. All of the composite films were a very promising electrode material for application in supercapacitor, corrosion protection coatings or sensor employments.
