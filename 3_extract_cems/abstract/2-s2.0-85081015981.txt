The development of lightweight, flexible, and stretchable energy storage systems is essential for state-of-the-art electronic devices. We propose a new and broad strategy to fabricate a stretchable and conductive GO/CNTs-TPU fiber electrode by direct wet spinning, from which a flexible fibrous supercapacitor is fabricated. The fibrous electrode exhibits a high strength of 11.68 MPa, high conductivity of 342 S/cm, and high specific capacitances (21.8 mF/cm, 36.45 F/cm3, and 95 F/g). The specific capacitance of the assembled all-solid-state hybrid fiber-shaped supercapacitor reaches 14.3 F/cm3. After 5000 charge-discharge cycles, 97% of the capacitance of the hybrid supercapacitor is maintained. These high-strength electrochemical electrode materials could be potential candidates for applications in practical and large-scale energy storage systems and textile clothes.
