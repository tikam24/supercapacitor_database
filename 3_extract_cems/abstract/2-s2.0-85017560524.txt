WO3 microspheres film with a tertiary, textured and porous structure assembled of WO3 hierarchical nanorods has been directly prepared on Cu foil using a one-step hydrothermal method. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) are used to reveal the surface microtopography, crystal structure, elementary composition, valence state and formation mechanism of WO3 tertiary structure. Moreover, the electrochemical properties and supercapacitive performances of WO3 microspheres film are also intensively investigated. The WO3 microspheres film has high specific capacitances of 485, 426, 372, 319 and 260 F g−1 at unit currents of 0.5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 A g−1 and exhibits good cycle stability (93% after 5000 cycles) and reversibility (98.5%), a lower charge transfer resistance (0.5 Ω) and high energy densities ranging from 21 to 17 W h kg−1 corresponded to high power densities varied from 150 to 3000 W kg−1.
