Porous carbon materials are the most widely used electrode materials in Electric Double Layer Supercapacitor (EDLS). Optimize specific surface area, improving hierarchical pores structure, and doping heteroatoms are all important methods to improve the capacitance performance of electrodes. Herein, we synthesize walnut shell-derived hierarchical porous carbon (WSPC) with cost-effective and well-developed pore for electrochemical energy storage via simple phosphoric acid-assisted activation method. The final porous carbon products have perfect microporous structure, abundant heteroatom functional groups (the atomic content ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur reaches 10.3%), and high specific surface area and pore volume (up to 2583 m2 g−1 and 1.236 cm3 g−1, respectively). In the three-system, the electrode shows an optimal specific capacitance of up to 332 F g−1 and excellent rate performance. In the symmetric system, the symmetric device WSPC//WSPC shows a maximum gravimetric specific energy of ~14.08 Wh kg−1. And the device still has a specific energy of 9.75 Wh kg−1 even under the high gravimetric specific power of 7 kW kg−1. In addition, the device has excellent cycle stability and retains an initial specific capacitance of 90.2% after 8000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycle. In summary, these outstanding results suggest the biomass derived porous carbon possessing the potential and will show great commercial value for the fabrication of high performance supercapacitors.
