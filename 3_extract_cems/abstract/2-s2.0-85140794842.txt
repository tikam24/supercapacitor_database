Porous carbons with high specific surface area are critical engineering materials for current electrochemical capacitors (ECs) technology. Controlling the pore size distribution of porous carbons remains a significant challenge as it is a key aspect in many applications. Herein, we synthesized porous carbon as the electrode material of ECs by means of a two-step synthesis procedure using abandoned feathers as carbon precursor and potassium hydroxide as activating agent. The optimal sample (AFHPC-800–1:3) exhibited an ultra-high specific surface area (SBET) of 3474 m2/g and a huge total pore volume (VT) of 1.82 m3 g−1 as well as abundant small mesopores ranging from 2 to 5 nm in size. The ECs based on the AFHPC-800–1:3 electrode exhibited an ultra-high specific capacitance (Csp) of up to 709F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. More interestingly, a capacitance of 212F g−1 was retained even at 100 A g−1, demonstrating excellent high-rate capacitive performance. Furthermore, the symmetrical capacitor yielded an excellent energy density of 35.1 Wh kg−1 when the specific power density was 625 W kg−1, substantiating the potential of the small mesopores in promoting the overall capacitance and energy density of electrode materials.
