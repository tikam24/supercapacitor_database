We demonstrate a novel method to manufacture non-toxic supercapacitors with aqueous electrolyte by solution processing techniques. The supercapacitors are fabricated on flexible substrates by applying ink layers on top of each other resulting to a monolithic structure. In this way the whole component including current collectors, electrodes and separator can be implemented on one substrate without the need to align and seal two separately fabricated electrodes. Biopolymer chitosan has an important role since it acts both as separator and activated carbon electrode binder. This work facilitates an easier manufacturing of thin supercapacitor structures e.g. for Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network applications. The capacitance range of our components is 0.26–0.43 F and equivalent series resistance 12–32 Ω.
