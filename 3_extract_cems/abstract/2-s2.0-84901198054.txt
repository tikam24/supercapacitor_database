A novel organic molecule of 9H-carbazole-9-carbothioic methacrylic thioanhydride (CzCS2metac) was synthesized by incorporating CS 2 and methacrylate groups into the carbazole monomer structure. CzCS2metac was characterized by FTIR, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. CzCS2metac was electropolymerized in 0.1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4)/acetonitrile (CH3CN) on glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The characterization of the electrocoated P(CzCS2metac)/CFME thin film was studied by various techniques, such as cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscopy-energy- dispersive X-ray analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The specific capacitance (C sp) of P(CzCS2metac)/MWCNT/GCE in the scan rate of 20 mV s-1 (C sp = 38.48 F g-1 from area formula, C sp = 38.52 F g-1 from charge formula) was increased ~15.66 and ~15.64 times in area and charge formulas compared to P(CzCS2metac)/GCE (C sp = 2.46 F g-1 from area and charge formulas). The same results were also obtained from Nyquist graphs. The specific capacitance value of composite film (C sp = 1.09 × 10-3 F) is ~15.66 times higher than the polymer film (C sp = 6.92 × 10-5 F). The composite film may be used as supercapacitor electrode material in energy storage devices. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
