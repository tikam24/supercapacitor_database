In this study, a novel composite supercapacitor electrode material, ZnWO4 nanorods decorated with colloidal SnO2 quantum dots, was synthesized via a facile sonochemical method. The synthesized material was systematically characterized to confirm the successful construction of core@shell nanorods. SnO2 surface encapsulation on ZnWO4 nanorods improves electrochemical performance by enhancing conductivity and adding storage sites. ZnWO4 nanorods@colloidal SnO2 quantum dots, displayed an electrochemical performance of 162 F/g specific capacitance, 98% capacity retention after 5000 cycles.
