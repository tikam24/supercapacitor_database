We report a biomass-derived nanoporous carbon (B-NPC) from dried Aesculus turbinata fruit by carbonization in a tubular furnace at 800 °C. The surface morphology, structural, and electrochemical properties of B-NPC were examined by different techniques. The prepared B-NPC exhibits a high surface area of 205 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 5.6 nm. B-NPC showed specific capacitance of 123F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 with 96% capacity retention even after 10,000 cycles. The prepared B-NPC can show a significant contribution to energy storage applications.
