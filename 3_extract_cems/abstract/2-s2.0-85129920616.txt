P-Nitroaniline has been adopted as a versatile precursor for the selective preparation of N-doped porous carbon (PC) and carbon dots (CDs) with rich N functionalities. Furthermore, the CDs are anchored on PC to yield PC-CDs composites with the assistance of ultrasonication. Due to the catalytic effect of the pyridinic- and pyrrolic-N sites within the CDs as well as the high specific surface area and conductivity of PC, the optimized PC-CDs-1.5% composite (containing 1.5% CDs) could substantially promote the redox reaction of the acidic KI electrolyte. Therefore, the PC-CDs-1.5%-based supercapacitor demonstrated high specific capacitance (Cs, 1783 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), good rate capability (800 F g−1 at 6 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (84.7% Cs retention upon 10 000 charge-discharge cycles). Moreover, when employed as the electrode in a flexible supercapacitor, the PC-CDs-1.5% composite also exhibits good capacitive performance in the PVA-H2SO4-KI gel electrolyte, and a high energy density (Ecell) of 13.85 W h kg−1 at a power density (Pcell) of 97.00 W kg−1 is also delivered. In addition, the flexible device shows good electrochemical cycling stability and the Cs of the flexible device could be well maintained under bending and twisting deformations.
