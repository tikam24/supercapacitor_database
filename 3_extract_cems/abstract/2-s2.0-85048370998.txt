In this paper, two charged supercapacitor modules of identical specification have been used as the input, as also the sole power source for a buck converter including all of its components. Extra power supply like battery has not been used in this entire circuit. The load current ranges from 300 mA to 1.2 A. These two supercapacitor modules supply decaying input voltage to the buck converter, the output voltage of which is being regulated to a constant value by the feed-forward closed loop PWM control circuit that proportionately varies the duty ratio and amplitude of the switching pulse as a function of the time-varying input voltages across the supercapacitor modules. As a result, the operation of a dc analog circuit has been shown as is being powered by supercapacitor modules. This circuit topology is suited for low- and medium-voltage applications in which variable dc input source will be used to yield a constant output voltage at a constant current and also can be used in applications like mobile phones in place of battery since supercapacitor has a high rate of charging due to low equivalent series resistance values. The operating frequency ranges from 1 to 2.5 kHz.
