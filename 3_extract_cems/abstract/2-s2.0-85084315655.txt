A Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell hybrid electric vehicle (PEMFCHEV) occupies several benefits, convenient with respect to a gasoline-powered inner burning machine-based conveyance or a standard hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). This study proposes individual Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC), Battery, and Super-Capacitor (SC) hybrid energy production, which is substantiated within PEMFCHEV's. Here, the energy supplier consists of individual PEMFC stack at a fixed power, which acts as a prime energy supplier. The nominal voltage supplied by the battery and an SC bank acts as a subsidiary power storage device to support continuous energy to support traction motor for proper synchronous speed. A typical arrangement of FC, Battery, and SC hybrid energy supplier modified in the MATLAB Simulink and simulated. After the simulation, DC-link voltage, dissipated power, and AC output voltage of Inverter has been measured, which in turn delivered to the traction motor to maintain synchronous speed. Thus, the combination of the fuel cell, battery, and super-capacitor to get constant power, is the main achievement of this project. Since state of the art of entire types of energy suppliers employed in FCHEVs, assimilate to the planned PEMFC, Battery, and SC hybrid energy supplier, which clarifies its better competency.
