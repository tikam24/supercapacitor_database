High-power micro-supercapacitors based on micrometers-thick graphitic petal electrodes have been designed and fabricated. The electrodes were prepared by using microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition and patterned by optical lithography and reactive ion etching. Charge/discharge rates up to 100000mVs-1 (1000times faster than conventional supercapacitors) have been achieved in 1M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. After electrochemical oxidization treatment in 1M H2SO4 solution at room temperature, a volumetric capacitance of 270Fcm-3 (with an area-normalized capacitance of 108mFcm-2) was observed at a scan rate of 20mVs-1 while maintaining high charge/discharge rates. The electrochemically treated microdevices exhibit energy densities in the range of 0.8 to 10mWhcm-3, power densities in the range of 0.6 to 235Wcm-3, a theoretical maximum power density of 292Wcm-3 at a current of 100Î¼A, and good cycling stability.
