MnO2/C composite with 3D hierarchical ridge/straight-pore/nano-grid architecture (RPG-MnO2/C) is fabricated using Parides sesostris butterfly wings as both template and carbon source via a carbonizing-surface reaction process. The self-supported RPG-MnO2/C as supercapacitor electrode shows a maximum specific capacitance of 1539.7 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is among the highest values ever reported for MnO2. Excellent cycling stability retaining 97.6% of its initial capacitance after 10000 charge-discharge cycles at 10 A g−1 is also exhibited, together with ~100% coulomb efficiency. This outstanding performance can be attributed to the coupling effect of double-component composition (carbon substrate, MnO2 nanolayer) and multiscale hierarchical architecture (microscale ridges, sub-microscale straight pores, nanoscale grids).
