In this paper, a new energy control scheme is proposed for actively controlled hybrid dc microgrid to reduce the adverse impact of pulsed power loads. The proposed energy control is an adaptive current-voltage control (ACVC) scheme based on the moving average measurement technique and an adaptive proportional compensator. Unlike conventional energy control methods, the proposed ACVC approach has the advantages of controlling both voltage and current of the system while it keep the output current of the power converter at a relatively constant value. For this study, a laboratory scale hybrid dc microgrid is developed to evaluate the performance of the ACVC strategy and to compare its performance with the other conventional energy control methods. Using experimental test results, it is shown that the proposed strategy highly improves the dynamic performance of the hybrid dc microgrid. Although the ACVC technique causes slightly more bus voltage variation, it effectively eliminates the high current and power pulsation of the power converters. The experimental test results for different pulse duty ratios demonstrated a significant improvement achieved by the developed ACVC scheme in enhancing the system efficiency, reducing the ac grid voltage drop and the frequency fluctuations.
