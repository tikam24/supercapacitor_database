The accuracy of the model is very important for the control and performance optimization of the energy storage system of supercapacitor (SC). A parameter identification method of SC equivalent circuit model based on weight distribution optimization is proposed to improve the accuracy of models. The SC are tested with various operating conditions on a Neware test platform. On this basis, the recursive least square method and the bilinear transformation method are used to identify the related parameters of each branch of the three-branch equivalent circuit model of the SC. Furthermore, the weight distribution optimization method is introduced to modify the parameters of the SC equivalent circuit model by combining the advantages and disadvantages of the two parameter identification methods under different working steps. An equivalent circuit model of the SC is established to verify the effectiveness of the weight distribution optimization by comparing and analyzing the results calculated from the model and the experimental results. Comparisons with the recursive least squares method and the bilinear transformation method show that the weight distribution optimization method more accurately reflects the characteristics of SC, the accuracy of the proposed model is improved by 1.45% and 1.78%, respectively.
