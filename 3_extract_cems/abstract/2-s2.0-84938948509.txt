The vertical TiO2 nanotube arrays constituting the core of 3-D nanoscale electrode architecture were synthesized over Ti sheet by anodization. Such formed TiO2 nanotubes are electrically conducting and amorphous as confirmed by XRD studies. Nanotube morphology is affected by water content and in the present study, close-packed 3-4 μm long TiO2 nanotube arrays of 45-50 nm diameter are formed with 2% water as revealed by the transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The redox active polypyrrole sheath is created by ultra-short pulsed current electropolymerization. Electrochemical properties of the 3-D nanoscaled TiO2 nanotube core- polypyrrole sheath electrodes relevant to the energy storage were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Charge discharge (CD) tests. High areal capacitance density of 48 mF cm-2 and low charge transfer resistance 12 Ω cm-2 with least ion diffusion limitation are realized at optimized polypyrrole sheath thickness. The Raman spectra studies reveal anion at specific chain locations involve in the redox process.
