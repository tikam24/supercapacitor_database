Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) have shown a great potential candidate for high-performance supercapacitor due to their wide operating potential which can remarkably enhance the capacitive behaviour. In present work, a novel positive electrode derived from functionalised carbon nanofibers/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/manganese oxide (f-CNFs/PEDOT/MnO2) was prepared using a multi-step route and activated carbon (AC) was fabricated as a negative electrode for ASC. A uniform distribution of PEDOT and MnO2 on f-CNFs as well as porous granular of AC are well-observed in FESEM. The assembled f-CNFs/PEDOT/MnO2//AC with an operating potential of 1.6 V can achieve a maximum specific capacitance of 537 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s and good cycling stability (81.06% after cycling 8000 times). Furthermore, the as-prepared ASC exhibited reasonably high specific energy of 49.4 Wh/kg and low charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 2.27 Î©, thus, confirming f-CNFs/PEDOT/MnO2//AC as a promising electrode material for the future energy storage system.
