A wireless sensor node powered by solar energy is modeled and analyzed. The sensor node consists of six components: solar panel, maximum power point tracker, input stage, supercapacitor, output stage, and load. The components are either modeled using equivalent circuits or characterized by behavior defining parameters. The sensor node model is first simulated and analyzed using a typical solar radiation and a fixed load current. Results show that these component models capture their characteristics. Two supercapacitor models, the variable leakage resistance model and the energy iteration equation model, are compared within the sensor node model. Their potential impacts on sensor node operation are investigated. Â© 2012 IEEE.
