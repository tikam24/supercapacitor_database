In the present time, the sustainable synthesis of electrochemical active nanomaterial is highly desirable. Here, we have synthesized the facile ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd nano electrode material using hydrothermal route, the greener organic synthesis fuel extracted from leaves of Euphorbia cognata Boiss. The obvious nano spherical particles with crystal size of 21 nm ± 2 were obtained. The organic assisted ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd nanocomposite was integrated into electrode utilizing substrate in foam of nickel applying the thermal vacuum treatment. The supercapacitive energy storage potential was first investigated by cyclicvoltammetry (CV) by scanning the electrodes at varies rates ranging 2 mV/s to 300 mV/s. By CV ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd electrode exposed maximum specific capacitance, that is, 348 F/g. Then, galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis was conducted for prepared electrode applying different current densities(CD) ranging 0.5 to 30 A/g. Greater energy density (ED), that is, ~10 W/kg was obtained for ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd electrode having enhanced power density, that is, 4965.6 W/Kg from GCD measurement. Finally, the electrochemical conductivity was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Internal resistance observed in this work was very less, that is, 0.49 Ω, signifying good conductivity because of fast diffusion shown by electrons as well as ions. Consequently, good redox supercapacitors behavior of ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd was unveiled, has proven substantial potential of ZnO:NiO-PdO-Pd electrode for energy storage.
