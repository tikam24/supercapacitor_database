In this paper, the effect of annealing temperature on the compositions and corresponding electrochemical performance of Mn3O4/γ-MnOOH composites on the carbon cloth fabricated by a simple hydrothermal method is investigated. The results show that the γ-MnOOH converts into Mn3O4 completely between 200 °C and 300 °C and further increasing the annealing temperature to 400 °C and 500 °C leads to the transformation of partial Mn3O4 into MnO. The electrochemical measurement results for products annealed at different temperatures suggest that increasing the annealing temperature causes the decreased capacitance performance.
