The 2D conductive material MXene （Ti3C2Tx），electroactive tannic acid and robust aramid nanofibers are composited and vacuum-filtered to prepare self-supported flexible films with layer structure. The microstructure，morphology，mechanical and electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx/TA/ANF films are systematically investigated. The results show that Ti3C2Tx/TA/ANF film exhibits a high tensile strength of 36.2 MPa and excellent flexibility，which can be arbitrarily bent，folded and twisted. The Ti3C2Tx/TA/ANF film assembled flexible solid-state supercapacitor possesses a volumetric specific capacitance of 826.56 F cm-3，a superior volumetric energy density of 28.7 Wh L-3 and electrochemical stability under various bending angles.
