Transition metal sulfide due to high theoretical capacity, large active sites, non-toxic and higher conductivity make them more favorable for energy storage applications. Therefore, we have synthesized Nickel sulfide by employing multiple approaches to study their electrochemical properties and utilized it for practical applications. Initially, the sample was confirmed by performing X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. The hydrothermally synthesized electrode obtained specific capacity (Qs) of 434.16C/g at 1.6 A/g compared to its counterpart. Owing to maximum capacity, this electrode was assembled in two electrode configurations to explore their hybrid performance. The NiS//AC results in Qs of 261.6C/g at 1.5 A/g with great capacity retention of 86.7 % after testing for 10,000 GCD cycles. Furthermore, the device has revealed astonishing specific energy of 61.76 Wh/kg and power of 1275 W/kg. These experimental outcomes were investigated by using the Dunn's model to extract the capacitive part from the diffusive, demonstrating the nature of (NiS//AC) hybrid device. Moreover, Power's law was employed to validate the assembled device behavior by evaluating b values. In sum, it appears promising to utilize the suggested NiS//AC with elevated performance and great stability as anode material in hybrid supercapacitors.
