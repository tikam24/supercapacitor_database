Hierarchical Ni(OH)2@CoMoO4 nanoflake composite on Ni foam was successfully constructed by electrodepositing Ni(OH)2 onto CoMoO4 nanoflake and investigated as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitor. The composite shows a large areal capacitance of 5.23Fcm-2 at current density of 8mAcm-1, and a capacitance retention of 82.5% after 1000 cycles. The high electrochemical performances can be attributed to the hierarchical nanoflakes structure and the synergetic effect between Ni(OH)2 nanosheets and CoMoO4 nanoflakes. This work demonstrates that Ni(OH)2@CoMoO4 nanoflake composite is highly desirable for application as advanced electrochemical electrode material.
