Intensive research in the current device technology and the impetus for new ideas has led to many advances and the arrival of the appropriate energy device is required to move it to the next frontiers. In this regard, expecting properties such as high-power density, faster-charging rate, and higher reliability of the storage devices for sustainably energy applications to wide range of energy requirements. In this consequence, the advantages of fast charging/discharging ratio and long cycle life make supercapacitors a viable candidate for next-generation power supply, so the use of supercapacitors is becoming more widespread in many fields, but also faces many hurdles when commercializing the product. It faces problems including economic, overall performance retention, and environmental impact due to the wide range of business features taken from the research stage for practical application. It is highly desirable to develop new techniques and sites tailored to critical and urgent needs from the business/practical level. All of these developments must occur using economically viable and abundant and safe products for the market.
