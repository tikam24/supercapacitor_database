A novel asymmetric Li ions supercapacitor was fabricated using LiMn2O4 nano-rods and activated carbon (AC) electrodes as cathode and anode, respectively. The LiMn2O4 nano-rods that derived from Î²-MnO2 nano-rods not only provide more active sites for charge-transfer reaction, but also served as an energy source to supply a high energy density. The test results showed that the highest energy density of Li ions supercapacitor at the rate of 30 C achieved 33.16 Wh/kg, which was closed to 2.04 times than that of AC/AC supercapacitor. Meanwhile, a large power density had been sustained. In addition, because of low cost and toxicity, easy synthesis, and an abundant resource of LiMn2O4, this novel asymmetric Li ions supercapacitors could be considered as promising energy storage devices for next generation supercapacitors.
