In this paper, Gd3+ doped V2O5/Ti3C2Tx MXene (GVO/MX) hierarchical architectures have been synthesized by wet chemical approach. As prepared GVO/MX composite, along undoped VO and unsupported GVO were well characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDX, FT-IR and BET techniques. Electrochemical performance of VO, GVO and GVO/MX was evaluated by CV, GCD and EIS measurements. Among the three electrodes, GVO/MX composite exhibited highest electrochemical activity with the optimum specific capacitance of 1024 Fg-1 at 10 mVs−1. The specific capacitance of GVO/MX was ∼1.7 and ∼3 times higher than unsupported GVO (585 Fg-1) and VO (326 Fg-1), respectively. The cyclic life of GVO/MX with capacitance retention 96.12% was observed at 60 mVs−1. EIS measurements showed reduction in electrochemical impedance for GVO/MX as compared to GVO and VO. The corresponding impedance values of Rct and Resr for GVO/MX were calculated as 18 Ω and 1.8 Ω, respectively. The superior capacitive ability of GVO/MX can be ascribed to its unique morphology, short diffusion path and high surface area of fabricated composite. Considering it, the present work provides a feasible strategy to fabricate highly effective electrode materials for next generation energy storage devices.
