We introduce a facile method to construct new ternary hierarchical nanocomposites by combining MnO2 coated one dimensional (1D) conducting polyaniline (PANI) nanowires with 2D graphene sheets (GNs). The hierarchical nanocomposite structures of PANI@MnO2/GNs (PMGNs) are further proved by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical characteristics of the electrodes made of the hierarchical structured PMGNs materials are determined by the CV and galvanostatic measurements. These electrochemical tests indicate that electrodes made of the nanostructured PMGNs exhibit an improved reversible capacitance of 695 F g-1 after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 4 A g-1. The ternary composites possess higher electrochemical capacitance than each individual component as supercapacitor electrode materials. Such intriguing electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of MnO2, PANI and graphene. The hierarchical ternary nanocomposites show excellent electrochemical properties for energy storage applications, which evidence their potential application as supercapacitors.
