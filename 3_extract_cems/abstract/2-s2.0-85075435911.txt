In this paper, MgCo2O4 twinned-hemispheres (MgCo2O4 THSs) composed of a large number of nanoparticles were obtained via a solvothermal reaction accompanied with subsequent annealing process. Such MgCo2O4 THSs possessed a specific surface area of 63.8 m2 g−1 with a dominate pore size of 6 nm, and the mean pore size was calculated to be 13.5 nm. The electrochemical performance of these MgCo2O4 THSs was evaluated in a typical three-electrode system. The results revealed that such MgCo2O4 electrode material delivered a specific capacitance of 626.5 F/g at 1 A g−1 in 2 M of KOH aqueous electrolyte, and possessed a rate capability of 71.8% at 16 A g−1. The capacitance could preserve 68.9% of the original value after 5000 cycles at the current density of 5 A g−1. The assembled MgCo2O4 THSs//AC asymmetric supercapacitor attained an energy density of 30.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 861 W kg−1, and a long cycling life with 99.06% specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The outstanding electrochemical properties of MgCo2O4 THSs can be attributed to their unique structure, which make them suitable and promising electrode material candidate for supercapacitors. In addition, the synthesis strategy is easy to be operated, which is able to be adopted to fabricate other binary transition metal oxides.
