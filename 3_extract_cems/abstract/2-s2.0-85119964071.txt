Although the doubly fed induction generator under the control of overspeed deloading control can participate in the primary frequency adjustment of the grid, it has problems such as low power generation efficiency and small speed adjustment range. In order to improve the system frequency quality and enhance the stability of the power grid, this paper comprehensively considered the influence of source-load power random fluctuations on the system frequency, and proposed a control strategy for the primary frequency smooth adjustment of doubly-fed wind turbines. Combined with the historical data of wind power fluctuation of a windy meteorological cycle in a wind farm, the influence of wind power fluctuation on the system frequency of a single wind turbine at different time scale was studied. The capacity of the energy storage device required for frequency smoothing at the optimal time scale was determined, and the supercapacitor energy storage device was optimally configured in combination with the required capacity of the fan to participate in the system primary frequency modulation. Finally, simulations and experiments show that the primary frequency adjustment capability of the proposed control strategy is significantly improved compared with the conventional primary frequency modulation control. It provides new ideas and new methods for the upgrade of the DFIG.
