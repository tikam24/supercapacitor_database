This paper is aimed to experimentally analyse the effectiveness of a hybrid storage system, when powering a commercial vehicle for urban use. The hybrid energy storage system is composed by two ZEBRA batteries, combined with an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) module. The integration of those storage systems is obtained by means of a bidirectional DC/DC converter, which balances the electric power fluxes between batteries and super-capacitors, depending on the driving operative conditions. Modeling and simulations are preliminarily conducted with reference to the specific case study of an electric version of the Renault Master, supplied by the above described hybrid storage system. That theoretical activity allows the optimization of rule based energy management strategies for the hybrid energy storage system, in terms of the effectiveness in reducing the negative effects of high charging/discharging currents on battery durability. Then, the experimentation of the real power train, connected to the mentioned hybrid storage system, is carried out through a 1:1 laboratory test bench, able to perform the analysed energy management strategies on standard driving cycles, representative of the urban mission of the commercial vehicle under study. The obtained experimental results, expressed through electrical and mechanical parameters in a wide range of road operative conditions, show that the super-capacitors can improve the expected battery lifespan, with values of maximum effectiveness up to 52%, for driving patterns without negative road slopes. The procedure followed and presented in this paper definitely demonstrates the good performance of the evaluated hybrid storage system, controlled by the DC/DC power converter, to reduce the negative consequences of the power peaks associated with the urban use of commercial vehicles.
