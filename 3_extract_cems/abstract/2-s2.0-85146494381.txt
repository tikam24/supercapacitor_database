With the development of the global economy and the increase in environmental awareness, energy technology in transportation, especially the application of energy storage technology in rail transportation, has become a key area of research. Rail transportation systems are characterized by high energy consumption and poor power quality due to the more flexible regulation capability of energy storage technology in these aspects. This paper summarizes the latest research results on energy storage in rail transportation systems, matches the characteristics of energy storage technologies with the energy storage needs of rail transportation, and analyzes the operation of energy storage systems in different scenarios. The adaptability of batteries, supercapacitors, and flywheels as energy storage systems for rail transportation is summarized and compared. The topologies and integration methods of various energy storage systems are studied. The control strategies under each control of rail transportation are summarized and proposed. The future development direction of energy storage system for rail transportation prospects and the corresponding reference is provided for the engineering of energy storage technology in the field of rail transportation.
