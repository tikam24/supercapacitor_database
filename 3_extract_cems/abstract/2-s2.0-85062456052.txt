Porous carbon nanofiber webs were prepared by electrospinning and one-step carbonization using modified carbon black (MCB)/PVP as carbon source without template removal and activation treatment. The MCB addition amount was adjusted and the maximum mass ratio of MCB/PVP reached 1.5:1. The MCB-based carbon nanofibers (MCNFs) were mainly composed of micropores and small mesopores. When the addition ratio of MCB/PVP was 1.5:1, the MCNFs showed specific surface area of 624 m2 g−1, high carbon yield of 54%, 10.39 at.% of surface oxygen, and 6.05 at.% of surface nitrogen. The MCNFs were directly cut into electrodes for supercapacitors, and the electrochemical performances of the MCNFs were evaluated in 6 M KOH in three-electrode configuration. The MCNFs showed a maximum specific capacitance of 166 F g−1 and high rate performance (maintaining 54% from 0.1 to 10 A g−1). In view of simple process, high carbon yield, and self-standing nature, the MCNFs may find potential application in supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
