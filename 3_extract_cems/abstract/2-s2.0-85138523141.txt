Bi-directional, DC/DC converters find a wide range of applications such as, electric vehicles, plug-in-hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging stations, residential micro-grid systems, uninterruptable power supplies, charging/discharging of battery storage, the realisation of a hybrid combination of battery with renewable energy sources, etc. Bi-directional DC/DC converter topologies are divided mainly in two categories namely, Isolated and Non-Isolated. Isolated and Non-Isolated topologies are further sub-categorised into nine and sixteen groups, respectively. Respective configurations, table summary, comparative plots of the component count, efficiency and voltage gain are also presented in this paper. Bi-directional DC/DC converters are being developed to improve voltage gain, efficiency, minimise size and cost, increase reliability and introduce modularity. In this work, a detailed topology-wise review is carried out along with respective applications, highlighting comparative features, modern technology trends and future scopes which throw light on specific applications. Based on the review, this paper intends to provide a logical and categorised approach to highlight various technical aspects in this domain.
