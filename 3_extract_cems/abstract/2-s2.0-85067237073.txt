Herein, a novel bimetallic metal organic framework (MOF) using copper and iron as the metal centers with 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid as a ligand (CuFeBTC) and its composite with sulphur doped graphene (S-GNS) have been investigated for supercapacitive performance. The synthesis of materials has been carried out using a facile wet chemical route. The physicochemical characterization of the materials employing various structural and surface techniques has been performed which confirms the successful formation of nanocomposite. The capacitive behavior of CuFeBTC, S-GNS and CuFeBTC/S-GNS has been systematically examined using 1 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte in a three and two electrode assembly. The electrochemical studies reveal that CuFeBTC/S-GNS electrode demonstrates highest specific capacitance of 1164.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with suffice rate capability as compared to CuFeBTC and S-GNS electrodes. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor is configured using the CuFeBTC/S-GNS nanocomposite electrodes which deliver remarkable energy and power output of 96.57 Wh kg−1 and 1595.12 W kg−1 at an operating voltage of 1.8 V. The as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor displays competent energy storage retention of 50.2 Wh kg−1 even at current density of 20.0 A g−1 with high power density 26973.13 W kg−1. These deliverables epitomize the latest performance record of bimetallic MOFs based supercapacitors, suggesting that CuFeBTC/S-GNS is a promising active material for high performance electrochemical energy storage applications.
