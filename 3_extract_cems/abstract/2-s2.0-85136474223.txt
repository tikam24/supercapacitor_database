Carbon nanofiber nonwovens (CFN) are powerful electrode materials with exceptional performance in energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Small fiber-diameters together with hierarchical porosity endow CFN-electrode materials with large surface areas and high electrical capacitance. Porosity of the fiber surface is often realized by corrosive activation methods such as wet-etching or using oxidative gases at elevated temperatures. In this study, we present a chemical-free, environmental-friendly, and easily controllable surface activation method using an atmospheric pressure plasma-jet. We investigate the best instant for activation along the process chain and show that the surface area of nanofiber nonwovens can be tailored by adjusting the plasma exposure-dose. Plasma-activated CFNs show an almost 20-fold increase in capacitance (CspPJ = 10.1 F/g) in an electrochemical supercapacitor setup compared to nonactivated CFN (CspnoPJ = 0.55 F/g).
