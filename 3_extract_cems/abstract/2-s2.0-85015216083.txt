A three-dimensional (3D) graphene/NiO/Si-microchannel (MCP) composite electrode is synthesized by the conventional microelectronic machining process and electrochemical exfoliation technology for electrochemical capacitors. SEM, AFM, and Raman scattering are used to investigate the morphology and structure, and electrochemical characterization reveals that the 3D graphene/NiO/Si-MCP has a high specific capacitance of 833 Fg−1 at a current density of 5 Ag−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH. Moreover, good cycling performance with 92% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles is observed indicating the novel electrode has large potential in high-performance supercapacitors.
