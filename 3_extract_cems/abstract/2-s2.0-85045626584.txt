For the goal of large, environmental - friendly, renewable, and inexpensive energy storage, the development of supercapacitor electrodes is needed, by anchoring transition metal oxide (Fe3+ ion) as pseudo capacitor electrode material with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) from an old coconut shell as electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC). This porous electrode composite is prepared by sonication and chemical exfoliation assisted by acid. Synthesis of supercapacitor is also added by glucose, which acts as a spacer between layers of rGO to increase the capacitance, also as binder between the materials used. Combining Fe3+ with old coconut shell rGO give high specific capacitance of up to 99 F/g at a potential window of -1 V to 1 V. The Fe3+/glucose/rGO electrode has thickness of up to 57 nm (from PSA result) and give a uniform distribution from EDX mapping with disperse Fe domains and not bonding with rGO.
