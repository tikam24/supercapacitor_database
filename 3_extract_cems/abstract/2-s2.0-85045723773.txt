Polyaniline colloidal nanoparticles (PANI CNs) were synthesized, employing biopolymer pectin (Pec) as a stabilizer along with hydrochloric acid dopant and ammonium persulfate oxidant. Chemical nature and electronic structure was studied by FT-IR and UV-visible spectroscopy respectively. FE-SEM revealed spindle like morphology of PANI CNs and displayed the nearly discrete particles without aggregation, showing stabilizing capacity of the Pec. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements demonstrated the electroactivity and supercapacitive property of the PANI CNs in 1 M HCl. The specific capacitance of PANI CNs in 1 M HCl at 1.5 A/g was found to be 197 F/g, where 70% of specific capacitance was retained even after 1000 cycles. These findings establish the feasibility of using the PANI CNs as a potential material for energy storage in aqueous acidic medium. Furthermore, this colloidal dispersion can find potential application in electrodes of flexible supercapacitor device and printable electronics.
