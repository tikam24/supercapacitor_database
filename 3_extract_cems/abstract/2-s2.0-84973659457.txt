A strategy has been developed to prepare conductive polymer-based nanocomposites as the electrode materials for supercapacitor with spent battery powder (SBP) as raw materials. Thus the waste resources from power could be sustainably recycled for new energy storage devices. The SBP containing manganese dioxide (MnO2) and graphite powder was obtained from the spent zinc-carbon battery, in which MnO2 was utilized for the oxidative polymerization of pyrrole. The binary graphite/polypyrrole (G/PPy) and ternary MnO2/graphite/polypyrrole (MnO2/G/PPy) nanocomposites were obtained under different reaction conditions, such as hydrochloric acid concentration, MnO2/pyrrole molar ratio, sodium p-toluene sulfonate (p-TSNa)/pyrrole molar ratio, and acid solution volume. The results showed that the electrochemical properties of the G/PPy nanocomposites were better than those of the MnO2/G/PPy. Under the optimized preparation condition (100 mL of 1.5 mol/L HCl with 0.03 mol/L pyrrole, and MnO2/pyrrole/p-TSNa molar ratio of 1:1:1), the G/PPy nanocomposite possessed a relatively high Coulombic efficiency, a high electrical conductivity of 20.0 S/cm, and the highest specific capacitance of 212.4 F/g at 1 mV/s scan rate tested by CV, as well as a retention of 89.5% of its original capacitance after 1000 cycles.
