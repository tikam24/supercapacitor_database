Polypyrrole nanofibers doped with Ni salt (Ni-PPy) were synthesized by using the fibrillar complex as a seed template in the presence of Ni salt. Morphologies of the seed template, PPy and Ni-PPy were characterized by SEM. The supercapacitor was assembled with Ni-PPy as active electrode materials and 1 mol/L KCl aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge. At a current density of 2 mA/cm, the Ni-PPy exhibits high specific capacitance of 474 F/g.
