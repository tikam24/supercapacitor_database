This study presents the development of an electrochemical supercapacitor with a cadmium selenide nanoparticles (CdSeNPs) electrode utilizing a straightforward and economical method based on kappa-carrageenan (κ-CGN). The structural, morphological, and optical characteristics of CdSeNPs were assessed. Activated carbon (AC) and green-prepared CdSeNPs were easily mixed to achieve excellent electrochemical properties. The nanoelectrode (AC@CdSe) was tested in an aqueous electrolyte of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) with a concentration of 1 Molar. Specific capacitance (Csp) for the AC electrode and the AC@CdSe electrode at 1 A g−1 was calculated to be 103 and 480 F g−1, respectively. Besides, the symmetric supercapacitor AC@CdSe/AC@CdSe device has a high specific energy of 52 Wh kg−1 and a maximum specific power of 2880 W kg−1, with a specific capacitance of 115.5 F g−1. With a coulombic efficiency of between 82 % and 100 %, the device continues to maintain excellent capacitance after 10.000 cycles.
