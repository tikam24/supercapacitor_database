Owing to the advantages of high power density, fast charge/discharge rates, as well as long lifetime, micro-supercapacitors have drawn much attention for their potential application in miniaturized electronics. Great progress has been made in recent years. On the one hand, many efforts have been devoted to the design and fabrication of high-performance miniaturized supercapacitors. On the other hand, integration of micro-supercapacitors with multiple functional materials and devices has emerged with the development of portable and wearable microelectronics. This review first discusses the recent progress of fabrication methods and strategies in the micro-supercapacitor field. The recent reports on integration of micro-supercapacitors with smart functions, for instance, self-charging, self-protection, electrochromism, self-healing, sensing, stretchability, as well as photo-switchimg, are summarized. The perspectives on micro-fabrication strategies and integrated multifunctionalities of smart micro-supercapacitors are provided at the end.
