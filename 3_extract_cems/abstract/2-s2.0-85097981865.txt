This work is devoted to the study of new functional nanocomposite materials for supercapacitor electrodes based on layers of porous silicon (PS), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and tin oxide with a high specific surface area, uniform distribution of components, and stability during cycling. Methods for producing consolidated layers of carbon nanotubes on a developed surface of porous silicon have been developed and optimized. Nanocomposites have been created by uniformly applying a metal oxide component to the layers of carbon nanotubes/porous silicon (CNT/PS). Structural and electrochemical characteristics of electrodes based on CNT/PS and SnOx/CNT/PS have been studied.
