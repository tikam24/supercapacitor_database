Freestanding carbon nanotube/carbon nanofiber (CNT/CNF) composites are prepared using electrospun CNFs as skeletons in a tubular chemical vapor deposition system. The obtained CNT/CNF composites show a hierarchical structure with a high special surface area, a high conductance (1250 S cm-1 for a 10 mm × 20 mm sample), and a high flexibility. After coated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) via an in-situ redox deposition for 0.5 h (∼0.33 mg), the CNT/CNF/MnO2 electrodes show a high specific capacitance of 517 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1, which is about 5.6 time higher than that CNF/MnO2-0.25 h ones with MnO2 of ∼0.36 mg. Moreover, this CNT/CNF/MnO2 electrodes show a much higher rate capability (57% at current density of 14 A g-1) than CNF/MnO2 ones (24% at 14 A g-1), and also show a higher cycling stability (maintaining 75% of the initial capacitance at cycle number of 1000). In addition, the symmetric supercapacitor assembled using two piece CNT/CNF/MnO2 electrodes shows their maximum energy density of 3.88 Wh kg-1 at power density of 7000 W kg-1. The capacitance of the assembled capacitor maintains 70% after 100 bending cycles, indicating a good flexibility. These enhancements in EC performances should be due to our designed hierarchical structures. It is suggested that such freestanding flexible CNFs/CNTs/MnO2 hierarchical composites are highly promising for high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
