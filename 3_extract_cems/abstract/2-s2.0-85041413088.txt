The rational construction of heterostructured electrode materials that deliver superior performances to their individual counterparts offers an attractive strategy for supercapacitors. Herein, we anchor low-crystalline nanostructured MnO 2 onto soybean stalk-derived carbon matrix through chemical activation and subsequent hydrothermal reaction. The highly porous and conductive matrix can effectively enhance pseudocapacitive kinetics of nanostructured MnO 2 . Therefore, the obtained nanocomposite exhibits high specific capacitance (384.9 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 ), great rate capability (185.0 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 ), and superior cyclability (90.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Using this nanocomposite as the positive electrode material, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled, and achieves high specific energy of 34.2 Wh kg −1 and high specific power of 9.58 kW kg −1 . The results of this study demonstrate great potential of combining biomass-derived porous carbon with metal oxides.
