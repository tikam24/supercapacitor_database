Flexible supercapacitors (SCs) are attractive energy storage devices for wearable electronics, but their applications are hindered by their low volumetric energy densities. Two dimensional (2D) non-carbon nanomaterials are the most promising pseudocapacitive materials for high volumetric capacitance electrodes. However, they are poorly conductive and prone to self-stacking, which results in unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. In this work, large-scale V 2 O 5 ·nH 2 O ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized by a facile and scalable method and transformed into layered and compact composite films with one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The self-standing films show an optimized volumetric capacitance of 521.0 F cm −3 with only 10 wt% of CNTs, which is attributed to dramatically enhanced electrical conductivity beyond the electrical percolation threshold, high dispersion of pseudocapacitive V 2 O 5 ·nH 2 O nanosheets, and high mass density of the films. All-solid-state flexible SCs made of V 2 O 5 ·nH 2 O/CNTs films show a maximum energy density of 17.4 W h L −1 .
