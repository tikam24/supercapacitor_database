Integration of multiple DC sources has received a growing interest to enhance the powertrain performance of the BEVs. To achieve this integration, multiport DC/DC power converters (MPCs) could play a significant role in the future powertrains and sustainable energy systems. This paper proposes a bidirectional multiport DC/DC power converter (BMPC) to integrate multiple-input DC sources (such as High Energy Battery (HEB), Supercapacitor (SC) or High Power Battery (HPB)) to common DC-link in the BEV powertrain. In this article, the proposed BMPC is responsible for the power flow control between the DC sources and DC-link. The proposed converter can provide a compact size, low EMI, centralized control system, high reliability and high efficiency for the BEV drivetrain system compared to other converter topologies. The proposed converter and its control system are investigated and designed by using Matlab/Simulink. Furthermore, the simulation results are provided to verify the dynamic performances of the proposed powertrain in different operating modes. The impact of the proposed topology on the energy consumption and driving range of the vehicle is presented.
