Organic supercapacitors are considered attractive alternatives to traditional inorganic-based charge storage devices due to their synthetic versatility, low cost, and environment-friendliness features. Photopolymerized anthraquinone-polydiacetylene is employed as a core component in high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). Specifically, interspersed polydiacetylene-anthraquinone/polyaniline (PANI) electrodes are prepared via drop-casting and used as cathodes in devices employing polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide anodes using aqueous or ionic liquid electrolytes. The excellent electrochemical properties of the polydiacetylene-anthraquinone/PANI electrodes, specifically high capacitance (specific capacitance ≈720 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), long discharge time, and cycling stability, are ascribed to the superior redox profile of the anthraquinone and ambipolar charge transport associated with the polydiacetylene framework. The asymmetric supercapacitor prepared using the polydiacetylene-anthraquinone/PANI electrodes displays a high energy density of 36 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 995 W kg−1, underscoring possible utilization of the anthraquinone-polydiacetylene derivative in practical energy storage devices.
