A new and simple circuit configuration with only one operational amplifier (OA) and one capacitor is proposed for the simulation of a supercapacitor which is also known as a frequency dependent negative resistance. The simulation procedure is based on the one roll-off characteristic of the OA. A second order lowpass transfer function having low active and passive component sensitivities for its Q and Ï‰0 is achieved with the addition of only one resistance to the simulated network structure and is tunable over a wide range of frequencies.
