DC Microgrid has been a key research area from the last few decades. Most of the renewable energy sources are intermittent in nature. Power management for the system is essential to guarantee high utilization of renewable sources and stable operation of MG. This paper presents an Islanded DCMG in which PV connects with the DC bus through the unidirectional boost converter and its duty cycle is controlled by the PO MPPT algorithm. Its power is fed to a variable DC load. DC bus voltage is supported by the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) (devices include Battery and Supercapacitor (SC)) with the use of active topology. Storage devices connect with the DC bus through the bidirectional buck-boost converters. A MATLAB/Simulink DC microgrid model is developed which includes a PV array, battery and SC, and a three-step Variable DC load. The results are presented and discussed in this paper.
