We report the synthesis of highly capacitive reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/SnO2 nanocomposite supercapacitor electrode. RGO supported SnO2 nanocomposite show better performance as compared to pure SnO2 electrode. RGO support has dual role to play i.e., an efficient charge collector and a rigid platform for nano dimensional SnO2 growth without aggregation. Results show that the specific capacitance of RGO/SnO2 nanocomposite estimated from cyclic voltammetry experiments is found âˆ¼653 F/g and is almost double to that of bare SnO2 (363 F/g). Galvanostatic charge-discharge characteristics also reveled high specific capacitance (215 F/g) for RGO/SnO2 nanocomposite at 1.6 A/g. Electrode performance show that the conducting support RGO improved the SnO2 particles charge storage capacity and charge collection through improved electronic conduction.
