A novel graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite material synthesized using chemical precipitation technique is reported as an electrode for supercapacitors. The graphene (G)-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposite film was dissolved in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and characterized using Raman, FTIR, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The interesting composite structure could be observed using different ratios of graphene and aniline monomer. The supercapacitor is fabricated using G-PANI in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and G-PANI-Nafion films on graphite electrodes. A specific capacitance of 300-500 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1 is observed over graphene-PANI nanocomposite materials. The aim of this study is to tailor the properties of the capacitors through the optimization of their components, and packaging towards a qualification for portable systems applications. Based on experimental data shown in this work, conducting polymer nanocomposite capacitor technology could be viable, and could also surpass existing technologies when such a novel approach is used.
