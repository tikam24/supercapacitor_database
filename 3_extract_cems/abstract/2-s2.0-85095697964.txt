Supercapacitors are a very important class of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. An energy storage mechanism is different in supercapacitors compared to batteries, which results in the exhibition of high power density. The energy storage in supercapacitors is influenced by many parameters such as the nature of electrode material, the current collector, and the electrolyte. Among these parameters, the most significant is the morphology of the electrode. Based on the type of energy storage mechanism, supercapacitors are divided into two categories: Electrochemical double layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. There is a practice to have both kinds of these supercapacitors as electrode materials to achieve high electrochemical performance. Adapting nanostructured materials for this purpose satisfies most of the above mentioned characteristics. In particular, two-dimensional nanomaterials have attracted increased attention as electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their unusual characteristics when they are one or a few atoms thick. Also, they exhibit many special properties such as highly chemically active edge sites relative to basal planes and high mechanical and chemical stability. In this chapter, we discuss fundamentals of supercapacitors and the relevance of two-dimensional nanomaterials as electrodes.
