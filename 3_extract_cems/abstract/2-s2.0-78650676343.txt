Aligned carbon nanotubes (ACNTs) array is synthesized by plasma-enhanced hot filament chemical vapor deposition of the stainless steel substrate covered by ferric nitrate. The morphology and structure of the carbon nanotubes array are characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope and Transmission Electron Microscope. Cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge technique are employed to test the electrochemical performance of the button-like super-capacitor fabricated using the ACNTs array as electrode. The specific capacitance of the ACNTs array electrode reached 160.9F/g in the potential range of -0.2∼+0.8V, at a scan rate of 1mV/s in 1mol/L Na2SO 4 aqueous electrolyte. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
