Abstract: Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as two burgeoning families of crystalline porous materials (CPMs) have been extensively investigated and applied in various fields on account of their enticing features as large surface area, controllable crystalline structure and highly ordered pores/channels. However, the greatest stumbling block to their widespread application in electrochemical energy storage systems is the inferior electrical conductivity. Therefore, numerous efforts have been exerted on exploiting the advantages and remedying the disadvantages. In this review, we mainly focus on pristine MOFs and COFs, emphasize the recent progress and highlight the milestones of their applications in the fields of lithium-ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, lithium–air batteries and supercapacitors. We hope to provide a constructive view of the structure–activity relationship between CPMs and energy storage systems and promote their future development.
