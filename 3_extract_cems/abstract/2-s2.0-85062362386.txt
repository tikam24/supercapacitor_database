Graphene fiber-based supercapacitors (SCs) are rising as having the greatest potential for portable/wearable energy storage devices. However, their rate performance is not well pleasing, which greatly impedes their broad practical applications. Herein, three-dimensional porous carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide fibers were prepared by a nonsolvent-induced rapid phase separation method followed by hydrazine vapor reduction. Benefitting from their three-dimensional porous structure, large specific surface area, and high conductivity, the fabricated SC exhibits a high volume capacitance of 54.9 F cm -3 and high energy and power densities (4.9 mW h cm -3 and 15.5 W cm -3 , respectively). Remarkably, the SC works well at a high scan rate of 50 V s -1 and shows a fast frequency response with a short time constant of 78 ms. Furthermore, the fiber-shaped SC also exhibits very stable electrochemical performances when it is subjected to mechanical bending and succeeding straightening process, indicating its great potential application in flexible electronic devices.
