This paper deals with the effect of Thyristor Controlled Phase Shifter (TCPS) & Ultra capacitor (UC) on Load Frequency Control (LFC) of multi-area power system in deregulated environment. TCPS located between two areas makes it possible to stabilize system frequency oscillations by changing the relative phase angle between system voltages, thus regulating the real power flow which mitigates the frequency oscillations & enhances the stability of the power system. Further, by integrating ultra capacitor in the power system along with TCPS results in suppressing the peak value of the frequency deviation to a greater extent than that of a system with only UC & without both ultra capacitor & TCPS. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated by considering a two area restructured power system under different contract scenarios. The proportional integral (PI) controller is adopted for the LFC scheme. Results obtained by incorporating both TCPS & ultra capacitor in the power system were found to be better than those obtained by using UC only and without using both TCPS & ultra capacitor.
