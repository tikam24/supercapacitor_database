Supercapacitors are important energy storage devices with high power and long life. But they always age much faster than expected by some mechanisms. In addition, despite considerable efforts to understand these mechanisms, there is still a lack of a clear picture of the parasitic reactions that occur in operating devices. Therefore, in this work, based on an experimental study of a damaged supercapacitor, we analyzed a white powder occurring on the surface of the electrodes due to aging. The identification of the elements of this powder is carried out by X-ray diffraction, 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The results obtained allow us to determine the causes of ageing and thus to understand their mechanisms.
