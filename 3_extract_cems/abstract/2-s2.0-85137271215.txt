Activated carbon from coconut shells is a low-cost, environmentally friendly material that is available for fabricating the electrodes for electric double-layer capacitance supercapacitors. As such, activated carbon derived from coconut shells was coated with Co3O4/CeO2, and its electrical and ionic conductivity were evaluated. The ternary technique for selecting materials was systematically investigated with an economical process. The Co3O4/CeO2 coating that was formed on the activated carbon coconut shells was deemed AC-Co3O4-CeO2. The 90-05-05 composite was the best electrode for electric double-layer capacitance supercapacitors, resulting in high conductivity (0.62 x 103 SÂ·cm2), low series resistance and internal resistance (based on the Nyquist plot), and the charge-discharge was able to reach 0.56 V for 90 seconds (1A/g). Therefore, activated carbon coconut shells coated in Co3O4/CeO2 can promote the necessary characteristics of electrodes needed for electric double-layer capacitance supercapacitors.
