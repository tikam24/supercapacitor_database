Hollow and hierarchical NiO nanosheets nanotubes were successfully prepared through a one-step solvothermal route followed by a thermal annealing treatment. The microstructure and chemical composition of Ni-precursor@PNT core-shell nanostructures and calcined NiO nanosheets nanotubes are investigated by SEM, TEM, TGA and XRD. The unique NiO nanosheets nanotubes show admirable electrochemical performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors owing to the hierarchically tubular structures and hollow interior.
