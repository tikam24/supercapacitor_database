The δ-MnO2 has been prepared by using sol-gel reaction of fumaric acid and KMnO4 in a mixed alcohol/aqueous solution, and modified with HCl and ferrous ion (Fe2+) to form different MnO2-based materials possessing different electrochemical properties. These MnO2-based materials have been characterized by BET, XRD, ICP, FESEM, and TEM. The electrochemical performance was measured by CV and charge/discharge tests in 1M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. From the charge/discharge test, the calculated specific capacitance of the Fe/MnO2 sample was 210F/g at a specific current of 0.4A/g. It indicates that Fe-modified δ-MnO2 has well electrochemical properties for supercapacitor applications. © 2013.
