Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were dispersed and loaded homogeneously onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets via an electrostatic self-assembly process. The selective modification of the outmost surface with γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) was performed. The outmost surface of the APTES-HNTs (APHNTs) was converted into a positively charged surface under acidic conditions due to the existence of amine-tailed short organic chains. A combination then occurred driven by the electrostatic force between the negative GO sheets and positive APHNTs. A HNTs@rGO composite (HGC) was fabricated after reduction of GO and investigated as an adsorbent and electrode material. The superior behavior of HGC for rhodamine B (RhB) removal and high performance as a supercapacitor highlight the potential applications of HGC in waste water treatment and energy storage issues. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
