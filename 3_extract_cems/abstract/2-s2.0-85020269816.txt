Porous graphene (PG) based positive supercapacitor electrode for hybrid supercapacitor - battery energy storage device has been fabricated successfully and studied in 1M AlCl3 electrolyte for the first time. PG was prepared by simple and easy reduction and activation process by focusing solar light on acid treated graphene oxide (a-GO) film. This material exhibits electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) performance and high specific capacitance of 270.1 F/g at 2 A/g current density as well as high rate capability. This porous graphene based positive supercapacitor electrode in Al3+ based electrolyte can be commercialised in near future for high energy and power densities hybrid energy storage device.
