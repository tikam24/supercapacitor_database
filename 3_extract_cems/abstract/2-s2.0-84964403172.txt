Simple and cost effective 'dip and dry' approach has been demonstrated for the coating of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNCTs) thin film, films are characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques where uniform coating of amorphous PEDOT:PSS on MWCNTs has been confirmed. The electrochemical performance of the PEDOT:PSS/MWCNTs electrode has been evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The specific capacitance of 235 Fg- 1 at 5 mVs- 1 has been achieved within 0 to 0.9 V potential range in 1 M aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis showed the lower equivalent series resistance and excellent frequency response of PEDOT:PSS/MWCNTs electrode material.
