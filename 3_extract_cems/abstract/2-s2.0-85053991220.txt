Continuous miniaturization of electronic devices for portable and wearable applications requires miniaturized and integrated energy storage solutions for which electrochemical double-layer capacitors, the so-called supercapacitors, are among the best candidates. In this chapter, a short description of a supercapacitor structure, several advanced electrode materials, and device characterization techniques are presented. Development of porous silicon supercapacitors is reviewed including the first publications and discussion on the main advantages and problems related to porous silicon electrodes. Various passivation techniques of the surface, such as sputtering of metals, graphene coating, and atomic layer deposition, are described. In addition, potential on-chip integration of porous silicon capacitors with high capacitance and energy density is discussed.
