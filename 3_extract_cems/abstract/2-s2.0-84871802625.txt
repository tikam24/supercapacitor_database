A hierarchical nanocomposite based on MnO2 nanowire/CoAl layered double hydroxide/carbon fibers is fabricated by a facile two-step method as a high-performance supercapacitor. The CoAl-LDH nanocrystals grown on flexible carbon fibers were prepared via an in situ hydrothermal method, followed by loading of MnO2 nanowires through a direct redox reaction between the Co2+ species and MnO4-. The hierarchical MnO2/LDH/CFs electrode as a supercapacitor displays a high specific capacitance (944 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and rate capability, good stability and excellent long-term cycling life.
