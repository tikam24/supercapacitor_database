The unpredictable intermittent Wind and Solar power combination nature leads to improve new strategies defeating weakness of grid connection and its frequency and voltage fluctuations added to insufficient stand-alone proper storage. Indeed, several strategies have been proposed in literature to harness the power sources efficiency or load repartition demand besides the intelligent management of storage energy system (HESS). Recently, the battery-super capacitor association as hybrid energy storage system (HESS) has been proposed to mitigate the impact of dynamic power exchanges on battery's limited lifetime. In this paper, a model of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) Wind-Solar system using a battery and supercapacitor for DC grid connected was implemented using MATLAB/Simulink software package. A supervision strategy of storage energy was discussed in this issue aiming to optimize the supply of power exchange between the alternative turbine-solar panel pumped to the DC voltage bus. The dynamic behavior performance of the hybrid system was evaluated under random wind speeds, temperatures and different radiations levels.
