Based on the analysis of the patent data of graphene supercapacitors from the Thomson Innovation database, the global situation in graphene supercapacitor research, including patent application trend, major patents' branch distribution and geographical distribution, and distributions of significant patent assignees and core patents, is deeply investigated, and the developing trend of the technological innovation of graphene supercapacitors is fully revealed. The conclusions are as follows: the graphene supercapacitor technology is developing rapidly. Supercapacitors and their manufacturing, electrodes and their materials, are the two research and development hotspots. China, the United States, Korea and Japan are not only the main technical origin countries, but also the main technical target countries, besides that, European is also an important market. The United States, Korea and Japan pay more attention to global patent technology layout,on the contrary, China prefers domestic market. The core technology in this filed is mainly in the hands of the United States.
