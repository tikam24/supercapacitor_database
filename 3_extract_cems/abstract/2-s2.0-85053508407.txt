Initially, carbon materials, especially carbon blacks [1-3], were the main electrode materials of supercapacitors, with the discovery of new types of carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene [2, 4-6], the electrode materials of supercapacitors have been largely widened. This chapter serves to provide an overview on the progress in development of carbon based electrode materials of supercapacitors, including carbon blacks, CNTs, graphene oxide and graphene, as well as their combinations.
