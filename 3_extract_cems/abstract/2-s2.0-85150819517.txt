Controlled morphology and hierarchical pore are essential factors for preparing high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials. Here, concave-belly-bowl-like carbons (CBCs) with micro-meso-macroporous structures were fabricated by direct carbonization of the electrosprayed polymer microparticles without any assistant reagents. Those microparticles were prepared by the electrospraying of polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1). The morphologies of CBCs were maintained under different carbonization conditions, and the graphitization degrees and specific surface areas (SSAs) of CBCs enhance with the increase of the carbonization temperature. Specially, CBC-900 obtained at the carbonization temperature of 900 °C possesses the highest graphitization degree of 2.38 and the largest SSAs of 1618.0 m2 g−1. CBC-900 also shows high specific capacitance of 174.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte and robust cycling property with almost 100 % capacitance efficiency at 10 A g−1 under 5000 cycles. Moreover, CBC-900 performs an energy density of 5.08 W h kg−1 at the power density is 250.00 W kg−1.
