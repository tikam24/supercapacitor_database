Transition metal hydroxides (TMHs) nanosheets have attracted wide attention in electrochemical energy storage and conversion because of their superior surface area, highly tunable composition, and low cost. Moreover, the self-supported electrode has been extensively studied for electrochemical devices due to its fast electron transfer and mass transport, resulting in enhanced stability and electrode performance. Hence, reviewing the recent advances in self-supported TMHs nanosheets is crucial for developing high-performance electrodes for electrochemical devices. In this review, we first introduce the fundamental properties of TMHs in terms of layered single metal hydroxides (LSHs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Then, we review various synthetic approaches utilized to construct self-supported TMHs nanosheets with tunable compositions and structures. Afterwards, the electrode performance and durability of self-supported TMHs nanosheets in various electrochemical applications (water electrolysis, zinc-air battery and supercapacitor) are comprehensively summarized. Finally, the further perspectives on current challenges and research directions of self-supported TMHs nanosheets towards electrochemical energy storages and conversion applications are proposed.
