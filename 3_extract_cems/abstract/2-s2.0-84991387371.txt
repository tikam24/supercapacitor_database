Manipulating basal plane structure of graphene for advanced energy conversion materials design has been research frontier in recent years. By extending size of defects in the basal plane of graphene from atomic scale to nanoscale, graphene with in-plane holes can be synthesized by multiple steps oxidation and reduction of defective graphene oxide at low concentration. These complicated and low yield synthetic methods largely limited research and applications of holey graphene based high performance energy conversion materials. Inspired by graphene in-plane holes formation mechanism, an easy and scalable synthetic approach has been proposed in this work. By oxidizing widely available defective graphite mineral under high concentration, holey graphene oxide has been scalable synthesized. Through simple reduction of holey graphene oxide, nitrogen doped holey graphene with high volumetric capacitance of 439 F/cm3 was obtained. We believe this breakthrough can provide a feasible synthetic approach for further exploring the properties and performance of holey graphene based materials in variety of fields.
