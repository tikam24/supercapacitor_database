As one of the effective methods for the preparation of nanomaterials, the main advantage of template synthesis method is that the chemical reactions occurring in the liquid phase or the gas phase are carried out within the scope of effective control. Compared with other ordinary methods, nanomaterials prepared by template method deliver various morphology and structure, which could deliver excellent electrochemical performance. In this review, template method has been divided into soft template and hard template, which the former is flexibility and ease of customization and the latter is accuracy and uniformity. But, the soft template lack precision and consistency, while hard template limits creativity and adaptability. In addition, the progress and prospect of template method have been provided.
