The pore structure and Fourier transform infrared analyses were carried out on the biochar obtained from pyrolysis of biomass bamboo loading ferrous salt, the electrochemical experiment of supercapacitors made from pyrolysis char was carried out. The experiment results show that the pore size distribution of coke sample loading ferrous salt is more complete, having good pore structure, the capillary condensation phenomenon of coke loading high concentrations is more obvious, and capillary concentration phenomenon of coke lading 30% concentration Fe(CH3COO)2 is the most prominent;there only remain hydroxyl and C=C bond for functional groups on the surface of coke at high temperature of 800â„ƒ;the effect of FeSO4 on the capacitance characteristics is better than the same concentration Fe(CH3COO)2 and FeCl2;increasing ferrous salt concentration is conducive to improve capacitance characteristics of supercapacitor prepared by the active coke.
