Conducting polyaniline (PANI) with high conductivity, ease of synthesis, high flexibility, low cost, environmental friendliness and unique redox properties has been extensively applied in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies including supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries and fuel cells. Pure PANI exhibits inferior stability as supercapacitive electrode, and can not meet the ever-increasing demand for more stable molecular structure, higher power/energy density and more N-active sites. The combination of PANI and other active materials like carbon materials, metal compounds and other conducting polymers (CPs) can make up for these disadvantages as supercapacitive electrode. As for rechargeable batteries and fuel cells, recent research related to PANI mainly focus on PANI modified composite electrodes and supported composite electrocatalysts respectively. In various PANI based composite structures, PANI usually acts as a conductive layer and network, and the resultant PANI based composites with various unique structures have demonstrated superior electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries and fuel cells due to the synergistic effect. Additionally, PANI derived N-doped carbon materials also have been widely used as metal-free electrocatalysts for fuel cells, which is also involved in this review. In the end, we give a brief outline of future advances and research directions on PANI.
