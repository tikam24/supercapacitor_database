There are growing demands for the next generation lithium ion batteries with high energy density as well as high power performance for renewable energy storage and electric vehicles application. Recently, nanoscale materials with outstanding energy storage capability have received considerable attention due to their unique effect caused by the reduced dimensions. This review describes some recent developments of our group in research of transition metal nitride nanocomposites in application of energy storage, especially for lithium ion battery and supercapacitor. The strategies of mixed conduction (electron and ion) network with a favorable charge transportation interface in the design of the nanocomposites for such devices are highlighted.
