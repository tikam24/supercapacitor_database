To meet the increasing demand of high-power sources in Internet of Things and integrated systems, this work reports a high-power micro supercapacitor (MSC) based on a mesoporous gold framework which is fabricated with all-wafer-compatible microfabrication techniques. Benefiting from the highly electronic/ionic conductive framework and pseudocapacitive MnO2 decorating, the device remains large capacitance even at fast charging/discharging rate. Meanwhile, the asymmetric electrode architecture expanding the voltage window from 0.8 V to 1.5 V helps to supply the MSC with an excellent power density as high as 60 mW/cm2. As a demonstration, the prototype successfully powers a calculator stably after rapidly charged by alternating current input. This work illustrates the potential of on-chip MSCs for various high-power applications and promotes their further commercialization.
