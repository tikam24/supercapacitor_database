In this study, Melamine functionalized graphene oxide (FGO-Melamine) was synthesized by chemical route. The prepared functionalized graphene oxide was characterized by different analytical techniques such as FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetry coupled with mass spectrometry (TG-MS), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To improve electrochemical properties of polyorthoaminophenol (POAP), the electropolymerized POAP/FGO-Melamine films, employed as an active electrode regarding electrochemical performance. In terms of electrochemical measurements, galvanostatic charge–discharge evaluation, EIS (electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and CV (cyclic voltammetry) were employed for conducting an enquiry into supercapacitive performance of nanocomposite of POAP/FGO-Melamine. This graphene-based electrode showed a specific capacitance (SC) by 273 F g −1 and high energy of 37.91 W kg −1 at power density of 500 W kg −1 . The novel materials synthesized in the current work show higher efficiency compared to the carbon-based ones concerning redox reactions of capacitors consisting of good stability in the existence of aqueous electrolyte, large active surface area and ease synthesis method.
