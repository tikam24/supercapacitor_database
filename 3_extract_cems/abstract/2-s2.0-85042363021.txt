In this paper a power management system (PMS) is designed to achieve, for automotive applications, a control strategy aiming to split the load power between a fuel cell and a supercapacitor accounting for the fuel cell limited dynamics, its rated power and bounded supercapacitor voltage. The power sources are connected to a DC bus through boost and buck-boost converters. The converters are controlled to regulate the Dc bus voltage and the supercapacitor current must track a reference provided by the PMS unit. The fuel cell is the main source and the supercapacitor is the auxiliary one, which recovers power at a braking or a decelerating mode. The supercapacitor current is also controlled in order to keep the state-of-charge (SOC) within accepted bounds. Thus, the fuel cell charges the supercapacitor when the SOC is too low, and, the supercapacitor feeds the power-train, whenever it is overcharged. Meanwhile, the fuel cell dynamics is perfectly controlled during algorithm commutations. Theoretical analysis and results, for a practically validated high-fidelity simulation model, show that the proposed controller and the power management system meet all the objectives.
