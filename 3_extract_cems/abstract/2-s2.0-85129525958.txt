In this paper, four NiO nano-arrays with different morphology on nickel foam were synthesized by a hydrothermal approach. It is found that the porous single crystal NiO nanoflake array (PNFA) holds superior electrochemical properties, better than the other three samples. The specific capacitance of the PNFA obtained from the cyclic voltammetry curve was 716 F g−1 and that derived from the galvanostatic charge-discharge curve was 589 F g−1 in three-electrode system. The cycling stability of the PNFA could retain as high as 92.4% after 5000 cycles. When the PNFA was assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor, the PNFA//PNFA device exhibited an energy density of 39.3 W h kg−1 (at 550 W kg−1) and could retain 13.2 W h kg−1 (at 11,000 W kg−1) in two-electrode system. Furthermore, the SEM, XRD, TEM and XPS results prove that the PNFA is a special porous single crystal structure, which combines the advantages of the cross-linked single crystal structure for facilitating electron transfer and the porous structure providing more interfaces for insertion/exit of electrolyte ions from the active material. It indicates that the PNFA is a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
