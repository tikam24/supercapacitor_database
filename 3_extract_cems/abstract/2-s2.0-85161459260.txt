The charge redistribution phenomenon is a memory effect exhibited by supercapacitors, which always draws close to the charge state at the previous moment, which makes many supercapacitor energy storage systems have obvious voltage changes during the stationary process, affecting the control strategy or causing the calculated energy storage efficiency to decrease, and may even endanger the safety of operators. In order to effectively simulate the charge redistribution phenomenon at different resting times, this paper firstly introduces the charge redistribution principle of supercapacitor from a microscopic perspective, and then proposes an optimization method of supercapacitor branching model according to this phenomenon, which can select the number of branches according to the working conditions and improve the computational efficiency of the model.
