As an effective way, surface functionalization can modulate the electrochemical properties of nanomaterials for supercapacitors. The Co3O4 nanosheets as the precursor have been synthesized using a solvothermal reaction followed by a high-temperature calcination reaction. Oxygen-incorporating CoP nanosheets were obtained via a high-temperature phosphating reaction. The obtained samples have been characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical results displayed that the oxygen-incorporating CoP nanosheets are promising anode material for high-performance supercapacitor devices. The specific capacitance of the sample could be calculated to 416, 345 and 317 F g-1 at a current density of 2, 5 and 10 A g-1, respectively. Even after 900 cycles, the capacitive retention of the oxygen-incorporating CoP nanosheets electrode was 97% and it remained unchanged, manifesting that such a supercapacitor displays a good electrochemical cycling stability. The high specific capacity, long cycle stabilities as well as great rate capability make the oxygen-incorporating CoP nanosheets a good candidate for high-performance supercapacitors.
