The combination of polyaniline (PANI)-coated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and activated carbon cloth (CC) is proposed on the basis of a facial hydrothermal and in situ polymerization. The flexible composite of CC/MoS2/PANI with a three-dimensional sandwich structure displays remarkable electrochemical performance, in terms of the highest specific capacitance of 972 F g−1 with a current density of 1 A g−1, compared to CC/MoS2 (425 F g−1) and CC/PANI (440 F g−1), good rate performance, low internal resistance, and more importantly, a long cycling life and notable electrochemical stability with retention of the initial specific capacitance at 87% after 5000 cycles (a large current density of 10 A g−1). The flexible self-assembled supercapacitors (FSCs) can display good electrochemical performance with the specific capacitance of 193.3 F g−1, as well as outstanding mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the performance of this flexible device was obviously decreased under various bending states. The present composite design concept opens a new path for the discovery of efficient electrode materials with three-dimensional sandwich structures.
