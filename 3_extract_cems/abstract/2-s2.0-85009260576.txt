Rod-like manganese molybdate (MnMoO4) crystallines with two-dimensional nanoflakes has been successfully synthesized by a novel and facile wet chemical method with the assistance of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP). Experimental results demonstrate that PVP participation is significant to control the size distribution of rod-like MnMoO4 crystallines. As the electrode material of supercapacitor, the rod-like MnMoO4 crystallines achieved a high specific capacity of 109C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 after 2000 cycles and the capacities of 93.9C g−1 and 75.8C g−1 at the current densities of 2 and 4 A g−1 corresponding to 86% and 69% of the capacity obtained at 1 A g−1, respectively. The rod-like MnMoO4 crystallines showed superior long cycling and rate performances arising from two-dimensional nanoflakes, which provided more interfacial contacting between MnMoO4 active material and electrolyte facilitating the diffusion of electrolyte and the charge transfer.
