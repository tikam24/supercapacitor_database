Zn-based hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) have received increasing attention in recent research, due to their high electrochemical performance and low cost. Herein, a composite cathode is developed based on polyaniline (PANI) and cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF), exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance. The results showed that PANI is coated on CoHCF, thereby enhancing the electrical conductivity and Zn2+ transport kinetics. As a result, the as-prepared materials demonstrate remarkable specific capacitance (741.7 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1), good cycling durability (86.15% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1), high peak energy density (312 Wh kg−1 at 500 W kg−1), and superior power density (75 294 W kg−1 at 25 Wh kg−1). The excellent electrochemical performance confirms that PANI–CoHCF composites are promising cathode candidates for ZHSCs in practical applications.
