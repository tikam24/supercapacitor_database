The Na-ion hybrid capacitor (NIC) has exhibited its potential applications for devices that need high energy and power densities with low cost. Nevertheless, due to their "Daniell-type" mechanism, conventional NIC devices require massive electrolytes to provide a good ionic conductivity during charging, which could decrease the packaged energy density. Herein, we report a novel "Rocking-Chair" Na-ion hybrid capacitor (RC-NIC) employing Na-ions as charge carriers, Na 3 V 2 O 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F@PEDOT as the cathode material and activated carbon (AC) as the anode material. RC-NIC efficiently improves the energy density by minimizing the amount of electrolyte like secondary batteries because Na-ion is de-intercalated from the cathode while it is adsorbed to the anode during charging. The Na 3 V 2 O 2 (PO 4 ) 2 F@PEDOT//AC (peanut shell derived carbon) RC-NIC delivers high energy density of ∼158 W h kg -1 and power density of ∼7000 W kg -1 based on the total mass of active materials in both electrodes, respectively, in the voltage window of 1.0-4.2 V. This is one of the highest energy densities among the previously reported NICs. This concept provides a new route to build sodium-ion hybrid capacitors that meet dual criteria of battery and supercapacitor characters.
