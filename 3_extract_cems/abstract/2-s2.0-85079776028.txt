This paper presents a new configuration for a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) called a battery–inductor–supercapacitor HESS (BLSC-HESS). It splits power between a battery and supercapacitor and it can operate in parallel in a DC microgrid. The power sharing is achieved between the battery and the supercapacitor by combining an internal battery resistor and an output LSC filter, which consists of a supercapacitor and an inductor. The battery current is smoothened to supply and receive only the low-frequency current component under any disturbance and load condition through cooperation with the supercapacitor. Complete guidelines to design the parameters of the BLSC-HESS are also presented. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BLSC-HESS configuration achieves a high-stability performance and a lower cost, and is easily applied to DC microgrids.
