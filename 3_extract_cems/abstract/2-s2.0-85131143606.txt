In the modern phase of electricity and global connectivity, a supercapacitor plays an eye-catching role by overcoming the detrimental of capacitors and batteries. Imagining an advanced smartphone, a miniature, light-weight, flexible electronic device with good power and energy capability, large-scale stretchability, and self-healing property is one step ahead of becoming a reality in innovations. To facilitate the sustainable operation and ensure the reliability of the obtained electronic system, it is desirable to obtain satisfactory performance under certain conditions like bending, stretching, compressing, deforming and twisting, etc. However, multifunctional integrity remains a challenge in a single system. The stable and insistent output can only be possible by choosing the proper electrode design and material selection. This review discusses the recent trends in different categories of stretchable materials used for supercapacitor applications, various architectures influencing their stretchability, their mechanical properties like strain, pre-stretchability and healability, etc. and the usability of these stretchable materials in smart and wearable devices.
