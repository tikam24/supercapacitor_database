A novel ternary network organo-hydrogel electrolyte is developed to improve the environmental adaptability of flexible supercapacitors. The ternary network electrolyte is composed of graphene/boric acid/polyvinyl alcohol matrix and methyl sulfoxide/water/H2SO4 mixture. A flexible supercapacitor with a sandwich structure is further assembled with the electrolyte and two polyaniline fiber/carbon cloth electrodes. The supercapacitor exhibits a high capacitance retention rate (90%) after 5 cutting/self-healing cycles. Furthermore, supercapacitors have high specific capacitance and capacitance retention on a wide temperature range of −65 °C–65 °C. The specific capacitance of supercapacitor is about 237.8 F/g and 152 F/g at 65 °C and −65 °C, in which the corresponding capacitance retention of supercapacitor is about 110.5% and 70.7%, respectively. The work provides an effective strategy to design and prepare flexible electrolyte with broad temperature adaptability, good self-healing ability and good mechanical flexibility for flexible energy storage devices.
