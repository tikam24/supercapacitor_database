As the demand for energy storage devices increases, the importance of electrolytes for supercapacitors (SCs) is further emphasized. However, since ions in electrolytes are always in an active state, it is difficult to store energy for a long time due to ion diffusion. Here, we have synthesized a phase-transitional ionogel and fabricated an SC based on the ionogel. The 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate ([EMIM]+[NO3]-) ionogel changes its phase from crystal to amorphous when the temperature was elevated above its phase transition temperature (∼44 °C). When the temperature is elevated from 25 to 45 °C, the resistivity of the gel is decreased from 2318.4 kω·cm to 43.2 ω·cm. At the same time, the capacitance is boosted from 0.02 to 37.35 F g-1, and this change was repeatable. Furthermore, the SC exhibits an energy density of 7.77 Wh kg-1with a power density of 4000 W kg-1at 45 °C and shows a stable capacitance retention of 87.5% after 3000 cycles of test. The phase transition can switch the SCs from "operating mode" to "storage mode" when the temperature drops. A degree of self-discharge is greatly suppressed in the storage mode, storing 89.51% of charges after 24 h in self-discharge tests.
