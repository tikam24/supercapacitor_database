A polyaniline-carbon microsphere (PANI-CMS) hybrid was prepared by an electrochemical deposition method and used as an electrode for supercapacitors. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy were used to characterize its morphology and structure. The supercapacitive performance of the hybrid was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cycling tests. Results indicate that polyaniline is uniformly coated on the outer surfaces of the CMSs by the electrochemical deposition. The hybrid has a specific capacitance of 206 F·g-1 at a current density of 1 A·g-1. It has a higher specific capacitance and more stable cycle performance than PANI, which is ascribed to a synergistic effect between the PANI and the CMSs.
