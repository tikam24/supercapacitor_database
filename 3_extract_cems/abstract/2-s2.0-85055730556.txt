Activated carbon derived from plant wastes is attractive for the fabrication of low cost and high performance electrochemical energy storage devices. The heteroatoms (O, N)-doped porous carbon (KAC-700) is fabricated from bamboo shoots shells via KOH activation. The symmetric supercapacitor based on KAC-700 has gravimetric and volumetric capacitance of 223.21 F g−1 and 167.63 F cm−3, respectively, at current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. This supercapacitor also delivers a high energy density of 13.15 Wh kg−1 at power density of 546.60 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, as well as high capacitance retention rate of 93.62% after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Compared with graphene, carbon nanotubes and other expensive carbon material, this activated carbon has a bright future due to its low cost and easy fabrication process as electrode material for supercapacitors.
