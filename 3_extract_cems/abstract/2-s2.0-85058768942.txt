A carbon-coated molybdenum dioxide-reduced graphene oxide (RGO@MoO 2 /C) composite was synthesized as a high-performance electrode for supercapacitors via a facile hydrothermal method. In this composite, RGO not only provided high conductivity to benefit effective electron transfer, but also offered nucleation sites to load in situ formed MoO 2 /C nanoparticles. The MoO 2 @C nanoparticles interconnected with each other forming nanoclusters and were anchored uniformly on RGO sheets instead of self-agglomerating into large aggregates. This allowed more MoO 2 grains to gain easy access to both the conductive network and the electrolyte for efficient electron and ion transfer. Moreover, this effect was achieved after the addition of a rather small amount of GO (5 wt%), which allowed high MoO 2 /C loading to contribute to the overall capacitance. When the RGO@MoO 2 /C composite was evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors, a synergistic effect was exerted with high specific capacitance (1224.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 ) and large reversibility (92% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles), both of which were of great advantage over individual MoO 2 /C composite. RGO@MoO 2 /C was also used to construct a symmetric supercapacitor, which showed enhanced voltage profiles and could light an LED device for dozens of minutes, thus confirming its excellent electrochemical performance.
