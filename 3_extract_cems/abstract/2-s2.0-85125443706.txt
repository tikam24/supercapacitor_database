Flexible electrodes are candidate for portable and wearable electronic storage devices. In this work, high-performance flexible self-supporting CoSe2/carbon fiber felt (CoSe2/CFF) electrode was prepared via the microwave method without any binder. The CoSe2/CFF electrodes exhibited superior electrochemical performance (621 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and an ultra-high cycling life (84.7% capacitance retention after 100,000 cycles). When the CoSe2/CFF was used as the positive electrode for the flexible supercapacitor, the assembled device exhibited an outstanding energy density of 22.43 W h Kg−1 at a power density of 823.12 W kg−1. Because of the excellent mechanical stability of the device, it maintained 91.3% of its initial C after bending from 0° to 180°. The CoSe2/CFF proposed in this work shows electrode promising applicability to a low-cost, small-sized wearable and portable energy storage device.
