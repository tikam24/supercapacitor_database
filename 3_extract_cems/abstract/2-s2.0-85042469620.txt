In this work, a high-capacitance hybrid nanocomposite based on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and polyindole (PIn) was fabricated via an in situ chemical oxidative polymerization approach. The structure and morphology of PIn/RGO were investigated by FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical properties of this electrode in aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte were also investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Compared to RGO and PIn electrodes, the PIn/RGO hybrid nanocomposite shows a large improved specific capacitance of 322.8 F g1 at 1.0 A g1, good stability with a cycling efficiency of 94.5% after 1000 cycles, and high energy density of 36 W h kg1 at a high power density of 5000 W kg1. The enhanced performance is proposed to arise from the synergetic effect between PIn and RGO. In addition, the symmetric PIn/RGO//PIn/RGO supercapacitor showed specific capacitance of 99.8 F g1 and only 3.7% decay after 1000 cycles. These results imply that PIn/RGO should be a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
