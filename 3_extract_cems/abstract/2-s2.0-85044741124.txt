Screen-printed reduced graphene oxide (rGO)–polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites with/without post-annealing were used as the electrode of a supercapacitor with a polyvinyl alcohol/H2SO4 quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte. Annealing can remove part of the ineffective organic binders and thus enhance the supercapacitive performance. However, too high an annealing temperature may damage PANI, thus reducing the pseudocapacitance. Annealing at 100°C for 10 min results in the best achieved areal capacitance of 102.73 mF/cm2, as evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) under a potential scan rate of 2 mV/s. The capacitance retention rate is 88% after 1000 CV cycles under bending with a bending radius of 0.55 cm.
