Herein, a novel hierarchical porous carbon nanosheet with high N content was successfully prepared by pyrolyzing a spidroin heterologously expressed in engineered Escherichia coli through a pre-carbonization process and a subsequent KOH activation process. The as-obtained carbon materials absolutely inherited the characteristics of natural spidroin at the molecular level and presented a nanosheet structure. At an activation temperature of 800 °C, the material exhibited a large specific surface area (2170 m2 g−1) and a high N content (2.83 wt%). As a result, this material (AS-PC800) displayed a specific capacitance (Cg) of 561 or 384 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, based on a three- or two-electrode system, respectively. The assembled symmetrical coin-like supercapacitor showed a good rate capability (Cg held 353 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) and cycling stability (Cg retained over 95.8% after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The symmetrical device delivered a high energy density of 85.84 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 with the [BMIm]BF4/AN electrolyte. Additionally, AS-PC800 exhibited the optimal oxygen reduction properties. The onset reduction potential began at 0.98 V vs. RHE which is very close to that of the commercial 20% Pt/C (1.04 V) catalyst. This work provides an innovative method for exploring novel biomass precursors in the development of porous carbon materials for energy conversion and storage applications.
