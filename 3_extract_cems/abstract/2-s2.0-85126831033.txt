A pristine, redox-active triphenylstibine based COF (Sb-COF) exhibits well-uniform nanostructures which could provide sufficient electron conduction pathways and minimize the ion transport lengths, making triphenylstibine moieties readily accessible by the electrolyte. The assembled Sb-COF//rGO thus provides an excellent energy density of 69 W h Kgâˆ’1
