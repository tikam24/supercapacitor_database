A major problem to tackle in applications of the electric field is energy storage. Various systems have been proposed for energy storage based upon power and energy densities. This paper deals with one of the mixed energy storage systems known as hybrid energy storage system (HESS). The hybrid energy storage system consists of a battery as a supply in steady state and an ultracapacitor as supply during transient state. To make optimum use of a hybrid energy storage system, there must be power sharing from source to load as well as between the battery and the ultracapacitor. In this paper, energy and power management between the battery and the ultracapacitor in hybrid energy storage system with a DC-to-DC bidirectional converter consisting of two-switch topology and a control strategy based upon charging and discharging of energy storing devices is presented. Typical configuration used for the battery and the ultracapacitor along with different power management scenarios are studied. The performance of the system is validated by simulation results.
