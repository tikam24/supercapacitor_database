Among a large variety of energy storage technologies, supercapacitors possess special advantages such as rapid charge/discharge, high power density, safety, and environmental friendliness to meet the requirement of specific applications. The common electrode materials of supercapacitors, including porous carbon, conductive polymers, and metal oxides/hydroxides, have their own benefits and drawbacks in energy density and stability. Owing to the big surface area and controllable porosity, the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored as important candidates for supercapacitor applications. This mini-review focuses on the recent advances of MOF-based materials including pristine MOFs, MOFs composite materials, and MOF-derived materials in the development of long cycling life supercapacitors. The devices discussed here mean those with capacitive retention rates of more than 90% after 10,000 cycles and high energy density. In addition, we also describe the fundamental knowledge of supercapacitors, highlight the stabilization mechanism of MOFs, and propose the strategies to enhance the stability of MOF-based supercapacitor electrodes.
