The wearable demand of modern electronic devices makes flexible and stretchable energy storage device urgently needed. Stretchable and flexible supercapacitors (SCs) are energy storage devices that provide ultrahigh power density while having long-term durability, high security, and electrochemical stability. Among different SCs electrode materials, CNTs and graphene-based materials exhibit great potential in terms of stretchable SCs due to its ultrahigh electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and good mechanical properties. In this review, the state-of-the-art process and achievements in the field of stretchable SCs enabled by CNTs and graphene are presented, which include the novel design strategy, mechanical and electrochemical properties. The final section highlights current challenges and future perspectives on research in this thriving field.
