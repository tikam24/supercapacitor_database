In this work, a flower-like porous Ni-MOFBDC@C (MOFs@Csp) has been synthesized successfully on carbon material through two surfactants (SDS and PVP) control by means of a facile solvothermal method. SEM results reveal that the MOFs@Csp is the porous material that bends and folds into the flower shape of Ni-MOF nano sheets orientated grown on the carbon materials. The results also illustrate that the carbon material plays the role of template and conductive reinforcing agent. Under the action of carbon and double surfactants, the MOFs@Csp has the highest specific capacity and the lowest resistance of charge transfer in the four Ni-MOFBDC materials (namely MOFs@Csp, MOFs@Cp, MOFs@Cs and Ni-MOFBDC). That is the specific capacity of MOFs@Csp is 1350.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, corresponding to resistance of charge transfer of 0.3 Q. Moreover, the energy density of the asymmetric device assembled by MOFs@Csp is 42.9 Wh kg-1 under 813.1 W kg-1.
