In this work, V2O5 particulate electrospun V2O5/rGO/PCL nanofibers were synthesized and annealed for 3 h at 60 °C for supercapacitor application. The scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the average diameter nanofiber and crystallite size of particulates varied from 200 to 300 nm and 59.7 to 43.3 nm respectively with different concentrations of V2O5 content. The radius of gyration, Rg of the clusters varied from 8.9 to 11.06 nm, whereas mass fractal, Dm varies between 2.9 and 2.8 with an increase in V2O5 in the V2O5/rGO/PCL nanofiber. The FTIR vibrational peaks at 549 cm−1 and 798 cm−1 are about symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of the V-O-V bond. The optical emission of V2O5/rGO/PCL nanofibers decreased from 2.6 to 2.24 eV due to a transition alternation of the oxygen lone pair in the carbon π network. The cyclic voltammetry analysis of the maximum specific capacitance of 702F g−1 at scan rate 10 m Vs−1 in 1 M KCl was used as the electrolyte of the potential window of −0.3 to 0.3 V. and minimum equivalent series resistance, ESR are 44.25 Ω, at the current density of 2Ag−1 respectively. The Nyquist plot analysis confirmed solution resistance,RS and charge transfer resistance (RCT), are 19.8 Ω and 442.56 Ω respectively. The Raman peak D band and G band are at 1345 cm−1 and 1615 cm-1attributed to the presence of graphene in the V2O5/rGO/PCL nanofibers. The ID/IG for rGO to be 1.26 to 0.7 decreases V2O5/rGO/PCL nanofiber. The FT-IR analysis reveals O–V3, V–O–V, C–O, C–O–C, C–O–H, C[dbnd]O, C[tbnd]N, C–Nn and O–H chemical bonds respectively.
