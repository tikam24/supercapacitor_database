Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has unique properties that can revolutionize the performance of the functional devices. rGO hybrids can be designed with transition metal oxides for improved energy storage applications. Herein, a hybrid composite of conductive rGO with titanium dioxide, designed by a simple hydrothermal method, is reported to demonstrate a high double layer capacitance in aqueous electrolyte systems. The mesoporous structure of the composite provides short ion diffusion pathways and the resultant capacitance of the material is 334 F gâˆ’1 with ~77% capacitance retention after 7000 charge-discharge cycles.
