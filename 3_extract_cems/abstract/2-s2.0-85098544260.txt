Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional wired charging methods for electric vehicles, a wireless charging device based on supercapacitor is designed to realize the full automation of wireless charging of cars. The system uses the electromagnetic induction to transfer energy through coil induction, and uses the quick charge and bigger energy storage of supercapacitor to avoid poor contact, low charging speed, interface heating and damage caused by multiple plugging and unplugging because of oxidation and passivation of the metal surfaces. This system has very important practical significance to increase the service life of the whole machine, and improve the environmental adaptability of the entire system.
