Rapid motion of electrolyte ions is a crucial requirement to ensure the fast charging/discharging and the high power densities of supercapacitor devices. This motion is primarily determined by the pore size and connectivity of the used porous carbon electrodes. Here, the diffusion characteristics of each individual electrolyte component, that is, anion, cation, and solvent confined to model carbons with uniform and well-defined pore sizes are quantified. As a result, the contributions of micropores, mesopores, and hierarchical pore architectures to the overall transport of adsorbed mobile species are rationalized. Unexpectedly, it is observed that the presence of a network of mesopores, in addition to smaller micropores—the concept widely used in heterogeneous catalysis to promote diffusion of sorbates—does not necessarily enhance ionic transport in carbon materials. The observed phenomenon is explained by the stripping off the surrounding solvent shell from the electrolyte ions entering the micropores of the hierarchical material, and the resulting enrichment of solvent molecules preferably in the mesopores. It is believed that the presented findings serve to provide fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of electrolyte diffusion in carbon materials and depict a quantitative platform for the future designing of supercapacitor electrodes on a rational basis.
