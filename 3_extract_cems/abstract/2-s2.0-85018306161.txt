Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has almost no contribution to the inertia of the power system because the power electronic converter decouples wind turbine speed and grid frequency. With the increased penetration of DFIG based wind farms, the fluctuation of grid frequency will become more and more significant. To effectively use the "hidden" inertia of DFIGs, a hybrid adaptive fuzzy control scheme that uses both rotating mass of DFIGs and super-capacitor paralleling between rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC) as the virtual inertia source was proposed to provide short-term frequency regulation. The power system with different wind power penetration on real time simulation platform RT-LAB was used to validate the proposed control strategy. By compared with other control methods, the proposed method could quickly provide active power support when the load suddenly changed, and system could be recovered to the MPPT state after the error of frequency was reduced.
