Supercapacitors (SCs) hold great promise as energy storage devices for next-generation electronics. Highperformance supercapacitor electrodes based on semiconductor nanowires (TiN, and TiO2) and nanowire heterostructures (e.g., TiO2/MnO2 and TiO2/C core-shell nanowires) have been developed. These 1D semiconductor nanowires and nanowire heterostructures show significantly enhanced performance and stability in applications for SCs. Â© OSA 2013.
