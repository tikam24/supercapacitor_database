Recently, several research groups have analyzed more seriously what can be done to preserve natural resources and regulate energy use. Energy storage systems in several, industrial uses and bulk energy storage systems may play a vital role. The present chapter will address multiple subjects, first, evaluating the comprehensive capacitors and supercapacitor work development for high-energy storage, and second, summarizing the bio capacitor preparation mechanisms and properties and the bio supercapacitor method. Before that, it describes electrodes and electrolytes. Finally, to boost the improvement materials, the significant opportunities and future challenges are also explained. Ultimately the significant prospects and potential threats are often clarified to raise the resources for development.
