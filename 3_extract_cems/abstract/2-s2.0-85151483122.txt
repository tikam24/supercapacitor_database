Abstract: The possibility of synthesizing carbon–carbon nanocomposites with nanofibers embedded in a carbon matrix by two-stage dehydrochlorination (under the action of alkali followed by carbonization) of a carbon-chain chloropolymer has been shown. Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride was used as the initial chloropolymer, and nitrogen-containing carbon nanofibers (N-CNFs) were used as a nanoscale component. The structure of the resulting nanocomposites was examined by electron microscopy and the texture parameters were studied using low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption. The introduction of N-CNFs into the carbon matrix and the activation of the resulting carbon–carbon nanocomposite in an atmosphere of CO2 contributed to the formation of a micro- and mesoporous material with a specific surface area of ~1100 m2/g. It was shown that the resulting nanocomposites were characterized by high energy capacity and energy efficiency when tested as electrodes of electrochemical supercapacitors.
