Developing capacitor with high capacitance and power capacity has received much attention in the scientific research. This research aimed to study the effect of polyaniline (PANI) content on the capacitance of the capacitor fabricated from PANI/carbon powder composites. Wasted-sweet potato was used as the source of carbon for synthesizing carbon powder (CP). Two types of CP were considered in the study, including with and without sulfuric acid pre-treatment. For CP without acid treatment, the sweet potato was heated at 900 °C for 2 h in argon atmosphere. For CP with acid treatment, the sweet potato was reacted with concentrated sulfuric acid for 2 h and then heated at 900 °C for 2 h in argon atmosphere. Both samples were ground before use. PANI contents of 0-5 %wt were used to combine with the CP samples. SEM, FTIR and potentiostat/galvanostat, respectively, investigated the physical, chemical and electrochemical properties of the composites. The electrochemical results showed that 5 %wt PANI composited with acid-treated CP provided the highest specific capacitance of 304.87 F/g. This composite also showed high stability under charge-discharge investigation. This study confirms that carbon powder synthesized from wasted-sweet potato composited with PANI can be useful for developing supercapacitor.
