Supercapacitor is widely in many applications, and accurate models will reflect the information just like the real situation of the practical application and provide a basis to users. However, the relationship between each parameter and the charge and discharge currents is ignoring in the traditional modeling. So the accuracy of the model is lower. This paper presents an extended model in which the constant resistance is replaced by a variable resistor with the current changes. The experimental data was obtained by a charge and discharge experiment, and the Parameter Estimation was used to identify the values of the model parameters. The dynamic value of the variable resistor was got in polynomial fitting method. The results showed that characteristics of the extended dynamic supercapacitor model was more accurate.
