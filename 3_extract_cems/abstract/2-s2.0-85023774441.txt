An amorphous composite film consisted of manganese and nickel oxide was synthesized using simple chronopotentiometry method and tested as electrode material for supercapacitor. The composite film was examined using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemical characterizations. The electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and frequency response analyzer by a three-electrode configuration. The prepared composite electrode remained amorphous until 400 °C. The composite film deposited at 13 min and annealed at 300 °C was found to perform the best. It exhibited a good specific capacitance of 670 F g−1 over a potential window of 1 V in 1 M Na2SO4. Annealing temperature higher than 300 °C brought about a rapid decrease in specific capacitance. The composite electrode remained 61% of initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles.
