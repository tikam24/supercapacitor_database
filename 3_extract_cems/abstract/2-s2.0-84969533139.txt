TiO2 of various morphologies was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Among them, urchin-like TiO2 exhibited the largest BET [Brunauer-Emmett-Teller] specific surface area. In this paper, the full-cell was fabricated using Urchin-like TiO2 as negative electrode and the activated carbon as positive electrode and measured electrochemical properties for cell balancing of cylindrical hybrid supercapacitors. The hybrid supercapacitor using urchin-like TiO2 with a large specific surface area had a discharge-specific capacitance of 61.1 Fg-1 and excellent cycle life. Also, the hybrid supercapacitor with an urchin-like TiO2 negative electrode showed a maximum power density of 12224.356 W kg-1 at an energy density of 10.134 Wh kg-1 and maximum energy density of 50.648 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 194.412 W kg-1. Thus, urchin-like TiO2 showed potential as a material for the negative electrode of hybrid supercapacitors.
