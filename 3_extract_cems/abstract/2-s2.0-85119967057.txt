Integrating renewable energy source and storage device is a viable solution to handle the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. A compact three-port integrated DCâ€“DC converter topology (TPIC) is proposed to integrate a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH), supercapacitor (SC) and load. A dual output buck-boost converter meant for maximum power extraction and dual input buck converter meant for voltage regulation are integrated to form the three- port converter. Time multiplexed pulse skip modulation (TMPSM) technique is proposed for the voltage regulation of the buck converter. The proposed converter topology and control scheme is validated through simulation and experimentation.
