In order to improve the engineering practicability and cyclic stability of electrode material, the biomass-based porous carbon is designed as the solid substrate to load the mixed metal hydroxide. O-doped layered porous carbon is prepared from bagasse pith by chemical activation. Its flat and broad surface is ideal for loading metal hydroxide. A simple strategy is devised to synthesize Sr-doped urchin-like NiCo hydroxide (U-SrNiCo-OH) and Sr-doped flower-like NiCo hydroxide@O-doped layered porous carbon (F-SrNiCo-OH@OLPC). The U-SrNiCo-OH electrode shows high specific capacity (616.69Cg−1 at 1Ag−1 and 425.00Cg−1 at 50Ag−1) and excellent rate performance (68.92% retention from 1Ag−1 to 50Ag−1). Compared with the U-SrNiCo-OH electrode, the F-SrNiCo-OH@OLPC-40 electrode exhibits close specific capacity (584.16Cg−1 at 1Ag−1 and 341.66Cg−1 at 50Ag−1) and higher cyclic stability (63.59% retention after 5000 cycles). When used as the positive material, F-SrNiCo-OH@OLPC-60 performs best. In the gel electrolyte, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on F-SrNiCo-OH@OLPC-60 delivers high specific capacitance (93.60Fg−1 at 0.5Ag−1 and 47.00Fg−1 at 10Ag−1) and high energy density (29.12Whkg−1 at 374.14Wkg−1). Based on the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the OLPC configuration with microporous structure similar to that of OLPC is constructed, and the charging dynamics of asymmetric supercapacitor is studied. F-SrNiCo-OH@OLPC, with low cost and excellent electrochemical performance, has great application potential in energy storage/conversion. The MD simulations provide a new perspective for understanding the energy storage process of asymmetric supercapacitor.
