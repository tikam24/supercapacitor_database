The primary aim of this article is to investigate and compare the static electric conductivity of degraded polyacrylonitrile powders under microwave irradiation in air. The resistivity of these materials was finally calculated. SEM analysis was used in order to characterize the most conductive powder. Polyacrylonitrile microwave conductivity may play an important role in the construction of high porosity area and so in electrochemical supercapacitor devices with high performances. Degradation of polyacrylonitrile carbon based nanoporous materials can be also used in the construction of fuel cells and in polymer lithium batteries.
