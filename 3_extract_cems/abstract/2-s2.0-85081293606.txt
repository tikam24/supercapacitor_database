One-dimensional carbon nanotube material decorated by NiCo2O4 nanoparticles has been successfully fabricated by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method together with a sequent annealing treatment. The as-prepared nanoscale CNT-NiCo2O4 composites with network structure manifested an enhanced specific capacitance of 1055A g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and an outstanding cycling performance compared with pure NiCo2O4. When tested at current density of 20 A g−1, excellent capacity retention ratio up to 99.8% can be achieved for the composite electrode after 6500 cycles. The remarkable cycling performance can mainly be attributed to composite unique structure that CNTs present high conductivity together with NiCo2O4 nanoparticle's eminent capacity. Consequently, the ultrahigh specific capacity coupled with admirable cycling stability makes such composite a promising electrode material candidate for supercapacitor in energy storage.
