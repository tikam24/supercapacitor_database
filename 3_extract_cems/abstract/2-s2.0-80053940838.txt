Manganese dioxide electrode with nanoball structure deposited by pulse current method has high specific capacitance and good charge-discharge characteristics. In this paper, an orthogonal experimental method was conducted to improve the capacitive characteristics of the manganese dioxide. The optimum condition is concluded as the concentration of Mn(Ac)2 of 0.5 mol/L, the current density of 250 A/m2, the on-time of 0.01 s and the off-time of 0.2 s. The obtained manganese dioxide exhibits the specific capacitance of 575 F/g at the scanning rate of 10 mV/s. When the scanning rate increases to 2 000 mV/s, ideal capacitive behavior still remains.
