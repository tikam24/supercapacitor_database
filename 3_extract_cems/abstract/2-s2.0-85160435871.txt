Effective ion and electron transport pathways provide an effective method to further improve the energy storage performance of layered double hydroxide (LDH) for supercapacitors. Here, microflower-like NiMn LDH/silver nanowires (Ag NWs) composites for high-performance supercapacitors are constructed by a convenient hydrothermal method, in which silver nanowires are found to not only ensure excellent electron conductivity but also have a positive effect on the growth of LDH nanosheets to form the unique three-dimensional open pore structure. In addition, the significantly increased interlayer spacing of the composite enables fast ion transport. In particular, NiMn LDH/Ag NWs exhibits higher specific capacitance (1436.30 F·g−1 at 2 A·g−1) in a three-electrode system, which is 121.29% of the specific capacitance of pure NiMn LDH. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with NiMn LDH/Ag NWs and AC electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 215.63 F·g−1 at 2 A·g−1, superior energy density of 71.95 Wh·kg−1 and excellent cycling stability, illustrating that the NiMn LDH/Ag NWs composite is the promising material for supercapacitor applications.
