Nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials have now become one of the most important candidates for efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysis and supercapacitors because of their low cost and high stability. In the present study, a novel triazine-based, quaternary bipyridinium-type framework (TBPF) is synthesized by polycondensation of 4,4′-bipyridine with cyanuric chloride. The as-synthesized TBPF is then subject to pyrolysis at 900 °C, yielding N-doped porous carbon (N/C-900). The N/C-900 material possesses brain-like architecture, high N-containing functionalities (5.40 at.% N), and relatively high specific surface area (684 m 2 g −1 ), which can act as a truly metal-free catalyst toward ORR and an electrode material for supercapacitors. Due to the synergistic effects, the N/C-900 material shows outstanding ORR electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline media with an onset potential of 0.969 V (vs RHE), a half-wave potential of 0.843 V (vs RHE), a limited current density of 5.05 mA cm −2 , and a 3 mV negative shift of half-wave potential after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the N/C-900-based supercapacitor electrode also displays relatively high specific capacitance (217 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and excellent stability (96 % capacitance retention after 10000 cycles) in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
