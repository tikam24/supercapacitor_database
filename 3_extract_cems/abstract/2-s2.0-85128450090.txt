With the advantages of electrochemical activity for Ni and Co elements, as well as joint enhanced nature, layered double hydroxides (i.e., Ni-Co LDHs) are believed to be competitive candidates for hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) but they possess poor structural stability. Here, a series of citrate-intercalated Ni-Co LDH electrode materials are synthesized by hydrolyzing ZIF-67 at room temperature. Due to three-carboxylic coordinate sites with metal hydroxide layers, citrate ions strongly support the layered structure as pillars and offer efficient enlarged interlayer paths for OH− transportation, resulting in an obviously enhanced utilization of the intrinsic properties of Ni-Co LDHs. In combination with the abundant active sites of hollow microsphere morphology, the electrochemical characteristics of Ni and Co elements are further determined, and thus, an evolution from typical pseudocapacitive to battery-type charge storing behaviors is first demonstrated. As a result, the Ni-Co-LDH-C-1:4 with a high Co content exhibits pseudocapacitive characteristics including high specific capacities of 135 and 124 mA h g−1 at 1 and 10 A g−1, and over 100% capacity retention after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles, showing excellent rate capability and cycling stability. Simultaneously, the Ni-Co-LDH-C-4:1 with a high Ni content demonstrates typical battery-type behavior with an obvious charge-discharge plateau and a maximum specific capacity of 255 mA h g−1 (1835 F g−1) at 1 A g−1, and good rate capability with 164 mA h g−1 at 10 A g−1. In addition, the hybrid electrode Ni-Co-LDH-M exhibits pseudocapacitance-like electrochemical characteristics due to the deliberate design of involving multiple compositions of Ni-Co-LDH-Cs, which is an anticipated property for battery-type electrodes to balance the dynamics of capacitive electrodes in HSCs. This method provides a route to design highly stable and activated pseudocapacitive electrodes for future-generation HSC applications.
