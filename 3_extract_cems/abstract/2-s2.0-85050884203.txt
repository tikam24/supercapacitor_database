Flexible supercapacitors in modern electronic equipment require light-weight electrodes, which have a high surface area, precisely integrated redox moieties, and mechanically strong flexible free-standing nature. However, the incorporation of the aforementioned properties into a single electrode remains a great task. Herein, we could overcome these challenges by a facile and scalable synthesis of the convergent covalent organic framework (COF) free-standing flexible thin sheets through solid-state molecular baking strategy. Here, redox-active anthraquinone (Dq) and π-electron-rich anthracene (Da) are judiciously selected as two different linkers in a β-ketoenamine-linked two-dimensional (2D) COF. As a result of precisely integrated anthraquinone moieties, COF thin sheet exhibits redox activity. Meanwhile, π-electron-rich anthracene linker assists to improve the mechanical property of the free-standing thin sheet through the enhancement of noncovalent interaction between crystallites. This binder-free strategy offers the togetherness of crystallinity and flexibility in 2D COF thin sheets. Also, the synthesized porous crystalline convergent COF thin sheets are benefited with crack-free uniform surface and light-weight nature. Further, to demonstrate the practical utility of the material as an electrode in energy-storage systems, we fabricated a solid-state symmetrical flexible COF supercapacitor device using a GRAFOIL peeled carbon tape as the current collector.
