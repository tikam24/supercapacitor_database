Hybrid power sources which are combination of solar cell or windmill along with the battery and ultra capacitor are mainly used in electric vehicles applications and also in renewable energy sources system. In this paper, ultra-capacitor used in the hybrid power source which comprise of battery and ultra capacitor, is charged during the regenerative braking of DC motor drive is implemented. The DC motor is supplied from this hybrid power source through a bidirectional converter. The implementation of regenerative braking in the DC motor drive increase the efficiency of the system, reduce the wastage of energy and eliminate the toxic gases produced in the present automobiles. Ultra capacitor used in the hybrid power source withstands the sudden rise in regenerative current, which lead long life to battery. Also the charging time of the ultra capacitor is less compared to the secondary cell An experimental prototype is developed.
