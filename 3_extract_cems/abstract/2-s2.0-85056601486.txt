With the huge variety of wearable/stretchable electronic devices that require materials with different properties depending on the applications, securing the large reserves of stretchable material systems is crucial. In this study, trimethylolpropane formal acrylate (TFA)-based polymer films are explored to develop stretchable composite electrodes. The TFA resin containing 1-hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone as a photoinitiator is UV curable and shows a high optical transmittance of ∼93.0 ± 0.3% and a low haze of ∼0.29 ± 0.03%. The TFA films can withstand a tensile strain up to 100% and show excellent mechanical reliability during 30 cycles of tensile tests. Furthermore, the elastomeric TFA films are attachable to polymer or glass substrates, and during multiple adhesion tests, show a lower degradation of the adhesion properties than that showed by typical adhesive materials such as scotch tapes. The electrodes fabricated by embedding Ag nanowires in the surface of the TFA films (TFA/Ag nanowire electrodes) function as stretchable/patchable conductors under severe mechanical deformation such as stretching and crumpling. Furthermore, a patchable/stretchable supercapacitor comprising the TFA/Ag nanowire electrodes as a current collector is demonstrated that shows a reliable electrochemical performance under bending, stretching, and twisting conditions.
