V2O5 nanoparticles with different morphologies were prepared by a hydrothermal method using carbon pellets and glucose as templates, and CNT/Gr/V2O5 composites were in-situ synthesized by adding graphene (Gr) and carbon nanotubes (CNT) in the hydrothermal process. The results show that both carbon spheres and glucose both have a function of reducing agent. The sample particles prepared by using carbon spheres as a template are multi-layered rosettes with a specific capacitance of 170F/g at a scanning rate of 2mV/s. The samples prepared by using glucose as a template are porous and hollow microspheres with a specific capacitance of 324F/g at a scanning rate of 2mV/s. CNT/Gr/V2O5 composite in-situ synthesized at a glucose amount of 1mol/L has a specific surface area of 382.7m2/g and a specific capacitance of 274F/g at a scanning rate of 2mV/s, showing a good electrochemical performance.
