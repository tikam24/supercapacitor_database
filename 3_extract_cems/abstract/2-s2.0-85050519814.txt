This paper aims to present the mathematical modeling of a cascade DC-DC converter. The modeling technique will be applied to supercapacitors modules connected in series, a topology usefull in electric vehicles. Using state space averaging modeling technique, a model for three series connected modules was obtained, which was later used to obtain a general model for N series connected modules. Simulation results of a base case circuit were used to validate the mathematical model.
