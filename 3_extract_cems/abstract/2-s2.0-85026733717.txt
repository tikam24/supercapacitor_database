An electrochemical electrode, based on dual-morphology manganese-oxide nanoparticles, is fabricated via acidic reduction of potassium permanganate, which consists of amorphous, porous surface, terminated by crystalline edges. The higher surface-to-volume ratio into the pores promotes the surface redox reaction via higher utilization of active materials, whereas the crystalline edges enhance bulk insertion/de-insertion of cations/protons to promote bulk redox reactions. This combinatorial effect increases the charge storage performance of the manganese-oxide-based supercapacitor electrode considerably, with a specific capacitance ∼1000 F g−1. Additionally, removal of K+-ions within manganese-oxide matrix, via repeated rinsing steps during synthesis, enhances the charge transport properties for improved supercapacitive activity.
