The present study portrays the synthesis of ZnO/MnO2-based nanocomposite with different weight percentages of MnO2 (10 % and 40 %, signifies as ZM-1 and ZM-4), and their morphological-dependent electrochemical performance has been demonstrated. The morphological study was explored using SEM analysis which showed that the ZnO and MnO2 reflected the nanorods/nanowires morphology. During the electrochemical study, the optimized ZM-4 nanostructures demonstrated a specific capacitance of (304/155.0) Fg−1 at 1/3 Ag−1, which is significantly higher than pure ZnO (160.6 Fg−1), and MnO2（206.5 Fg−1. Furthermore, the capacitance of the built hybrid supercapacitor reached 105.0F/g after the expansion of the voltage window to 1.6 V with decent cycling durability. More importantly, a 26 Wh kg−1 energy density at 4790 Wkg−1 power density was obtained, manifesting that ZnO/MnO2 is a highly appealing potential material for energy storage and conversion.
