Three-dimensional hierarchical nanostructured polyaniline (PANI) was constructed through a simple and efficient template-free frozen polymerization of aniline in strong acid condition for fabricating high performance electrode for supercapacitor. The morphology and structure of flower-like PANI was investigated, and its charge storage ability was evaluated. The PANI electrode exhibited the specific capacitance of 428.5 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, the capacitive retention remains 78.8% from 1 to 10 A g-1, and cycling retention of 62 % after 1000 cycles, exhibiting its great potential application as the supercapacitor electrode materials.
