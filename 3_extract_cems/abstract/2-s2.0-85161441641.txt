This work investigates the electrochemical performance of an asymmetric supercapacitor with a porous carbon electrode exhibiting a linear or stepwise change structure, along with a non-aqueous electrolyte, during the charging/discharging process, in which Butler–Volmer equations together with Frumkin isothermal relations are employed in a one-dimensional model to describe the deposition/dissolution reactions of lithium metal in a lithium electrode and adsorption/desorption in a porous carbon electrode. The effects of porosity distribution (i.e., linear, stepwise, and constant porosity) and the thickness ratios between two layers with different porosities in stepwise distribution on the cell voltage, electrode potential, and surface coverage or adsorption filling in the supercapacitor are analyzed. Higher cell voltage and electrode potential and larger surface coverage occur in the mode with a linearly increasing porosity of ε = 0.84 to 0.89 in the carbon electrode (i.e., 4.78 V cell voltage, 4.15 V electrode potential, and adsorption filling of 0.514 at current of 2.1 mA/cm2), which decrease with current increasing from 2.1 to 5.25 mA/cm2. The change in porosity amplitude relates to the matching between the current and electrolyte supply, as well as electrolyte conductivity and specific surface area in the electrode. Additionally, the cell voltage and electrode potential can be adjusted by varying the thickness ratio in the porous electrode in stepwise fashion.
