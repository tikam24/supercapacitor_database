The green energy revolution showcases the potential of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Moreover, hybrid energy sources are replacing the conventional energy supply system of the electric vehicle. In this context, this paper presents a fuel cell and battery-powered hybrid vehicle topology. The paper describes the mathematical modelling of a fuel cell-powered hybrid EV power train. Since a fuel cell is an energy supplier only, it requires secondary storage, like a battery. The battery can store energy during regenerative operation. A practical drive cycle generally involves uncertainty in the driving pattern on various roadways. Uncertainty in the drive cycle needs an adaptive control strategy for the performance improvement of EVs. A fuzzy logic-based control algorithm for effective utilization of energy storage units is developed. The result shows that the proposed fuzzy control is effective in the city drive cycle, which has the characteristics of frequent starting, stopping and acceleration. The potency of the proposed control strategy is validated with a case study using a modified drive cycle considering the driving pattern of Trivandrum, Kerala. The result shows that the fuzzy-based control strategy results in a significant improvement in driving range.
