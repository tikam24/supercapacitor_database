Possibility of integration of manifold functionalities coupled with novel interface phenomenon generation in geometrically intricate hierarchical nanoform has made them greatly pertinent from both research and technological point of view. Here, oxide based hybrid has been realized by integrating 1D TiO2 nanorod with 2D MnO2 nanoflake via low temperature chemical route. Meticulous tunability over the hierarchical morphology was achieved by subtle variation of reaction parameter which in turn created difference in MnO2 growth over TiO2. Morphological features of the samples were examined by FESEM and TEM. Hybrid samples exhibited high electrochemical performance than pristine TiO2 nanorods. Registered electrochemical performance from TiO2-MnO2 hybrid was found to be ∼1024F/g at a current density of 0.66A/g which is ∼100 fold than TiO2 at same current density. Such enhanced performance is accounted from higher surface area and electrical conductivity of the hybrid.
