Integrated power systems are gaining popularity in the field of power systems and DC integrated power systems are considered promising for electric propulsion ships due to their simple grid topology, low fuel consumption, and easy access to new energy sources. However, the dynamic response characteristics of the power plant can be compromised when a variable speed generator is used in a DC power system, despite achieving energy savings. In this research, we investigate the power control strategy of a specific type of a ferryâ€™s DC power plant. We establish a mathematical model and a Matlab/Simulink-based simulation model to analyze the performance of the proposed strategy. The research utilizes the fast charging and discharging advantages of supercapacitor storage devices to compensate for the dynamic impact delay of the power output when using the variable speed generator set. Additionally, an improved DC bus voltage droop control method that incorporates voltage compensation is proposed to mitigate problems related to large bus voltage fluctuations under sudden load change conditions, enabling better load distribution between different power sources. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in optimizing the speed-seeking method of the variable speed diesel engine sets matching with the supercapacitor, and its positive impact on the dynamic performance of the propulsion system is demonstrated under variable load conditions resulting from ferry operations.
