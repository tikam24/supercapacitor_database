As a good electrode material for supercapacitor, RuO2·nH2O film was deposited on tantalum foils in aqueous solution of RuCl3·3H2O by galvanostatic-differential pulse voltammetry and heat treatment. The phase transition, surface morphology and cyclic voltammetric performance from precursor RuCl3·cH2O to amorphous and crystalline RuO2·nH2O of the developed film were studied with X-ray diffractometer (XRD), infrared spectrometer (FTIR), differential thermal analyzer (DTA), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemical analyzer, respectively. The results show that the precursor RuCl3·3H2O film transforms into RuO2·nH2O through four reactions, including one from amorphous to crystal phase change with the increase of temperature. After being heat treated at 300°C, surface mass of the RuO2·nH2O film electrode material is 2.5 mg/cm2 with a specific capacitance of 512 F/g. The specific capacitance of the RuO2·nH2O film decreases by 38% when the voltage scan rate increases from 5 mV/s to 250 mV/s.
