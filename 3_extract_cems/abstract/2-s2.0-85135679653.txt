Flexible supercapacitor is an increasing interest among researchers due to its various applications especially energy storing. The super capacitors offer more advantages compared to batteries and other capacitors such as higher power densities and charging and discharging at short intervals of time. Larger surface area of electrode enhances storage capacity of supercapacitor. This chapter discusses about classification of flexible super capacitor. Different materials utilized for super conductors are discussed briefly. Fabrication methods namely, Electro-chemical deposition method, Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) process, Inkjet printing Spray deposition method, Sol-gel Technique, Direct writing Method, are discussed with neat sketches.
