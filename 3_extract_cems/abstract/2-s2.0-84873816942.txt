A new facile synthesis method of polyaniline nanoparticles (PANI) by an in-situ electrodeposition was developed in this work. The morphologies of PANI nanoparticles could be controlled by the growth time in the electrodeposition process. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the PANI nanoparticles were examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), galvanostatic charge-discharge and cycling-life measurements. The PANI electrode composed of nanoparticles showed high specific capacitance (SC) value of 719 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and high stability over 1000 cycles. The results of electrochemical measurements showed that these PANI nanoparticles have a potential application as the high-performance supercapacitor electrode material. Â© 2013 by ESG.
