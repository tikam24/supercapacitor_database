A simple and low-cost method involving pencil-drawing and electrodeposition is introduced to fabricate graphite/polyaniline hybrid electrodes on paper for flexible solid-state supercapacitors. The as-prepared hybrid electrodes, which are chemically stable, show a low sheet resistance of 32.3Ωsq-1 and a high areal capacitance of 355.6mFcm-2 at a current density of 0.5mAcm-2. The paper-based symmetric supercapacitors assembled by two pencil-drawing graphite/polyaniline networks hybrid electrodes exhibit a volume capacitance of 3.55Fcm-3 at a current density of 4.57mAcm-3, and an energy density of about 0.32mWhcm-3 at a power density of 0.054Wcm-3 normalized to the whole volume of the solid-state device. These encouraging results show their great potential in flexible and solid-state energy storage systems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
