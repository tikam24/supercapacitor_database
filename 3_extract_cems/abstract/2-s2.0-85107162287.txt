Both SiC and porous carbons have been widely used in the fields of catalysts, ceramics, electrode materials and electromagnetic materials since their advantages of excellent chemical and thermal stability, good conductivity, flexibility and stiffness. However, pore construction of SiC still faces considerable difficulty comparing to carbon materials with a large variety of pores. Herein, by developing a novel method combining the silanization of SBA-15 template, acetylene CVD and magnesiothermic reduction reaction (MRR) technology, a novel porous material of OM-SiC@OMC that the ordered mesoporous SiC interfaces with the ordered mesoporous carbon has been successful synthesized. The silanization enhances the activity of carbon deposition into the pores of SBA-15 template, MRR results in the formation of SiC between the interface of SiO2 and carbon. After the template removal, a novel mesoporous composite material of OM-SiC@OMC has been successfully obtained. Interestingly, OM-SiC@OMC contains two types of ordered mesopores interfacing with each other by the pore wall of SiC phase and carbon phase, respectively. As electrode materials of supercapacitors, OM-SiC@OMC exhibits a capacitance of 194.8 F gâˆ’1 with an excellent retention rate of 97.8% after 10,000 cycles. The present study explores a novel ordered porous materials constructed by the interfaced pores of carbon and carbide, it is promising to find good applications of these multi-interfaced porous materials.
