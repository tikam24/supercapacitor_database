In this study, we investigated a simple strategy by introducing a adhesion promoter into the electrode to improve decrease bonder content and the supercapacitor performance. The improved electrodes are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical measurements. According to the results, the treated activated carbon electrode retains good adhesion strength with smaller bonder content. The electrode prepared using activated carbon treated with the adhesion promoter and a bonder mass content of 7.0 % shows the best electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance reaches 347.5 F·g-1, whereas the internal resistance is 0.94 Ω. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
