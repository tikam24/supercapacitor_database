Biochar receives significant importance as it exhibits extensive scientific and technological potential in many fields with the added advantages of environmental restoration as a carbon sink. Traditionally, biochar has been explored for the soil amendment purposes with lower economic impacts, which hampered the viability of their industrial sectors. Thus, the value added uses of biochar have become essential, which lead to the exploration of their application potential in many industrial sectors including catalysis, water treatment, composite fabrication and energy storage and conversion. Among them, carbonaceous biochar has potential usage in electrochemical energy storage devices especially supercapacitors. Though, the usage of biochar in supercapacitors is in preliminary stage, significant research accomplishments have been devoted in recent years. As the demand for high performance supercapacitors made with sustainable materials expands exponentially, this chapter summarizes the recent developments on biochar-based supercapacitors.
