Fullerene is a unique nanocarbon nanomaterial, and fullerene nanowhisker has been identified as a unique form of fullerene, which usually consists of an aligned assembly of fullerene molecules. In other words, the fullerene nanowhisker (tiny nanofiber) has a diameter or length of <100nm, and so is very useful as a polymeric nanoadditive. Polymer and fullerene nanowhisker-derived nanocomposites have been developed using facile processing methods. Mostly, conjugated polymers have been used with fullerene nanowhiskers. The fullerene nanowhisker dispersion in the polymers and interactions with the matrix define the final nanocomposite properties. The polymer/fullerene nanowhisker nanocomposites reveal a range of superior physical features, such as morphology, electron transportation, specific capacitance, photovoltaics, and other physical characteristics. Consequently, polymer/fullerene nanowhisker nanocomposites have found applications in photovoltaics and supercapacitors.
