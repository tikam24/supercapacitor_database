Optimization techniques can be used to find optimal size allocation of renewable energy resources along with battery and ultra-capacitor used to create a standalone system. Battery and ultra-capacitors are used as energy storing elements for reducing power fluctuations. In this work optimal size allocations to different energy generating and energy storing elements are proposed by a three step optimization method. The proposed method is used for a case study to decide the sizes of photovoltaic panel, wind turbine, Battery Energy Storage System and ultra-capacitor forming a standalone energy generating system designed to supply a large academic building.
