Screen printing is regarded as a highly competitive manufacture technology for scalable and fast fabrication of printed microelectronics, owing to its advanced merits of low-cost, facile operability and scalability. However, its large-scale application in printed microelectronics is still limited by screen printing functional ink. In this review, we summarize the recent advances of ink formation, typical scalable applications, and challenging perspectives of screen printing for emerging printed microelectronics. Firstly, we introduce the major mechanism of screen printing and the formation of different organic- and aqueous-based inks by various solvents and binders. Next, we review the most widely used applications of screen printing technique in micro-batteries, micro-supercapacitors and micro-sensors, demonstrative of wide applicability. Finally, the perspectives and future challenges in the sight of screen printing are briefly discussed.
