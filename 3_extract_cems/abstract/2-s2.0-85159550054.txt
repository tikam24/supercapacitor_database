The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an innovative technology that converts ambient mechanical energy into electricity based on electrostatic induction and triboelectrification. However, the TENG has an inherent critical problem of low peak and root mean square (RMS) output current due to its high internal impedance. Herein, we propose a unidirectional charge-supplying flutter TENG (UCSF-TENG), which exhibits highly enhanced peak/RMS current output performance. By leveraging just one rectifier diode and distinctive fluttering device design, the UCSF-TENG achieved a peak current of 5.9 A and an RMS current of 20 mA. The electrical output generation mechanism of the UCSF-TENG was systemically analyzed based on the mechanical fluttering motion analysis using a high-speed camera. In addition, the UCSF-TENG was structurally optimized via mechanical and electrical analyses for various design factors, through which it achieved an average power of 109 mW. Benefiting from such high output performance, the UCSF-TENG can successfully charge a supercapacitor of 0.22 F, power 108-W commercial lamps, and operate 12 commercial sensor arrays continuously. This work provides a promising strategy for boosting the output current performance of the TENG while maintaining integrability and portability.
