The traction power supply mode of urban rail transit trains is mainly divided into two categories: contact power supply and contactless power supply. Among them, contactless power supply mode has advantages of cost saving, unrestricted operation area, energy conservation and environmental protection. Therefore, some domestic and foreign institutions have begun to carry out research in related fields and practical application. Based on the "Battery and super capacitor"train hybrid energy storage system, we study the contactless power supply technology in this paper, the description and conclusion can provide a reference for the further research of contactless power supply technology together.
