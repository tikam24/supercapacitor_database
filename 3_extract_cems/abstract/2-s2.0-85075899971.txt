Solid-state electrochemical energy storage devices (i.e. supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries) have attracted tremendous attention because they are widely considered as the promising next-generation energy/power technology to overcome the current issues of low energy density and insecure safety in conventional liquid devices. The last decade we witnessed notable performance improvement on electrochemical energy storage through advances in understanding and design of advanced nanostructured materials. One could argue that inorganic materials have played a central, starring role for the assembly of various electrochemical energy storage systems. However, energy storage systems fabricated from organic polymer networks have just emerged as a new prospect. 3D polymer is a category of pure polymer or composites featuring three-dimensional frameworks structure, which could be potentially used in solid-state electrochemical energy storage due to its high electron conductivity or ionic conductivity. Here we summarize the main research advances on the attractive use of 3D polymer networks for the fabrication of electrodes and electrolytes in either solid-state supercapacitors or lithium-ion batteries. Besides, challenges of future development for 3D polymer networks have also been outlined.
