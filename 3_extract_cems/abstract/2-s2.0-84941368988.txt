Spurred by the fast development and commercial appeal of the energy storage device, supercapacitor with large capacity and wide potential range is being more and more popular. An electronic double layer supercapacitor consisting of three-dimensional silicon microchannel plates and electroplated MnO2 nanoflakes as the active materials of the positive electrode is fabricated and evaluated systematically in an organic electrolyte (1M LiClO4 in propylene carbonate). Its composition, morphology, electrochemical impedance and charge storage mechanism are studied and compared to that of a planar structure. The silicon microchannel plates increase the specific area for loading of active materials. This supercapacitor with a large aspect ratio delivers excellent capacitive performance in limited space and weight. A single device made of the materials can power light emitting diodes, demonstrating its commercial potential.
