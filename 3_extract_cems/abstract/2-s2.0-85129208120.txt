In this paper, the facile synthesis and characterization aspects of maghemite nanoparticles has been presented, in the context of energy storage device technology. An experimental study of the structural, magnetic, optical and thermal properties of cobalt and zinc doped maghemite nanoparticles prepared by coprecipitation of ferrous, ferric, and the dopant precursors in water at different temperatures and pH of ammonium hydroxide solution has been done. The structural characterization establishes that all the samples have high surface area and are highly crystalline, 5â€“10 nm spherical nanoparticles with the cubic spinel structure. The magnetization curve is steeply linear with saturation magnetization in the tune of 60 emu/gm. The magnetic characterization reveals peculiar trends with zinc and cobalt doping, main features being the increase in the saturation magnetization, coercivity with doping, and thermal stability. The high sensitivity evident from magnetization features can be used for state estimation of the energy storage devices. In comparison to 2.2 eV of the bulk maghemite, the optical band gap of the nanoparticles has been calculated as 3.9 eV, which can be modulated up to 4.67 eV with the doping reported herein, thus establishing the conductivity modulation strength of the synthesized samples. The thermal gravimetric analysis establishes the thermal stability of the maghemite. The affordability of the maghemite electrode iron batteries will surely be helpful for scaling up the renewable energy storage technology.
