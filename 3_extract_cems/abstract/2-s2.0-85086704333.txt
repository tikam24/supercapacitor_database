To balance the performance in specific surface area and electrical conductivity, ordered sheets of graphene aerogels were induced into porous carbon foam for supercapacitors with enhanced specific capacitance. Systematic investigations into morphology, structure and electrochemical properties confirmed that the introduction of graphene aerogels can effectively make specific surface area to increase, however, the declined resistance is neither due to electrolyte diffusion nor charge transfer, which gave rise to the improvement of electrochemical performance by 55.3% with a great specific capacitance of 210.5 F g - 1 at the current density of 0.5 A g - 1 compared to that of carbon foam.
