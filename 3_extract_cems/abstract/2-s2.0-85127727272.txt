It first introduces a data acquisition method in power distribution system, and analyzes the problems existing in the energy acquisition process of this method. Aiming at the situation that the electric field energy that can be obtained fluctuates and the energy is too small due to the limitation of application scenarios, a solution is proposed to switch the working state of data acquisition module by judging the super-capacitor voltage. Finally.the paper describes the implementation of data acquisition module in hardware design and software design. The designed data acquisition module is installed on the high-voltage side without battery supply. The module can adapt to the harsh environment of high temperature, low temperature. high humidity and strong electromagnetic interference, and according to various configurations of the data transmission module, including micropower wireless channel, 4G or NB-IOT, it can be applied to different data collection and application scenarios of power distribution system, including the collection unit of primary and secondary fusion equipment, the collection unit of load monitor, etc.
