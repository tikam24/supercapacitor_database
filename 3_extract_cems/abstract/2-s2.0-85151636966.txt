Recent progress in metamaterial nanostructures and their potential applications have been gained the intense attention of many researchers in the scientific and academic community. The advanced structural and morphological modification in nanoscopic substances have opened a new window to boost up catalytic performance in optoelectronic devices and multicomponent systems. In this regard, a wider class of 2D metamaterials basically graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was aimed to address under the proposed chapter. The hybrid class of carbon nitrides doped with desired metals/elements are been focused on by giving a systematic preparation, characterizations, and their significant role for magnificent supercapacitors. The carbon-based doped 2D materials are gathered and their characteristics physicochemical activities are discussed to report superior catalytic performances by considering experimental findings/reports. The transitional and alkali metal-doped carbon nitride materials are explained along with proper synthetic routes, structural analysis, and supercapacitor applications in the present scenario. The versatile uses of these smart materials have already been established as a futuristic material for energy storage and conversations in the field of material science and technologies due to their optimal band gap, mechanical, thermal strength, and chemical stability. The elemental compositions and surface modification in atomic layered structures of graphitic carbon nitrides were carried out via different physicochemical processes for multiple uses and therefore we are going to highlight a wider overview including surface, structural, optical, and catalytic aspects toward supercapacitor applications.
