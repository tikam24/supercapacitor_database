This work reports the electrochemical supercapacitance capability of a thermally reduced graphite-oxide (TRGO) and iron-oxide (α-Fe2O3) composite synthesized by using a simple chemical method. The synthesized composite (TRGO+α-Fe2O3) displayed improved electrochemical properties, such as a large electroactive surface area and a low impedance. The composite showed an electroactive surface area of (0.016 cm2), which is almost twice larger than that of α-Fe2O3 (0.008 cm2). Furthermore, TRGO+α-Fe2O3 showed the highest capacitance (277.25 Fg-1) when calculated from cyclic voltammetry measurements. The improved performance of the TRGO+α-Fe2O3 composite results from the synergistic combination of the high electrical conductively of TRGO and the good electrochemical properties of α-Fe2O3, which make the synthesized composite an excellent alternative for supercapacitor applications.
