The carbon fibers with hollow structure were prepared by carbonization of renewable and inexpensive cotton. The surface of hollow carbon fiber was further modified by Co3O4 nanoparticles via a simple impregnation method and subsequent calcination process. The prepared Co3O4@cotton-derived hollow carbon fibers (CHCFs) maintained the macroscopic morphology and flexibility of the cotton. As binder-free electrodes, Co3O4@CHCFs exhibited much better electrochemical behavior than that of pure Co3O4. Especially, Co3O4@CHCF-2 showed a high specific capacitance of 566.89 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and high capacitance retention of 69.38 % at 15 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Using Co3O4@CHCFs as positive electrode and cotton-based activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, our asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy density and excellent cycling stability. Moreover, this electrode material can be easily prepared on a large scale due to its sustainability, low cost, facile preparation and environmental friendliness.
