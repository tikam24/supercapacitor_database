Additive manufacturing techniques can be exploited to produce effective energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Direct ink writing, fused melt deposit, and selective laser sintering techniques are exploited for these purposes. Between them, direct ink writing is the most explored. These fabrication processes allow the production of either 2D or 3D devices with remarkable performances, in some cases. In the following, supercapacitors’ and batteries’ properties and figures of merit will be recalled briefly, and a description of the recent advances in additive manufacturing approaches to energy storage device production will be given.
