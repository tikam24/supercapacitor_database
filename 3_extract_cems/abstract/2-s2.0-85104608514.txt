Porous carbon spheres derived from the facile hydrothermal treatment associated with the calcination process exhibit the good spherical morphology and unique porous structure. For the Li-based half-cell test, porous carbon spheres electrode not only exhibits larger reversible capacities and better compatibility as compared to the widely-used graphite, but also provides stable delithiation plateaus under different current density. Additionally, the delithiation ratio below 1 V almost accounts for a constant value (around 70%) with the increase of current density, evidencing that Li intercalation storage is the dominant model and Li insertion/extraction processes are propitious. The lithium ion hybrid capacitor configured with S-doped mesoporous graphene and porous carbon spheres as cathode and anode, delivers satisfied energy and power densities (up to 177 Wh kg−1 and 12,303 W kg−1, respectively) as well as long-term cyclability, which is superior to the corresponding S-doped mesoporous graphene//graphite and activated carbon//porous carbon spheres. In addition, the developed synthesis strategy is in favor of the realization of the scalable production of porous carbon spheres.
