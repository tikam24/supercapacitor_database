Layered double hydroxides (LDH) are promising as electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, their poor stability and electrical conductivities limit the further improvement of their electrochemical properties. Herein, Co−Ni LDH are well built on a conductive substrate of MXene-Ti3C2Tx and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using a one-step hydrothermal method to form vertically oriented two-domensional nanoarrays. The combination of MXene-Ti3C2Tx and MWCNTs not only serves as a substrate for the growth of Co−Ni LDH nanoarrays but also effectively maintains the overall layered structure, endowing the whole MXene-Ti3C2Tx/MWCNTs/Co−Ni LDH (MX-CNT-LDH) composite with abundant conductive channels and a stable multilayer structure to achieve excellent electrical conductivity and good cycle stability. The MX-CNT-LDH electrode possesses a surprisingly high specific capacity of 1382.2 ± 2 C g − 1 at a current of 1 A g − 1 and a good rate capability of 70.1% capacitance retention at 20 A g − 1. In addition, asymmetric supercapacitors constructed using MX-CNT-LDH exhibit a high-energy density of 78.7 ± 0.8 W kg−1 at a power density of 800 kW kg−1 and superior capacitance retention (96.7%) and Coulombic efficiency (97.2%) at 6 A g − 1 for 6000 cycles.
