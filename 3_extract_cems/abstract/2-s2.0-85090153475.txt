Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is suitable for various mobile occasions due to its significant advantages, including a relatively low cost, high reliability, comfortable mobility, and low energy consumption. Nevertheless, limited by the energy density and power density of the mobile energy storage system, the printing service time and health status of the present FDM printer leave much to be desired. In this work, we derive the first survey on energy analysis of a mobile multi-material FDM by separating a full printing cycle into different operating phases, of which the individual energy consumption is analyzed. In consideration of the switching between materials with different melting temperatures, which might require significantly varying power inputs, a hybrid energy storage system consisting of both a battery and a supercapacitor is developed. In addition, by governing work mode switching based on the prediction of power changes, an energy management strategy is finally realized to meet the design requirements.
