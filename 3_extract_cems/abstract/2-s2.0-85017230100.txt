Activated carbon-polyaniline composite samples were prepared via the polymerisation of aniline monomer into the pores of the activated carbon sample derived from waste tea. The composites were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors in an aqueous electrolyte. The effects of polyaniline content of the electrodes on the electrochemical performances of the supercapacitors were examined. The highest specific capacitance of 228 F/g at 1.5 mA/cm2 in an aqueous electrolyte was obtained for the electrode containing equal mass amount of the activated carbon and polyaniline.
