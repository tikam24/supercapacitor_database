Effective dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is of great importance to achieve their intrinsic performance. Normally, it is believed that CNT dispersion is decided by interactions between CNTs and their dispersants, while other interactions are often neglected. Herein, three ionic surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), dodecyl dimethyl betaine (BS-12) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), are used to disperse CNTs in a ternary composite, i.e., poly(p-phenylenediamine)-phosphomolybdic acid@reduced graphene oxide (DMoG), respectively, leading to three different DMoGC composites. It has been found that the CNT dispersion in DMoGC was mainly controlled by electrostatic interactions between the surfactants and DMoG, which further exerted vital influences on the constitution, content, morphology, porous structure and supercapacitive performance of the DMoGC composites. Among the three surfactants, cationic CTAB showed the best CNT dispersion, while amphoteric BS-12 could hardly disperse CNTs in DMoGC, leading to DMoGC-CTAB with a 2 times larger specific surface area (152.3 m2 g−1) and 1.5 times higher specific capacitance (422 F g−1) than those of DMoGC-(BS-12). Our study can provide valuable guidelines for selecting/designing effective dispersants to prepare multi-component composites containing uniformly dispersed CNTs.
