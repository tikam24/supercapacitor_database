Reduced graphene oxide/Fe3C hybrids were prepared through Fe-based intercalation of graphite oxide (GtO). Altering pH (acidic to basic) of aqueous GtO dispersion, the immobilization of Fe-based intercalant bearing amino benzoate groups (IFe) was strongly affected following either the nucleophilic substitution (sample: IGO) or ion exchange path (sample: IGO/b). Subsequent pyrolysis of the intercalated materials provided magnetic hybrid materials (samples: r-IGO and r-IGO/b), differing in terms of BET surface area (87 and 163 m2/g), magnetization (70 and 43 J/T/kg), resistance (3 and 3.7 Ohm) and capacitance (5 and 17 F/g) correspondingly, displaying both magnetic and supercapacitor behavior. IFe triggered after thermal treatment in vacuum the formation of Fe3C nanoparticles encapsulated in a graphite shell whose incorporation into the multi-layer reduced graphene oxide (GO) matrix provided multi-functional materials. In these materials, aggregation is prevented in two directions: (a) between adjacent Fe3C nanoparticles, since the graphitic shell offers isolation, and (b) between bundles of neighboring multi-layer graphenes, due to Fe3C nanoparticle interference. The graphitic shell assists cohesion of encapsulated Fe 3C nanoparticles with the graphene matrix as well as chemical stability, affording thus materials appropriate for a variety of applications.
