Wearable energy storage devices are crucial for the development of flexible and wearable electronics. However, their performance is still limited due to the addition of inactive additives and low porosity of electrodes. Herein, a novel strategy is reported to enhance the performance of flexible supercapacitor by a multifunctional interface design on cellulose substrate. The multifunctional interface can simultaneously take the function of binder, conductive additive and active material through the transition from the adhesive polydopamine interface to the nitrogen-doped carbon interface, and allows the electrode maintain nanoscale porosity and high specific area of 347.6 m2 g−1. The composite electrodes exhibit high specific areal capacitance of 3100 mF cm−2. All-solid-state supercapacitor based on them shows remarkable capacitance of 1208.4 mF cm−2 with excellent flexibility and rate capability, which is much higher than recently reported textile-based supercapacitors. This work may open up new opportunities for flexible electrodes and wearable supercapacitors with excellent performance.
