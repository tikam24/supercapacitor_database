Phase engineering of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can achieve phase transformation from the semiconducting phase (2H-MoS2) with poor conductivity to the metallic phase (1T-MoS2) with superior electrochemical properties. Therefore, it is desirable to prepare high concentration 1T-MoS2 by simple and facile methods. In this work, MoS2 with high concentration of 1T phase is successfully prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis through the synergistic effect of HNO3 and CH3CH2OH, which is stable for more than half of a year. The as-synthesized MoS2 shows high capacitance of 392 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as used for supercapacitors electrodes, and displays excellent capacitance retention (83% after 10,000 cycles). Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) devices assembled by the as-synthesized MoS2 and MnO2 on carbon cloths, exhibit high energy and power densities (0.194 mWh cm−2 and 13.466 mW cm−2). These results shed a light to realize 1T phase MoS2 through the synergistic effect in hydrothermal processing.
