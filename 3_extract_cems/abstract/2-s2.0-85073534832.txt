With the development of flexible electronic devices, flexible energy storage systems have been research hotpot. Conductive polymers is potential pseudocapacitor materials in energy storage field. Meanwhile, cellulose fiber with natural, degradable, renewable and flexible properties is one of tremendous promising alternatives to the flexible substrates. Hence, a polypyrrole@cobalt oxyhydroxide/cellulose fiber composite electrode is prepared via “liquid phase reduction” strategy in open system at room temperature. The composite electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, which has a high specific capacitance and capacitance retention. The highest specific capacitance of 571.3 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 is obtained. Besides, the specific capacitance of the composite electrode has no significant loss, showing high cycle stability (93.02% after 1000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the introduction of cobalt oxyhydroxide, which restrains the volumetric change of polypyrrole in the electrochemical redox process, and promotes the rapid migration of electrons.
