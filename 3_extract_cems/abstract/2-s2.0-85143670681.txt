Excellent power density and considerable energy density have made supercapacitors one of the excellent and demanding energy storage devices. The active surface area of the electrode material and kinetics involved at the electrode-electrolyte interface plays a vital role in supercapacitors. The nanostructures of metal oxides like CuO, NiO, Fe2O3, MnO2, etc., have been found to exhibit remarkable electrochemical behavior in supercapacitors. However, poor electronic conductivity and chemical stability remain as the critical problems. According to recent investigations, nanocomposites of metal oxides with carbon families that is CNTs, rGO, graphene, etc., have been used to avoid the electrical and chemical stability of the electrode material used in supercapacitors. In this chapter, the synthesis of various architectures of metal oxide nanocomposites along with their role in improving the electrochemical performance is elaborated, which altogether reports the low cost, electrically and chemically stable electrode material with enhanced electrochemical performance.
