Flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have been extensively studied because of their promising potential in wearable electronics. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is an efficient active material for the fabrication of high-performance flexible SCs owing to its high conductivity, high theoretical capacitance, and excellent flexibility. However, the numerous literature studies involving PEDOT:PSS-based flexible SCs in recent years are randomly distributed. There is a need to give an overview of achievements to date to identify the current direction and guide future research. Herein, we first focus on the origin of PEDOT:PSS capacitance and then systematically review the recent progress on PEDOT:PSS-based flexible SCs from the viewpoint of PEDOT:PSS-based fiber, film, and three-dimensional porous block. In the conclusion, a perspective on the challenges and outlook of PEDOT:PSS-based flexible SCs is given. It is expected that the design of PEDOT:PSS and its composites will pave the way for the practical application of flexible SCs.
