Carbon aerogel (LWCA) with hierarchical porous was prepared from phenolated wood by self-assembling and one-step carbonization/activation process, and the pores formation were be controlled by adjusting the content of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The influence of HMTA concentration on the morphological features and final electrochemical properties of LWCA materials were investigated. The characterization and properties of LWCA were investigated by XRD, XPS and N2 adsorption. The results showed that the doping of HMTA could orientate the hierarchical porous framework of carbon aerogels, and the best carbon aerogels had uniform coral pore structure. The specific surface area and pore volume was as high as 1845m2g−1 and 1.05m3 g−1, respectively. In addition, the resulting carbon aerogel exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. LWCA exhibited a high specific capacitance of 154.15Fg−1 at 0.5Ag−1. High capacitance retention (at the current density of 5Ag−1, the specific capacitance retention reaches 92.62%) and excellent rate performance (70% capacitance retention at 5A g−1) were possessed. This work provides a simplified technical method to develop biomass base carbon materials with controllable and layered porous for high charge storage capabilities.
