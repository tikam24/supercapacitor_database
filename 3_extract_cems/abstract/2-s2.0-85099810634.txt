Self-charging supercapacitor power cell (SCSPC) attains tremendous research interest due to their ability to harvest-, convert-, and store- energy in a solitary integrated energy device. The use of liquid electrolytes in SCSPC limits the mechanical to electrical energy conversion efficiency, therefore, the development of alternative electrolyte system is highly required. Here, we have developed a piezo-electrolyte film comprising of solid proton conducting electrolyte (phosphotungstic acid (PTA)) embedded in the piezoelectric PVDF matrix and utilized the free-standing film as separator cum electrolyte in SCSPC devices. Physico-chemical characterizations of the prepared PTA-PVDF piezo-electrolyte films such as X-ray diffraction, morphological, elemental, Raman spectroscopy and mapping analyses suggested the homogeneous distribution of PTA electrolyte in the PVDF matrix. Interestingly, the inclusion of PTA in the PVDF results in improved mechanical to electrical energy conversion properties as well as supply of electrolyte ions. Further, a graphene based SCSPC device was fabricated using PTA-PVDF piezo-electrolyte film as separators which makes the graphene SCSPC to self-charge (for about 110 mV) when subjected to an external force of 2 N. The self-charging process involved in the graphene SCSPC with PTA-PVDF piezo-electrolyte was discussed via piezo-electrochemical energy conversion process. These experimental findings pave a new paradigm in the field of integrated SCSPC that will be useful in the development of next-generation integrated energy devices.
