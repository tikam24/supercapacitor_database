Transition metal carbonitrides (MXene) with two-dimensional layered structures are a recent research topic in the field of supercapacitors. However, because MXene can easily self-stack, its capacitance performance is affected. To this end, one-dimensional cellulose nanofibers (CNF) and carboxylic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were used to intercalate MXene to obtain well-dispersed MXene/SWCNT/CNF aqueous suspensions and their hybrid hydrogels, and to obtain hybrid aerogels through supercritical drying. CNF gives aerogel excellent porosity, a high specific surface area (301.03 m2 g−1), good electrolyte infiltration, and gentle mechanical flexibility, while SWCNT imparts high conductivity to aerogel film. We assembled a symmetrical all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor and interdigitated micro-supercapacitors using an aerogel film as a flexible electrode. The area specific capacity of the above electrode reaches 746.68 mF cm−2 and 244.50 mF cm−2, respectively. This study provides a fabrication method of polymer–inorganic hybrid nanocomposite aerogel film electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.
