Germanene, with a wrinkled atomic layer structure and high specific surface area, showed high potential as an electrode material for supercapacitors. According to the first-principles calculation based on Density Functional Theory, the quantum capacitance of germanene could be significantly improved by introducing doping/co-doping, vacancy defects and multilayered structures. The quantum capacitance obtained enhancement as a result of the generation of localized states near the Dirac point and/or the movement of the Fermi level induced by doping and/or defects. In addition, it was found that the quantum capacitance enhanced monotonically with the increase of the defect concentration.
