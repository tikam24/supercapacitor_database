This article reports enhancement in the specific capacitance of Mg-doped tin oxide nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized through a simple and low-cost solvothermal method. The synthesized NPs were investigated through cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrostatic impedance spectroscopy studies. The specific capacitance, as determined through cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge characteristics, respectively, was found to be 523 and 55 F g−1 for undoped samples. Whereas it exhibited an increase with Mg doping and was found to be 981 and 134 F g−1, respectively. Also, according to the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the enhancement of ion diffusion was found to be the major cause for enhancement in capacitive performance of Mg-doped NPs.
