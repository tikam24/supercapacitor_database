Wearable electronics have shown great potential to improve our lifestyle and health. Most of the wearable electronics developed so far are either yarn- or fabric-based. Single fibres integrated with electronic functions are highly desirable, but remain difficult to make. Here, we prove a single fibre, which has two electronic functions electrochromism and supercapacitor, with a novel device structure and its facile preparation. The device was prepared using a template method to generate two coil electrodes on the fibre surface, followed by electrochemical deposition of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) on the electrode surface. An overlay of solid electrolyte was applied on the whole fibre. The fibre device showed a reversible electrochromic effect with fast response time (<5 s) at a potential of 0.6 V. It had a specific capacitance of 20.3 F g-1. The two functions happened simultaneously without interference with each other. Such an electronic fibre may find applications in wearable displays, personal power supplies and protective garments.
