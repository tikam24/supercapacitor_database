In this study, the nano-supercapacitors were electrodeposited the gold/manganese oxides thin film with potassium permanganate and gold chloride solution on ITO substrate. It was deposited for 200s by potentiostatic method (0.7V v.s. open circuit). The morphology and the microstructure of the films were examined by SEM (scan electron microscopy). The thickness of the thin films was about 30∼100nm and the thin films composed of MnO2 nano particles with Au. And the states of the ions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Such nano structure of the thin film contributes to much higher capacitance than traditional thin film supercapacitors. This is attributed to the lowering of impedance of the nano-supercapacitor by adding Au. In this study, the film with 0.2wt% god has trice capacitance and power than pure MnO2. ©2010 IEEE.
