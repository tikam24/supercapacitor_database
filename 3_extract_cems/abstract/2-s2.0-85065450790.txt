One of most difficult technical barriers for developing solid-state supercapacitors is low ionic conductivity of the polymer electrolyte at low temperature below the freezing point and at room temperature. In this work, a method which incorporates the addition of a small quantity of K4Fe(CN)6/K3Fe(CN)6 mediators in the PVDF-LiTFS polymer electrolyte membrane was used to achieve high conductivity at −20 °C and 20 °C. When the concentration of the mediators was below 4 vol%, the ionic conductivity of the membrane was in the level of 10−3 S/cm at −20 °C and 10−2 S/cm at 20 °C and the electronic conductivity was less than 2 × 10−6 S/cm at −20 °C and at 20 °C, suggesting that the polymer electrolyte can be used as a separator in a solid-state supercapacitor. The performance of the solid-state supercapacitor with mediator-containing membrane separator was better than that with mediator-free membrane separator at −20 °C.
