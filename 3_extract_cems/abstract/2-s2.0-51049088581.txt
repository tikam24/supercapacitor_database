In order to configure super capacitor based energy storages in hybrid electric vehicles, the required peak power and the total amount of energy are estimated by using our strategies of energy source control and management during typical test cycles. The configuration of the super capacitor based energy storage for a dedicated vehicle has been verified with respect to the voltge variation, maximum current and power losses. The strategies of energy source control and management presented in this paper can be ensure efficiently and safely using the super capacitor based energy storage.
