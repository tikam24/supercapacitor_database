The 1T/2H hybridized and 2H pure phases of MoS2 nanoflowers were synthesized in a one-step hydrothermal process with the molybdenum source as sodium molybdate dihydrate and the sulfur source as thiourea. The as-prepared 1T/2H hybridized and 2H pure phases of MoS2 were investigated using a thermogravimetry\differential thermal analysis, powder x-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The obtained 1T/2H hybridized phases of MoS2 were confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical characteristics of MoS2 electrodes were examined using cycle voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrodes are based on the 1T/2H hybridized phases MoS2 with specific capacitance (Cp) of 555.4 F g-1 at current densities (Cd) of 0.5 A g-1, capacity retention ratio of 85% after 10 000 cycles were observed that could be a strong potential electrode material for supercapacitors application.
