Because the electricity storage of renewable energy is irregular, the battery in this system will be impacted by current. This will also have a negative impact on the battery life, increase the project cost and lead to pollute the environment. This study proposes a method to improve battery life: the hybrid energy storage system of super-capacitor and lead-acid battery is the key to solve these problems.
