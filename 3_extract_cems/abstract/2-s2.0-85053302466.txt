Wearable fiber-shaped supercapacitor (SC) is a kind of one-dimensional flexible devices that can be directly knitted or sewn into various kinds of textile soft-substrate for wearable energy storage. Herein, acid-pretreated stainless steel yarn (SSY) has been developed to support electrodeposition of active materials of nickel/cobalt composite and polypyrrole (PPy) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The asymmetric all-solid-state supercapacitors (AASs) showed both high electrochemical properties and excellent mechanical flexibility under various degrees of deformation. The highest volumetric capacitance reached 14.69 F cm−3 at the current density of 25 mA cm−3, and the maximum energy density was 3.83 mWh·cm−3 (0.032 mWh·cm−2) at a power density of 18.75 mW cm−3 (0.284 mW cm−2). The AASs were highly flexible and durable for directly being sewn into textile fabrics, and exhibited a good electrochemical stability under 6000 charging/discharging cycles. This work uses the common materials and facile methods to fabricate the flexible and wearable AASs with enhanced electrochemical properties, showing a decent way in developing flexible SC devices.
