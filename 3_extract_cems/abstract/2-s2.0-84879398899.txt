Supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulators (SCALDO) were proposed as an alternative design approach to DC-DC converters, where the supercapacitor circulation frequency (switching frequency) is in the order of few Hz to few 10s of Hz, with an output stage based on a low dropout regulator stage. For converters such as 12-5V, 5-3.3V and 5-1.5V, the technique provides efficiency improvement factors of 2, 1.33 and 3 respectively, in compared to linear converters with same input-output combinations. In a 5-1.5V SCALDO regulator, using thin profile supercapacitors in the range of fractional farads to few farads, this translates to an approximate end to end efficiency of near 90%. However, there were concerns that this patented technique is merely a variation of well-known switched capacitor (charge pump) converters. This paper is aimed at providing a broad overview of the capability of SCALDO technique with generalized theory, indicating its capabilities and limitations, and comparing the practical performance with a typical switched capacitor converter of similar current capability.
