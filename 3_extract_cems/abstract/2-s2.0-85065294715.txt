The synthesis of interconnected nanoporous carbon (NPC) material from direct annealing of ultra-small Al-based metal-organic complex (Al-MOC) has been demonstrated. NPC presents a large accessible area of 1,054 m 2 /g, through the Methylene Blue (MB) adsorption method, which is comparable to the high specific surface area (SSA) of 1,593 m 2 /g, through an N2 adsorption/desorption analysis. The adsorption properties and mechanisms were tested by various dye concentrations, pH, and temperature conditions. The high MB accessible area and the good electrical conductivity of the interconnected NPC, led to a large specific capacitance of 205 F/g, with a potential window from 0 to 1.2 V, in a symmetric supercapacitor, and a large energy density of 10.25 Wh/kg, in an aqueous electrolyte, suggesting a large potential in supercapacitors.
