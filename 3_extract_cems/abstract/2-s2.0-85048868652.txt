This paper presents the modeling and control of an EV driven by interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) and fed by a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of batteries and super-capacitors (SC). By using the inversion-based rules of Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR), a systematic control structure and energy flow can be deduced. The filtering-based strategy is utilized as solution for dealing with current distribution between battery and SC. The role of SC can be shown in comparison with the traditional battery scheme. To control the interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM), the maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) control algorithm in field oriented control (FOC) configuration is employed. The simulation of the control scheme is performed with the ECE driving cycle to clarify the effectiveness of the EMR tool as well as of the drive control and energy management strategies.
