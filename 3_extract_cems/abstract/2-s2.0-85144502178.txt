As the pollution is increasing due to fossil fuel usage, electric automobile is gaining popularity. Among electric vehicles, solar-powered electric vehicle is getting more focus. In this paper; a multi-input single-output superboost DC-DC converter for solar-powered electric vehicle is proposed. Here, solar, battery, and the supercapacitor are the three inputs. The energy developed due to regenerative breaking is stored in supercapacitor and later used for high-speed operation along with photovoltaics (PV) and battery. The presence of supercapacitor increases the system reliability and efficiency. The operation principle, analysis, and detailed waveform of different modes are presented in this study. The performance of the MISB converter is verified through simulations.
