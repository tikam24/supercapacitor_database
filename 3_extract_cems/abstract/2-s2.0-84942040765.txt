Abstract: A facile one-pot solvothermal method has been developed to synthesize CoNiO2 single-crystalline nanoparticles. Crystal phase, morphology, crystal lattice, and composition of the obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, respectively. Results revealed that the as-synthesized CoNiO2 nanoparticles belong to cubic structure with narrow size-distribution (8–10 nm). Subsequently, new asymmetric supercapacitors were successfully assembled with CoNiO2 nanoparticles as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode. The electrochemical results show that asymmetric supercapacitors based on CoNiO2 nanoparticles possess excellent supercapacitor properties, i.e., a stable electrochemical window of 0–1.7 V, higher energy density of 24.0 Wh/kg at a power density of 415.4 W/kg, and excellent cycling stability (96.8 % capacitance retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles). Meanwhile, both a light-emitting diode and a mini fan can be powered by two series connection asymmetric supercapacitors. These results imply that the present asymmetric supercapacitors based on CoNiO2 nanoparticles possess the promising potential application in the field of high-performance energy storage.
