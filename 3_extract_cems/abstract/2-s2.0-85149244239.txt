In this study, MXene-derived/NiCoFe-LDH heterostructures with three-dimensional interconnected porous network microstructures were prepared, leveraging the excellent electrical conductivity and growth platform provided by the MXene material. The remarkable specific capacitance of metal oxides was fully exploited. The composite exhibited high specific capacitance and excellent stability, with a specific capacitance of 1305 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance of 85.7% of the initial performance after 6000 charge/discharge tests at 10 A g−1. A two-electrode assembly was constructed using activated carbon as the negative electrode material corresponding to 49.5 Wh kg−1 at 800 W kg−1, indicating that the electrodes could achieve rapid charge/discharge. The findings of this study indicate that the composite material comprising LDH/MXene has significant potential for supercapacitor applications.
