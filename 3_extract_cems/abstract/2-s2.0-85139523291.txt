In this paper, a high-performance Zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor was fabricated usingcoal pitch derived porous carbon (CPC) as cathode material. The hierarchical porous structureof the CPC cathode material is conducive to the rapid diffusion of electrolyte, and the abundantnitrogen and oxygen doping can provide reaction sites for the chemical adsorption/desorptionreaction of Li+ and Zn2+ for additional pseudocapacitive capacity. More importantly, theposition/dissolution reversibility and stability of zinc anode can be improved using the optimized electrolyteadding lithium sulfate, and the ion diffusion rate can also be accelerated during the actionprocess, thus improving the rate performance and cycle tability of the device.
