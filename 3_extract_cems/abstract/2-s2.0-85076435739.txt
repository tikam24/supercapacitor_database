Manganese-nickel oxide films were electrodeposited on a stainless steel plate substrate in a bath containing manganese sulfate, nickel chloride and a non-ionic surfactant. The structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of these films were investigated. The X-ray diffraction pattern revealed the grain size of the material and confirmed the presence of manganese oxide and nickel oxide in the films. The preparative parameters, such as potential window, scan rate, bath concentration and numbers of potential cycles, were optimized during potentiodynamic deposition. The cyclic voltammetry was used to study the reduction and oxidation mechanism during the electrodeposition process. The charge-discharge method was applied to study the capacitor property of the synthesized material.
