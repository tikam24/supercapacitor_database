Nickel-Copper metallic layers were deposited onto a steel substrate by using the electrochemical method. The morphology and the chemical composition of the deposited layers were studied by scanning electron microscopy. The electrical capacitance was measured on a functional supercapacitor made of two Ni-Cu deposited layers and a Nafion 117Â® membrane hydrated with distilled water, which served as a dielectric separator.
