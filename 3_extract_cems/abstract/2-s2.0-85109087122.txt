Developing multi-element composites is a promising way for high performance supercapacitor material development, and simplifying the synthesis steps is critical for reducing the preparation costs and successful promotion of the materials. A novel one-step selective reaction strategy is developed, and successfully used to prepare four-element ZnO-CoSe2 (ZOCS) nano-spherical composites, to be used as supercapacitor materials. Started form nano-spherical glycerate templates, under the optimal synthesis condition, the obtained ZOCS-0.125 electrode material exhibits a specific capacitance of 450.7 F/g at 1 A/g and a good rate performance by keeping 76.8% capacitance at 20 A/g. Moreover, the ZOCS-0.125 electrode exhibits excellent cycle stability of 114.9% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by ZOCS-0.125 and activated carbon electrodes delivers an energy density of 22.35 Wh/kg at 825 W/kg, and a cycle stability of 105.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. This work not only shows the good potential of the facilely prepared ZnO-CoSe2 composite electrode material, but also demonstrates a new strategy for low cost and high performance multielement composite material development, that can be used in a wide range of applications.
