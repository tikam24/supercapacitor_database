Manganese dioxide powder were prepared by anodic deposition and heat treatment at 200-450°C. The phases of the powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction(XRD) and the electrochemical properties of the powder electrodes were clarified by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results show that the original γ-MnO 2 is converted to β-MnO 2 progressively at higher temperatures. With the increasing of temperatures the specific capacitance is raised to a maximum value and then decreases. The highest specific capacitance (156 F·s -1) is obtained when treated at 300°C with a CV scan rate of 10 mV·s -1 in 0.5 mol/L Na 2SO 4 solution, and it exhibits a high electrochemical stability (no deterioration) after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.
