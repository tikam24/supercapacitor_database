The inspiring progress in the fabrication of nanostructured materials has driven the rapid growth of research in the field of supercapacitors. This material plays an important role as it offers a combination of nanoscale dimensions with a highly defined geometry and a very high surface area. Conventionally, a supercapacitor is composed of carbonaceous material such as activated carbon and metal oxides like ruthenium oxide to store and provide energy. However, low power density and poor cycle life owned by carbonaceous materials, while low electrical conductivity and high-cost production of the ruthenium oxide electrodes restrict their performance and application as supercapacitor. Therefore, nanostructured metal oxides with a promising capacitive performance have been extensively studied to compete with the one obtained by carbonaceous materials and ruthenium oxide. Over the past decades, titanium dioxide (TiO2) has gained much attention due to its exceptional properties, its tunable morphology and structural as well as excellent electrochemical properties, resulting in a strikingly high potential for supercapacitor application. In this chapter, the synthesis of TiO2 nanostructured for supercapacitors focusing on recent development and fabrication process in various types of nanostructured and their effect against charge storage capacities will be briefly described. The capacitive and the prospective of TiO2 nanostructured will therefore be discussed with respect to the incorporation of other materials to form nanohybrid and nanocomposite of TiO2, the supercapacitor evaluation method and electrolyte factors which play a critical role in defining supercapacitors as a device of interest.
