This paper presents an experimental evaluation of performance of a complete electric vehicle (EV) system. Experimental implementation of powertrain is presented and then the performance of each plant is tested and assessed. This drivetrain includes two permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), two power converters with their gate drivers, the control board of TMS320F28335 DSP, and energy storage system (ESS). The ESS includes battery cells, battery manage system (BMS) and Ultracapacitor unit. This work considers the possible performance of the EV based on theoretical calculations using its specifications. The dynamic performance of the power plants of powertrain is evaluated at both out-vehicle and in-vehicle operation. The performance is demonstrated using a commercial dynamometer. The experimental tests proved the applicability of the EV in different road circumstances.
