Two-dimensional (2D) materials have great potential for various applications due to their unique electrochemical properties. In this study, we successfully synthesized molybdenum disulfide-reduced graphene oxide (MoS2-rGO) composites using the microwave-assisted method at 140 °C for 30 min with different concentrations of ammonium tetrathiomolybdate, ((NH4)2MoS4). Morphology analysis of the composites revealed the distribution of Mo on the rGO sheets. The MoS2-rGO electrode synthesized with 0.01 M (NH4)2MoS4 exhibited a tremendous specific capacitance of 561.3 F g−1 at current density 0.8 A g−1 along with a capacitance retention of 92% after 10,000 cycles. Used in an asymmetric supercapacitor device, it demonstrated energy and power densities of 39.90 Wh kg−1 and 800 W kg−1, respectively. These results suggest MoS2-rGO as an outstanding potential candidate for supercapacitor electrodes in energy storage applications.
