Aqueous ammonium-ion energy storage systems have recently gained continuous attention owing to the advantages of sustainability and environmental-friendliness in the grid-scale application. However, ammonium-ion supercapacitors are still in their infancy, and it is of great challenge in developing suitable materials for application in wearable energy storage devices. Herein, we develop a vanadium oxide hydration (V2O5·nH2O)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite film (denoted as VGF) as a free-standing paper-like electrode for ammonium-ion storage, where V2O5·nH2O shows an expanded interlayer spacing and is sandwiched by rGO through chemical bonds. As a result, the designed VGF exhibits a capacitance of 600F·g−1 at 0.2 A·g−1 and good cyclability of over 10,000 cycles with a retention of 93 % using PVA/NH4Cl gel electrolyte. Meanwhile, the ammonium-ion storage mechanism in VGF electrode is further verified to be dominated by the intercalation pseudocapacitance and electric double-layer capacitance. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) has been also assembled to assess the feasibility of practical applications in wearable devices. As expected, the SSC possesses an areal capacitance of 241 mF·cm−2 at 0.1 mA·cm−2 (0.82 Wh·m−2 at 0.09 W·m−2) and an excellent cyclability of 20,000 cycles with a retention of 92 %, which is comparable to that achieved in the vanadium oxides powder-made electrodes and the SSC made of. Together with the excellent flexibility and feasibility of parallel/series combination, the VGF SSC devices shows great possibility for the applications in wearable devices, which further proves the great potential of this designed VGF free-standing electrode for ammonium-ion storage.
