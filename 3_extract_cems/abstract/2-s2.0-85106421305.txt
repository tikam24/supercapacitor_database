Transition metal selenide has been considered as an effective electroactive products. A Cu2Se–CoSe product structural and morphological feature was described. The role of temperature induced the sharp crystalline nature which enhanced the electrochemical performance of the prepared active electrode. The prepared product functional, vibrations, stretching and defects were identified. Compactly packed nanograin showed a highly porous nature and resulted enhancement in pseudocapacitive behavior achieved via reversible redox property and intrinsic conductivity. Hence, the active electrode exhibited the improved 1012 Fg−1 capacitance at 1 Ag−1 and long cycle life stability (97.1% capacity retention, 5000 cycles). The fabricated asymmetric device exhibited a prominent reversible discharge performance of 89.4% after consecutive 5000 cycles. Additionally, the practical application demonstration was also verified by energizing LED. Satisfactorily, the progress of the active material led to excellent stability and enhanced energy storage mechanism.
