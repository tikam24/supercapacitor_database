We report on the perovskite structured piezoelectric PMN-PLZT: 0.5Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3- 0.5(Pb0.9875La0.0125)(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 integrated 2D ultra thin Graphene Oxide nanocomposites developed through mixed oxide (for PMN-PLZT), hummers' method (for GO) and PVDF based flexible nanocomposite films through solution casting (PMNPLZT- GO-PVDF) method, and phase evolution, nanostructure, room temperature dielectric nature and piezoelectric charge coefficient were investigated. XRD studies showed a pseudo-cubic perovskite phase in PMN-PLZT-GO and TEM studies revealed the formation of 2D ultra-thin nanoflakes of GO and piezoelectric particles distribution over GO nanoflakes and their inter-laminar structures. Room temperature dielectric constant (?RT= 2643 for PMN-PLZT and 3198 for PMN-PLZT-GO-PVDF) and charge loss (Tan?RT=0.059 for PMN-PLZT and 0.074 for PMN-PLZT-GO) at 1kHz and piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33=349 pC/N for PMN-PLZT and 297 for PMN-PLZT-GOPVDF) were observed in unpoled and poled films, respectively. Piezoelectric PMN-PLZT integrated GO dispersed ÃŸ-phase PVDF film had showed promising dielectric and piezoelectric properties, which could be suitable for supercapacitor, actuator and energy harvesting applications in portable electronic devices.
