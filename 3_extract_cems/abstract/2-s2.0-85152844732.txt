Bacterial Cellulose is a sustainable, biocompatible and degradable strong material. It however has no electronic functionality and hence cannot be used in electronic devices. This limitation however can be overcome by incorporating functional second phase particles. The various possibilities of converting Cellulose into a highly functional nanocomposite are discussed in this article. The functionalities range from electrical conductivity to magnetism to piezoelectricity generation. These varied applications clearly demonstrate the potential of Bacterial Cellulose for developing the next generation of environment friendly electronic devices.
