In this work, Oxygen and nitrogen-enriched hierarchical MoS2 nanospheres decorated cornstalk-derived activated carbon (MoS2/CSAC) were prepared by simple carbonization and hydrothermal methods, being used in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) and supercapacitors. The structure and electrochemical performance of MoS2/CSAC composites were analyzed in detail. Oxygen and nitrogen-enriched MoS2 is spherical with uniform size, and accumulation of nanosheets was observed on the surface. The unique hierarchical structure could contribute to form more catalytic active sites. MoS2/CSAC composites contain abundant mesopores and a wide range of pore sizes, which are beneficial for fast electrochemical reactions. Moreover, it was detected that the coexistence of Mo4+ and Mo6+ in the MoS2/CSAC composites, exhibiting high catalytic activity for accelerating the formation of •OH from H2O2. The degradation efficiency of phenol (100 mg L−1) is up to 97.26% in 120 min. Simultaneously, it showed excellent performance in supercapacitors. The specific capacitance was as high as 332.62 F g−1 in a three-electrode system. These results demonstrate that the MoS2/CSAC composites are promising dual-functional materials for electrocatalytic degradation and supercapacitors.
