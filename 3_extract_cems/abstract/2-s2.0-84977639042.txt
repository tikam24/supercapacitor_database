Nanostructured nickel-cobalt binary hydroxide ([Formula presented]) is widely investigated as supercapacitor electrode material. However, the aggregation and poor electrical conductivity of [Formula presented] limit its practical application as a supercapacitor. In this work, a flexible free-standing hierarchical porous composite composed of [Formula presented] nanosheets and titanium carbide-carbon nanofiber ([Formula presented]) is fabricated through electrospinning and microwave assisted method. The as-prepared composites exhibit desirable electrochemical performances, including high specific capacitance, cycling stability, and rate capability. In particular, the [Formula presented] composite electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 2224 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cyclic stability of 91% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at 5.0 A g−1. To expand its practical application, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated using the [Formula presented] composite as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode. The ASC exhibits a prominent energy density of 55.93 Wh kg−1 and a high power density of 18,300 W kg−1 at 5.0 A g−1. The superior electrochemical property is attributed to the uniform dispersion of [Formula presented] nanosheets on the TiC/CNF felt matrix. The TiC/CNF felt with uniformed TiC nanoparticles makes the fiber surface more suitable for growing [Formula presented] nanosheets and simultaneously enhances the conductivity of electrode.
