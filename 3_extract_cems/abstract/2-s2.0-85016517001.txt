Mesoporous architecture of vanadium oxide thin films were successfully synthesized on flexible stainless steel substrates [SS (1.5 × 5 cm, no- 304)] at 2.30 V deposition potential by potentiostatic electrodeposition technique using 0.007 M, 20 ml aqueous solution of vanadyl sulphate. Electrochemical properties of electrodeposited V2O5 electrodes were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometric charge discharge and electrochemical impedance in 1 M aqueous KCl electrolyte. The annealed vanadium oxide electrode (400 °C for 3 h) shows highest value of specific capacitance 608.94 F/g at 5 mV/sec in 1 M KCl. Charge discharge behavior exhibits high reversibility with specific energy 63.73 Wh/kg, specific power146.66 kW/kg and columbic efficiency (η) 94.97%. Impedance spectroscopy reveals capacitive behavior and gives combined internal resistance ~1.53 ohm.
