The necessity for energy conversion and storage has led us to find more efficient electrode materials applicable for advanced energy systems such as fuel cell, battery, supercapacitor, solar cell, thermoelectric, and sorption-based waste heat management systems. Together with innovation in materials fabrication techniques, proper characterization of those materials and the system level critical analysis are very essential for commercial success. In this chapter we present advanced techniques for characterization of electrode materials for efficient energy conversion and storage application including their theoretical and analytical aspects.
