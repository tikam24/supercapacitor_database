Micron-scale Co3O4 electrode materials were prepared by microwave heating a precursor of cobalt oxalate obtained by coprecipitaion using cobalt nitrate and ammonium oxalate as raw materials. The structure and surface morphology of the as-prepared Co3O4 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The supercapacitive behaviour of the as-prepared Co3O4 in alkaline electrolyte was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling (CD). The results indicate that pure Co3O4 of cubic system can be obtained by microwave heat-treatment, the as-prepared Co3O4 show good presupercapacitive behaviors with a specific capacitance of 91 F/g at 2 mV/s in 6 mol/L KOH. The capacitance of the as-prepared Co3O4 in alkaline electrolyte arised from the intercalation and deintercalation processes of OH- in Co3O4, CoOOH and Co(OH)2. The capacitance decay of the as-prepared Co3O4 during the long circles was caused by the poor reversibility and the secondary reaction of the faraday processes on the electrode.
