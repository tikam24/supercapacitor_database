This study demonstrates a scalable solution-based approach for the fabrication of α-Fe2O3/polyaniline (PANi) hybrid nanostructured hydrogels as high-performance binder-free anodes for supercapacitors. PANi coating is in situ polymerized on the α-Fe2O3 surfaces and hierarchically porous PANi framework form simultaneously, thus forming the hierarchical structure of α-Fe2O3 particles well connected by the conductive framework. This unique architecture delivers multiple advantageous features: (i) greatly enhancing electronic and ionic conductivities, (ii) providing porous space to accommodate the volume change of α-Fe2O3 during charge-discharge processes, and (iii) enabling the ion readily access to α-Fe2O3. The electrode made of α-Fe2O3/PANi exhibits high specific capacitance of 473.6 F g−1 (236.8 mF cm−2) at a current density of 1 A g−1, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.2% after 5000 cycles). The solid-state hybrid supercapacitors consisting of α-Fe2O3/PANi and PANi electrodes achieves a high energy density of 0.31 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 67.1 mW cm−3. This versatile and manufacturing-compatible synthesis motif for α-Fe2O3/PANi anodes can be generalized for other supercapacitor electrode materials system to enable the facile fabrication of various kinds of electrodes for supercapacitors.
