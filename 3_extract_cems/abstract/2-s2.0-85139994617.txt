Recent research on electrochemical energy storage devices has shown that their specific capacities, cyclic-lives, as well as rate performances, are chiefly controlled by their electrodes. Therefore, a key challenge for 21st-century material researchers is to seek out novel electrode materials with improved crystal structures, excellent specific capacities and better electronic conductivities, in order to fabricate a highly efficient energy storage system. To address this concern (In2O3)1-xCuOx (where x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) heterostructure nanocomposites have been prepared through the surfactant-assisted co-precipitation strategy. The nature of the atomic and molecular interactions, chemical compositions, textures and shapes of the synthesized nanocomposites have been investigated in detail. In this study, the novel composite materials have been supported over carbon cloth (CC) to produce flexible working electrodes. It has been found that the electrode with a particular composition of (In2O3)0.5(CuO)0.5-over-CC has demonstrated superior capacitance (883 F/g at 1 A/g), improved electrochemical and cycle stability (83.5 % after 6000 GCD tests) and a higher rate capability (708 F/g at 5 A/g) than all other fabricated nanocomposite-based flexible electrodes. The electrode's improved electrochemical activity is attributed to its flexible design, higher electronic conduction, non-resistive current collector behaviour and unique nanoarchitecture. These versatile and simple-to-prepare nanocomposites are potential candidates as electrodes for high-performance pseudocapacitors nanodevices.
