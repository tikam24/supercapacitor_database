Development of micro/nanoarchitectures with unique morphology and size remains a great challenge in the pursuit of electrochemically active electrode materials for supercapacitors. Ordered mesoporous, flaky structures have been achieved by combined species (Co 3 O 4 /CMC) to meet the energy necessities in supercapacitors. Present study suggests an energy budget approach to address the preparation of cobalt oxide (electrical conductivity) with remarkable enhanced electrochemical performance by utilizing carbon (carboxymethyl cellulose-CMC) as physical support. This structure also offers short diffusion path for ions and accelerate effective charge transport which results in high specific capacitance (298 C g −1 at 1 A g −1 ), outstanding stability (90% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) and low charge transfer resistance (0.5 Ω) in three electrode system. In addition, we have designed an asymmetric supercapacitor (operating voltage 0–1.2 V) which shows desirable electrochemical behavior with an energy density of 18 W h kg −1 (at 2 A g −1 ). These outcomes endorse the potential capabilities of integrated Co 3 O 4 & CMC which could be a promising electrode in future generation supercapacitors.
