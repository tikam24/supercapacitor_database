To improve the efficiency of hybrid energy storage systems composed of fuel cells and supercapacitors used in high-power applications such as electrified transportation systems and renewable energy systems, the interfacing power converters need to be carefully designed. This paper proposes an active clamping current-fed three port converter for an application scenario in which modular converters are required to aggregate distributed energy storage resources. The converter topology is conceived to implement four operation modes: single input dual output, dual input single output, and two scenarios of single input single output. These operation modes are combinations of three types of power flows: fuel cell to load, fuel cell to supercapacitor, and supercapacitor to load. Simulation results verify the functionality of the proposed converter.
