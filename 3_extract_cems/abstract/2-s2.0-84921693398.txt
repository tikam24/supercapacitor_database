Electrochemical catalytic oxidation, a simple, green, novel and cost-effective approach to obtain graphene oxide, is introduced for the preparation of graphene oxide nanosheet-modified electrode. After reduced by the electrochemistry method, we can clearly see the graphene structure according to the FE-SEM. Nickel hydroxide, a low cost, high theoretical capacitance, ready availability and green supercapacitive material, is deposited into the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets without adding any other binder or metallic current collector. The composite materials exhibit a specific capacitance of 1700 F/g at a charge and discharge current density of 5 A/g and 967 F/g at 20 A/g with excellent cycling ability. Meanwhile, the electrode exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 950 F/g at a charge and discharge current density of 5 A/g after 500 cycle tests. These results suggest a novel pathway to synthesize the graphene oxide for high-performance energy applications after being reduced.
