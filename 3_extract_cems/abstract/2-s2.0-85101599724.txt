The rich oxygen-vacancies (OVs) on transition metal oxides are favorable for charge storage in supercapacitors, but are subjected to deactivation during charge-discharge cycles. Herein, we report that Co3O4@polydopamine-reduced graphene oxide (Co3O4@PDA-RGO) nanocomposite could relieve the deactivation problem via the self-reviving of OVs. Besides the high specific surface area and ion/electron conductivities, Co3O4@PDA-RGO provides a robust framework to disperse Co3O4 nanorods, and the oxygen atoms in the vicinity of OVs account for 46.2% of oxygen-species. Especially, the resultant OVs can survive the rigorous charge-discharge cycles by virtue of the reversible redox with the aid of PDA-RGO. Given the advantageous structural characteristics, a high specific capacitance of 1562 ​F ​g−1 (781C ​g−1) can be delivered at current densities of 0.5 ​A ​g−1 and retain to 771 ​F ​g−1 (385.5C ​g−1) at 20 ​A ​g−1 ​by the Co3O4@PDA-RGO electrode. Moreover, 91% of its initial capacitance can be maintained after 10,000 consecutive charge-discharge cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor, assembled by the Co3O4@PDA-RGO electrode and an activated carbon electrode, delivers a high energy density of 46.1 ​Wh kg−1 at 800 ​W ​kg−1. This study paves an efficient avenue to synthesize self-reviving OV on metal oxides for the potential applications in supercapacitors.
