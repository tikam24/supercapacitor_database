Present paper reports reduced Graphene nano ribbons (GNR) synthesized via longitudinal splitting of carbon nano tubes (CNTs) using simple oxidation reduction approach. GNRs, thus obtained, has less defects and distortion than the earlier reported method of GNRs synthesis. GNRs properties are confirmed by various spectroscopic analysis . The crystallographic features of the GNRs have been explored via XRD analysis. In order to identify the morphological features of the GNRs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is performed. To have a better understanding of GNRs at atomic level, optical analysis is done via UV-vis absorption technique. UV-vis absorption results are further verified by FTIR spectroscopic analysis. The cyclic voltammetric (CV) analysis is also carried out to further explore the suitability of GNRs as potential supercapacitor (SC) electrode material. A brief discussion on the possible use of material in various fields and possible future scope is also presented.
