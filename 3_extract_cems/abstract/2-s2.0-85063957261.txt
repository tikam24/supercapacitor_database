A novel nanocomposite electrode material consisting of Fe2O3 and reduced graphene oxide (RGO/Fe2O3) has been synthesized using a cost-effective chemical approach for its application in the field of energy storage devices. The morphological and structural characterizations of the as-synthesized RGO/Fe2O3 nanocomposite materials were done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction respectively. The electrochemical properties of the RGO/Fe2O3 nanocomposite were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The RGO5/Fe2O3 nanocomposite exhibited higher specific capacitance (50 Fg-1) at a scan rate of 0.1 V/s in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution than the pristine RGO. Moreover, the impedance spectroscopy showed that the value of charge transfer resistance (RCT) was 91.1 and 21.64 Î© for RGO1/Fe2O3 and RGO5/Fe2O3 respectively, indicating a decrease in the charge transfer resistance and increased charge conductivity for RGO5/Fe2O3. This low-cost protocol provides an alternative pathway for the large-scale production of various composite materials with controllable dimensions for energy storage and conversions.
