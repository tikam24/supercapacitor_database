Monoclinic nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) micro-crystals were synthesized via a conventional solid-state synthesis route with a prospective to investigate its conductivity response with high-temperature evolution and phenomenal electrochemical performance for supercapacitor application. The tenacious phase formation, Raman active phonon vibration and metal oxide (Ni–O, Mo–O) stretching vibration in octahedral and tetrahedral sites of as-synthesized NiMoO4 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction techniques, Raman and FTIR spectra. The UV-DRS absorbance spectra of NiMoO4 exhibits several effective absorption peaks in the UV–Visible wavelength range (200–800 nm). The optical band gap of NiMoO4 was estimated at 2.50 eV experimentally with the famous Kubelka–Munk equation and theoretically correlated with the result obtained from the density of states (DOS) calculation. The saturation magnetization of NiMoO4 diminished from 0.0026 to 0.0013 emu g−1. significantly due to the embodiment of MWCNT but the coercivity maintain a minute change. Lessening of real (Z′) and imaginary impedance (Z″) with temperature was observed with high-temperature evolution (633–773 K) and the Nyquist plots were well fitted with equivalent circuit model (QR)(QR)(CR) network. The temperature-dependent frequency exponent (n) suggested the band-correlated barrier-hopping process in high temperature for the conduction mechanism of NiMoO4. The maximum specific capacitance (Csp) was estimated 518 F g−1 for NiMoO4 at current density 5 Ag−1 and its value intensified up to 1050 A g−1 at current density 5 Ag−1 in MWCNT-integrated NiMoO4. Imperatively, the upmost energy density 66.12 Wh Kg−1 was detected at power density 1075 W Kg−1 for MWCNT-blended NiMoO4 which is significantly larger than pristine NiMoO4 (energy density 42.28 Wh Kg−1 at power density 612 W Kg−1) at a current density 5 Ag−1, which reveals their great potential application as a supercapacitor and energy storage technology.
