Significant enhancement in supercapacitor performances was achieved by the first fabrication of amorphous RuO2 hybrid by utilising carbon spheres as templates. The as-prepared carbon spheres (Cs)/RuO2 and reduced carbon spheres (rCs)/RuO2 composites exhibit high specific capacitances of 387 F g-1 (44.2 wt% RuO2 loading) and 614 F g-1 (72.6 wt% RuO2 loading) at a current density of 1 A g-1 at 2 mg cm-2 loading mass, showing remarkable rate capability with capacitances of 336 F g-1 and 491 F g-1 at a current density of 20 A g-1 and excellent cycling stability with capacity retention of 97.7% and 90.8% for 5000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performances could be attributed to the unique structure of the resulted composites as well as the high utilization of well-dispersed RuO 2 nanoparticles on the carbon surface. These results demonstrate the great potential of carbon sphere-based composites in the development of high-performance electrode materials for supercapacitors. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.
