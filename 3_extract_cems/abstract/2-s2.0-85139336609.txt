In the current work, we provide the electrochemical (EC) characteristics and considerable size of Ca-doped ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles. Mixed transition metal oxides are widely used as excellent electrode materials in superior supercapacitors because of their superior capacitance, low cost, and environmental friendliness. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and EC methods. The results exhibited that the as-synthesized nanoparticles had a cubic spinel crystal structure and efficient EC properties. The EC properties of the prepared electrodes were explored by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The Ca0.1Zn0.9Fe2O4 electrode demonstrated a specific capacitance (SC) âˆ¼208 Fg-1 at a 2 mV/s scan rate due to significant morphological behavior. Therefore may be the prepared materials are the finest electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
