MXenes have fascinated researchers in scientific and technological fields for various applications such as energy storage devices, including supercapacitors (SC) and flexible batteries. The application of pure MXenes and their composites in various classes of SCs is significantly increasing owing to their unique mechanical, physicochemical, optical, electrical, and electrochemical properties. This review introduces various classes of MXenes and their composites with carbon, metals and conducting polymers. Challenges associated with the application of MXenes for SCs, including flexibility, diffusion resistance and oxidation, are also explained.
