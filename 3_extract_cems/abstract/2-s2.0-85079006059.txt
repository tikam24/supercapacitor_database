Morphology of transition metal oxide largely affects its electrochemical energy storage properties. This also applies to its composites. In this paper, NiFe2O4/Graphene nanosheets composites (NFO/GNSs) are successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. NiFe2O4 (NFO) in the sample exhibits a unique nanosheet morphology, vertically arranging on the graphene nanosheets (GNSs). Microscopically, NFO nanosheets interpenetrate on the surface of graphene to form a continuous network structure. The sample exhibits excellent specific capacitance and rate performance. It is worth mentioning that the specific capacitance increases to 140% after 5000 cycles, showing superior cycle stability. This may be due to the conductive network formed by NFO nanosheets and GNSs. Excellent electrochemical performance indicates excellent application prospects of materials in supercapacitor electrodes.
