Due to their high capacity, nickel-cobalt-based cathode materials have attracted significant attention as potential components of hybrid solid-state supercapacitors (HSSCs). However, their poor cycling stability and low rate capability have impeded their implementation. In the present study, a single-step, binder-free potentiodynamic polarization approach is presented for the preparation of battery-Type phosphorus-containing amorphous trimetal nickel-ruthenium-cobalt hydroxide (P@NRC-OH) nanofibers on Ni foam for use in high-energy, stable HSSCs. The phosphate dopant and the trimetal-rich electrode surface increase the intrinsic electron conductivity and redox activity and generate a large number of active defects. As a consequence, a P@NRC-OH electrode exhibited enhanced energy storage properties in terms of specific capacity (541.66 mA h g-1 at 3 mA cm-2), cycling durability (90.35% over 20 000 cycles), and rate capability (308.64 mA h g-1 at 20 mA cm-2). An assembled full-cell HSSC with P@NRC-OH nanofibers as the cathode material and porous activated carbon as the anode material produced a maximum specific energy of 90.02 W h kg-1 at a specific power of 1363 W kg-1 which remained as high as 37.87 W h kg-1 at a power density of 6818.18 W kg-1, with remarkable cycling stability over 15 000 charge-discharge cycles. The proposed approach thus represents a scalable and efficient strategy for the design of electrodes and devices with superior electrochemical performance.
