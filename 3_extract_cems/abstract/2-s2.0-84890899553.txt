Here we reported a novel route to synthesize a hierarchical nanocomposite (PANI-frGO) of polyaniline (PANI) nanowire arrays covalently bonded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). In this strategy, nitrophenyl groups were initially grafted on rGO via C-C bond, and then reduced to aminophenyl to act as anchor sites for the growth of PANI arrays on rGO. The functionalized process was confirmed by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The electrochemical properties of the PANI-frGO as supercapacitor materials were investigated. The PANI-frGO nanocomposites showed high capacitance of 590F g-1 at 0.1A g-1, and had no loss of capacitance after 200 cycles at 2A g-1. The improved electrochemical performance suggests promising application of the PANI-frGO nanocomposites in high-performance supercapacitors.
