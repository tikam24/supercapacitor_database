Nanostructured materials and nanocomposites have inspired many structural and functional applications in recent time. In the last decade, energy-storage devices have employed electrode materials in form of nanomaterials/ nanocomposites to yield promising electrochemical performance. The current paper throws light on the application of nanostructured pristine activated carbons as well as chemically modified carbon-halide nanocomposites in practical electrochemical supercapacitors. Pristine activated carbons have been mechanochemically modified via high-energy milling and iodine doping to produce carbon-halide nanocomposites. A significant change in existing physical and electrochemical properties (~200-500% rise in volumetric capacity) has been marked by introduction of iodine into carbon and the subsequent formation of nanocomposites. The effect of halides and nanoscale morphology is discussed using X-ray, Raman spectroscopy, DSC, BET analysis and electrochemical testing. Â© 2008 Materials Research Society.
