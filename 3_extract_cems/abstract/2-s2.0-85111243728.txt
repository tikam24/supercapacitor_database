A one-step synthesis of sheet-like RuS2 nanoarchitectures exhibiting traits of a potential cathode material for designing high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) is demonstrated. The synthesis includes direct sulfurization of RuO2 in an inert atmosphere at high temperature that results in densely packed nanosheets of RuS2 with a moderate surface area. Such a structure provides abundant sites for faradaic/non-faradaic reactions for energy storage while facilitating ion migration during charge/discharge processes. Furthered from these traits, the RuS2 electrode exhibits substantially enhanced electrochemical performance as compared to the RuO2 electrode. Detailed analyses suggest that the charge storage at higher scan rates is dominated by capacitive processes, while at lower scan rates, the diffusion-controlled process of charge storage in addition to the capacitive processes is responsible for increased capacitance. The as-assembled activated carbon//RuS2 ASC with an optimum cell voltage of 2 V in an aqueous electrolyte exhibits attractive energy-power combination with excellent cycling performance, which outperforms many other recently reported ASCs.
