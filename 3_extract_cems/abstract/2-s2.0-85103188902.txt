This paper presents an initial work to design frequency stabilization strategies through, I, PI, PID, ID, and IDD calculated via the JAYA optimization process for load frequency control (LFC) framework of photovoltaic (PV) and thermal generators linked via AC tie-line. Firstly, a comparative analysis of all LFC designs is conducted for typical load alterations, and the LFC recital is evaluated on basis of pick-up value, inverse absolute error (IAE), inverse time multiplied by absolute error (ITAE) and the interpretation of graphical results. Additionally, the effects of an ultracapacitor combined with a redox flow battery and an ultracapacitor in each zone of the PV-thermal system is also investigated and evaluated to improve the results of the PV-thermal system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed plan is assessed for nonlinearity, continuous load alteration, and broad parametric varieties from the ordinary plant values. The application results are presented to show the novelty and benefits of the proposed work.
