The suppression of irreversible phase change in battery-type materials during electrochemical process, leading to high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs), remains one of the crucial challenges for the new generation of electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, we propose a pre-activation strategy to address the corresponding problem based on an in-depth study of the failure mechanism of nickel-manganese layered double hydroxide (LDH), which is the inhibition of the exfoliation and deactivation of lattice Mn during the cycling process. The modified NiMn-LDH shows enhanced electrochemistry performance compared to pristine NiMn-LDH, with an increase in specific capacity from 855 to 1082 C g−1and a doubling of stability after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled ASC device achieves a high specific energy density of 48.9 W h kg−1at a power density of 810 W kg−1. The anchored, activated lattice Mn provided by hydrogen peroxide in the pre-activation strategy is proved to play a vital role in achieving high-performance ASCs. This work paves a new avenue to solve the long-standing significant challenge of battery-type materials for asymmetric supercapacitors.
