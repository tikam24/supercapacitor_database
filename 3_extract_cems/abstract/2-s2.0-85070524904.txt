The hybrid fuel cell electric vehicle powered by household power during peak use is another opportunity to reduce emissions and save money. For this reason, Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) and Home-to-Vehicle (H2V) systems were proposed as a new method of exchanging smart energy and a new method of exchanging smart energy. The main goal of this paper is to develop a smart home energy management based on IoT, generate more energy efficiency and share production between home and vehicle. In fact, the Hybrid Fuel cell electric vehicle will be used simultaneously to power household appliances during peak demand for electricity to solve energy consumption. The household's energy is derived from an accurate Autonomous hybrid power system. Several technologies such as Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell, solar panel, Supercapacitor (SC) device and water electrolyzer are incorporated into the proposed system. Two-way electrical energy from the PEMFC-Hybrid Electric Vehicle and household power will be exchanged by discharging vehicle energy storage to balance energy demand and supply. To this end, a smart energy management unit (EMU) will be developed and discussed in order to meet the estimated fuel consumption mitigation goals during peak periods when demand is highest, coordinating between household power and vehicle energy storage. The Matlab / Simulink software based on an experimental database extracted from household power to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its effects on V2H / H2V operations will simulate the presented design for one day.
