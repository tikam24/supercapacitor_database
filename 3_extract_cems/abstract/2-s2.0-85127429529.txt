MnO2 nanoflakes anchored on hollow carbon spheres (MnO2/HCSs) were obtained via the first synthesis of HCSs and subsequent hydrothermal deposition of MnO2. The as-prepared MnO2/HCSs nanostructures were investigated as electrode materials of asymmetric supercapacitors. MnO2/HCSs (MnO2/HCSs-30) prepared from 30 mM of KMnO4 exhibited an impressive performance with a specific capacitance of 209 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. The asymmetric supercapacitors device consisting of MnO2/HCSs-30 as a positive electrode and HCSs as a negative electrode displayed a high energy density of 26.8 W h kg−1 at the power density of 170.0 W kg−1 and still maintained 5.0 W h kg−1 at the power density of 4285.7 W kg−1. This result manifests that MnO2/HCSs could be a potential supercapacitor electrode material due to the in-situ immobilization of MnO2 nanoflakes on the functional carbon framework and facile tailoring of the ratio of MnO2 and HCSs in the nanohybrids.
