Rich N/O co-doped hierarchical porous laminated carbon was successfully prepared via one-step carbonization combined with CO2 activation approach, using the wasted carapaces of Qing River shrimp as raw materials. Parts of N and O elements were kept in the form of in-situ doping, and calcium carbonate with uniform distribution in the carapace was used as in-situ template during the process of preparation. The samples were investigated by varied means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), laser Raman spectrometer and specific surface area measuring instrument, respectively. The results indicated that the obtained rich N/O co-doped hierarchical porous laminated carbon contained interconnected super-macropores, macropores, mesopores and micropores. The specific surface area and total pore volume of the obtained hierarchical porous laminated carbon are 1 012.2 m2/g and 0.975 cm3/g, respectively. The content of in-situ doped nitrogen is up to 9.15%, and oxygen content is as high as 26%. Benefiting from these unique features, the rich N/O co-doped hierarchical porous laminated carbon pile-based electrode materials exhibited excellent electrochemical performances. The specific capacitance reaches 385 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and even possesses 187.5 F/g at 10 A/g in 1mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance can still maintain up to 93.6% after 5 000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A/g. The excellent capacitive performances indicate that the wasted carapace of Qing River shrimp can serve as a new resource of rich N/O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon materials for high performance of supercapacitors.
