In the present work, we analyzed the effect of doping (Bi, Hf, and Nb) on the performance of tungsten oxide (WO3) based supercapacitor. Through substitutional doping, the properties were altered to enhance its electrochemical charge storage performance. The doped samples were tested in different electrolytes (H+, Li+, Na+, Ca2+ and Al3+). The cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and EIS studies were performed to identify the best suitable anode material for the fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitor. Nb:WO3 yielded the highest specific capacitance (Csp) of 782 Fg−1 in Ca electrolyte. An asymmetric device with Nb:WO3 as anode and MnO2 as a cathode using an aqueous Ca ion electrolyte exhibited a high potential window of 2 V and capacitance of 126 Fg−1. The factors responsible for performance of electrode material in different electrolytes were identified through experimental results, theoretical calculations, and relevant simulations. The effect of doping on WO3 crystal structure and electronic properties along with their binding nature/interaction with different electrolyte ions were first postulated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
