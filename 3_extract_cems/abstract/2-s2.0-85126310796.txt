Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been paid much attention as supercapacitor electrode due to outstanding chemical stability, high electron transfer rate and large specific surface area. However, the preparation process of CNFs is always stalemated in electrospinning, heat stabilization and carbonization. The problems of solvent pollution in the electrospinning process, complex process and high energy consumption in conventional carbonization process can't be solved. Herein, CNFs have been innovatively prepared from nanofibrillated cellulose by the molten-salt method (NaCl/NaOH). Molten salt penetrates between the fibers, separates and activates the fibers. The obtained carbon nanofibers remain developed branching structures and have a large specific surface area (899 m2 g−1). The electrical properties are tested in a symmetrical two-electrode system. The specific capacitance is 150 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. Low equivalent series resistance (1.13 Ω) indicates that it has high electrode conductivity. This study has taken into account energy conservation, environmental protection, recyclability and simplified preparation process, which has a very far-reaching significance for the industrial production of CNFs.
