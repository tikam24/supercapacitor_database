In this work, nickel phosphide nanoparticles are prepared via a facile solid state reaction method. The phase composition is easily controlled by tuning reaction temperature. At optimum condition, Ni2P/Ni12P5 composite exhibits the gravimetric capacity of 147.3 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and impressive capacitance retention of 81.0% after 20,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, as hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials. The simple and effective approach opens up an opportunity to achieve long circling life hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials.
