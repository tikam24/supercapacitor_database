In present work, RGO/IL-Cr composites were synthesized via chemical routes. The structural and valance state of the prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. For improving the electrochemical performance of conductive polymer, POAP/RGO/IL-Cr composite films have been fabricated by POAP electropolymerization in the presence of RGO/IL-Cr as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been applied to study the system performance. The supercapacity behavior of the composite film was attributed to the i) high active surface area of the composite, ii) charge transfer along the polymer chain due to the conjugation form of the polymer and finally iii) synergism effect between conductive polymer and RGO/IL-Cr.
