In the Electrical Vehicle (EV), the ultracapacitor is a promising source to perform as an auxiliary device to support the battery or as a primary source in a small EV. Unlike a battery, the terminal voltage of the ultracapacitor has a steep droop characteristic with respect to the drain of energy. So the terminal voltage of the ultracapacitor should be considered as a state-space variable. This work proposes a stability analysis for a zero voltage switching buck converter for charging the ultracapacitor. The bode plot has been utilized for the stability analysis. The results have shown that phase margin and the gain margin of the system for an open loop is 0 degree and 10 dB, while in the close loop is 4.21 degree and near to 14 dB, respectively. The positive gain and phase margin implies a stable system. The resonant buck converter with zero voltage switching for charging the ultracapacitor has been simulated in MatLab/Simulink and tested in real-time using STM32F4 Microcontroller.
