Polyaniline (PAn) coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) / NiFe 2O4 composite have been successfully synthesized for the first time by in-situ polymerization. The composites were characterized using TEM, which indicated that aniline is preferentially polymerized on the surface of MWNTs to form a layer of PAn on the MWNT/NiFe2O4 surface. The interaction between PAn and MWNTs/NiFe2O4 has been investigated and explained according to the results of FTIR. The TG and XRD results showed the improvement of thermal stability and crystallinity of the composites. The composites could be used as electrode materials for rechargeable batteries, electrochemical supercapacitors, magnetic materials as well as absorbing materials.
