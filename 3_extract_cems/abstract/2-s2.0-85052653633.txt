Flexibility is a key parameter of device mechanical robustness. The most profound challenge for the realization of flexible electronics is associated with the relatively low flexibility of power sources. In this article, two kinds of energy applications, which have gained increasing attention in the field of flexibility in recent years, are introduced: the lithium-ion batteries and the supercapacitors. We overview the latest progresses in flexible materials and manufacturing technology. The performances of the energy devices based on flexible materials are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages of different manufacturing processes are discussed systematically. We then focus on current technical difficulties and future prospects of research in flexibility.
