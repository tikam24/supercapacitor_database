Nanocomposites based on both modified/unmodified graphene and polypyrrole, were investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitor application. All the nanocomposites were prepared by in-situ oxidative polymerization method using ammonium persulfate as oxidant. The amine functionalization of Graphene was confirmed by FTIR and X-ray Photo Electron Spectroscopy (XPS). Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) analysis were performed to study the morphology of the nanocomposites. The maximum capacitance value was found as 240 F/g for unmodified graphene based composite. Though the capacitance value was found to be lower for modified graphene based composite, the cyclic stability was found to be higher as compared to unmodified graphene/polypyrrole nanocomposite.
