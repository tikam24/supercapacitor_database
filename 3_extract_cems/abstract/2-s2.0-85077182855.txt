The rapid development of silicon-based microelectronic devices urgently demand for compatibly silicon-based micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with smaller size, higher power density, and higher integration density. However, there are still some challenges in fabricating silicon-based MSCs, such as weakly-connected interface and expensively-manufactured process. Here we demonstrate a scalable and low-cost treating-cutting-coating (TCC) manufacture platform for Ti3C2Tx MXene-based on-chip MSCs. The hydrophilical treating of silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO2) surface can effectively enforce MXene-silicon interface adhesion, resulting in the improved integrity and uniformity of MXene films. Subsequently, cold laser-cutting followed by spin-coating can rapidly prepare the MXene-based electrodes on the kapton-masked Si/SiO2 substrates. This as-obtained MSC displays a high areal and volumetric capacitance of 472 μF cm−2 and 21.4 F cm−3, incorporating with outstanding cycling stability of over 87.6% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. Evidently, this treating-cutting-coating manufacture process will support a general platform toward scalable on-chip energy storage devices based on 2D materials.
