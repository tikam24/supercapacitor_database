Carbon-based materials have been widely employed for multipurpose applications such as superior energy storage and efficient oil–water separation. However, their commercial utilization has hindered by processing and engineering challenges. Herein, multifunctional ultralight mesoporous micro-yarn (MUMMY) carbon aerogel was derived from bio-waste. The fascinating structure, mesoporosity, high surface area and heteroatoms presence in the MUMMY carbon aerogel favors superior performance in supercapacitors and oil–water remediation. The binder-free and freestanding MUMMY carbon aerogel electrode exhibited an outstanding life span of 0.32 million cycles with 99 % capacitance retention at an ultrahigh scan rate of 10000 mV s−1 at 80 °C in an aqueous electrolyte. Further, the electric double layer capacitive behavior up to ultra-high scan rate 50000 mV s−1 was illustrated approving the high power device. In addition, a greater energy density of 64 Wh kg−1 at 80 °C was realized in an ionic liquid with a power density of 1500 W kg−1. Moreover, the MUMMY carbon aerogel determined a superior oil adsorption capacity of 215–348 times its weight. The adsorption capacity was conserved up to 87 %, 92 % and 99.8 % by combustion, squeezing, and distillation methods respectively after repeated nine cycles attributed to tremendous thermal stability and robustness. This MUMMY carbon aerogel has a great potential to use commercially as robust electrode materials for supercapacitors as well as super adsorbents for oil.
