Utilizing renewable resources for electrodes realizes the sustainable fabrication of a supercapacitor with high environmental friendliness. Laser-based graphitization of biomass has been emerging as a promising technique for patterning the electrodes of a supercapacitor with renewable resources. Herein, simultaneous patterning and microstructuring of laser-induced graphene (LIG) on a renewable biomass resource, bamboo, by a laser-based graphitization technique was demonstrated. By irradiating femtosecond laser pulses onto bamboo, graphitization and microstructuring were both induced simultaneously, forming conductive structures with high surface area. Furthermore, LIG patterned on bamboo by our method was used as the electrodes of supercapacitors. NaCl was selected as the electrolyte for the fabrication of supercapacitors. The proposed method realizes the fabrication of environmentally-friendly supercapacitors comprised of all renewable biomass resources.
