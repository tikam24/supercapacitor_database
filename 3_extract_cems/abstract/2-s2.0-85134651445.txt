Despite the rapid advances in wearable electronics, there are still challenges in developing wearable energy devices with excellent mechanical properties, let alone resisting bullets. In this work, a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on Kevlar and epoxy is developed (KE-TENG). It not only can protect users, but also collects the impact energy and store. Interestingly, impact signals can also be transmitted remotely via Bluetooth module and act as an alarm, showing its potential in wearable protective clothing. Epoxy not only improves the triboelectric properties of KE-TENG, but also greatly enhances the robustness under impact. Furthermore, a fiber shaped supercapacitor (F-SC) has been prepared in this work. F-SC has stable energy storage capacity, which does not deteriorate under different bending angles or multiple chargeâ€“discharge cycles. Most importantly, it can be assembled with KE-TENG via rectifiers, realizing an integrated system for energy collection and storage.
