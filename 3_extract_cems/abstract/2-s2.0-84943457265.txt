Although supercapacitors can store less energy than batteries, they are particularly appealing for hybrid vehicle applications (for example, for braking energy recovery, or stop and start systems supply...). As power networks in hybrid vehicle experience high frequency ripple currents due to power electronics components such as static converters, experiments are done to study the impact of high frequency ripple currents on supercapacitor ageing. The results suggest that high frequency ripple currents do not create new ageing mechanisms. A complementary ageing test is also carried out to study the effect of temperature on supercapacitor ageing at very low voltage. It clearly shows that a significant part of increase in supercapacitor resistance is only linked to temperature, instead of the combined effect of temperature and voltage as assumed by literature for supercapacitor ageing. Whereas tests demonstrate that capacitance loss through time is linked (for the most part) to the combined effect of voltage and temperature. Hence, this paper shows that resistance increase is only partially linked to capacitance loss.
