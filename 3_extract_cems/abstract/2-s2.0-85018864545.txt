The use of supercapacitors (SCs) to store regenerative braking energy from urban rail trains is able to achieve a good energy saving effect. This paper analyzes the current balance method of stationary energy storage devices (ESDs). At the beginning of the paper, the mathematical model of the DC traction power system, which includes trains, ESDs and traction substations, is established. Next, based on this, the SC state-based control strategy (SCSCS) is proposed, which can adjust the charging voltage of the ESD according to the SC voltage and current, then the charging current of the ESD can be reasonably distributed under the voltage difference of ESDs, and the SC voltage and current stress can be reduced. In order to determine the optimal controlling parameters, the optimization model is proposed and solved by the genetic algorithm. The analysis of the case study also shows the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy and optimization algorithm. Finally, the rationality of the proposed strategy is verified by experiments.
