Polyaniline (PANI)/Camphorsulfonic acid (CSA)/ copper oxide (CuO) nanocomposite was synthesized by in-situ chemical oxidation method. PANI nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results shows broadening the peaks depict enhanced the amorphous with addition of CuO nanoparticles. The FT-IR results are reveals the chemical interaction and copper metal ions uniformly embedded in PANI matrix. The TGA results are shows enhanced thermal stability with increasing the CuO nano concentration. These results are suggesting PCC composite is a prominent candidate for supercapacitor properties and optoelectronics devices applications.
