Supercapacitors have attracted tremendous attention due to high power density, high rate capability, long cycling life and safety. The article presents the comparison of electrochemical performance of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), MnO2 and MnO2/MWCNT nanocomposite as electrode mass in supercapacitor. Materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, low temperature nitrogen adsorption and cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance was found to increase in the row MWCNTs < MnO2 < MnO2/MWCNT achieving 32, 90 and 140 F · g−1 at 5 mV · s−1, respectively. The outstanding improvement of specific capacitance for MnO2/MWCNT was attributed to the combination of high electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes enhancing the charge transport and faradic redox reactions occurring on MnO2 surface.
