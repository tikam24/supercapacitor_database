Nanotailoring of active faradaic electrode materials with enhanced surface chemical reactivity is among the most efficient strategies of securing fast reaction kinetics in the hybrid supercapacitor application. Herein, an ammonia-etching-assisted nanotailoring of a-phase manganese silicate (nt-MnSiO3) with an average particle size of about 20 nm is purposely developed to disruptively promote its electrochemical faradaic reaction kinetics. The as-synthesized nt-MnSiO3exhibits a 3.55-times higher faradaic capacitance than the common yolk-shell counterpart at 0.5 A g-1. After being wrapped with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), the electrochemical performance of nt-MnSiO3/rGO is further enhanced with a specific capacitance of 860 F g-1at 0.5 A g-1and a capacitance retention of 80% after 5000 cycles. Integrating them with activated carbon into a hybrid supercapacitor device (nt-MnSiO3/rGO//AC) demonstrates an impressive areal capacitance of 816 mF cm-2at 1 mA cm-2, and an ultrahigh energy density of 1.633 W h m-2(40.8 W h kg-1) at a large power density of 1.5 W m-2(37.5 W kg-1) even under bending conditions. The present work provides a guideline to disruptively improve the faradaic capacity of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
