MgCo2O4 nanomaterial is thought to be a promising candidate for renewable energy storage and conversions. Nevertheless, the poor stability performances and small specific areas of transition-metal oxides remain a challenge for supercapacitor (SC) device applications. In this study, sheet-like Ni(OH)2@MgCo2O4 composites were hierarchically developed on nickel foam (NF) using the facile hydrothermal process with calcination technology, under carbonization reactions. The combination of the carbon–amorphous layer and porous Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles was anticipated to enhance the stability performances and energy kinetics. The Ni(OH)2@MgCo2O4 nanosheet composite achieved a superior specific capacitance of 1287 F g−1 at a current value of 1 A g−1, which is higher than that of pure Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles and MgCo2O4 nanoflake samples. At a current density of 5 A g−1, the Ni(OH)2@MgCo2O4 nanosheet composite delivered an outstanding cycling stability of 85.6%, which it retained over 3500 long cycles with an excellent rate of capacity of 74.5% at 20 A g−1. These outcomes indicate that such a Ni(OH)2@MgCo2O4 nanosheet composite is a good contender as a novel battery-type electrode material for high-performance SCs.
