The distributed mode of generation reduces the complications related to transmission and distribution which has its discrete advantages. This paper proposes a model of Human to Nanogrid (H2N) that is based on the distributed generation technology to harness and store the human energy wasted during a workout on different gym equipment into a bank of supercapacitors. Targeted machines at the health club are selected based on the maximum load that can be lifted and also based on specific muscle group exercise that can be performed on them, such as bench press and Lat pulldown machine. Mechanical energy generated from a machine by different users over a period is studied and a comparison between the human power output and the energy consumption at the gym is carried out to find the change in monthly and yearly electricity bill. Finally, the collected data is utilized to analyze the energy savings, emission reduction and also the break-even analysis is performed to determine the payback period.
