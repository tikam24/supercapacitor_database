An all-solid-state, coaxial and self-powered "energy fiber" is demonstrated that simultaneously converts solar energy to electric energy and further stores it. The "energy fiber" is flexible and can be scaled up for the practical application by the well-developed textile technology, and may open a new avenue to future photoelectronics and electronics.
