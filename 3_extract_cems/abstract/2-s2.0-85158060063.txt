To use nanostructured materials for practical applications, scaled quantity production becomes a necessary part of synthesis. The present work demonstrates the simple one-step easy synthesis of Ni(OH)2/rGO nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications at scaled quantities. Direct deposition of Ni(OH)2/rGO on nickel foam for a supercapacitor was performed using a hydrothermal method. Depending on the size of the autoclave, it is possible to deposit an active mass on a selected substrate. Crystallography and microstructural study results showed the formation of good-quality and required morphology material. The electrochemical characterization performed on Ni(OH)2/rGO/Ni exhibited a specific capacitance of 1900 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Capacitance retention of 92.5% is demonstrated after 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The obtained results suggest that the synthesized material can be used for supercapacitor applications at the mass scale.
