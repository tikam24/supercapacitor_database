This research revealed the effect of adding up commercial polypyrrole (PPy) on morphology, molecular structure and electrochemical supercapacitor properties of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) film. The film was deposited through electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method. The method introduces an application of pyrocatechol violet (PV) act as a dispersant to disperse MWCNTs-PPy uniformly into deionised water. The uniform colloid was subjected to set direct current electric field to 20.7 V. The film was successfully deposited on anode electrode after 15 minutes of EPD. The morphology assessment of the film magnified at 30k shows the distribution of agglomeration of irregular spherical structure on continuous structure similar to wire. FTIR analysis indicated the PPy characteristic peaks with C=C stretching vibration in pyrrole ring, =C-H in plane vibration band and C=C bending band were preserved in MWCNTs-PPy spectra. The SO3-peak appeared in MWCNTs, PPy and composite spectra confirmed that PV adsorption happened on MWCNTs and PPy. The MWCNTs-PPy film has broad diffraction peak around 24°<2θ<28° revealing the deposited film contain mixture of crystalline and amorphous nature. The film potential function as supercapacitor was further investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. From the analysis, the specific capacitance, energy density, power density and energy efficiency of MWCNTs film have enhanced with the presence of PPy.
