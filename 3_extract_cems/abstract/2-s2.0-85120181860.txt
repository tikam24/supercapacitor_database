What will cars look like in 100 years' later? They must run by ‘electric motor’ and will receive energy directly from electric power infrastructure like electric trains. The key technologies here are ‘supercapacitors’ to excel in power input and output rather than batteries, and ‘wireless power transfer’ to connect cars to power infrastructure. Furthermore, energy efficiency and safety will be dramatically improved by the technology of ‘motion control’ to make use of the excellent torque control characteristics of electric motor, also together with automatic driving technology. © 2021 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.
