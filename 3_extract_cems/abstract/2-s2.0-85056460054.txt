In this review paper, we highlight the utilization of nanostructured quantum dots (QDs) in light-emitting diodes, biomedical, and energy-related applications. We discuss different preparation methods, cation-doping effects, and the optical applications of perovskite QDs. Cadmium selenide QDs are semiconductor materials with narrow bandgaps; therefore, their optical properties and electronic structures can be tuned. They can absorb photons (light energy) and convert multiple electron-hole pairs efficiently via multiple exciton generations. These effective light absorption properties are suitable for solar-driven water electrolysis processes and efficient photo-electrochemical lithium-air batteries. We focus on the utilization of upconverting nanoparticles in the field of biomedical applications. Suitable bandgap position, efficient charge separation, transportation, and photo-stability are the advantages of QD nanostructured materials. Hence, they are efficient and challenging candidates for the future.
