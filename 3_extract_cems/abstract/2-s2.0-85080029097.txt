With the advent of Materials Science-based technological advances, the fabrication of materials that could simultaneously exhibit both mechanical and processing properties of polymers and unique electrical characteristics of metals is a requirement with prior mandate. With the development of conducting polymers, great opportunities have been established, and novel devices with the significant features have emerged. Polyaniline (PANI) and its derivatives have attracted immense attention because of their fascinating properties, including high conductivity, inexpensiveness of starting material, unique redox behavior, facile synthesis, tunable properties, appropriate electrochemical and environmental stability, and strong bimolecular interactions. Nanostructures based on PANI have shown improved functionalities in various applications. In this article, different synthesis strategies such as interfacial polymerization, microwave-assisted polymerization, and sonochemical polymerization among others have been summarized. Besides, PANI-based nanocomposites and their various industrial, as well as biomedical applications in supercapacitors, batteries, gas vapor sensors, printable electronics, electrochromics, actuators, electrostatic dissipation, electromagnetic interference shielding, corrosion protection, filtration membranes, microbial fuel cell, biosensors, tissue engineering, and drug delivery systems, have been discussed in detail.
