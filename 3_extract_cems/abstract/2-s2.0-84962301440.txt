The proceedings contain 25 papers and 3 PowerPoint presentations. The topics discussed include: high performance silicon nanowire lithium ion battery anodes; direct deposit of polyvinyl alcohol/silicon/graphene nanoribbon nanofibers for a facile production of high capacity lithium ion battery anodes; foamed mesoporous carbon/silicon composite nanofiber anode for lithium ion batteries; a mechanistic understanding of lithium-ion diffusion and intercalation in novel lignin-derived carbon composite anodes; carbon-based nanostructured electrodes for high performance rechargeable battery applications; advanced hybrid supercapacitor based on new ordered mesoporous materials as high performance anodes; and roll-to-roll synthesis of vertically aligned carbon nanotube electrodes for electrical double layer capacitors.
