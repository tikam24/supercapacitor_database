Conductive multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposites were prepared via solution method and their conductive micro-patterns were made using the doctor blade technique. The prepared patterns were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltam-metry, and four-point probe conductivity meter. SEM images of the cross-sections of micro-patterns revealed that by increasing MWCNT concentration from 5 to 10%, while the dense and smooth bulk structure converted to a brittle one, their conductivities raised from 0.07 up to 0.33 S/cm. These micro-patterns preserved their conductivities under high bending cycles except for high MWCNT loading which loses almost half of its conductivity. The cyclic voltammetry analyses showed that MWCNT/ PDMS conductive micro-patterns had supercapacitor properties. The specific capacitance of the composite containing 10 wt% of MWCNT was 0.35 F/g These nanocomposites can be used in cochlear implants due to their high conductivities. Their low working voltages ensure the safety of the neural tissues. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
