We successfully demonstrate reduced graphene oxides supercapacitors processed by atmospheric pressure plasma jets. The optimized processing time is merely 15 s. The best specific capacitance achieved is ∼274 F g−1as evaluated by cyclic voltammetry under a potential scan rate of 2 mV s−1. The specific capacitance decreases from ∼203 F g−1at cycle 1 to ∼168 F g−1at cycle 2000 in a cycling stability test evaluated under a potential scan rate of 200 mV s−1.
