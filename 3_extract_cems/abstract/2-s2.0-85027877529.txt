Thiourea aldehyde resin-based heteroatom doping carbon and graphene composites (RHDC/GN) were prepared by an in situ polymerization and carbonization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that thiourea aldehyde resin deposited on lamellar GO flakes during the polymerization and RHDC/GN composites had a hierarchical structure. The specific capacitance of the RHDC/GN composites was high up to 355 F g−1, much higher than that of the pure thiourea aldehyde resin-based heteroatom doping carbon (RHDC) with specific capacitance of 135 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 in 6-M KOH electrolyte. And the hetroatoms in RHDC/GN composites increase the specific capacitance, and GN enhances the conductivity of the electrodes which is beneficial to improving electrochemical cycling stability of the electrode significantly. The specific capacitance retains 90.97% after 5000 charge-discharge processes at 10 A g−1, which provides potential as supercapacitors.
