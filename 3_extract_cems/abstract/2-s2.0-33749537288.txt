Hydrous RuO2 particles were electrochemically loaded into poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped poly(styrene sulfonic acid), PEDOT-PSS, matrix by employing various potential cycles in cyclic voltammetry and to fabricate the PEDOT-PSS-RuO2·xH2O electrode. The amount of hydrous RuO2 particles loaded into the PEDOT-PSS matrix was easily controlled by varying the number of potential cycles. Scanning electron microscopy photographs reveal a uniform dispersion of hydrous RuO2 particles in the porous structure of PEDOT-PSS matrix. Raman spectrum confirms the incorporation of hydrous RuO2 into PEDOT-PSS matrix. Chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry were employed in 0.5 M H2SO4 to evaluate the capacitor properties. Specific capacitance values were determined by chronoamperometry. An increasing trend in specific capacitance with loaded amount of hydrous RuO2 particles in PEDOT-PSS was noticed. A maximum specific capacitance of 653 F/g was achieved. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
