Transition metal oxide nanostructures and conducting polymers like polyaniline have specific capacitance, an order of magnitude higher than those of carbon based nano-materials. In the present study, nano-flowers of cobalt hydroxide, polyaniline and carbon nanotubes were combined on a conventional polymeric sponge to develop by using facile wet chemical techniques. High surface area of cobalt hydroxide nano-flowers when combined with polyaniline showed enhanced capacitance values and stability. The carbon nanotubes enhanced the conductivity of the composite while the double porous structure of polyurethane sponge enhances the electrolyte flow, surface area, and reduces current density which leads to good reversibility and greater capacitance. Samples were characterized by cyclic voltammetry technique against Ag/AgCl reference electrode in three electrode setup.
