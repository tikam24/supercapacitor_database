Metal-organic frameworks are clusters of metal ions with organic linkers, which bind together through coordination bonds. Around 20,000 MOFs have been introduced with their diverse characteristics such as morphology, specific surface area, and porosity, as well as controllable chemical and physical properties. MOFs are raised as attractive platforms for developing advanced electrode materials for various rechargeable batteries. MOFs and MOFs-related materials or bimetallic organic frameworks (BMOFs) offer great opportunities to resolve the current issues of rechargeable batteries. MOFs and BMOFs have attracted widespread consideration as an advanced precursor for the production of various nanomaterials, such as porous carbon metal oxides (MOx), metal carbides, metal chalcogenides, metal phosphides, and their composites, with tailorable properties. MOF-derived nanostructures as anode materials for energy storage devices such as lithium-ion batteries, Na+ ion batteries, supercapacitor, etc. have great potential. MOF-derived nanostructure has some unique properties in terms of its composition, morphology, size, and surface area. This chapter summarizes the different MOFs and MOFs derivative-based anode materials for rechargeable batteries. Further, the influence of different parameters such as morphology, temperature, composition on the properties of rechargeable battery-anode is also discussed. This work will help to select the controllable preparation of MOF-derived nanostructures for the anode of energy storage devices. In addition, the fabrication process and their application as energy storage devices are summarized.
