This review article provides information on solution-processed nanocrystalline Bi-type electrode materials and their electrochemical energy storage applications. The importance of solution-based processes for developing nanocrystalline electrodes and operation principle of supercapacitor charge storage mechanism arecompressively discussed. Then, the increasing demand for metal oxides, chalcogenides, and halides in energy storage devices is explored. Bi-based compounds contaning oxides, chalcogenides, and halides, such as Bi2O3, Bi2S3, Bi2Se3, BiMoO6, BiMnO2, BiFe2O3, BiV2O5, Bi2S3/graphene/CNT/carbon, etc., are versatile electrode materials for supercapacitor applications owing to their low-cost, chemical stability, mechanical robustness, natural abundance, eco-friendly nature, quasi-faradaic redox reactions, and availability of various structures and morphologies. Furthermore, a tabular electrochemical performance survey and synthesis solution process details of Bi-based nanoelectrode materials have also been provided in the form of a database. Finally, insights into the future applications are provided before concluding remarks.
