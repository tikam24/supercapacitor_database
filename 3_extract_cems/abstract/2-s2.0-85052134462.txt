This paper proposed a regenerative braking system (RBS) strategy for battery electric vehicles (BEVs) with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) driven by a brushless DC (BLDC) motor. In the regenerative braking mode of BEV, the BLDC motor works as a generator. Consequently, the DC-link voltage is boosted and regenerative braking energy is transferred to a battery and/or ultracapacitor (UC) using a suitable switching pattern of the three-phase inverter. The energy stored in the HESS through reverse current flow can be exploited to improve acceleration and maintain the batteries from frequent deep discharging during high power mode. In addition, the artificial neural network (ANN)-based RBS control mechanism was utilized to optimize the switching scheme of the vehicular breaking force distribution. Furthermore, constant torque braking can be regulated using a PI controller. Different simulation and experiments were implemented and carried out to verify the performance of the proposed RBS strategy. The UC/battery RBS also contributed to improved vehicle acceleration and extended range BEVs.
