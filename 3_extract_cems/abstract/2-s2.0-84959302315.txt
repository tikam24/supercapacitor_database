A homogeneous Ni(OH)2/graphene nanosheet (GNS) nanocomposite with excellent supercapacitive performance has been synthesized by a facile chemical precipitation. The Ni(OH)2/GNS nanocomposite presented an ideal morphology with the nano-sized Ni(OH)2 particles homogeneously growing on the GNS. Its microstructure, morphology were investigated by XRD, SEM and TEM. The electrochemical performance of the Ni(OH)2/GNS nanocomposite was test by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic chargeâˆ’discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The homogeneous Ni(OH)2/GNS nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1667 F/g at a current density of 1A/g and maintained a good stability in 5000 cycles, suggesting that it can be a promising candidate for supercapacitor. The high specific capacitance and remarkable rate capability are promising for applications in supercapacitors with both high energy and power densities. The Ni(OH)2/GNS nanocomposite exhibited large specific capacitance, high rate capability and good cycling stability.
