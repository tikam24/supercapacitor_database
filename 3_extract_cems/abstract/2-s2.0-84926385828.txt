The ability to achieve high surface areas with nanomaterials brought several advancements in energy storage devices and their applications in different industries. Supercapacitors, a new generation of energy storage devises, have quick charge and discharge abilities, and hold as much energy as batteries and other chemical storage devices. The present study focuses on the effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) inclusions in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolytes for the improved capacitance values, which may affect the lifetime, charge holding, and charging and discharging rates of the graphene nanoflake-based supercapacitors. In this research, various supercapacitors were constructed using the reduced graphene oxide nanoflakes, PVA and PVA incorporated with CNTs, and the best candidates were selected for the future considerations. The test results showed that the CNT concentrations of 0.1-1.0wt% in PVA enhanced the capacitance (charge holding capacity) and reduced the internal resistance of the electrolytes significantly. This study may open up new possibilities for the supercapacitors and other energy storage devices currently under developments.
