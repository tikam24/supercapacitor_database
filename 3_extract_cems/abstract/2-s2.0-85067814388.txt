Nitrogen-doped porous carbon is prepared by the fusion and carbonization processes of Al-based metal-organic frameworks and melamine, and following removal of thermal decomposed Al2O3 via dissolving in NaOH solution. The hierarchically porous carbon has a large surface area of 1452 m2 g−1 with mesopores of suitable size (4.64 nm). It exhibits an enhanced specific capacitance and rate capability of 318.7 F g−1(1 A g−1) and 210.5 F g−1 (100 A g−1), respectively. The cycling life tests indicate the material offers superior stability with 96.4% retention at ultra-high current density of 100 A g−1 during 50, 000 cycles. The improved electrochemical properties of this carbon can be attributed to the exogenous nitrogen-doping, special ellipsoid shape and hierarchically porous structure. This method is a new potential strategy to configure unique structure and particular heteroatom-doped porous carbon material for power supercapacitors via the fusion of metal-organic frameworks and heteroatom-containing polymer.
