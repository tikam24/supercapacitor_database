In recent years, transition metal dichalcogenides(TMDs), an emerging two-dimensional material, are regarded as the promising candidates for the supercapacitors electrodes due to their unique layered structure and electrical properties. This review introduces the common synthesis methods of two-dimensional TMDs, elaborates the research progress of molybdenum-based, tungsten-based, vanadium-based and other TMDs in supercapacitors, and analyzes the influence of morpohologies, nanoarchitectures, modified methods and other factors on the electrochemical performance of TMDs. The achievements and challenges of TMDs in this field are roundly disscussed toward the practical application.
