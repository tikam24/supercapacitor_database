In this paper we report a semiconducting porous carbon material for supercapacitor application. Semiconducting carbon material was prepared by two step method. First, hypercross-linked polymers (HCPs) of phloroglucinol and α,α'-dichloro-p-xylene was prepared by a simple Friedel Crafts alkylation, and second, the synthesized microporous HCPs was subjected into carbonization at 700°C in a helium atmosphere. The carbonized sample was characterized into cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1M sodium sulphate aqueous solution for supercapacitor applications. The specific capacitance of carbonized materials is found to be 86Fg-1 at a current density of 0.1Ag-1.
