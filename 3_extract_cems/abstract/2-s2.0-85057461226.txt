Frustules of the cultured diatom (CD) with unique porous architecture and high surface area were used as template for electrodes. Iron oxide coating on cultured diatom (CD-FeOx) was carried out via hydrolysis and metathesis reaction of FeCl3, which allowed the uniform coating of the FeOx onto frustules. The relatively large surface area of CD contributed to double-layer capacitance, while the FeOx provided pseudocapacitance. Results showed that 51% loading of FeOx on CD significantly enhanced performance to 70.2 F gâˆ’1, which was much higher compared with CD only. Supercapacitors remained functional after 1000 cycles and maintained 90% of the original performance. The CD-FeOx composite was also successfully used to fabricate flexible supercapacitor electrodes.
