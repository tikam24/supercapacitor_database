NiO/LaNiO 3 (NiO/LNO) film electrode was prepared by spin-coating technique on Pt/Ti/SiO 2 /Si(100) substrates. The crystal structure and surface morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic charge-discharge measurements were employed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the electrode. The effect of LNO layer on the performance of the NiO/LNO electrode was also investigated. The NiO/LNO electrode with appropriate LNO content possesses high specific capacitance (2030 F/g at 0.5 A/g) and good cyclability (specific capacitance retention of 83% after 1000 cycles). The present study suggests that NiO/LNO film is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
