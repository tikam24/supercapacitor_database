The performance of portable electronic equipment can often be improved by including an electrochemical capacitor alongside the battery. The capacitor extends battery life by reducing its peak output power. A CR2032 coin-type battery cell was used for the LiCoO2 cathode and Li anode. A mixture of 1 M LiPF6-ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (1:1 vol, Merk) was used as the electrolyte. The electrochemical characteristics of a supercapacitor are able to provide a much higher pulse current capability than the battery system. By combining a supercapacitor and a battery, the pulse performance of a battery can be significantly improved according to various pulse times. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
