Supercapacitors have gained a lot of concern owing to their high-power density, fast charging rate and long lifecycle. Supercapacitors showed higher power density than the battery and conventional capacitors. It composes of anode, cathode, and separated by a separator that consists of electrolytes. Owing to the storage mechanisms, supercapacitors are divided into pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance. Among transition metal oxides, ZnO has been widely utilized in supercapacitor electrodes owing to its outstanding properties. However, it suffers from the dendrite growth after repeated charge/discharge process. Hence, ZnO-based composites with carbonaceous materials, conducting polymers and transition metal oxides are needed.
