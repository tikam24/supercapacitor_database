In the present study, we introduce the first study for investigating the effect of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the electrochemical performance of the PTy electroactive film. In this work, we applied PEG to improve electrochemical performance of PTy electroactive film. The electrochemical properties of the prepared electrodes were investigated by means of various electrochemical methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and consecutive charge/discharge. The developed electrode in this study exhibits a specific capacity of 4200 mF.cm−2 at 5 mA.cm−2 current density while retaining 90% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles. Our results provide an improved conductive polymer composite film with high active surface area, ease of synthesis and high cycling stability for supercapacitors (SCs) in aqueous electrolytes.
