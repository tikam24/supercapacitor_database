The load of different electric vehicles connected to the micro-grid is different in modern times. The micro-grid usually uses energy storage system to stabilize the power fluctuations of DC bus caused by load changes. This paper uses a lithium battery and supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (Li-SC HESS) to meet a demand of both the aspects of power and energy due to load changes. This paper researches on the model structure of hybrid energy storage system, and presents a PCH strong tracking control method for power coordinated allocation. Then it combines simscape to simulink, establishes an energy storage system model for photovoltaic (PV) micro-grid, and makes a comparative research with the conventional double-loop linear control, and also combines battery online monitoring system to establish the experimental system platform. The simulation and experimental results show that, the proposed HESS control strategy can effectively reduce lithium battery's charging/discharging times, and smooth its charging/discharging process, with life span increasing, thereby improving the performance of the hybrid energy storage system and improving the charging quality of the electric vehicle. And it is also significant in making in-depth study of HESS power coordinated management and the development of electric vehicle industry in the future.
