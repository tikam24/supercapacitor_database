Nanobud assembled copper oxide mesostructures have been synthesized on a stainless steel substrate via a simple chemical bath deposition method and characterized for crystal structure, surface morphology and oxidation state by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption desorption measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy respectively. X-ray diffraction pattern reveals that copper oxide is in monoclinic phase. The 3-(3′-Hydroxypropyl)-1,2-dimethylimidazolium chloride [HPDMIM][Cl] ionic liquid was prepared by refluxing 1,2-dimethylimidazole and 3-chloro-1-propanol and used as an electrolyte. Supercapacitor application of copper oxide was examined by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in different molar concentrations of [HPDMIM][Cl] ionic liquid. Electrochemical analysis demonstrated copper oxide exhibit comparatively higher specific capacitance of 90 F g-1 in 0.3M than 0.1 and 0.2 M ionic liquids at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 for the potential range of -0.9 to +0.4 V.
