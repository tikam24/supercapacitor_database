Despite significant progress in the preparation and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) materials, the synthesis of 2D organic materials remains challenging. Here, we report a novel space-confined polymerization method that enables the large-scale synthesis of 2D sheets of a functional conjugated polymer, namely, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). A key step in this method is the confinement of monomer to the boundaries of ice crystals using micelles. This spatial confinement directs the polymerization to form 2D PEDOT sheets with high crystallinity and controlled morphology. Supercapacitors prepared from the 2D PEDOT sheets exhibit outstanding performance metrics. In aqueous electrolyte, a high areal specific capacitance of 898 mF cm−2 at 0.2 mA cm−2 along with an excellent rate capability is achieved (e.g., capacitance retention of 67.6 % at a 50-fold higher current). Moreover, the 2D PEDOT-based supercapacitors exhibit outstanding cycling stability (capacitance retention of 98.5 % after 30,000 cycles). Device performance is further improved when an organic electrolyte is used.
