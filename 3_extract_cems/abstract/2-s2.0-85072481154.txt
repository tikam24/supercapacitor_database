Current research is focused upon addressing lifetime performance degradation for ruthenium oxide based super-capacitors developed at Space Research Institute (SRI). Degradation has been attributed to decreases in inter-particle contact within the powder-based electrode due to changes in the moisture content of the electrode binder. To achieve maximum utilization of the ruthenium oxide, the binder must achieve optimum moisture levels. Data collected during a 30 day drying test shows the performance changes can be divided into four distinct regions which are characterized by an initial degradation period, a performance recovery period, stabilization and eventual slow degradation. These regions are analyzed and interpretations of the particle and binder behavior are presented. Copyright Â© 2002 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.
