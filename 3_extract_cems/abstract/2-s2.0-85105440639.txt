Sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SICs) as promising energy conversion and storage devices have exhibited excellent specific energy, high specific power, and good cycling life. Nevertheless, anode materials for SICs suffer from terrible volume expansion and sluggish reaction kinetics owing to the larger radius of sodium-ion. To find suitable anode materials, we design and prepare reduced graphene oxide-supported CoS2 nanoparticles (CoS2/rGO) with high electrochemical performance through a facile hydrothermal method. When tested as anode materials, the specific capacity of CoS2/rGO delivers 529.3 and 1168.6 mA h g−1 in the process of the 1st charge and discharge, respectively. Moreover, the specific capacity retention is up to 214.8 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 over 100 cycles. In order to explore the practical application of CoS2/rGO, SICs are assembled by biomass-derived porous carbon cathodes and CoS2/rGO anodes, which displays remarkable specific energy of 112.6, 103.75, 91.29, 70.34, 47.45 W h kg−1 under specific power 225, 449.82, 899.86, 1350, 2689.3 W kg−1, respectively, benefiting from the high pseudocapacitive performance of CoS2/rGO anodes and outstanding specific capacity of biomass-derived porous carbon cathodes.
