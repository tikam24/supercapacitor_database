Abstract: In this article, a novel silicon-based electrode was designed with the facile solution methods. With the modification of highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer on the SiNWs by the spin-coated method (SiNWs-PSS), three-dimensional (3D) porous network polyaniline nanofibers (PANI) film was uniformly electrodeposited on the silicon surface (SiNWs-PSS@PANI). The sheet resistances of the PEDOT:PSS layer with different surfactants as well as the deposition time of the PANI were investigated. After optimization, the fabricated SiNWs-PSS@PANI electrode displayed high capacitance about 301.71 mF cm−2 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2, which enhanced ~ 29 fold comparing to 10.18 mF cm−2 of electrode without the PEDOT:PSS layer between the SiNWs and PANI (SiNWs@PANI), outperforming most values of the reported silicon-based electrodes. The electrode designed in this paper provides a new idea to fabricate high-performance of silicon-based micro-supercapacitors with the simple and low-temperature method.
