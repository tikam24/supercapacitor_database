Double-layer capacitor electrode including activated carbon with multi-walled carbon nanotube as a conductive additive (AC/MWCNTs) and pseudocapacitor electrode with nano-structural porous manganese oxide (NP-MnO2) were prepared and used to improve the capacitive performance of the negative (N−ve) and positive (P+ve) electrodes for asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor. The investigated asymmetric NP-MnO2//AC/MWCNTs hybrid supercapacitor device was assembled with positive and negative electrodes using tissue paper as a separator. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were employed for measuring the electrochemical characterization of the individual electrodes and supercapacitor cell. The specific capacitance of the NP-MnO2 positive electrode and the AC/MWCNTs negative electrode was 333 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and 250 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, after 1000 CV cycles and 2000 GCD cycles, the positive and negative electrodes demonstrated superior stability of cycles with capacitance retention of 100%. The asymmetric NP-MnO2//AC/MWCNTs hybrid supercapacitor device manifests a wide working potential window (0–1.8 V) and highest specific energy of 50 Wh kg−1 with a specific power of 1085 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. After 10,000 cycles at 12 A g−1, an excellent cycling stability behavior with 95% capacitance retention was obtained.
