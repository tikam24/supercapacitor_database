The specific capacitance of polyaniline (PANI) deposited potentiodynamically on a stainless steel (SS) substrate, in the presence of p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTS) is estimated. Cyclic voltammetric experiments, galvanostatic charge-discharge studies and impedance analysis are carried out in order to investigate the applicability of the system as an electrochemical supercapacitor. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques are employed for characterization of the electrode. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.
