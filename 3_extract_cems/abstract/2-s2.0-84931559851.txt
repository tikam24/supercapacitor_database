In this study, metal nitrides MN (M = Cr, Co) nanoparticles of particle size âˆ¼20-30 nm have been prepared under NH3 + N2 atmosphere at relatively low temperature. The Cr-urea complex was directly converted to CrN with an intermediate formation of Cr2O3, whereas CoN was prepared from Co3O4. These compounds were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) techniques. The electrochemical properties were evaluated by galvanostatic cycling, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical performance of the resultant MN nanoparticles showed that they can be used as potential electrode materials for non-aqueous hybrid electrochemical supercapacitors (HESCs). The MN/AC showed high specific capacitance of 75 and 37 F g-1 for M = Cr, Co, respectively when cycled at 30 mA g-1 in non-aqueous electrolyte.
