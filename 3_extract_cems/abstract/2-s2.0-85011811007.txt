Hollow activated carbons (HACs) with unique through-pore structure derived from reed straw were prepared with KOH activation. The amount of activating agent greatly affected the properties of the HACs. When the KOH content was three times that of the carbonized reed straw, the HACs exhibited a large specific surface area of 2387 m2 g−1 and outstanding electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of the assembled electrodes reached 355 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Moreover, a high specific capacitance of 290 F g−1 was retained even at a high current density of 30 A g−1, implying excellent rate performance. These results clearly demonstrate the potential of reed straw-based HACs for use in supercapacitor electrode materials.
