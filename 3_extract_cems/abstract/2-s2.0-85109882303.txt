Manganese dioxide (MnO2) is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high capacitance, environment friendly, and low cost. However, it shows low specific capacitance and poor circulation in practice because of the disintegration of MnO2 in chargeâ€“discharge process. In this review, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of MnO2 and MnO2-based composites with various structures have been discussed in detail. In addition, the development prospect of MnO2-based composites has been discussed.
