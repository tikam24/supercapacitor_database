Flexible and stretchable electrochromic supercapacitor systems are widely considered as promising multifunctional energy storage devices that eliminate the need for an external power source. Nevertheless, the performance of conventional designs deteriorates significantly as a result of electrode/electrolyte exposure to atmosphere as well as mechanical deformations for the case of flexible systems. In this study, we suggest an all-transparent stretchable electrochromic supercapacitor device with ultrastable performance, which consists of Au/Ag core-shell nanowire-embedded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), bistacked WO 3 nanotube/PEDOT:PSS, and polyacrylamide (PAAm)-based hydrogel electrolyte. Au/Ag core-shell nanowire-embedded PDMS integrated with PAAm-based hydrogel electrolyte prevents Ag oxidation and dehydration while maintaining ionic and electrical conductivity at high voltage even after 16 days of exposure to ambient conditions and under application of mechanical strains in both tensile and bending conditions. WO 3 nanotube/PEDOT:PSS bistacked active materials maintain high electrochemical-electrochromic performance even under mechanical deformations. Maximum specific capacitance of 471.0 F g -1 was obtained with a 92.9% capacity retention even after 50000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, high coloration efficiency of 83.9 cm 2 C -1 was shown to be due to the dual coloration and pseudocapacitor characteristics of the WO 3 nanotube and PEDOT:PSS thin layer.
