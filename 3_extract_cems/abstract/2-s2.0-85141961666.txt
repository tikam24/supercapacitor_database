Stretchable supercapacitors with simultaneously high energy/power densities and long life can enrich integrated power options for ever-increasing wearable electronics. However, supercapacitors with high electrochemical performances while maintaining high stretchability are still challenging. Herein, we report stretchable sodium ion capacitors (S-SICs) based on multi-dimensionally and hierarchically elastomeric composite electrodes, and stretchable high voltage gel polymer electrolyte (3.0 V). The elastomeric composite electrode is constructed by stretchable 3D electrospun polyurethane (PU) fibrous mat and conductive 1D Ag nanowire network. 2D MoSe2/MXene and 3D AC/MXene as anodic and cathodic materials are embedded in this conductive and stretchable mat. This hierarchical structure enables multi-dimensional conductive connections under tensile condition. The pre-strain treatment on PU fibrous mat further increases the relatively stretching distance before losing conductive connection among hierarchical components. The electrodes exhibit superior sodium ion storage performances (420 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), as well as good stretchability and stability (95% after 1000 cycles at 2 A g−1). Based on this, the S-SICs with high operating voltage demonstrate high energy/power densities (max. 5.44 mWh cm−3, 493.55 mW cm−3) and good stretchability. This prototypical exhibition of S-SICs indicates a promising design direction of stretchable supercapacitors with high electrochemical performances and tolerance of stretchability.
