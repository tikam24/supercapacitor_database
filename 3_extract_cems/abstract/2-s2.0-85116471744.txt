Haemoglobin (Hb) has been employed as naturally copious metal plagiaristic that attains the material with sustainable supercapacitance. Herein, a fabrication method in the course of interaction between macromolecule compound Hb with graphite has been reported over stainless steel electrode in the presence of sulphonated polysulphone (SPS) as a binder. The microstructure of fabricated Hb graphite stainless steel (SS) electrode has been ascertained through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical capacitance of electrodes has been examined in KOH solution (1.0 M) with reference to Ag/AgCl at a scan rate 0.001 to 0.2 Vs-1. Developed electrode has shown highest capacitance of 158.43 at scan rate of 0.001 Vs-1along with energy and power densities of 3.86 Whkg-1and 237.92 Whkg-1respectively. In multiple cycles electrode rendered quite slow decrease in electrocapacitive during the first 1000 cycles (at scan rate of 0.1 Vs-1) indicating good charge-discharge with improved electrochemical cyclic stability.
