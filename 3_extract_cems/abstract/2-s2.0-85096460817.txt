In the last decades, the world has been confronted with increasingly severe threats caused by small drones, especially for security of important places such as military bases and crucial activities in public areas. In comparison with traditional projectile weapons, high-energy laser weapons are especially suitable for countering such threats due to its precise and scalable effect with extremely low collateral damage. This paper presents a systematic design method of anti-drone laser weapons. First, this paper analyzes the system's requirements. Secondly, describes the damage capability of high-energy laser weapons, presents how to determine the main parameters of the laser weapon system. Finally, for maneuverable deployment, this paper discusses the power supply for laser and cooling equipment, and shows how to reduce the power supply requirement and the system mass.
