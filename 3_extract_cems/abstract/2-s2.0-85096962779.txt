Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are drawing more and more attention in the field of energy storage devices due to their distinct advantages such as their high power density, good electrochemical performances and long maintenance-free lifetime. In this work, a simulative approach (based on FEM (finite element method)) was employed to investigate the interplay of architecture between the geometric parameters for different electrodes number, length and width of an interdigitated structure. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) have been numerically calculated showing the maximum current response for optimized geometry parameters (length= 6500 µm, 16 electrodes width= 200 µm) of about 92 mA/cm2. All the results demonstrate that this kind of micro-supercapacitor is a promote candidate that can be used in future autonomous systems.
