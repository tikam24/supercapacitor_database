Cobalt Ferrite (CoFe 2O 4) nanorods and nanorings have been successfully controllable synthesized by solvothermal method. The specific characteristics were confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The measurement of their electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrode materials indicate different morphological characterizations have various capacitive effects, and CoFe 2O 4 nanorings generally have larger specific capacitances than nanorods at different scan rates and current densities in 1.0 M KOH solution.
