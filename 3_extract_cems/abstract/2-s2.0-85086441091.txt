The hollow cobalt-iron Prussian blue analogue (Co2HCFe) is fabricated via simple co-precipitation at room temperature through a way of dominating the molar mass of transition metal cobalt. The hollow structure nanomaterials have more active sites, larger area in contact with electrolyte, and good electrical conductivity. These advantages make Co2HCFe exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as the electrode material of supercapacitor. At the current density of 0.5 A g−1, the specific capacitance of Co2HCFe even reaches 2526 F g−1 under alkaline conditions, while remaining a capacity retention rate of 90.25% after 2000 cycles.
