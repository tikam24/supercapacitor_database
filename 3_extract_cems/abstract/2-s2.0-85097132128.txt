In the process of charging, the supercapacitor cell balancing mechanism should be introduced to avoid the overcharging. However, the current balancing methods will cause voltage drop effect due to inter resistance. In order to solve this challenge, this paper proposes a cooperative balance strategy for charging supercapacitor with the generalized extend state observer. Firstly, a model is constructed to incorporate the switched resistor circuit and cyber communication interactions. Then the observer is used to estimate the voltage of the equivalent capacitor of each cell, and the generalized extend state observer based on the consensus theory is used to balance the supercapacitor which can realize the robustness of the system to disturbance. An experimental test platform constructed verifies the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative balancing strategy method.
