Nickel hydroxide was prepared by electrodeposition in Ni(NO3)2 aqueous solution for the electrode materials of supercapacitors. The structure and morphology of products were characterized using X- ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), respectively. The experimental results of XRD show that the products are typical α-phase nickel hydroxide. The FESEM results reveal that the α-Ni(OH)2 displays particle-like morphology with a loosely packed structure. The component and thermal stability of the products are respectively measured by FT-IR, thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA). The electrochemical performances are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge technique in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The results show that the α-Ni(OH)2 with particle-like morphology has excellent electrochemical performances and its specific capacitance value as single electrode is up to 2595 F g-1. Furthermore, the effect of deposition conditions such as deposition potential and concentration of Ni (NO3)2 solution on the electrochemical capacitance of the deposited Ni(OH)2 films is discussed in detail. © 2009 by ESG.
