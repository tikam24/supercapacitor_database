Bergman cyclization, an organic reaction that forms 1,4-benzene diradicals via intramolecular cyclization of enediyne (EDY) compounds, is a fascinating reaction and can be used to fabricate polyarylenes with various side chains and construct carbon nanomaterials with diverse morphologies. Bergman cyclization has had a strong impact on a number of fields, including pharmaceutics, polymer chemistry, and materials science. The homopolymerization of EDYs through Bergman cyclization is an ingenious strategy for fabrication of functional polyarylenes and has the advantages of facial operation, high efficiency, tailored structure, and being catalyst-free. Moreover, the obtained functionalized polyarylenes show many remarkable properties, such as excellent thermal stability, good solubility, and processability, which enable these polyarylenes to be further manufactured into carbon nanomaterials. Recently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the application of Bergman cyclization in polymer chemistry, materials science, and nanodevices. This chapter summarizes the synthetic strategies that have been developed for fabrication of structurally unique carbon-rich materials using Bergman cyclization, including formation of nanoparticles by intramolecular collapse of single polymer chains, fabrication of conjugated microporous polymers, and construction of carbon nanomembranes with different morphologies and their applications in nanodevices. The future development of Bergman cyclization in materials science is discussed, especially in the construction and application of carbon nanomaterials by altering the template types and morphologies to precisely control the microstructures and properties of carbon nanomaterials.
