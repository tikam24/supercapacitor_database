Electrospinning and calcination technique have been combined to fabricate N-doped carbon nanofibers(N-CNFs) by introducing amino grafted few-layered hexagonal boron nitride (amino@BN) into polyacrylonitrile(PAN) matrix as filler followed by carbonization. For the high N-doping level(10.7%, atomic fraction) with the final product, the as-prepared N-CNFs exhibit interesting surface wettability(superamphiphilicity in air and underwater oleophilicity). Moreover, compared with pristine PAN derived carbon nanofibers(marked as CNFs), N-CNFs exhibit higher graphic structure under fixed carbonizing temperature as well. Taking these advantages aforementioned, the as-prepared N-CNFs exhibit good specific capacitance(ca. 200.1 F/g) without activation treatment at the current density of 0.5 A/g in three-electrode configuration, which is about 149% that of CNFs(ca. 134 F/g). What’s more, our N-CNFs also display the unexpected capacity to demulsify diverse surfactant free oil-in-water emulsions by simple filtration in large scale with the high water flux ca.(23578±150) L·m−2·h−1
