Abstract: To obtain the highest performance of supercapacitive properties, it is necessary to discover an appropriate pair of electrode material and electrolyte. Supercapacitors have many applications in the industry over batteries, and our result shows the advantages of low-cost polyaniline (PANI) electrode material in supercapacitors. In the present work, the polyaniline nanofibers (PANINFs) thin films can be directly used as an electrode for supercapacitor. PANINFs electrode showed maximum specific capacitance of 633 F/g which exhibited at 5 mV/s scan rate, the specific energy density of 45.67 Wh/kg, the power density of 500 W/kg and the coulomb efficiency of 85.59% at 0.5 mA/cm2 current density with 0.32 Ω equivalent series resistance (ESR) value. The capacitance value is obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of 20.33 mF/cm2 with the relaxation time of 0.14 s. Nanofibrous network (50–60 nm diameter) confirmed hydrophilic nature by wettability test. From the supercapacitive performance of PANINFs thin films conclude that they are promising for energy storage application. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
