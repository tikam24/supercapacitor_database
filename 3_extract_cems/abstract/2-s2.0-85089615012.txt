A mixture of water suspensions of graphene oxide (GO) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was used to make the films GO-PTFE (50:50). They became conductive (2.0-2.8 S/cm) while maintaining flexibility after reduction with hydrazine and subsequent annealing at 370 Â°C. The structure and morphology of the reduced films (rGO-PTFE) are examined in detail by means of a number of techniques such as scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman, and contact angle wetting. The results of the films tested as current collectors in a metal-free supercapacitor with electrodes from microwave exfoliated GO and an acid (1 M H2SO4) electrolyte are presented.
