This paper presents an innovative solution for electric power system (EPS) based on supercapacitors, developed for nanosatellites. Considering 3 different configurations of possible redundant systems for EPS, using Li-Ion supercapacitors, with their advantages and faults, it has been chosen the best one which allowed further testing of a nanosatellite model in light and in dark conditions. Testing and analyzing the EPS, it was possible to select the appropriate conversion circuit in order to get the best efficiency. We have proved that there are handy solutions for supercapacitor based EPS as primary source for electrical power system storage.
