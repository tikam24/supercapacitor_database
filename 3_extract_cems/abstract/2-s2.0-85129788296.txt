Nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials with planar holes not only inherit the structure advantages of porous carbon materials, but also have a unique planar porosity and heteroatomic doping feature, showing enormous interest in the field of energy storage and conversion. Nevertheless, rational and controllable design of honeycomb-like porous carbon materials with rich planar holes remains a tremendous challenge. Herein, we develop a “bottom-up” self-assembly of carbon- and nitrogen-rich conjugated polymer and subsequent potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) facilitated activation, catalysis and self-generated template assisted carbonization strategy to construct nitrogen self-doped honeycomb-like porous carbon nanoframework (NHPC) with rich planar holes. By exploiting the advantages of the integral and interconnected honeycomb-like carbon skeleton and rich planar holes (rapid ion/electron diffusion) and the efficient nitrogen doping (improved wettability), the NHPC possesses high specific capacitance of 288 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and outstanding rate performance. In addition, an aqueous symmetric supercapacitor fabricated from NHPC electrodes possesses widened potential window of 2.0 V, high energy density of 23.6 Wh kg−1 at 500 W kg−1, as well as excellent electrochemical stability (91.2 % capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles).
