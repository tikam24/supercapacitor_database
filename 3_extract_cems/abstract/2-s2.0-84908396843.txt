An aqueous, high potential asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is developed using cobalt manganite (CoMn2O4) modified graphene nanoribbon (GNR). Combining CoMn2O4/GNR and GNR as different electrodes of supercapacitor in Na2SO4 electrolyte, the ASC device exhibited 1.9 V wide potential window for charge storage along with significantly improved capacitive performance than symmetric counterpart. When cycled reversibly in 0-1.9 V, the ASC demonstrates high energy density 84.69 Wh Kg-1 (more than four times of the symmetric cell) at high power density 22 kW Kg-1 due to elegant synergism between different electrodes. Additionally, it exhibits long term stable cycling performance with 96% capacitance retention and âˆ¼ 97.5% columbic efficiency. These outstanding results pave their way for promising applications in high energy storage systems.
