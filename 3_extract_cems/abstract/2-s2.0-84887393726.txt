This study deals with the dynamic and thermal behaviors of supercapacitors. Characterization is performed using the Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) method to determine by experiment the supercapacitor's series resistance (ESR) and capacitance according to the frequency. The study deals also the particular case of the supercapacitor's spectra and the thermal shock. Finally, life test at constant temperature and the impact of the vibration on the supercapacitor's parameters are illustrated. Â© 2013 IEEE.
