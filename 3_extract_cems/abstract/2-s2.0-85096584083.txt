Cubic FeCo2O4 (FCO) is synthesized by quick and easy urea combustion technique. Transmission electron microscopy reveals the interconnected nearly spherical particle morphology. The transport properties of FCO confirm that FCO exhibits high conductivity i.e. 1.27 Ã— 10-8 Scm-1 and this reasonable transport mechanism of FCO is owing to its distinctive morphology and intact grain boundaries in micro particles that might be served as smooth conducting pathways for easy ionic diffusion throughout the spinel oxides and hence improved ionic conductivity is obtained. Further, FCO powder is used to fabricate the supercapacitor electrodes to investigate the electrochemical behavior using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanic charge discharge (GCD) at various scan rate and current density, respectively. As a result, FCO exhibits excellent cycling stability retention (92% up to 1000 cycles) as well as structural and morphological integrity which was further complemented by ex-situ XRD and FESEM studies.
