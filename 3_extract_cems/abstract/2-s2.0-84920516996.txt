Mesoporous carbon (MPC) with highly textured, reproducible and uniform structure is prepared by silica-sol template assisted method, as new carbonaceous supercapacitor materials with high energy density. High resolution transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the MPC consisted of textured structure of carbon on the sheets like domains and exhibited a specific surface area of 1412 m2 g-1. The symmetric supercapacitor of MPC exhibits an excellent cyclability over 5000 cycles and high energy density of 84.6 Wh kg-1, with a cell potential of 1.6 V and a large specific capacitance of 238 F g-1 in neutral electrolyte. The enhanced performance of the carbon material as a supercapacitor electrode is due to the synergetic effect possibly contributed from the fast ion transportation during fast charge/discharge and better utilization of carbon.
