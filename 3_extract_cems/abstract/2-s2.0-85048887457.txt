Simultaneously enhancing the flexibility and electrochemical performances is of great significance for flexible supercapacitors. Herein, we designed a special structural electrode, in which the optimal loading mass of MoO2 (9.1 mg cm−2) was grown on carbon fibers using a facile solvothermal method, and then filtrating RGO suspension, MoO2 coated carbon fibers were covered and interconnected by RGO film. The wrapping RGO formed a conductive network to supply more pathways for accelerating fast electron transfer, and what's more, it could prevent MoO2 peeling from carbon fibers and alleviate electrode structure's destruction in folding process. Consequently, RGO assisted MoO2 textile electrode exhibited ultrahigh areal capacitance (8132 mF cm-2 at 2 mV s−1), outstanding cycle stability (95% capacitance retention after 30000 times charge/discharge cycles at 120 mA cm−2) and enhanced flexible properties (90%, 85% and 77% capacitance retention after 2000, 4000 and 6000 times folding in different directions, respectively). These merits make our RGO/MoO2/carbon textile promising candidates for flexible supercapacitor electrodes. Besides, the approach of introducing wrapping RGO into textile electrode is believed to provide a new thought for producing superior performance flexible energy storage devices.
