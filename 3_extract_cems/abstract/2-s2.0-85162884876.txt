Supercapacitor is able to provide fast charging rate, environmentally friendly and relatively abundant material availability. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has a high potential to use as a supercapacitor electrode material because of its significant advantages compared to other metal oxides such as high specific capacitance due to the reversible redox reaction and affordable prices. Briefly, the experiment begins with the preparation of a composite solution with a variety of compositions that was deposited on the aluminum foil substrate as electrodes using the doctor blade method. The supercapacitor was packed in a coin cell with 1 M Et4NBF4. The symmetric supercapacitor cycled in the cell potential window of 0-2 V, exhibited excellent specific capacitance of 52.87 F g-1, with power density of 344.94 Wh kg-1 and maximum energy density of 21.84 Wh kg-1 with 82.23 % capacity retention for 100 cycles.
