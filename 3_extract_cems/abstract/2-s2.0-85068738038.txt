A lead-carbon battery, which possesses simultaneously advantages of lead-acid battery and supercapacitor, can be obtained by adding a certain amount of carbon into the lead-acid battery. So, it is particularly critical to create a new type of carbon with ideal specific capacitance and stability in acid solutions. We tried to synthesize such a new carbon material namely C-ZIF-8@AC via a two step process i.e. low temperature liquid phase method and high temperature calcination. The materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) etc. The results show that the prepared C-ZIF-8@AC composed of carbon particles with polyhedral structure (ZIF-8 framework) grown uniformly on the surface of active carbon (AC) particles; After ZIF-8 has further been coupled with AC particles, the size of the formed C-ZIF-8 particles is reduced. Electrochemical results indicate that the elemental N in pyridine nitrogen and pyrropyrrole nitrogen of the C-ZIF-8 framework can enhance the specific capacitance of C-ZIF-8@AC, which is about 181 F/g, much higher than that of the simple AC. The C-ZIF-8@AC shows excellent cycling stability with 99% capacitance retention rate after 6000 cycles at the current density of 5 A/g, which is higher than that of the simple AC.
