Battery-type electrode materials have attracted much attention as efficient and unique types of materials for hybrid battery supercapacitors due to their multiple redox states and excellent electrical conductivity. Designing composites with high chemical and electrochemical stabilities is beneficial for improving the energy storage capability of battery-type electrode materials. We report on an interfacial engineering strategy to improve the energy storage performance of a Co(OH)2-based battery-type material by constructing polypyrrole-assisted and Ag-doped (Ag-doped@Co(OH)2@polypyrrole) nanosheets (NSs) on a Ni foam using a hydrothermal process that provides richer electroactive sites, efficient charge transportation, and an excellent mechanical stability. Physical characterization results revealed that the subsequent decoration of Ag nanoparticles on Co(OH)2 nanoparticles offered an efficient electrical conductivity as well as a reduced interface adsorption energy of OH- in Co(OH)2 nanoparticles as compared to Co(OH)2@polypyrrole-assisted nanoparticles without Ag particles. The heterogeneous interface of the Ag-doped@Co(OH)2@polypyrrole composite exhibited a high specific capacity of 291.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, and showed a good cycling stability after 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. The specific capacity of the doped electrode was enhanced approximately two-fold compared to that of the pure electrode. Thus, the fabricated Ag-doped@Co(OH)2@polypyrrole nanostructured electrodes can be a potential candidate for fabricating low-cost and high-performance energy storage supercapacitor devices.
