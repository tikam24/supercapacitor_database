Electric vehicle is the innovation of the future. Reduction of pollution along with decreasing the fossil fuel consumption aids the need for its popularization. Energy storage is an integral part of electric vehicle technology. However the size of battery, frequent charging, adverse atmospheric conditions etc. poses hindrance for the popularization of the technology. The project aims to aid the developing field of electric vehicles by suggesting an alternate way of power transfer to electric vehicles. The proposed system works on the principle of wireless magnetic resonance coupling. The system will have specially designed roads with energized winding buried beneath. The secondary windings will be on the vehicle which will link the maximum possible flux, effectively for a seamless and stable power transfer. An ultracapacitor is used in the secondary circuit which drives the motors. The paper proposes a dynamic charging system suitable for wide range of applications. The result shows that the use of ultracapacitor in wireless charging system can support fast charging and discharging need of electric vehicles. This will help in the stable and commercial use of electric vehicles so as to help the reduction of fossil fuels in transportation systems.
