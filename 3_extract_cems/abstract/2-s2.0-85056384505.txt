Herein, the simple electrolysis synthesis route to produce Î±-MnO2 is reported. The phase and crystal structure were evaluated by means of X-ray diffraction data collection and analysis. The morphological microstructure of as-prepared samples were captured by scanning electron microscope. The diameter distribution was studied by particle size analyzer. The electrochemical performance was systematically investigated by means of cyclic voltametry test. The produced MnO2 was also prepared to form composite with carbon. The results revealed that the MnO2/C composites perform outstanding characteristics mainly in terms of their maximum specific capacitance of 922.67 mF/g, with maximum power density of 90.150 W/kg, and maximum energy density of 0.063 Wh/kg. Therefore, the MnO2/C composite meets the criteria of the prospective applicability for supercapacitor.
