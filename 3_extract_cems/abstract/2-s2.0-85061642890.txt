Graphene has great potential for application in capacitive energy storage devices. In this study, we have investigated the effects of employing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) either as an additional supplement or as a total replacement of carbon black, the current conductive additive used in commercial carbon/carbon supercapacitors. We also examined the impact of incorporating rGO before and during the slurry preparation. Some electrochemical and morphological studies were conducted to compare the rGO and carbon black in performance enhancement for conventional activated carbon-based electrodes. Our results have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating graphene into the current carbon/carbon supercapacitors.
