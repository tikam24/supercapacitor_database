The whole world is focusing their attention and efforts on the creation of alternative energy sources in the present because the amount of energy produced by fossil fuels is rapidly decreasing. This is due to the rapidly decreasing availability of fossil fuels. One of the alternative energy sources with the most potential is referred to as 'renewable energy.' Vehicles use more than 25 percent of the energy generated from fossil fuels for their own needs. As a direct result of the depletion of fossil fuels, the costs associated with maintaining a vehicle have skyrocketed and are now at an all-time high. Apart from this, excessive use of fossil fuels is also polluting the environment around the area to a great extent. As a potential solution to this issue, people from all over the world are currently showing a significant amount of interest in electric vehicles. Most electric vehicles are equipped with BLDC motors. A BLDC motor, in its most basic form, is characterised by its compact dimensions, high speed, high efficiency, noiseless operation, and high dynamic response. However, when the BLDC motor is operated at a variable speed, some noise or ripple is produced within it, and at the same time, it is unable to function in a smooth manner. A hybrid control technique has been proposed in this paper for controlling the BLDC motor speed in electric vehicle applications. Using hybrid fuzzy-PI based speed control techniques, we can control the BLDC motor's speed without affecting its performance, as well as reduce its noise and ripple. This method is also improving the overall performance and efficiency of BLDC motors in electric vehicle applications. For charging the EV battery, we used solar energy, batteries, and a supercapacitor-based DC microgrid with grid-connected infrastructure to improve the overall reliability of the systems.
