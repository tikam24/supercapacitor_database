Despite the significant advances in solid polymer electrolytes used for supercapacitors, intractable problems including poor ionic conductivity and low electrochemical performance limit the practical applications. Herein, we report a facile approach to synthesize a NaCl-agarose gel electrolyte for use in flexible supercapacitors. The as-prepared agarose hydrogel consists of a three-dimensional chemically interconnected agarose backbone and oriented interparticular submicropores filled with water. The interconnected agarose matrix acts as a framework that provides mechanical stability to the gel electrolyte and hierarchical porous networks for optimized ion transport. The developed pores with the water filler provide an efficient ionic pathway to the storage sites of electrode. With these properties, the gel electrolyte enables the supercapacitor to have a high specific capacitance of 286.9 F g-1 and a high rate capability that is 80% of specific capacitance obtained in the case of a liquid electrolyte at 100 mV s-1. In addition, attributed to the simple procedure and its components, the gel electrolyte is highly scalable, cost-effective, safe, and nontoxic. Thus, the developed gel electrolyte has the potential for use in various energy storage and delivery systems.
