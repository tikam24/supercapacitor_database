Commercially available wearable energy storage devices need a wire-type electrode with high strength, conductivity and electrochemical performance, as well as stable structure under deformation. Herein, we report a novel wire-type electrode of hierarchically structure MnO2 on Ni wire with multilayer graphene (MGr) as a buffer layer to enhance the electrical conductivity of the MnO2 and interface contact between the MnO2 and Ni wire. Thus, the wire-type MnO2/MGr/Ni electrode has a stable and high quality interface. The wire-type supercapacitor (WSC) based on wire-type MnO2/MGr/Ni electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance, high rate capability, extraordinary flexibility, and superior cycle lifetime. Length (area, volumetric) specific capacitance of the WSC reaches 6.9 mF cm−1 (73.2 mF cm−2, 9.8 F cm−3). Maximum length (volumetric) energy density of the WSC based on MnO2/MGr/Ni reaches 0.62 μWh cm−1 (0.88 mWh cm−3). Furthermore, the WSC has a short time constant (0.5–400 ms) and exhibits minimal change in capacitance under different bending shapes.
