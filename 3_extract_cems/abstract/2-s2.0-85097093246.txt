High-performance porous carbon is an essential electrode materials for high-specific energy supercapacitors because it has a high specific surface area on the electrode surface and stores charge through electrolyte-ion adsorption. In this article, N, S co-doped porous carbon was successfully prepared through carbonization and activation of partial poly (2, 2′-dithiodianiline) (PDTDA). The N, S co-doped porous carbon material was used to prepare the electrode for supercapacitor. The three-electrode system was used to test its electrochemical performance. The results show that the suitable carbonization temperature was 600 °C (ASNC-600–800), which showed excellent capacitance performance. The specific capacitance of ASNC-600–800 is 500.10 F/g at 1 A/g. In addition, N, S co-doped porous carbon possess the specific energy of 21.15 Wh/kg at specific power of 450 W/kg. A new path has been opened for the preparation of low cost and high-performance porous carbon electrode materials.
