The high efficiency development of electrode materials has always been the pursuit of scientific research and industrial applications. In this work, a low-cost and scalable monolithic electrode electrochemical synthesis technology is proposed. A certain concentration of cobalt nitrate was used to pretreat the nickel foam (NF), and then a voltage was applied to the pretreated NF in an alkaline environment to electrochemically synthesize double transition metal hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) on the NF. The prepared NiCo-LDH@NF electrode can be used directly as an electrode without any other treatment. NiCo-LDH@NF electrode exhibits high single-electrode performance with a specific capacity of 10.04 C cm−2 (2512 F g−1) at 2 mA cm−2. In addition, NiCo-LDH@NF was adopted as the positive electrode and commercial activated carbon (AC) was adopted as the negative electrode to further assemble the all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor (ASF). The NiCo-LDH@NF//AC ASF device can provides an energy density of 56.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 937.3 W kg−1. In addition, the electrochemical performance of ASF device is virtually unchanged after 90° and 180° bending, with the capacity retention rate of 97.1 % and coulomb efficiency of 100 % after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. These excellent properties provide great feasibility for future commercial applications of NiCo-LDH@NF electrodes.
