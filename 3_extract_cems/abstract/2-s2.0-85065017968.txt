Biomass-derived carbon has been extensively studied as carbon electrode materials for supercapacitor thanks to its environmental friendliness and wide range of sources as well as natural hierarchical structure. Hierarchical porous structure with interconnected and multi-scale porous structure can facilitate capacitive performance and rate capability of supercapacitor. Scores of research works focused on synthesizing biomass-derived hierarchical porous carbon via selecting different kinds of biomass precursors and exploring various synthesizing methods, related research works have promoted the capacitive performance of biomass-derived supercapacitor carbon electrodes to a new benchmark valued as about 300F/g (1A/g) from about 200F/g (1A/g). This review summerizes most advanced research progress in regard to synthesis of biomass-derived supercapacitor carbon electrode materials with hierarchical porous structure. Benefits of biomass precursors on structure construction are discussed, followed by retrospects and discussion of advanced and common synthesizing methods, and environmentally friendly pore-generation methods especially novel low-toxicity and low-corrosion porogens are highlighted and discussed.
