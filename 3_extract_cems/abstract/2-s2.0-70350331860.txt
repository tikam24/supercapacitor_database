Hollow carbon micro/nanospheres exhibit excellent properties such as low density, high specific surface area, high damping characteristic, good thermal and chemical stability and available hollow interior, which make them highly appropriate systems to be used in lithium-ion battery, catalysis, supercapacitor, hydrogen storage, superconductor and high damping composite, etc. The synthesis methods for hollow carbon micro/nanospheres such as template, solution phase and gas phase method are detailedly introduced and the characters of these methods are also summarized. The recent application researches of hollow carbon micro/nanospheres, including energy storage, catalyst support, electrochemical hydrogen storage, dopant for MgB2 superconductor and damping material, are systematically reviewed.
