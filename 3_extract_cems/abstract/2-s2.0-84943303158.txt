Batteries have become fundamental building blocks for the mobility of modern society. Continuous development of novel battery chemistries and electrode materials has nourished progress in building better batteries. Simultaneously, novel device form factors and designs with multi-functional components have been proposed, requiring batteries to not only integrate seamlessly to these devices, but to also be a multi-functional component for a multitude of applications. Thus, in the past decade, along with developments in the component materials, the focus has been shifting more and more towards novel fabrication processes, unconventional configurations, and additional functionalities. This work attempts to critically review the developments with respect to emerging electrochemical energy storage configurations, including, amongst others, paintable, transparent, flexible, wire or cable shaped, ultra-thin and ultra-thick configurations, as well as hybrid energy storage-conversion, or graphene-incorporated batteries and supercapacitors. The performance requirements are elaborated together with the advantages, but also the limitations, with respect to established electrochemical energy storage technologies. Finally, challenges in developing novel materials with tailored properties that would allow such configurations, and in designing easier manufacturing techniques that can be widely adopted are considered.
