The current effort discuss the fabrication of improve electrode materials for supercapacitor comprise of surfactant doped polypyrrole‑carbon materials composites integrated with graphene, amine functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes and hybrid carbon assembly. The spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate the establishment of a well-built state of charge swap complex among surfactant doped polypyrrole and carbon materials that disclose the occurrence of polymer‑carbon phases and promote well-built polarization. The electrodes are assembled in the three electrode cell configuration with graphite sheet current collector. The composite SDBSDPPy-HC holds a specific capacitance of 1086 F g−1 at scan rate 5 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. SDBSDPPy-HC exhibit only 10% losses in specific capacitance over 2500 cycles i.e. 90% preservation of specific capacitance at a current density 1 A g−1.
