Several carbon materials were produced by reacting aluminum carbide with chlorine gas at different temperatures (400-900 °C). Chlorination temperature and porosity values showed the inversely related trends whereby the graphitization degree rises with the chlorination temperature. Electrochemical measurements performed in three-electrode test cells with 1.0-M Et3MeNBF4 electrolyte revealed that the changes in porosity parameters and the degree of graphitization are in good correlation with specific capacitance values. Capacitance depends on the structure of carbon and varies in studied chlorination range from 109 to 60 F g-1 and from 114 to 64 F g-1 for the negatively and positively charged electrode materials, respectively. An exceptionally low capacitance was observed for the material produced at 700 °C that was explained by the multiwall carbon nanobarrels and the highly ordered curved graphitic flakes, which have low specific surface and possess the relatively low specific surface-related capacitance. © Springer-Verlag 2008.
