Supercapacitor is a new type of energy-storage device, and has been attracted widely attentions. As a two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, graphene is considered to be a promising material of supercapacitor because of its excellent properties involving high electrical conductivity and large surface area. In this paper, the large-scale graphene is successfully fabricated via environmental-friendly electrochemical exfoliation of graphite, and then, the three dimensional (3D) graphene foam is prepared by using nickel foam as template and FeCl3/HCl solution as etchant. Compared with the regular 2D graphene paper, the 3D graphene foam electrode shows better electrochemical performance, and exhibits the largest specific capacitance of approximately 128 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte. It is expected that the 3D graphene foam will have a potential application in the supercapacitors.
