In order to improve the capacitance of electric double layer capacitor with organic electrolytes, the effect of conductive material, the content of adhesives and pressure to the capacitance of supercapacitor are researched. Through the impedance spectra simulated with equivalent circuit, the relation of the content of conductive material and adhesives with the parameters is researched. The parameters include the resistance of electrode, polarization resistance, diffusion resistance, electric double layer capacitor, limiting capacitance and so on. The optimal content of conductive material and adhesives is defined. After being optimized, the working voltage, capacitance, cycle life and leak current are tested by CV and constant current charge/discharge. The working voltage of the supercapacitor in organic electrolyte has reached to 3 V. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is obtained as high as 31.78 F/g. The capacity attenuates by 1.26% after 5000 cycles.
