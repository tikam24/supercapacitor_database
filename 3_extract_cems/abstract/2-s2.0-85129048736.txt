This chapter is dedicated to the electrolyte that is a crucial component of any device. Electrolyte plays a dual role in the device, acts as a carpet for electrolyte ions, and also separates the electrodes to avoid short-circuiting or explosion. Initially, the characteristics parameter and selection criteria for the electrolyte will be discussed. Then, the organic electrolytes have been discussed followed by a focus on emerging novel gel/solid polymer electrolytes for application in battery and supercapacitor. The performance of the battery and supercapacitor is shown for different electrolytes.
