The development of highly sensitive, selective, and low-cost chemical sensors that can detect trace amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is essential for environmental sustainability and human health monitoring. Here, a layer-by-layer technique for selective deposition and aligned placement of nanoparticles dependent upon 3D printing-enabled surface patterns is demonstrated. A reasonable deposition density and the preferential alignment of nanoparticles, here carbon nanofibers (CNFs), produced a high-performance chemosensor that can detect low concentrations of VOCs in gas and liquid forms. The highly enhanced sensitivity and selectivity were attributed to efficient electron transport and inter- and intra-nanofiber hopping. This research sheds light on a method to develop rapidly prototyped chemosensors, which are desired for applications in nanocomposite reinforcement, design of supercapacitor and battery devices, thermal dissipation management, surface tension control, and drug delivery systems.
