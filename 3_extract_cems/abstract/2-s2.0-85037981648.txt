As an important binary IV-VI semiconductor compound, tin selenide (SnSe) has been investigated intensively for a wide range of applications in energy storage and photovoltaic devices, due to its unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. In this work, we successfully synthesized SnSe powders by a simple, rapid and high-yield method called microwave-assisted synthesis for the first time and also measured their electrochemical performances. By rationally controlling the microwave heating time, we found that the 15-min reacted sample exhibited the most outstanding specific capacitance and rate capability (214.3 F/g at 1 A/g and 182.8 F/g at 20 A/g), and excellent cycling stability. The microwave-assisted synthesis method is efficient and rapid for preparing SnSe electrode materials.
