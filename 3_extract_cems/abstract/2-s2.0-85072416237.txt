INTRODUCTION During the starting process of an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), the engine is first motored by an external cranking device to an engine speed from which it can successfully commence combusting. During this motored phase the cranking device needs to overcome friction, pumping and auxiliary torques, but also get the engine through its compressions. The cranking device commonly used nowadays is the startermotor, which is connected to the flywheel. In future vehicle applications however this startermotor can be replaced by an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG). The cost of an ISG with its inverter, control electronics and (larger) battery is higher than the cost of a conventional startermotor and it is therefore necessary that a well balanced design is made of the necessary power and torque capability of the ISG. This paper discusses detailed dynamic simulation models that can be used for describing the engine cranking process. These models include (i) a battery, (ii) a supercapacitor, (iii) a belt-driven ISG and (iv) an ICE. With help of these models the cranking phase of the engine is simulated. A method for reducing the required external motoring torque is described. The solution is found in (i) using an initial crank angle and (ii) adding an additional inertia to the crankshaft. It is shown that these two design variables have direct effect on the cranking process. Copyright Â© 2004 SAE International.
