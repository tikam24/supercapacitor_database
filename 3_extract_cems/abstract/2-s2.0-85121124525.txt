In this study, potassium hydroxide (KOH) was used as activator to prepare lignocellulose-based carbon materials with different structures via two different processing methods. One was first pre-carbonization and then activation, and the other was first activation and then carbonization. The porous carbon material synthesized by the former method was rich in defects and the specific surface area reached 1737 m2/g. Due to its special structure-activity relationship, the obtained porous carbon material as a supercapacitor electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a specific capacity of 194 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g.
