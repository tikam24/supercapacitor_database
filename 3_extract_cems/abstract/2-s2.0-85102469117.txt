We demonstrate a transparent stretchable supercapacitor based on a nanocomposite electrode consisting of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) modified with ethylene glycol. The addition of ethylene glycol (EG) in the PEDOT:PSS solution can dramatically enhance the conductivity of the polymer film. Furthermore, the solvent treatment induces the reorganization of the polymer chains, leading to better distribution of PEDOT:PSS on the AgNW network. With the EG-enhanced AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS electrode, an 87% transmittance of the nanocomposite electrode can be achieved at a wavelength of 550 nm and a pseudo capacitance of 113 ± 18 F/g (areal capacitance = 2.83 ± 0.46 mF cm-2) can be achieved at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. When it was stretched with a tensile strain of 40%, the capacitance of the transparent supercapacitor even increased, owing to closer electrode contact. This work provides a facile way to produce highly transparent and stretchable electrodes using EG-enhanced nanocomposite for a stretchable portable power source of transparent electronics.
