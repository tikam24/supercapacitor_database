The STATCOM based on voltage source converter is used for voltage regulation in transmission and distribution systems. In this paper, the integration and control of energy storage systems such as supercapacitor into a Distribution system STATCOM (D-STATCOM) with voltage controller is developed to enhance power quality and improve distribution system reliability. This paper develops the control concepts to charge/discharge the supercapacitor by the D-STATCOM, and validates the performance for an integrated D-STATCOM/ supercapacitor system for improving distribution system performance. The potential performance improvements are verified by simulation results for rapidly varying arc-furnace loads for voltage flicker mitigation, by supplying fluctuating real power by the D-STATCOM/supercapacitor system.
