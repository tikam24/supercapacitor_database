Nanoarray electrodes with highly capacitive materials and specific architectures are hopeful to realize advanced supercapacitor performance. The nickel foam (NF) supported hierarchical nanosheet array electrode is fabricated through a template route toward excellent capacitive supercapacitor. The hierarchical nanosheet array weaved with Ni(OH) 2 -MnO 2 nanowires provides multiple advantages for porous feature, high surface area, and fast charge transfer. The neighbored Ni(OH) 2 -MnO 2 supplies lattice fringes distortion as additional active sites as well as synergism, for improved capacitive performances. As expected, the Ni(OH) 2 -MnO 2 /NF electrode manifests high specific capacitance of 14.7 F cm −2 at 2.5 mA cm −2 and good cyclic stability, making it hopeful for highly capacitive supercapacitor application.
