In today's sophisticated world, the need for electric energy is increasing every day. Therefore, it is essential to manufacture electrode materials to store electric energy. Nickel, bismuth, and cobalt vanadium oxides are considered a member of a group of the best anodes in energy storage applications. In this study, three kinds of anode materials were analyzed for their better electrochemical behavior. Hydrothermal method was preferred for all the synthesis processes. The basic characterization studies such as X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence, Raman, and Fourier transform infrared confirmed the presence of nickel, bismuth, and cobalt vanadium oxides. The highest specific capacitance value of 426.11 F/g in cyclic voltammetry and 285.65 F/g in galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) measurements was obtained for the cobalt vanadium oxide samples. Furthermore, stability test in GCD showed its 83.64% capacitive retention over 5000 cycles at a high (5 mA/g) current density.
