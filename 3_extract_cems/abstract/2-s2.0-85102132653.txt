We report a novel Ni3S2 carbon coated (denoted as NCC) rod-like structure prepared by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method and employ it as a binder free electrode in supercapacitor. We coated carbon with glucose as carbon source on the surface of samples and investigated the suitable glucose concentration. The as-obtained NCC rod-like structure demonstrated great performance with a huge specific capacity of 657 C g−1 at 1 A g−1, preeminent rate capability of 87.7% retention, the current density varying to 10 A g−1, and great cycling stability of 76.7% of its original value through 3500 cycles, which is superior to the properties of bare Ni3S2. The result presents a facile, general, viable strategy to constructing a high-performance material for the supercapacitor applications.
