Recently, increased emissions regulations and a push for less dependence on fossil fuels are factors that have enticed a growth in the market share of alternative energy vehicles. Readily available energy storage systems (ESSs) pose a challenge for the mass market penetration of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in HEVs, and EVs. This is mainly due to the high cost of ESS available today. However, tremendous research efforts are going into reducing the cost of these storage devices, increasing their lifespan, and improving their energy density. This paper aims to give an overview of the current state of readily available battery and ultracapacitor (UC) technologies as well as a look ahead toward promising advanced battery chemistries and next generation ESS. Energy management systems and various battery balancing configurations are discussed in addition to battery state/parameter estimation and protection mechanisms. Finally, hybrid ESSs (HESS) are reviewed as a mitigation strategy to the shortcomings of traditional battery and UC technologies. Consideration is given to the combination of advanced battery chemistries with UCs to portray HESS performance, which can meet and exceed the performance of current ESS technologies.
