In this work, a hybrid nanocomposite based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), polyindole (PIn) and reduced graphene oxides (RGO) was firstly fabricated and the optimal feed ratio of this composite was investigated. The morphology and structure of CNTs/PIn/RGO composite were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The electrocapacitive performances of this ternary electrode composite were researched by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). And the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the samples were investigated by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms. The prepared composite shows high dispersibility, high specific capacitance and excellent stability. Specifically, the CNTs/PIn/RGO composite exhibits a large specific capacitance of 383 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and outstanding cycling stability of 88.79% capacitive retention after 3000 cycles at 10 A g −1 . It was anticipated that CNTs/PIn/RGO12 composite could be a practical and valuable material for the application of supercapacitors.
