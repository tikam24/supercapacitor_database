Ternary bi-metallic borides have been prepared by administrating two different solvent media utilized through co-precipitation process with particles dimension ranging from 3 to 5 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy suggests the presence of redox states in the cobalt-nickel based bi-metallic borides that promotes excess electroactive sites. The outstanding stability of bimetallic borides has been estimated by measuring relaxation time (T2) in solvent medium. The surface area has been evaluated about 151.302 m2 g−1with associated pore diameter of 6.57 nm. Moreover, the ternary bi-metallic electrode exhibited excellent pseudocapacitance with exceptional specific capacitance (SC) of 4835 Fg−1 (606 mAh g−1) at 5 Ag−1 by upholding cycling retention of ∼94.2% over 15,000 cycles. Also, different concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) electrolyte (0.5, 1.0 & 1.5 M) are employed for comparative study to achieve optimal electrochemical performance. Simultaneously, an electrode configuration is designed with cobalt-nickel-boron (Co-Ni-B) 1:1:0.15 as positive and carbon black as negative electrodes to fabricate asymmetric device. The device illuminates a commercial light emitted diode (LED, ∼1.8 V) to justify the electrode performance and their full-scale deployment with a device efficiency ∼363 Fg−1 (358 mAh g−1) and an energy density of 114 Wh kg−1.
