Silver nanowire@cadmium sulfide (AgNW@CdS) core-shell nanostructured electrodes were synthesized in two steps. Initially, a layer of AgNWs was coated onto Ni foam by drop casting. CdS was then deposited onto the pre-coated Ni foam by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. This process converted the Ag nanowires to Ag2S, which was confirmed by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The effects of the CdS layer thickness on AgNWs on the electrochemical properties of the nanostructure were examined by varying the number of SILAR cycles. The resulting AgNWs@CdS electrode exhibited a high areal capacitance of approximately 2662 mFcm−2 at 10 mVs−1 and 810 mFcm−2 at 45 mA applied current.
