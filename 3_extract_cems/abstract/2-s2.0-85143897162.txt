AC circuit breakers are a mature technology, and are based on an arc chamber coupled with inductive arc absorption circuitry developed using commercial off the shelf components. In developing these, two zero crossings per AC cycle is effectively used, with capacitors, MOVs and other components used at the switch contacts to absorb the inductive energy in the AC circuit loop.Given that a DC circuit loop does not provide current zero crossings, arc extinguishing is not supported. Hence, commercial DC breakers are modified versions of AC breakers, usually the contacts of a 3 phase breaker poles connected in series to share the arc energy, sometimes combined with other transient absorbing components.This paper presents a preliminary results of a new approach for DC circuit breakers based on placing a supercapacitor based energy absorption loop, making use of the high current capability and the significant joule rating of a supercapacitor.
