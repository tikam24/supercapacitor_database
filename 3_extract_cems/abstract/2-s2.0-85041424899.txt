This study investigates three different techniques to mitigate the switching overvoltages (SOVs) in the microgrids. At first, the effectiveness of reactive power compensation devices, such as static var compensator (SVC), is evaluated. After that, the performance of the supercapacitor (SC), as an energy storage device, is studied. Finally, with the addition of the SVC to the SC, the possibility to mitigate SOV by compensating both active and reactive power simultaneously is investigated. SOVs result due to unsymmetrical switching operation during de-energisation (disconnection) procedures. The μG two operational modes; grid connected mode and isolated mode, are considered. A small hydro generation unit and three variable speed, double-fed induction generator-based wind turbines are the main renewable power generation units in the tested microgrid system. Alternative Transient Program is used in this study for simulating the compensation device, the energy storage device and the investigated microgrid. The study shows that through the μG two operational modes, the SC has priority over the other two investigated mitigation methods. Furthermore, using the SC or SC with SVC, the results have more regular voltage waveforms.
