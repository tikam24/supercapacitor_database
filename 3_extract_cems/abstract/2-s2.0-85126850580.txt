In this study, hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods were used to prepare cross-linked polymer-based porous carbonaceous materials designated as activated carbon from polyvinyl alcohol (AC-PVA), activated carbon from polyvinyl alcohol/reduced graphene (AC-PVA/rGO) and activated carbon from polyvinyl alcohol/reduced graphene/polyvinyl pyrrolidone (AC-PVA/rGO/PVP). The structural properties of the as-prepared samples indicated a higher degree amorphicity. The textural analysis revealed high specific surface areas along with high void fractions for the samples. The electrochemical analysis of the cross-linked polymer-based activated carbons conducted as three-electrodes revealed the samples' potential as electrode materials for supercapacitors' applications. Activated carbon from PVA/rGO/PVP exhibited a superior specific capacitance (223 F g−1), a smaller charge transfer resistance (RCT = 1.0 Ω) and equivalent series resistance (ESR = 0.54 Ω) as compared to AC-PVA and AC-PVA/rGO. Remarkably, a fabricated symmetric device based on the AC-PVA/rGO/PVP as electrode and designated as AC-PVA/rGO/PVP//AC-PVA/rGO/PVP, delivered a high specific energy of 19.5 W h kg−1 corresponding to a specific power of 400 W kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Besides, the supercapacitor displayed a stable evolution of capacitance, high coulombic efficiency of 99.8% and good related capacitance retention of 82.3% during a 10,000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles conducted for the device in an extended cell potential of 1.6 V at 5.0 A g−1 in 2.5 mol L−1 KNO3 aqueous electrolyte. These encouraging results demonstrate the versatile potential of the carbon materials for future electrochemical energy storage devices.
