The high-power density and fast charge/discharge ability of super-capacitor established it as a potent candidate among sustainable and efficient energy storage devices. The bottleneck for their avenue is the lower energy density compared to that of batteries and fuel cells. 2D materials have the scope to design different materials with enhanced surface area that may help to tackle these issues. In this chapter, we have highlighted recent progress in some of these 2D materials such as graphene with transition metal oxides, chalcogenides and MXenes.
