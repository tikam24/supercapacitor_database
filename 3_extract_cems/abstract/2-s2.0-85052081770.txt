A porous graphitic carbon (PGC) was prepared by the one-step activation and graphitization of mesocarbon microbeads using NaOH and FeCl3 as the activation reagent and graphitization catalyst, respectively. All supercapacitors constructed from the PGC using 1 M LiPF6/EC:DEC (v/v=1), 1 M Et4NBF4/PC and 1 M [BMIM]BF4/AN as the electrolytes show good electrochemical properties, with the optimum electrolyte being Et4NBF4/PC.
