Porous Ni(OH)2 nanocubes were successfully fabricated by a simple self-sacrificial-template protocol using Ni-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) as precursor. When treated with NaOH, the simultaneous corrosion of Ni-Co PBA precursor and formation of amorphous Ni(OH)2 resulted in porous Ni(OH)2 nanocubes with uniform size of about 100 nm. Due to the large specific surface area and unique regular porous structure, the as-prepared materials showed large specific capacitance, relatively stable rate capability and long cycle stability when used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. With the voltage between 0.00 and 0.45 V versus Ag/AgCl, the specific capacitance can achieve 1842 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g.
