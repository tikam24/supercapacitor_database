The high temperature modified covalent triazine framework (CTF-600) can exhibit the upmost specific capacitance of 458 F/g at 0.25 A/g, owing to the increased conductivity and suitable pore structure, accompanied by the inherent advantage of CTF. The corresponding symmetric CTF-600//CTF-600 supercapacitor exhibits the energy density of 8 Wh/kg, and excellent cycle stability such as no significant decline of capacitance retention after 10000 cycles. Therefore, the calcinated CTF can be identified as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
