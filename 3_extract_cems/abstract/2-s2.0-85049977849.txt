Interdigitated grid topology May provide for higher quality electrical devices, which are sieges of electric and magnetic fields, in terms of capacity, reconfiguration capability, and compactness. It is then important to provide design solutions that add to these the architectural scalability required to produce readily available solutions for designers. This paper aims to propose a constructal solution for interdigitated grid topologies based on an optimal scalable, minimum-redundant, reconfigurable interdigitated topology for planar electric devices. Although the interdigitated constructal design (ICD) May be of interest in the optimization of numerous planar structures, here we envisage two applications. In this paper, ICD is applied to optimize a planar micro supercapacitor that utilizes vertically grown carbon nanotube forests electrodes. This study relies on numerical solutions to boundary value problems that are solved using the finite element method.
