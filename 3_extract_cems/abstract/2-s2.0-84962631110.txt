This paper presents a powertrain system for an urban electric vehicle. The powertrain system consists of a hybrid energy source (battery storage and ultracapacitors) and drivetrain system (two in-wheel outer-rotor PMSM motors). Battery performance improvement, has been achieved by supporting it with ultracapacitor energy storage. Power flow control using fuzzy logic controller is presented in detail. An electronic differential algorithms have been implemented and tested.
