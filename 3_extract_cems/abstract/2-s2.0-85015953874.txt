Transportation sector has second highest carbon footprint so transition towards electrification of transport sector with clean and green energy sources is an important step towards energy efficient and sustainable transportation while complying with environmental regulations. This paper provides the justification for the use of ultra capacitor with lithium ion battery to realize hybrid energy source after analyzing the limitations of single source for electric vehicle. Power management strategies for hybrid energy source to overcome the problem of charge depletion in small size ultra capacitor is also presented.
