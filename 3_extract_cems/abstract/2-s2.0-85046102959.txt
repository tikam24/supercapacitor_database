In this study, we report the synthesis of SrCo1−xRuxO3−δ nominal compositions, where x = 0.0-1.0, using solid-state reaction technique. XRD analysis confirms the structure of x = 0 sample as hexagonal Sr6Co5O15. As the Co ions are substituted by Ru, a two-phase structure (hexagonal R32 and orthorhombic Pbnm) emerges up to x ≤ 0.5. As the Ru content is increased further, the hexagonal R32 phase disappears completely and an orthorhombic Pbnm phase becomes the main phase. SEM images show that grain size of the samples decreases with increasing Ru content. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity studies indicate upon Ru substitution in the nominal SrCo1−xRuxO3−δ compounds, resistivity decreases due to appearance of metallic SrRuO3 phase. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the samples show capacitive properties upon Ru substitution. The cycle measurements of the capacitors yield promising results for potential supercapacitor applications.
