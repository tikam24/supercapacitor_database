Tremendous efforts have been devoted to develop the active materials for supercapacitor electrodes, but very few are focused on the improvement of the electrode material/electrolyte interfaces via protonic conductors. In this study, double conductive networks are constructed in powdery carbon electrodes by using sulfated zirconia as protonic conductor and acetylene black as electric conductor. The synergetic effect of protonic and electric double transport pathways enhances the electrode material/electrolyte interfaces, reduces diffusion distance of protons, and increases the electrode specific capacitance. Compared to the control electrode without protonic conductor, the electrode shows a specific capacitance with 21.0% increment. The proposed strategy may be a promising avenue for preparation of powdery carbon electrodes used in electrical double-layer capacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
