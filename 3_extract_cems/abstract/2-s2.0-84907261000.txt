A nanostructure S-doping manganese oxide (MnOxSy) amorphous powder was prepared by a homogeneous coprecipitation method for supercapacitor application. The structure and surface morphology of the as-prepared MnOxSypowder were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The as-prepared nanostructure S-doping manganese oxide powder was confirmed with a chemical composition of MnO1.26S0.23by elemental analysis, in which the average oxidation state of manganese is about 3.1. The supercapacitive behavior of the as-prepared MnO1.26S0.23was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge cycling (CD) experiments in 1 mol L-1Na2SO4electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 181 F g-1was obtained for MnO1.26S0.23. Furthermore, the specific capacitance remained 97.3% of the original value after 500 cycles. The superior capacitive behavior and better cycling stability indicate that the amorphous nanostructure MnOxSymaybe a promising electrode material for electrochemical capacitors.
