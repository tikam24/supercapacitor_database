Supercapacitors (SC) have emerged as a promising energy storage technology due to their high power density, long cycle life, and fast charging/discharging capabilities. This makes them suitable for a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. In addition, the use of sustainable and environmentally-friendly materials in the production of supercapacitors can further enhance their potential as a clean energy storage solution. The use of materials such as zinc (Zn), which is low cost and has a low environmental impact, can help to reduce the carbon footprint of energy storage systems. Zn-based SC is the most significant of the several SC materials due to its cost-effective modest manufacture and less negative environmental impact. Due to its cutting-edge advantages, low cost, and great chemical stability in the fields of energy storage and catalytic applications, the substance Zn has been acknowledged as a scientifically important material. Typically, precipitation, sol-gel, hydrothermal, and other processes are used to create Zn-based SC. The globe is currently experiencing the biggest problems due to the rapid population growth and the increased demand for energy consumption that has resulted from this. For forthcoming energy technology, an SC strategy is creating strong energy strategies. Due to varied oxidation circumstances, Zn-based materials for pseudocapacitors are of concern. We absorbed Zn-based materials created using various synthetic processes in the current review article. Because of their physicochemical characteristics, Zn-based materials are currently an emerging electrode material for SC applications. The three main factors that determine an SC's performance are the electrochemical (EC) properties of the electrode material, the electrolyte, and the voltage range. This review work has reported on the characteristics of the electrode material for Zn-based electrode materials as well as the storage processes of SC and its numerous variants.
