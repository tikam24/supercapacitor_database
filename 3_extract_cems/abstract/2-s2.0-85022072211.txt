Rational design and fabrication of novel electrode materials are of great importance for developing supercapacitors with remarkable capacitance and enhanced cycling stability. In this paper, we present a simple one-pot hydrothermal deposition followed by calcinations process for the in situ construction of homogeneous NiO/MnO2/CeO2 (NMC) nanoflake arrays on Ni foam substrate, which could be directly adopted as the binder-free electrode materials for high performance supercapacitors. The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are carried out to investigate the morphology, microstructure and composition of NMC nanoflake arrays. As-prepared hierarchical NMC nanoflake arrays exhibit the specific capacitance of 1027.8 F g−1 at a current density of 3.1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 97.8% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. This facile, cost-effective and controllable fabrication route and the robust supercapacitive activity suggest that the ordered NMC nanoflake arrays could be promising candidate electrode materials for high performance electrochemical energy storage devices.
