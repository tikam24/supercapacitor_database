Bi2S3 thin film electrode has been synthesized by simple and low cost successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method on stainless steel (SS) substrate at room temperature. The formation of interconnected nanoparticles with nanoporous surface morphology has been achieved and which is favourable to the supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical supercapacitive performance of Bi2S3 thin film electrode has been performed through cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and stability studies in aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte. The Bi2S3 thin film electrode exhibits the specific capacitance of 289 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1 scan rate in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.
