In order to improve reliability and efficiency of single fuel cell hybrid power system, a system composed of multiple fuel cell modules and supercapacitor is proposed, and the power allocation strategy based on passive control is developed according to the efficiency curve of the fuel cell. In this control strategy the multiple working modes are analyzed and the output powers of fuel cell and supercapacitor are allocated. So this hybrid power system can follow the requested load power rapidly and work in high efficiency area as far as possible. The simulation results demonstrate that the fuel cells of the hybrid power system can work in high efficiency area, and the complex and variable load power can be satisfied rapidly.
