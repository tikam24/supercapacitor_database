This paper provides a platform for a novel innovative approach towards an off-grid Supercapacitor based battery charging and hybrid energy harvesting system for low wind speed Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT). A 3-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) was chosen for its low maintenance cost, light weight and less complicated design. Simulation studies was carried out to obtain an optimized design and a 200W 12V 16 Pole PMSG attached to a VAWT of 14.5m radius and 60cm of height was sent for fabrication with Maglev implementation (Magnetic Levitation). Upon arrival, the optimized system is implemented into the energy harvesting circuit and field testing is carried to observe the performance. Under wind speed range of 3-5m/s, the energy harvesting circuit showed better efficiency in charging battery in all aspects comparing to direct charging of battery regardless of with or without converter. Based on analysis and results carried out in this paper, all feasibility studies and information were successfully provided for future work.
