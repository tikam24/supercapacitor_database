Photo-supercapacitor is a combination of solar cells and supercapacitor which intensively being developed. Photo-supercapacitor performance is influenced by the efficiency of solar cells and storing and releasing capacity of supercapacitors. Any types of either solar section or supercapacitor sections could be used. In the DSSC solar cell, one of the influential variables is the performance of the photoanode. The photoanode with semiconducting metal oxides play a role in charges mobility and light absorption process, which are influenced by crystal morphology and structures. The common metal oxides used are ZnO and TiO2 which show high electron mobility, wide band gap, and good optical properties. This work is designed to investigate the effect of annealing temperature of the composite layer of ZnO and mesoporous TiO2 on structure, morphology, optical absorption, and photo-supercapacitor performance. The ZnO compact layer was deposited onto the FTO substrate by a spin coating method with various annealing temperature. The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited on top of the ZnO compact layer by means of screen printing method. The construction of photo-supercapacitor model comprises DSSC and BaTiO3-PVDF symmetric supercapacitor which integrated by using aluminum substrate. Characterization was done using XRD, SEM, UV-Vis, and I-V solar simulators for the performance of photo-supercapacitor.
