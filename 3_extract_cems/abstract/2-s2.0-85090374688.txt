The supercapacitor is an effective energy storage device, which is used to meet the demand for global energy consumption. But the design and fabrication of an ideal electrode material are the most challenging issues to achieve high-performance supercapacitors. The use of single electroactive materials like carbon materials, transition metal oxides, and electronically conducting polymers as an electrode in supercapacitors suffers from several demerits. Thus, different types of hybrid materials are utilized to achieve high-performance supercapacitor electrodes of high specific capacitance, energy density, power density, rate capability, and cycle life with low cost and environmentally friendly. Even the use of two components in binary composites cannot fulfill all the requirements of a high‐performance supercapacitor. Therefore, numerous strategies have been employed to design ternary composites by merging all three types of electroactive materials for the fabrication of ideal high‐performance supercapacitors. Hence, this chapter focuses on the recent progress of supercapacitors based on ternary composites of transition metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and conducting polymers. The chapter also provides a comprehensive study of the synthesis, structural characterizations, electrochemical properties of transition metal oxides, carbon-based materials, and conducting polymers.
