In this paper we are reporting secondary metal ion doped polyaniline is chemically synthesized and used for the construction of a redox supercapacitor. The chloride doped polyaniline is chemically synthesized and secondary doping with iron metal cation is studied using 0.5M concentration of ferric chloride as oxidizing agent. Iron ions doped polyaniline is coated over the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass plates using solution casting technique and films are characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolytes. The secondary ions doped polyaniline shows a significant improvement in the charge storage properties.
