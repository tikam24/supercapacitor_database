This work presents the digital implementation of peak current control method in a bidirectional buck-boost DC-DC converter, as an alternative solution to voltage and hysteresis mode control schemes. The advantages of peak current control, such as the constant switching frequency and good performance in both steady state and dynamic response are pointed out. Moreover, an implementation scheme is presented, based on the C2000 Piccolo Launchpad microcontroller unit. Experimental results on a prototype converter are shown, indicating the improved dynamic characteristics of a Type II feedback compensator compared to a PI controller.
