We report on the optimized fabrication and electrochemical properties of ternary metal oxide (Ti-Mo-Ni-O) nanoparticles as electrochemical supercapacitor electrode materials. The structural, morphological, and elemental composition of the fabricated Ti-Mo-Ni-O via rapid breakdown anodization are elucidated by field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, and photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The Ti-Mo-Ni-O nanoparticles reveal pseudocapacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 255.4 F g-1. Moreover, the supercapacitor device Ti-Mo-Ni-O NPs//mesoporous doped-carbon (TMN NPs//MPDC) device exhibited a superior specific energy of 68.47 W h kg-1 with a corresponding power density of 2058 W kg-1. The supercapacitor device shows 100% coulombic efficiency with 96.8% capacitance retention over 11 000 prolonged charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g-1. This journal is
