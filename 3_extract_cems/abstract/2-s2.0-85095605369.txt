Manganese vanadate nano pebbles were prepared by a simple co-precipitation method and calcined at 350 °C for 3 h. X-ray diffraction pattern and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis confirmed the monoclinic structure of Mn2V2O7 with metallic bond vibrations. Morphological features of manganese vanadate nanoparticles were observed as pebble-like morphology via Scanning electron microscope and High-resolution transmission electron microscopic analysis. Oxidation states and optical property of the synthesized manganese vanadate nano pebbles was examined through UV-Visible absorption spectroscopic analysis. Pseudocapacitance nature of prepared manganese vanadate nano pebbles was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic techniques in 4 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance values of 528 Fg-1 was attained in 4 M KOH electrolyte solution at 10 mVs−1. Superior capacitive retention of about 90.1% was achieved along with 99% coulombic efficiency after 3000 continuous cycles.
