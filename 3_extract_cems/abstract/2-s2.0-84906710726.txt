This paper presents an intelligent DC link control using a fuzzy logic controller based on the differential flatness control theory for hybrid vehicle applications supplied by a fuel cell (FC) (main source) and a supercapacitor (auxiliary source). The energy in the system is balanced by dc bus energy stabilization (or indirect voltage regulation). A supercapacitor module functions by supplying energy to regulate the dc bus energy. The FC, as a slow dynamic source in this system, supplies energy to the supercapacitor module to maintain its charge. The FC converter combines four-phase parallel boost converters with interleaving, and the supercapacitor converter employs four-phase parallel bidirectional converters with interleaving. These two converters are called a multi-segment converter for high power applications. Because the model of the power switching converters is nonlinear, it is preferable to apply model-based nonlinear control strategies that directly compensate for the nonlinearity of the system without requiring a linear approximation. Using the intelligent fuzzy control law based on the flatness property, we propose straightforward solutions to hybrid energy management and to the dynamic and regulation problems. To validate the proposed method, a hardware system is developed with analogue circuits, and a numerical calculation is generated with a dSPACE controller DS1104. Experimental results for a small-scale power plant (a polymer electrolyte membrane FC (PEMFC) of 1200 W and 46 A with a supercapacitor module of 100 F, 500 A, and 32 V) in the laboratory corroborate the excellent performance of this control scheme during vehicle motor drive cycles.
