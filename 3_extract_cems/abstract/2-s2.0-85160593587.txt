Nuclear fusion experiments are becoming one of the most interesting focuses of research, given the hope of generating programmable, safe, and green energy. Among them, ASDEX (axially symmetric divertor experiment) upgrade has been operating at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) research center since 1991. To ignite and confine the plasma, several coils must be supplied through controllable high-current pulsed power supplies. The toroidal field magnets are here considered and a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-like system was designed and tested thanks to a small-scale prototype in previous works. The MMC-like topology, consisting of full-bridge submodules (SMs) with IGBTs and supercapacitor and exploitable also for other industrial applications, was chosen because of its modularity, redundancy, fault tolerance, and large amount of stored energy. The prototype, made of four SMs, was necessary to highlight critical key points in the design process. However, its scalability must be further tested before building a full-scale power supply, meant to reach almost 2400 SMs to guarantee the energy required by the load. This paper aims at validating hardware-in-the-loop (a powerful, safe, and relatively inexpensive real-time simulation environment that enables testing with real control boards) as a useful technology for power supply scalability studies and not only for control strategy tests. The results obtained previously from the prototype will allow us to finally increase the number of SMs and test the MMC-like scalability.
