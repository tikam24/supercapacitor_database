Phase change materials (PCMs) can absorb can release a large amount of heat during their phase transition process. However, the applications of pure PCMs have been limited due to the leakage problem, which needs to be solved to fabricate form-stable PCMs without any volume shrinkage. Microencapsulation has been employed to prevent leakage during melting by using polyaniline (PANI) as a shell material. Here, we used a highly porous material to support PCM. The graphene aerogel embedded PCM was fabricated to contain the external thermal energy effectively. The mechanical property of graphene aerogel was enhanced by cross-linking the graphene skeleton with cysteamine monomers. Graphene/cysteamine aerogel (GCA) supported PCM composite was used as an energy harvesting generator. Two different PCM composites were connected to each side of the thermo-electric electrode employing the Seebeck effect and pyroelectric effect. The power generator with PCM composites produced electrical energy in the circuit. In addition, numerical simulation was conducted using the finite element method (FEM).
