This paper put forward the inertial control strategy based on the control of charge and discharge of supercapacitor and the trigger angle of H-bridge which integrates photovoltaic (PV) system. The whole cascade H-bridge structure is composed of traditional photovoltaic module, Boost/Buck circuit, supercapacitor (SC), and H-bridge circuit. First, the charging state and the inertial energy power support of the SC are analysed. Then the control strategy of the cascade H-bridge is proposed. To verify the efficiency of the control strategy, a cascade chain consists of 12 H-bridge unit was built in EMTP simulation software. Finally the simulation results prove that the newly developed SC-integrated cascade module can do inertial energy support well, which is important to the coordination between the power system and solar energy.
