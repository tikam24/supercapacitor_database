Municipal sludge (MS) pyrolysis is often used to produce carbon materials for supercapacitors, however, the conventional heating process limits the improvement of its performance. In this paper, a facile method for the preparation of potassium humate (HA-K) by co-pyrolysis of MS and alkali was proposed for the first time, and then it was mixed with sodium chloride for roasting and quenching to obtain high performance HA-K carbon materials for supercapacitors. Compared with the electrode without chlorination roast quenching, the sample of HA-K-650-M−Q (the sample calcined at 650°C and quenched at 200°C) exhibited higher specific capacitance (395F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and enhanced energy density (32.28 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2805 W kg−1). After 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate reached 87%. This remarkable performance is due to its proper N- and O- self-doping and hierarchical porous geometry, which fundamentally promotes mass and charge transfer in the reaction. Therefore, this study provides a feasible method to solve the problem of sludge value-added and design suitable for the practical application of carbon materials.
