Monodispersed anamorphic cubic NiO materials have been synthesized by a simple method. SEM, TEM and XRD have been employed for the morphology and structure characterization. The calcination conditions have been carefully studied about their effects on supercapacitor properties. Electrochemical data prove that the monodispersed nano anamorphic cubic NiO materials contain a good specific capacitance and excellent specific capacitance retention after 2000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. These results suggest that both the morphology and structure have important effects on the high performance supercapacitors. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications.
