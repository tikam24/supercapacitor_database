In this paper, Super-Capacitor (SC) has been suggested to improve the performance and Low-Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) capability of the Wind Turbines (WTs) based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG). The stator is connected directly to the grid, however, the rotor is connected through a Back-To-Back Converter (BTBC): Rotor Side Converter (RSC) and Grid Side Converter (GSC). This configuration makes it very sensitive to any disturbances. SC is coupled through the voltage balance circuit to the DC Link Capacitor (DCLC), which is connected between the two converters. The proposed system effectively reduces the disturbance of the DC Link Voltage (DCLV) during the fault and recovers the active power rapidly and smoothly after the fault clearance. This, in turn, improves the LVRT Capability. A voltage dip and three phase fault are applied at different places. The study is carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK to depict the system validity.
