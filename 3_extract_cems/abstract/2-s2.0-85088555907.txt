Transition metal oxides are nowadays one of the most important materials in the manufacture of capacitive electrodes. The most important problems with these materials for applied energy storage devices are low specific energy and poor electrical conductivity. In this research nickel ferrite nanoparticles (NiFe2O4) and also hybrid of NiFe2O4/rGO are synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by XRD, Raman, and XPS analysis. The amount of porosity and specific surface area is studied by BET analysis as and surface morphology is studied by SEM and TEM. To investigate the effect of adding rGO to NiFe2O4 nanoparticles, from a hybrid electrode superconducting electrochemical tests are performed, including CV, EIS, and charge-discharge. This electrode with a capacitance of 584.63 F/g and capacitance retention of 91% after 2000 consecutive cycles can be a tempting option for supercapacitor applications.
