Environmental energy harvesting is a promising approach to achieving unlimited operational lifetimes for micro-scale electronic systems. This letter presents a hybrid PV-supercapacitor-powered wireless sensor node, which is composed of a photovoltaic panel, a supercapacitor, a low power Maximum Power Transfer Tracker (MPTT) circuit and a wireless MCU. Several low-power design schemes to reduce power dissipation of the proposed system are also described. An active-clamped bi-directional flyback converter is adopted for our system to charge and discharge the supercapacitor; the MPTT algorithm runs in an intermittent time interval mode because of the relatively slow changing of solar radiation, and when MPTT is not active, MCU enters into sleep mode to save power. Experimental results taken from a laboratory prototype are presented to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system. Â© 2013.
