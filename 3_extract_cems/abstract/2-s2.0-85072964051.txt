The paper discusses design of energy storage based energy recovery system for elevators. The main element of such system is unidirectional DC-DC converter to control energy flow to supercapacitor or li-ion battery based energy storage. The paper gives explanation of selection of the converter topology and some design considerations. The test results of experimental prototype on a developed test bench are presented in the paper.
