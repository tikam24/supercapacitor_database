For real-time reporting of power supply interruption on LV users, there essentially need the availabilities of both the back-up supply for communication module in smart meter and the communication channel between smart meter and main station. This paper studies a real-time reporting solution which embeds super capacitor as the back-up supply of communication module in smart meter and uses micro-power communication scheme for LV users. Field tests of 30 LV distribution areas in Baoji Power Supply Branch verifies the proposed solution. The application prospects of the proposed solution are further discussed, such as interruption diagnosis and fault analysis, under urban and rural LV scenarios.
