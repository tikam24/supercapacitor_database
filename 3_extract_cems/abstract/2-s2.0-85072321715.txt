N/O self-doped hollow carbon nanorods (HCNs) with micro/mesoporous walls are fabricated based on a new deep-eutectic-solvent that serves as an all-in-one precursor, self-template, and self-dopant agent. The carbon-based supercapacitor using an ionic liquid electrolyte exhibits a high energy density of 116.5 W h kg-1 with excellent long-term cycling performance.
