The hybrid approach allows for a reinforcing combination of properties of dissimilar components in synergic combinations. From hybrid materials to hybrid nanocomposite electrodes the approach offers opportunities to tackle much needed improvements in the performance of energy storage devices. This paper presents different types of hybrid materials with emphasis on those synthesized and studied in our laboratory and reviews the different approaches and scales of hybrids, materials, electrodes and finally presents recent efforts to develop hybrid battery-supercapacitor devices.
