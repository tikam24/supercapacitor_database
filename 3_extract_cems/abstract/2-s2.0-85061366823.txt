In electric vehicle (EV) drive system, having an energy sources with combination of high energy and power density characteristics is important. It enables the vehicle to travel at longer distance per charging cycle and demonstrates good response during acceleration and ability to recapture the energy during regenerative braking. This paper investigates on the newly proposed hybrid energy storage system on quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI) for PMSM drive system. The objectives are to prove that bidirectional power flow in the drive system can be realized and the current stress on the battery can be reduced with the installation of the supercapacitor via the bidirectional DC-DC converter. Overall system configuration is presented together with the mathematical modelling analysis for the supercapacitor charging/discharging operation. Results from the simulation verification shows that the proposed method works satisfactorily according to the requirement.
