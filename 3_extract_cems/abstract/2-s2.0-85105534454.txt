Demand-side management (DSM) in industrial facilities provides an opportunity for substantial amounts of energy cost savings, since industrial facilities are the largest energy consuming sectors globally. In this work, energy storage (ES) technologies are critically reviewed and compared with industrial DSM in mind. ES technologies reviewed herein include lithium-ion battery energy storage (BES), sodium-sulfur BES, lead-acid BES, flow BES, supercapacitor ES, superconducting magnetic ES, thermal ES, flywheel ES, pumped hydro ES, and compressed air ES. The fundamentals of these energy storage technologies are reviewed in detail including recent developments, followed by case studies and extensive comparisons. These comparisons include, but are not limited to cost per cycle analyses, levelized cost of energy analyses, and comparisons between performance, transient, and cost characteristics. Some key properties analyzed include the rated power, power density, efficiency, lifetime, discharge time, capital costs, and O&M costs.
