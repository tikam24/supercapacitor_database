MoS2 has attracted attention as a promising hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst and a supercapacitor electrode material. However, its catalytic activity and capacitive performance are still hindered by its aggregation and poor intrinsic conductivity. Here, hollow rGO sphere-supported ultrathin MoS2 nanosheet arrays (h-rGO@MoS2) are constructed via a dual-template approach and employed as bifunctional HER catalyst and supercapacitor electrode material. Because of the expanded interlayer spacing in MoS2 nanosheets and more exposed electroactive S–Mo–S edges, the constructed h-rGO@MoS2 architectures exhibit enhanced HER performance. Furthermore, benefiting from the synergistic effect of the improved conductivity and boosted specific surface areas (144.9 m2 g−1, ca. 4.6-times that of pristine MoS2), the h-rGO@MoS2 architecture shows a high specific capacitance (238 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1), excellent rate capacitance, and remarkable cycle stability. Our synthesis method may be extended to construct other vertically aligned hollow architectures, which may serve both as efficient HER catalysts and supercapacitor electrodes.
