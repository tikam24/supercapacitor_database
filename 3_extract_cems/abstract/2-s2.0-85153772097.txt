In this paper, the bimetallic cathode material of cobalt vanadium organic framework (Bimetallic organic framework) is fabricated by facile hydrothermal method and heat treatment. The hollow spheric and porous surface containing tailored morphology of bimetallic MOF composite plays a pivotal role in energy storage application. That is efficaciously inherited from the base cobalt MOF imidazolate template. The electrochemical analysis delineated that the vanadium interpolated ZIF-67 MOF composite unveiled an augmented super capacitive performance. The as-obtained specific capacitance is 549 F/g at a 2 mV/s scan rate, and 349 F/g at 3 mA/cm2 applied current value. Furthermore, exceptional capacity retention of over 89% and 95% coulombic efficiency was obtained for the fabricated cathode material even after 5000 cycles. Combining biowaste-derived activated carbon with a Bimetallic Organic Framework, the asymmetric device of supercapacitor storage is fabricated. That device works on 0â€“1.4 V windows. The accomplished galvanometric capacitance is 151 F/g in the 4 mA current with the maximum specific energy of 42.6 Wh/kg and the specific power of 1399 W/kg and exhibited promising stability over 10000 cycles. These attained results affirm its proficient application as cathode material of supercapacitor devices. Graphical Abstract: Write up The porous hollow-spheric Bimetallic organic framework and biowaste derive APCs are assembled in an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor device that delineates the real-time application by analyzing it with an LED glowing circuit about a reasonable time that can replicate the feasibility of a real-time portable energy storage device.
