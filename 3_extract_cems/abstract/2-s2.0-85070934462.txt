In this study, due to the large cavity structure of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), Au@ZIF-67 was synthesized by loading nanoscale Au nanoparticles (NPs) into Co based zeolite imidazole framework (ZIF-67). Subsequently, Au@ZIF-67 was calcined to produce Au NPs loading Co3O4 hollow nanocages (Au@Co3O4). The small size Au NPs were distributed on the wall of Co3O4 hollow nanocages. The final product in a polyhedral morphology formed hollow nanocages. The unique structure could provide a high specific surface area. As an electrode material of supercapacitors, the Au@Co3O4 electrode with polyhedral morphology showed a specific capacity of 763 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, the specific capacitance retention rate was 83.7% at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. These results indicate that Au@Co3O4 electrodes with polyhedral morphology have very wide application prospects in supercapacitors.
