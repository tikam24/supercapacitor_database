Rational designing and constructing multiphase hybrid electrode materials is an effective method to compensate for the performance defects of the single component. Based on this strategy, Cu2Se hexagonal nanosheets@Co3Se4 nanospheres mixed structures have been fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Under the synergistic effect of the high ionic conductivity of Cu2Se and the remarkable cycling stability of Co3Se4, Cu2Se@Co3Se4 can exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance as a novel electrode material. The as-prepared Cu2Se@Co3Se4 electrode displays high specific capacitance of 1005 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with enhanced rate capability (56 % capacitance retention at 10 A g−1), and ultralong lifespan (94.2 % after 10 000 cycles at 20 A g−1). An asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled applying the Cu2Se@Co3Se4 as anode and graphene as cathode, which delivers a wide work potential window of 1.6 V, high energy density (30.9 Wh kg−1 at 0.74 kW kg−1), high power density (21.0 Wh kg−1 at 7.50 kW kg−1), and excellent cycling stability (85.8 % after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1).
