A dahlia-liked carbon nanohorns (CNHs) decorated graphene/polyaniline (CGP) nanocomposite was prepared via in situ chemical oxidation and hydrazine hydrate reducing. Firstly, dahlia-liked CNHs decorated graphene oxide/polyaniline (CGOP) composite was synthesized from the polymerization of aniline monomers on the surface of graphene oxide with spherical dahlia-liked carbon nanohorns as spacers. Then, the CGP composite was obtained by reducing CGOP using hydrazine hydrate. CGP exhibited a uniform three-dimensional nanostructure because long cone-shaped tips of dahlia-liked CNHs spacers can boost the isolation effect of the nanocomposite. The maximum specific capacitance of CGP was up to 769 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 when served as supercapacitors electrodes. Importantly, CGP also performed a good rate capability and high stability. Furthermore, a CGP-based asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled and delivered an energy density of 19.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1504.9 W kg−1.
