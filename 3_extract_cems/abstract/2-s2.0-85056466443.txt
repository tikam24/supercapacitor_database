In this study, integrated plaster-like micro-supercapacitors based on medical adhesive tapes are fabricated by a simple pencil drawing process combined with a mild solution deposition of MnO2. These solid micro-supercapacitors not only exhibit excellent stretchability, flexibility, and biocompatibility, but also possess outstanding electrochemical performances, such as exceptional rate capability and cycling stability. Hence they may act as skin-mountable and thin-film energy storage devices of high efficiency to power miniaturized and wearable electronic devices.
