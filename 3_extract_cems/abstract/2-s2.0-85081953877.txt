To meet the energy needs batteries and supercapacitors are evolved as a promising candidate from the class of energy storage devices. The growth in the development of new 2D electrode materials brings a new revolution in energy storage devices with a comprehensive investigation. MXene, a new family of 2D metal carbides, nitrides and carbonitrides due to their attractive electrical and electrochemical properties e.g. hydrophilicity, conductivity, surface area, topological structure have gained huge attention. In this review, we discussed different MXene synthesis routes using different etchants e.g. hydrofluoric acid, ammonium hydrazine, lithium fluoride, and hydrochloric acid, etc showing that fluorine formation is compulsory to etch the aluminum layer from its precursor. Due to the advantage of large interlayer spacing between the MXene layers in MXene, the effect of intercalation on the performance of batteries and supercapacitors using MXene as electrodes by various sized cations are reviewed. Different MXene hybrids as supercapacitor electrodes will also be summarized. Lastly, the conclusion and future scope of MXene to be done in various supercapacitor applications are also presented.
