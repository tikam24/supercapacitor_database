A MoS2/CNT nanocomposite containing three-dimensional (3D) flower-like MoS2nanospheres and interconnected carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has been successfully synthesized by using MoO3and KSCN as reactants and deionized water as solvent with the presence of CNTs through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. The nanocomposite was applied as an electrode material for the supercapacitors with excellent energy storage performance. The structure and morphology of the nanocomposite were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, which show that MoS2nanospheres are about 300 nm in diameter and interconnected by CNTs. The special capacity of the nanocomposites can reach 74.05 F/g at a high current density of 2 A/g, which is higher than those of the flower-like MoS2and MoS2nanosheets at the same current density. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the MoS2/CNT nanocomposite still maintains 80.8% of initial capacitance over 1000 cycles at the current density of 2 A/g. The excellent electrochemical performance and long cycle life of the nanocomposite are attributed to the synergetic effect between CNTs and ultrathin MoS2nanosheets grown vertically on the flower-like MoS2.
