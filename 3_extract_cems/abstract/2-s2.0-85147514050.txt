A polyaniline (PANI)-incorporated boron nitride (BN) with different mass ratios (0.1–10 g) were prepared by two-step in situ oxidative chemical polymerization method for pseudocapacitor application. The surface morphology of BNPANI composites reveals that the PANI was uniformly decorated over the BN matrix. The electrochemical studies of PANI-embedded BN composites with different mass ratios (0.1–10 g) were evaluated. It was found that the PANI with BN (0.5 g) of composites exhibits pseudo-capacitive behavior with maximum specific capacitance value of 143 F g−1 at a specific current of 0.05 A g−1. Further, the composites exhibit 99% good cyclic stability and maintain improved specific capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles. The higher specific capacitance and improved electrical conductivity of PANIBN (0.5 g) were revealed by unification of the conducting PANI polymer into BN matrix.
