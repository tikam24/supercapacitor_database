Electrode materials are the most important factors to verify the properties of the electrochemical supercapacitor. In this paper, the storage principles and characteristics of electrode materials, including carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides and conducting polymers for supercapacitors are depicted in detail. Other factors such as electrode separator and electrolyte are briefly investigated. Recently, several works are conducted on application of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and MWCNTs-based electrode materials for supercapacitors. MWCNTs serve in experimental supercapacitor electrode materials result in specific capacitance (SC) value as high as 135 Fg -1. Addition of pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal oxides and conducting polymers in the MWCNTs results in electrochemical performance improvement (higher capacitance and conductivity). The nanocomposites of MWCNTs and pseudocapacitive materials are the most promising electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their good electrical conductivity, low cost and high mass density.
