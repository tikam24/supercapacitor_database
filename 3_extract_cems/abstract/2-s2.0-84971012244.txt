Battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is an effective way to suppress the power fluctuation of photovoltaic (PV) power generation system during radiation change. This study focuses on the power sharing between different energy storage components with two optimisation objectives: energy loss and state of charge of SC. First, the topology of HESS and its connection with PV system are analysed. Second, the control targets of the HESS have been organised as optimisation objectives. A linear weighted summation algorithm based on variable weights is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimisation problem to obtain current reference of SC and battery. Third, the energy management system of the HESS is designed based on proposed algorithms. Simulation and experiment results verified the proposed algorithms and control strategy.
