This paper presents an idea for using LabVIEW to create a virtual tool for determining the energy flows during charging an energy storage system made of connected in series supercapacitor cells. The preliminary developed charging algorithm is described and its basic equations are given. The presented tool allows the changing of some basic parameters of the energy storage system and observing if the algorithm is applicable.
