Site specific electroless gelation enables straightforward solution processing of graphene gel films with ultimate scalability and three-dimensional shape engineering. Due to the synergistic combination of open porous structure and highly electro-conductivity graphene gel framework, shape engineered gel films could be exploited for high performance supercapacitor electrode and achieved large energy capacity and high power density, simultaneously.
