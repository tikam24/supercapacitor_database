WSN is one among the predominant innovations that uprises in the recent decades. LEACH protocol is utilized for routing in order to form the clusters in an efficient manner. In case if the network is split into unequal clusters, then the system may become unbalanced in packet delivery. Formation of small clusters collapses that particular cluster after few rounds due to lack of energy, making a part of the network completely drained out and blacked out. In order to balance the network, a novel protocol is proposed which makes the system more efficient by making an additional energy source available to the existing system. Replacing a battery by super capacitor increases the lifetime of the power source. This technique makes the nodes to operate in energy rich state for longer duration, thus increasing the performance of the network. In addition usage of Super Capacitors reduces the number of batteries used. These e-wastes obtained from the energy sources are a big threat to the Mother Nature, flora and fauna. This paper proposes a technique to overcome these issues by employing a Super Capacitor thus producing a load balanced energy rich resultant bunch of nodes.
