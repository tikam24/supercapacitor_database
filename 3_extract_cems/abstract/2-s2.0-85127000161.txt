In order to prepare portable, one-dimensional fiber supercapacitors with required electrochemical properties, composite fibers were prepared as electrode substrates using the liquid crystal state of carbon nanotubes (CNT) and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) synergistically. A simple and controllable electrochemical deposition method was applied to deposit polyaniline (PANI) on the fiber surface to prepare composite fiber electrodes. Microscopic morphological characterization and electrochemical performance tests were performed on the fibers to obtain the electrode with the optimal deposition time and assemble the fiber supercapacitor. The result shows that the PANI/Ti3C2Tx/CNT fiber electrode exhibits the highest bulk specific capacitance of 113.92 F/cm3 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s when deposited for 5 min. The specific capacitance of the assembled supercapacitor reached 65.4 F/cm3 at a current density of 0.1 A/cm3. The retention rate of the specific capacitance is 79% after 5 000 cycles at 0.8 A/cm3, indicating good stability.
