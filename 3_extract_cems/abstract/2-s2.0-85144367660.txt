The spinel structured materials (e.g., MnCo2O4.5) are good aspirants for supercapacitor electrode application due to their outstanding pseudocapacitor performance. However, due to the collapsing of the crystal and morphological structures during electrochemical analysis, inferior cyclic stability and low energy density problems are inevitable when the materials are used as supercapacitor electrodes. Alteration of intrinsic (diffusion-controlled) to extrinsic (surface-controlled) capacitive behavior is the effective solution to overcome these issues. Herein, the intrinsic capacitor behavior of the MnCo2O4.5 material was altered into an extrinsic mechanism through the precipitation process with the aid of a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-based structural engineering process. The MnCo2O4.5 coated on nickel foam current collector delivered the specific capacity of 649C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retained 97 % of its initial capacity after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1 in three-electrode configurations. Additionally, the MnCo2O4.5//Activated carbon asymmetric device showed a specific capacity of 93.8C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with energy and power densities of 33.4 Wh Kg−1 and 681 W Kg−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. DNA-based structural engineering demonstrates the tuning of intrinsic to extrinsic capacitive behavior resulting in better supercapacitor properties in MnCo2O4.5 material.
