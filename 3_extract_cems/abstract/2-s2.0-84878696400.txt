The Ni(OH)2 particles are synthesized by repeated immersion method. The as-prepared particles are Ni(OH)2, which are well dispersed and have a fish-like shape. The electrochemical tests show that the particles have relatively high capacitance and excellent capacitive retention. The good structure and excellent performance suggest its promising application in supercapacitor. Â© 2013 by ESG.
