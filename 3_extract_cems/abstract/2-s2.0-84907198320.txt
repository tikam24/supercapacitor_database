In this work, we report a novel strategy for the controlled synthesis of nanorod assembled multi-shelled cobalt oxide (Co3O4) hollow microspheres (HSs). The Co2CO3(OH)2NRs are first vertically grown on the carbon microspheres (CS) to form the core-shelled composites by a low-temperature solution route. The multi-shelled hollow interiors within the Co3O4microspheres are unconventionally obtained by annealing the as-prepared core-shell structured CS@Co2CO3(OH)2composite in air. When evaluated for supercapacitive performance, the multi-shelled Co3O4hollow microspheres exhibit high capacitance of 394.4 and 360 F g-1at the current densities of 2 A g-1and 10 A g-1, respectively. The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the multi-shelled hollow structures, which facilitate the electrolyte penetration and provide more active sites for the electrochemical reactions.
