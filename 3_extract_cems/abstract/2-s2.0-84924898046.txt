A facile and low-cost approach has been developed for the fabrication of large-area nickel sulfide nanosheets via the hydrothermally assisted sulfurization of Ni foam. The obtained Ni3S2 nanosheets exhibit perfect supercapacitor performance, retaining almost 93.6% of the maximum capacitance after 3000 cycles. The strategy of self-sulfurization is promising for use in the construction of other nanoarchitectured sulfide (e.g., CuS, FeS and SnS) arrays for electrochemical applications.
