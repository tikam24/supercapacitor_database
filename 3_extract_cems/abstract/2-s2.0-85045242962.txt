In this paper, a cooperative voltage equalizer is proposed such that the voltages of supercapacitors in the power source achieve consensus. Voltage equalization for supercapacitors in the power source is a crucial issue since unbalanced voltage states would result in inefficiency and acceleration of lifetime decay. As multiple supercapacitors are connected in certain form, the power source can be modeled as a networked system. In this view, voltage equalization problem can be formulated as a consensus problem of multi-agent system. Combining cooperative control theory and Lyapunov method, a distributed controller is designed for each supercapacitor to drive its voltage synchronized to its neighbors in the network. It is proved that under the topology condition that the graph is connected, all voltages of supercapacitors can achieve consensus, i.e., voltage equalization of the power source is achieved. Simulation result has been presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.
