The preparation of planar transparent flexible supercapacitors with high energy storage capacity, high mechanical properties and excellent optical properties is still a great challenge. The typical planar supercapacitor electrodes adopting the interdigital structure are semi-transparent, for the interdigital parts are opaque. Herein, we report a highly transparent and flexible planar supercapacitor by utilizing the embedded metallic mesh as the current collectors. The embedded metallic mesh with an interdigital structure, which was fabricated though the selective electrodeposition and film-invertion techniques, was employed as the planar supercapacitor electrode after being loaded with MnO2 by electrochemical deposition. The realized planar solid-state supercapacitor exhibits high performance electrochemical characters and high transparency with an areal capacitance of 1.33 mF cm-2 and an optical transmittance of 81.7%. Further, the planar solid-state supercapacitor offered superior cycling stability of 99.3% retention even after 10 000 cycles, and meanwhile showed good mechanical stability, maintaining the areal capacitance of 90.3% retention after 1000 bending times at a radius of 5 mm, which mainly attribute to the embedded nature of the interdigital current collector. With excellent transparency, flexibility, and capacitance properties, the planar supercapacitor shows great potential in portable and comfortable designs for transparent wearable electronic device.
