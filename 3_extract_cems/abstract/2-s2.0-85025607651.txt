A type of porous ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) was prepared by a template-assisted method. The ZFO precursor solution was impregnated into the hard-template polystyrene (PS) microspheres. The porous ZFO sample was obtained after the removal of PS microspheres template by calcination in air. The results indicate that the ZFO sample is successfully prepared and exhibits a porous structure. Electrochemical tests show that the specific capacitance of the porous ZFO is 301.8 F g−1 at the scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. In addition, the porous ZFO sample displays an excellent cycling stability in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Nearly 140.97% of its initial capacitance can be observed after 5000 cycles when the cycling current density is 2 A g−1.
