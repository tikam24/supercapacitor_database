Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide composite (FFGC) was fabricated by a hydrothermal method for the exploration of electrochemical energy storage, where the Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheet uniformly. Interestingly, the TEM image showed that visible micro-cracks were appeared on the surface of flower-like Fe2O3 NP, which did not interfere with its stably crystalline structure. Herein, FFGC was investigated as anode material for lithium-ion battery (LIB) as well as electrode material for supercapacitor (SC). For instance, the specific discharge capacity was of 1366 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in LIB case, while the specific capacitance of 318.9 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in SC experiment. On the other hand, FFGC exhibited the excellently steady performance in either LIB or SC experiment. Those results suggest the roseate future of FFGC in the application of energy issues.
