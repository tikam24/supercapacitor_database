A facile strategy is developed for the in situ synthesis of low-cost, freestanding, binder-free CuO nanotube electrodes on a conducting Cu foil, totally eliminating non-active materials and extra processing steps. The synergy arising from the ameliorating structure, such as high porosity, large surface area and the ability for fast electron transport, make CuO nanotube electrodes ideal multi-functional electrochemical devices with excellent pseudocapacitive performance and a remarkable sensitivity to glucose for use as non-enzymatic biosensors (NGBs). The electrodes deliver remarkable specific capacitances of 442 and 358 F g-1 at current densities of 1 and 20 A g-1, respectively. The capacitance loss after 5000 cycles is only 4.6% at 1 A g-1, reflecting the excellent cyclic stability of the supercapacitor. The biosensor made from CuO nanotubes presents an extremely rapid and accurate response to glucose in blood in a wide, linear range of 100 μM to 3 mM, with a sensitivity of 2231 μA mM-1 cm-2. These interesting discoveries may open up the potential for the further development of new, multi-functional electrodes possessing both excellent energy storage and biosensory capabilities.
