A shape-memory, fiber-shaped supercapacitor is developed by winding aligned carbon nanotube sheets on a shape-memory polyurethane substrate. Despite its flexibility and stretchability, the deformed shapes under bending and stretching can be "frozen" as expected and recovered to the original state when required. Its electrochemical performances are well-maintained during deformation, at the deformed state and after the recovery. A smart supercapacitor: A shape-memory supercapacitor was developed by winding carbon nanotube sheets on a shape-memory polyurethane substrate (see picture). Its electrochemical performances are well maintained during deformation, at the deformed state and after the recovery.
