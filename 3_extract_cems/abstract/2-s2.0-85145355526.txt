A microwave irradiation technique was utilized to fabricate SnO2 nanostructured electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. The as-synthesized materials were investigated and analyzed using various characterization instruments. The outcomes emphasized the synthesis of pure tetragonal-structured SnO2 in the rutile phase. The N2-adsorption-desorption analysis demonstrated that the produced SnO2 with a maximum wide distribution of 18.4 nm pore diameter and a 0.198 cm3 g−1 pore volume. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance of annealed SnO2 nanostructured was enhanced compared with pristine SnO2. The as-prepared electrode of SnO2 delivered the maximum specific capacitance and specific capacity of 407 F g−1 and 163 C g−1, respectively, at 1 A g−1. A hybrid supercapacitor cell was designed for a real application utilizing the as-synthesized SnO2 as cathode, whereas activated carbon served as the anode. This result led to supplying remarkable specific energy of 34 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 773 W kg−1 and delivering an outstanding cycling performance retaining 87 % of its initial capacity even after 3000 charge/discharge cycles. These superior electrochemical features suggest that the SnO2 nanostructured could be employed as active materials in supercapacitor systems with a high energy density.
