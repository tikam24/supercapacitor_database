This paper developed a simple and inexpensive approach of boiling water-bath with simultaneous magnetic stirring to synthesize MnO2 nanomaterials. In this paper, we proposed a novel structure of conducting graphite (G)/MnO2 nanoflower (NF) hybrid electrodes, in which conducting graphite and MnO2 nanomaterials hybrid solution were uniformally naturally deposited onto carbon paper. Such NF structures effectively decrease the charge transport resistance and facilitate ion or electron transmission in the electrode. G/MnO2 NF hybrid electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance (Cs) of 506 F/g, high energy/power density, and excellent cycling stability with 94% capacitance retained over 2000 cycles. Furthermore, symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) with G/MnO2 NF hybrid materials as electrodes were successfully fabricated, which achieved promising characteristics with a maximum energy density of 11.72 Wh/kg and a power density of 16.88 kW/kg. Such low-cost, high-performance carbon paper-based G/MnO2 NF hybrid electrodes can hold promise for superior performance supercapacitors.
