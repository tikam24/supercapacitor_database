Different nanostructures of β-Ni(OH) 2 have been successfully developed using simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method from different nickel precursors. Effect of different nickel precursors on structural, morphological and supercapacitive properties of β-Ni(OH) 2 thin films have been investigated. The formation of nanocrystallinity and β-phase of Ni(OH) 2 are confirmed by X-ray diffraction and FTIR studies. Scanning electron microscope study revealed the formation of multilayer nanosheets, up grown nanofalkes and interconnected, macroporous; honeycomb-like structures of β-Ni(OH) 2 films. BET analyses showed that nanoflakes and honeycomb like structure have high surface area of 75 and 65 m 2 g -1 with micro and mesopores network. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the β-Ni(OH) 2 films are examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge studies. The β-Ni(OH) 2 films showed pseudocapacitive behavior with maximum supercapacitance of 462 F g -1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte, suggesting its potential application in electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
