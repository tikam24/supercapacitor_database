Co3O4-Ni-MOF composite was successfully prepared by solvent-thermal method and then was combined with acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); the resulting Co3O4-Ni-MOF/MWCNTs hybrid was applied in supercapacitor and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The electrochemical tests including cyclic voltammetric (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cycle life were also performed to investigate the supercapacitor properties of the as-prepared materials. The experimental results show that when the molar ratio of metal oxide material and Ni-MOF material is 1:1, Co3O4-Ni-MOF material displays better electrochemical performance. As the mass ratio of Co3O4-Ni-MOF and MWCNTs is 1:1, Co3O4-Ni-MOF/MWCNTs hybrid exhibits lower Rct value, higher cyclic capacitance stability, and better supercapacitor performance. Therefore, Co3O4-Ni-MOF/MWCNTs hybrid as an electrode material has a relatively ideal application prospect in terms of supercapacitor materials.
