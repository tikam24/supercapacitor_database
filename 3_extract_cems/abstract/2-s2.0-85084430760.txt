A Cu2O/Cu columnar array electrode that integrates the active materials and current collector was fabricated through in situ thermal oxidation of the chemically dealloyed Cu–Fe film prepared by co-electrodeposition using copper sulfate and ferric sulfate as raw materials. The effects of the ratio of copper ion to iron ion; the valence of iron ion; and the thermal oxidation temperature on the morphology, structure, and electrochemical properties of the electrode were investigated. Results show that the columnar array electrode not only has a large specific surface area but also has good conductivity, which can effectively improve the utilization of the active material and endow the electrode with an excellent capacitance performance. The prepared electrodes make a reversible redox reaction corresponding to the transformation between Cu2O and Cu within the potential window from − 1 to − 0.2 V in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The areal capacitance of the optimal electrode is found to be as high as 128.6 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s, and it shows a capacitance retention of 83.8% after being subjected 5000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 9 mA/cm2, indicating good electrochemical stability.
