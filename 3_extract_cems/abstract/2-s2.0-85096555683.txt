Nanocomposite metal oxides have been attracted great attention in the electrode material of supercapacitor. Herein, a novel Ag/Ni hetero-metallic complex with the hamburger-like structure was prepared, which was then calcined to form Ag/NiO nanocomposite via in-situ preparation. The in-situ formed Ag/NiO exhibits a very high capacitance of 1480 F g −1 at a current density of 0.6 A g−1 in 1 M KOH solution, and the cycling stability was retained about 85% after 3000 cycles with the current of 5 A g−1. The results showed that the in-situ formed Ag/NiO derived from hetero-metallic MOF possess high specific capacitance, which could provide a new effective strategy to improve the conductivity of metal oxides nanocomposite.
