In this work, Fe(II)-based metal organic framework (MOF), Zn-based MOF and hybrid poly orthoaminophenol/MOF composite were synthesized via a chemical method. Synthesized composite films have been characterized by conventional electrochemical methods and computational approach. The computational results show that both Zn-BTC and Fe-BTC interact well with 3POAP. Meanwhile, the adsorption energy of 3POAP on Fe-BTC is 2.03 eV higher than that of Zn-BTC. Therefore, it can be mentioned that the high adsorption energy of conductive polymer POAP on Fe-BTC compared to Zn-BTC has led to its better performance as the electrode of supercapacitors and these findings confirm the electrochemical results. It was found that in Zn-BTC/3POAP and Fe-BTC/3POAP systems the charge is transferred from the 3POAP to the MOFs. The results showed that the charge transfer from 3POAP to Fe-BTC is more than Zn-BTC which is a confirmation of the higher adsorption of 3POAP on Fe-BTC. The 3D periodic structure of Fe-BTC is generated by binuclear Fe(II) paddlewheel building units (PBUs) connected via the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate organic ligands. Also, the adsorption energy of 3POAP on Fe2(PhCOO)4 and Zn2(PhCOO)4 was calculated using supermolecular approach. These results are compatible with the adsorption energy obtained from the periodic calculations, so that the adsorption of Fe structure was more than that of Zn. The Fe2(PhCOO)4â€¦3POAP structure has the lowest band gap energy, so it can be concluded that the better adsorption of 3POAP on Fe-BTC not only results in higher adsorption energy, but also better electrical conductivity than the Zn-BTC. Computational results are in agreement with electrochemical results.
