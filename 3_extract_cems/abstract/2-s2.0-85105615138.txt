Recently, electrochromic materials have been received more attention due to their potential application in low-power displays, anti-glare mirrors, energy-saving, and smart windows etc. In this work, uniform, adherent, conductive, and electroactive p-toluene sulfonic acid (pTS) doped polypyrrole (PPy) electrochromic films were prepared on conducting glass substrate (fluorine-doped tin dioxide, FTO) by constant-voltage electrochemical polymerization. It was found that electrochemical polymerization time had an important effect on the electrochromic performance of pTS/PPy films. Results showed that the pTS/PPy films obtained at 100 s of electrochemical polymerization exhibited outstanding electrochemical and optical properties. The maximum optical modulation and coloration efficiency was 74.4%, 254.7 cm2/C at 600 nm of wavelength, respectively. Simultaneously, the pTS/PPy film also showed good specific capacitance of 34.2 mF/cm2 under scan rate of 0.1 mA/cm2. The test of electrochromic energy storage performance, it revealed that the pTS/PPy-100 supercapacitors can light up the red light-emitting diode (LED). We believed that the as-prepared electrochromic pTS/PPy films may have potential application in fabrication of electrochromic and energy storage devices.
