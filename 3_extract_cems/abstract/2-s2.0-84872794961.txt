Carbon microtubes (CMTs) with large inner spacing were prepared by a simple in situ template approach under moderate conditions, in which metallic Zn powder and ethanol were used as raw material. The morphology and microstructure of the CMTs were characterized by SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XRD, and Raman spectrum. The as-obtained CMTs have a homogenous morphology with an internal diameter of about 1 μm, a wall thickness of 30 nm and several microns in length. The electrochemical performance of CMTs was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Experimental results show that the CMT material presented a high specific capacitance of 185 F g-1 at current density of 200 mA g-1. The better capacitive behavior of the CMTs demonstrates a promising electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
