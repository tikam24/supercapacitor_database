Carbon-based supercapacitor textiles with superior electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility have attracted considerable attention as an important category of smart wearable textiles. However, the time-consuming fabrication process and high production cost limit their practical application. Herein, inexpensive composite electrodes composed of commercial activated carbon (AC), carbonized asphalt (CA) derived from recycled asphalt pavement and fiberglass cloth (FGC) were prepared via a facile dip-coating method, followed by one-step carbonization process. The effects of carbonization temperature and the mass ratio of AC to asphalt on the structure and electrochemical performance of the AC/CA/FGC electrodes have been investigated. The AC/CA/FGC electrode prepared at optimum conditions has a high specific capacitance of 499.3 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2. The as-fabricated all-solid-state symmetric AC/CA/FGC supercapacitor exhibits excellent specific capacitance of 85.4 mF cm-2, power density of 1.23 mW cm-2, energy density of 7.60 Î¼Wh cm-2, 87% capacitance retention after 10000 charge/discharge cycles and outstanding mechanical flexibility. The desired overall performance, scalable manufacturing process and relatively low production cost demonstrate the potential of AC/CA/FGC supercapacitor textile for the application in high-performance energy storage textiles.
