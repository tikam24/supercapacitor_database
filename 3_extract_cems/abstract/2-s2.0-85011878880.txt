Mixed oxidation states of manganese oxides are widely used as the electrodes in supercapacitors due to their high theoretical pseudocapacitances. However, their charge storage mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, the charge storage mechanism of Mn3O4 or Mn2+(Mn3+)2O4 nanofibres was investigated using a synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) technique and an in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). The average oxidation state of the Mn in the as-synthesized Mn3O4 is +2.67. After the first charge, the average oxidation states of Mn at the positive and negative electrodes are +2.61 and +2.38, respectively. The significant change in the oxidation state of Mn at the negative electrode is due to phase transformation of Mn3O4 to NaδMnOx·nH2O. Meanwhile, the charge storage mechanism at the positive electrode mainly involves the adsorption of counter ions or solvated SO42−. After the first discharge, the calculated Mn average oxidation numbers are +2.51 and +2.53 at the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. At the negative electrode, the solvated Na+ is desorbed from the electrode surface. At the same time, the solvated SO42− is desorbed from the positive electrode. The mass change of solvated Na+ during charging/discharging is ca. 80 ng per cm2 of the Mn3O4 electrode. A symmetric supercapacitor constructed from Mn3O4 nanofibres in 0.5 M Na2SO4 provides a working potential of 1.8 V, a specific energy of 37.4 W h kg−1 and a maximum specific power of 11.1 kW kg−1 with 98% capacity retention over 4500 cycles. The understanding of the charge storage mechanism of the mixed oxidation states of Mn2+(Mn3+)2O4 presented in this work could lead to further development of metal oxide-based pseudocapacitors.
