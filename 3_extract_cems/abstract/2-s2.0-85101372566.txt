In this work, we report enhanced specific capactance and cycle stability of Fe-SnO2@CeO2 electrode for supercapacitor applications. The Fe-SnO2@CeO2 nanocomposite was synthesized through a simple chemical co-precipitation method. The electrochemical performances of the Fe-SnO2@CeO2 nanocomposite electrode are assessed by using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance spectroscopy techniques. In three electrode system, the Fe-SnO2@CeO2 nanocomposite electrode is exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 348 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Further, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device performance has been evaluated and the ASC device produces a specific energy and specific power of 32.2 W h kg−1 and 747 W kg−1 at a current density of 1A/g, respectively. The device exhibited the capacitance retention of 85.05 % over 5000 cycles of operation. This study confirms that the Fe-SnO2@CeO2 is an alternative electrode material for high energy storage supercapacitor applications.
