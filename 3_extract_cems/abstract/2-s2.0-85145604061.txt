More and more attention has been attracted to regulate the morphology and structure of cobalt-nickel based compounds electrode materials through metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and explore the performance of the assembly them into asymmetric capacitors. In this study, NiCo-Metal organic framework derived carbon (NiCo-NC) is utilized as metal embedded template to in situ epitaxial fabricate nanoflower-like cobalt nickel sulfide (named NiCo2S4@NC) using alcohol heating in ethylene glycol sulfurization. Due to the dual electrochemical activity of NiCo2S4 and NiCo-NC, the NiCo2S4@NC multi-modal nanohybrid possesses a promising specific capacitance of 1021.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the voltage window of − 1 to 0 V. Besides, ultrathin cobalt nickel hydroxide nanosheets are in situ introduction on the surface of NC skeleton (NiCo-LDH@NC) with the help of absolute ethanol and L-ascorbic acid, which behave an excellent capacitance of 988.2 F g−1 (164.7 mA h g−1) at 1 A g−1, and exhibit an extraordinary charge-discharge stability. Due to the high conductivity of NC derived from NiCo-MOF, the appearance of more reaction sites after vulcanization and the specific hierarchical structure of cobalt nickel hydroxide, the assembled NiCo-LDH@NC//NiCo2S4@NC asymmetric supercapacitor device delivers a great energy density of 61.5 W h kg−1 (at 426.6 W kg−1) and pronounced cycle stability (retention of 92.7 % over 5000 cycles). This work provides a feasible strategy towards the practical application in supercapacitors using nickel cobalt multi-active centers with special morphology as high-efficiency and inexpensive electrode materials.
