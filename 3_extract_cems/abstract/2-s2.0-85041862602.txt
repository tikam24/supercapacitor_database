Ultrathin nanoflakes surface architecture of MoS2 thin film has been successfully decorated by simple and inexpensive chemical bath deposition onto dip and dry coated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to compare electrochemical performance with respect to individual MWCNTs and MoS2 thin films on flexible stainless steel (SS) substrates. Two dimensional thin films of MWCNTs, MoS2 and MoS2/MWCNTs (MCT) have been characterized through X-ray diffraction, X-ray photospectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and scanning/transmission electron microscopes. The unique nanostructured morphology of well anchored nanoflakes over MWCNTs enhances the value of specific capacitance and improves the cycle stability compare to bare MoS2. Strikingly, all-solid-state (ASS) symmetric SS/MCT//MCT/SS supercapacitor device has been constructed using flexible stainless steel substrate with the aid of PVA-LiClO4 gel electrolyte and results are discussed herein.
