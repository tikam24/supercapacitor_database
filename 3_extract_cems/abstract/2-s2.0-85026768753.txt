This paper focuses on improving the stability of a microgrid (MG) supplied by a self-excited induction generator (SEIG) during overloads. The voltage and frequency control is ensured by a voltage source inverter (VSI), in cooperation with a Dump Load (DL) connected on the VSI DC side. In order to enhance the MG stability, a short-term energy storage system based on a supercapacitor (SC) is added to the MG control system, while non-critical loads are interfaced through a controlled circuit breaker. During overloads, the SC will inject power into the MG DC-link as long as its state-of-charge (SOC) is kept over a pre-defined level. After this level is reached, the non-critical loads will be disconnected, and the SC will begin to charge. The overload regime is created either by the connection of a massive resistive load or by the direct starting and loading of a significant power induction motor (IM). Simulations performed in Matlab/Simulink are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control structure.
