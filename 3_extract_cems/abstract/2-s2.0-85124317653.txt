Carbon nanostructures are promising materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. Whereas, the main problem of these types of materials unresolved is the difficulty of achieving high specific capacitance. The efficient strategies to prepare carbon materials with improved electrochemical performances for supercapacitors have sparked numerous demands. Here, we demonstrated that the dual-heteroatom-doped carbon can be prepared by eco-friendly, simple route on a very large scale. Phosphorus/ Oxygen co-doped carbon nanosheets were synthesized by design a layered nanoreactor including gallate and phosphate anions. Under heat treatment at 700 °C, the reaction between gallate and phosphate anions resulted in production of Phosphorus/ Oxygen co-doped carbon nanosheets which can be utilized for practical supercapacitor applications. The obtained carbon materials showed highly porous structures with suitable micro/mesopores and efficient electrochemical performance in an alkaline medium. In addition, the carbon gallate phosphate (CGP) electrode had high specific surface area capacitance of 63.05 µF cm−2 in 1 M KOH, as well as good rate capabilities, supreme rectangular cycle performance and very low Ohmic resistance for charge–discharge curves. Thus, this low cost and facile strategy provides a new approach for designing high-performance electrodes with exceptional volumetric capacitance and prominent electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
