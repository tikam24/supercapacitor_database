Herein, a green, scalable and template-free deposition of self-assembled NiS-SnS (NTS) heterostructure is proposed by using SILAR (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method on a nickel foam substrate). In the assembled solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor devices, electrode materials of NTS hetero-structure exhibit remarkable high specific capacitance value of 1653 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1, significant-high energy density of 83 Whkg−1 at a power density of 117 Wkg−1 with excellent rate capability and cyclic stability (98 % after 4000 cycles). Moreover, NTS heterostructures with high performance are highly efficient to lighten commercial light-emitting diode, substantiating that SILAR based formation of NTS hetero-structure is promising for the next generation superior supercapacitor devices.
