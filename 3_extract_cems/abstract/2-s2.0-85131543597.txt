Electrochemical devices that harvest or store electrical energy are indispensable to our daily life and are currently of growing importance in the future prosperity of the world economy. The sol–gel technology has contributed substantially to the development of electrode materials and electrocatalysts, particularly in terms of the synthesis of nano-sized and/or nanostructured particles. As with the other application fields, nanomaterials with enriched active surface sites can enhance electrode performance, and hence, have been substituted for the classical low-surface-area electrodes like rods and plates. However, the powdery nanomaterials need to be fixed on an electrode substrate in a mixture with binders and conductive agents, which imposes several drawbacks especially in fundamental research. In this context, free-standing and binder-free monolithic electrodes bearing rationally designed nanostructures have emerged as advanced electrode materials based on the concept of incorporating the nanomaterials into the classical bulky electrodes. This review focuses on the recent progress in porous monolithic electrodes with special concern for those with three-dimensionally interconnected porous structures prepared via the sol–gel processes accompanied by phase separation. In addition to the synthesis and pore control for various electrode materials, the insights garnered from the electrochemical investigations on the porous monolithic electrodes are overviewed.
