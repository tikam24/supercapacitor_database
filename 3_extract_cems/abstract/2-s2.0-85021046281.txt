For the electric vehicle's defects of short continued driving mileage, easy battery aging, poor climbing ability and low energy recovery efficiency, the high power density and long cycling life hybrid power system of the super capacitor-battery based on the super capacitor auxiliary is studied. Based on the structure of the super capacitor-battery system, the driving mode of the electric vehicle is analyzed and the super capacitor charging model is built; meantime, the super capacitor battery hybrid power system is built and simulated. Simulation and experimental results show that the hybrid power system can effectively recover the braking energy, make up the defects of the battery low energy density and low power density, improve the electric vehicle power performance and power utilization. So this system can make the electric vehicle continued driving mileage longer, effectively reduce the battery voltage and current amplitude fluctuations as well as prolong the battery service life.
