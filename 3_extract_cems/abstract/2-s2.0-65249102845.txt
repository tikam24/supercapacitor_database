In this study, activated carbon (AC)-Fe3O4 nanoparticles asymmetric supercapacitor cells have been assembled and characterized in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte for the first time. The nanostructure Fe3O4 was prepared by the microwave method. It only cost several minutes to prepare magnetite nanoparticles with average particle size of 35 nm. The electrochemical performances of the hybrid AC-Fe3O4 supercapacitor were tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results show that the asymmetric supercapacitor has electrochemical capacitance performance within potential range 0-1.2 V. The supercapacitor delivered a specific capacitance of 37.9 F/g at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. The result of cyclic characteristic test showed that it also can keep 82% of initial capacity over 500 cycles. Â© 2009 American Chemical Society.
