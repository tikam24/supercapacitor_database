In this paper, examples of polarization measurements with a battery, electric double-layer capacitor, and fuel cell are discussed. The analysis of the polarization of a real cell and analytical methodology are described. In battery section, the rate capability is examined in detail and the origin of the different rate properties is discussed. Charge/discharge tests and self-discharge measurements are performed in the electric double-layer capacitor. Detailed measurement conditions and data analysis methods are introduced in the fuel cell section. The contents indicated in each section are very useful for interpreting the obtained experimental data.
