The interest in supercapacitors, which are energy storage/conversion systems of high power for applications ranging from transportation to stand-alone or grid-connected power plants, is growing worldwide. Various electrode and electrolyte chemistries and cell configurations are under study for the development of safe high-energy supercapacitors without sacrificing power capability and cycling stability. This article focuses on the use of ionic liquids (ILs) as solvent-free electrolytes. A survey of the physical-chemical properties of the most investigated ILs is given to highlight the main requirements for effective use of ILs in supercapacitors. The properties of electrode materials for IL-based supercapacitors, which should be tailored in relation to the nature of the IL, are discussed and particular emphasis is given to double-layer carbon materials. Cell configurations of IL-based supercapacitors with capacitive and pseudocapacitive electrode materials, which make possible the high cell voltages permitted by the wide electrochemical stability window (ESW) of the ILs, are also described.
