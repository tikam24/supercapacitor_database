This paper proposes a novel compound-type hybrid energy storage system (HESS) that inherits the unique advantages of both battery/supercapacitor (SC) and the SC/battery HESSs for electric vehicles (EVs). Eight operation modes are designed to match this system. A mode control strategy is developed for this HESS on the basis of these modes, and five classes of operation modes are established to simplify this strategy. The mode control strategy focuses on high operating efficiency and high power output. Furthermore, the compound-type HESS is designed such that the SC is the main priority in braking energy absorption. Thus, this HESS can operate efficiently and extend battery life. Simulation results also show that the compound-type HESS can not only supply adequate power to the motor inverter but can also determine suitable operation modes in corresponding conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that this HESS can extend battery life as well. The overall efficiency of the compound-type HESS is higher than those of the battery/SC and the SC/battery HESSs.
