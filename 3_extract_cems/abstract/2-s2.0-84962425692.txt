Aiming at the hybrid energy storage units with AC bus lines in distributed generation system, this paper puts forward a power allocation strategy for the hybrid energy storage units. The method retarded the over-charge/over-discharge phenomena of the energy storage units by adjusting the SOC values of the energy storage units in a certain range, through the power command of low-pass filterâ€™s effective distribution between the battery and super-capacitor, according to the SOC value of the battery and super-capacitor. At the same time, it took the state of charge/discharge into account, adjust the filter time constant to ensure that the SOC value of the energy storage units is maintained in a certain range. In PSCAD, the simulation results prove the effectiveness of power allocation strategy in hybrid energy storage units.
