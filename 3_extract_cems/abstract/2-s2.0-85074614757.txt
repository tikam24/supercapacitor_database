Flexible asymmetric supercapacitors are more appealing in flexible electronics because of high power density, wide cell voltage, and higher energy density than symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte. In virtues of excellent conductivity, rich porous structure and interconnected honeycomb structure, three dimensional graphene aerogels show great potential as electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors. However, graphene aerogels are rarely used in flexible asymmetric supercapacitors because of easily re-stacking of graphene sheets, resulting in low electrochemical activity. Herein, flower-like hierarchical Mn3O4 and carbon nanohorns are incorporated into three dimensional graphene aerogels to restrain the stack of graphene sheets, and are applied as the positive and negative electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors devices, respectively. Besides, a strong chemical coupling between Mn3O4 and graphene via the C-O-Mn linkage is constructed and can provide a good electron-transport pathway during cycles. Consequently, the asymmetric supercapacitor device shows high rate cycle stability (87.8 % after 5000 cycles) and achieves a high energy density of 17.4 μWh cm−2 with power density of 14.1 mW cm−2 (156.7 mW cm−3) at 1.4 V.
