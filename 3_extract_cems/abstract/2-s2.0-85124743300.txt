To address the demand of modern energy storage systems, innovative electrode materials with distinctive morphologies, cyclic stability, and electrical conductivity must be synthesized. The strong electrical conductivity of the synthesized electrode material allows them to attain high specific capacitance while maintaining a high energy density. In present study, we have designed novel spinel MnCr2O4 nanostructures, which display better structural, morphological, and electrochemical performance confirmed from X-rays diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and potentiostat, respectively. The synthesized material attains crystallites size of 52 nm, and cubic shape morphologies with average particle size (59 nm). At low current density (0.1 Ag−1), the synthesized MnCr2O4 nanostructures electrode reaches a specific capacitance of 1656 Fg−1 and high specific energy (184 Whkg−1) with a specific power of 17.25 W kg−1. Up to 1000 charging discharging cycles, the fabricated electrode demonstrates high cyclic stability with 78% retention. MnCr2O4 nanostructure shows a great potential toward electrode material in future energy storage devices due to their high energy, power density and remarkable cyclic stability.
