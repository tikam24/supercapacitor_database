Manganese dioxide nanowires (MnO2 NWs) anchored on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) were fabricated through a simple hydrothermal reaction and used as integrated electrodes for supercapacitor. The morphology-dependent electrochemical performance of MnO2 NWs was confirmed, yielding good capacitance performance with a high specific capacitance of 3.88F·cm-2 at a charge-discharge current density of 5mA·cm-2 and excellent stability of 91.5% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. Moreover, the composite electrodes were used to fabricate supercapacitors, which showed a high specific capacitance of 194mF·cm-2 at a charge-discharge current density of 2mA·cm-2 and high energy density of 0.108mWh·cm-2 at power density of 2mW·cm-2, foreboding its potential application for high-performance supercapacitor.
