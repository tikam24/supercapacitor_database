The paper presents a mathematical model of a permanent magnet motor, powered by a three-phase source of sinusoidal voltage and a control method. The cooperation of the numerical integration algorithms of the system of differential equations of the motor and inverter has been verified. The results of numerical simulations are presented in graphic form. The work is a supplement to the publication [1], which proposed a model: a battery, a supercapacitor and a method of controlling these energy sources during the driving cycle of the vehicle.
