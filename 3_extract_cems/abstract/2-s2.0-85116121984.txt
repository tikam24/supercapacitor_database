A passive methane sensor based on a catalytic sensor was developed and investigated. The sensor is activated when an NFC signal source (mobile phone) approaches it. In the case when the radio frequency field becomes strong enough, the NFC energy is accumulated in the supercapacitor. After the required voltage value is reached on the supercapacitor, power is supplied to the sensor control circuit and a single measurement is performed. The energy value, which is necessary to perform measurements is approximately 88.7 mJ. A mobile phone acts also as the sensor reader.
