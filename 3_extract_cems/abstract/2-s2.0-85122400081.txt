In this work, a method for the formation of planar supercapacitors, which combines electrophoretic deposition of composite electrode materials based on CNTs and ruthenium oxide, and laser engraving, is proposed. The features of electrophoretic deposition are considered and the influence of the main technological modes on the morphology and composition of the formed layers of electrode materials is determined. The conducted studies of the electrophysical characteristics of the formed samples confirmed the possibility of producing planar capacitors with a high capacity and their potential applicability for a number of applications in microelectronics.
