The one-step synthesis of heteroatom-doped porous carbons is reported with the in situ formation of cobalt oxide nanoparticles for dual electrochemical applications (i.e., electrochemical sensor and supercapacitor). A single molecular template of zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) was utilized for the solid-state synthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticle–decorated nitrogen-doped porous carbon (Co3O4@NPC) nanocomposite through a facile calcination treatment. For the first time, Co3O4@NPC nanocomposite derived from ZIF-67 has been applied as an electrode material for the efficient electrochemical detection of anticancer drug flutamide (FLU). The cyclic voltammetry studies were performed in the operating potential from 0.15 to − 0.65 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Interestingly, the fabricated drug sensor exhibited a very low reduction potential (− 0.42 V) compared to other reported sensors. The fabricated sensor exhibited good analytical performance in terms of low detection limit (12 nM), wide linear range (0.5 to 400 μM), and appreciable recovery results (~ 98%, RSD 1.7% (n = 3)) in a human urine sample. Hereafter, we also examined the supercapacitor performance of the Co3O4@NPC-modified Ni foam in a 1M KOH electrolyte, and noticeable a specific capacitance of 525 F g−1 at 1.5 A g−1 was attained, with long-term cycling stability. The Co3O4@NPC nanocomposite supercapacitor experiments outperform the associated MOF-derived carbons and the Co3O4-based nanostructure-modified electrodes.
