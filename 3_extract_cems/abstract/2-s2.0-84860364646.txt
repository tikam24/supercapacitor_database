Dendrite-like Co 3O 4 nanostructure, made up of many nanorods with diameters of 15-20 nm and lengths of 2-3 μm, has been successfully prepared by calcining the corresponding nanostructured Co-8-hydroxyquinoline coordination precursor in air. The Co 3O 4 nanostructure was evaluated as an electrochemical sensor for H 2O 2 detection and the results reveal that it has good linear dependence and high sensitivity to H 2O 2 concentration changes. As an electrode material of a supercapacitor, it was found that the nanostructured Co 3O 4 electrode exhibits high specific capacitance and long cycle life. The Co 3O 4 nanostructure also has good catalytic properties and is steadily active for CO oxidation, giving 100% CO conversion at low temperatures. The multifunctional Co 3O 4 nanostructure would be a promising functional nanomaterial applied in multi industrialized fields. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
