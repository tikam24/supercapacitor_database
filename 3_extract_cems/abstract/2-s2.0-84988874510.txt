MoS2/RGO composite hollow microspheres were hydrothermally synthesized by using SiO2/GO microspheres as a template, which were obtained via the sonication-assisted interfacial self-assembly of tiny GO sheets on positively charged SiO2 microspheres. The structure, morphology, phase, and chemical composition of MoS2/RGO hollow microspheres were systematically investigated by a series of techniques such as FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, TGA, BET, and Raman characterizations, meanwhile, their electrochemical properties were carefully evaluated by CV, GCD, and EIS measurements. It was found that MoS2/RGO hollow microspheres possessed unique porous hollow architecture with high-level hierarchy and large specific surface area up to 63.7 m2 g-1. When used as supercapacitor electrode material, MoS2/RGO hollow microspheres delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 218.1 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1, which was much higher than that of contrastive bare MoS2 microspheres developed in the present work and most of other reported MoS2-based materials. The enhancement of supercapacitive behaviors of MoS2/RGO hollow microspheres was likely due to the improved conductivity together with their distinct structure and morphology, which not only promoted the charge transport but also facilitated the electrolyte diffusion. Moreover, MoS2/RGO hollow microsphere electrode displayed satisfactory long-term stability with 91.8% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles at the current density of 3 A g-1, showing excellent application potential.
