Transport electrification have uplifted in technological world in aspect of ease of life with environmental protection. There are many challenges to be faced to make vehicle more viable to use and some problems with solutions are explained in this paper. In this regards, Power management between dual electric storage system can results in enhancing battery life span and increasing efficiency of electric vehicle. Supercapacitor has been used as an auxiliary source to support battery by operating in transients. In addition to power management, joint estimation of SOC and SOP has been done using kalman filtering and at conclusive stage battery power is optimised with the help of SOP. Two novel fuzzy logic control strategies have been proposed and discussed. The system model simulation has been done using MATLAB
