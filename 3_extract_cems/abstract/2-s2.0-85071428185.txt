Abstract: Novel nanorod-like manganese-based metal–organic frameworks (Mn-MOFs) were prepared through a facile solvothermal method using 1,3,5-benzentricarboxylic acid as organic linker and applied as electroactive material for supercapacitors. The Mn-MOFs exhibited a high-specific capacitance of 371 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and an excellent rate capability even if the current density was promoted to 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the designed asymmetric supercapacitors with Mn-MOFs as cathode, graphene as anode and 6 mol L−1 KOH as electrolyte delivered a specific capacitance of 89 F g−1 in the working potential range of 0 to 1.6 V and the energy density can reach 31.6 Wh kg−1. Notably, the specific capacitance of the fabricated hybrid supercapacitors retained 91.8% of the initial capacitance after successive 10,000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. These results suggest that the as-synthesized nanorod-shaped Mn-MOFs can act as promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Graphical abstract: Nanorod-like Mn-MOFs were prepared and investigated as promising electroactive nanomaterials for supercapacitors, which exhibited a high-specific capacitance of 371 F g-1, excellent rate capability and long cycle life with an eminent energy density of 31.6 Wh kg-1 for the designed Mn-MOFs//graphene supercapacitor.
