Very high pressure (VHP) was employed to synthesize polypyrrole (Ppy) films. We observed high specific capacitance, excellent rate performance, and report the specific energy for Ppy films in supercapacitor electrodes. The Ppy film electrode synthesized under the VHP of 500 MPa exhibited high specific capacitance (526 F/g) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. This specific capacitance was about two times higher than that was observed with electrodes prepared under ambient pressure in an acidic electrolyte. With an extremely high current density of 8 A/g, a specific energy of 109.8 Wh/kg was obtained for a Ppy film electrode synthesized under the VHP of 500 MPa. In addition, Ppy film electrodes prepared under the VHP of 500 MPa demonstrated cycling stability after 1000 charge-discharge cycles (potential window of -0.2 ~~ 0.8 V, current density of 8 A/g) with 74.6 % retention of the initial capacitance. The stability of VHP-synthesized PPy film electrodes is superior to that of Ppy film electrodes prepared under ambient conditions.
