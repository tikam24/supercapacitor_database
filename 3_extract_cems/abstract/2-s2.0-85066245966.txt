Functional hydrogels are an attractive material platform for energy-storage technologies. Thus, the development of hydrogels with enhanced physicochemical properties (e.g., improved mechanical strength, flexibility, and charge transport) offers new opportunities for next-generation batteries and supercapacitors. Armed with a deeper understanding of gelation chemistry, researchers have made significant strides toward fabricating hydrogels that are stimulus responsive, self-healing, and highly stretchable. In this short review, we highlight how hydrogels have been integrated into batteries and supercapacitors and provide exciting examples that demonstrate the versatility of hydrogels; namely, tailorable architectures, conductive nanostructures, 3D frameworks, and multifunctionalities. It is anticipated that creative and combinatorial approaches used in the design of functional hydrogels will continue to yield materials with great potential in the field of energy storage.
