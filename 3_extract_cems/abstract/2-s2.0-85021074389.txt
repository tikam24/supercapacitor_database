This work is devoted to the synthesis of magnetic iron oxides nanoparticles with very high saturation magnetization to be qualified for supercapacitor applications using, a simple electrodeposition technique. It is found that the electrochemical reduction process depends on concentration, temperature, deposition potential and the scan rate of potential. The nature of electrodeposition process has been characterized via voltammetric and chronoamperometric techniques. The morphology of the electrodeposits has been investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The structure and phase content of these investigated electrodeposits have been examined and calculated. The obtained iron oxides show a high saturation magnetization (Ms) of about 229 emu g−1. The data exhibited a relation between Ms of electrodeposited iron oxide and specific capacitance. This relation exhibits that the highest Ms value of electrodeposited iron oxides gives also highest specific capacitance of about 725 Fg−1. Moreover, the electrodeposited iron oxides exhibit a very good stability. The new characteristics of the electro synthesized iron oxides at our optimized conditions, strongly qualify them as a valuable material for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
