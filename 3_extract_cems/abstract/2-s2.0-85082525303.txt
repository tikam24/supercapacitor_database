The paper discusses design of supercapacitor-based energy recovery system for elevators. The main element of such system is bi-directional DC-DC converter to control energy flow from and to supercapacitor-based energy storage. In particular case interleaved converter structure was used which allows modularity of the converter to more easily change rated power of the converter. The test results of experimental prototype on a developed test bench are presented in the paper.
