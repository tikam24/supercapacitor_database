In this communication, a Ni doped PBCO in the B-position is proposed, the as-synthesized PrBaCo2-xNixO5+δ (PBCNx) material was used as the electrode of oxygen ion-embedded pseudocapacitor and assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor. The PrBaCo2-xNixO5+δ (x = 0.4, expressed as PBCN04) exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with the maximum specific capacity of 513.1 C g−1, the maximum energy density of PBCN04 //AC device is 48.3 Wh kg−1 and the maximum power density is 20011.8 W kg−1. Those results offer a suitable design of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
