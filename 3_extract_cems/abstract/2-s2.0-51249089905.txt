The present article demonstrates the use of low-cost electrochemically synthesized hydrophilic and nanocrystalline tin oxide film electrodes at room temperature in dye-sensitized solar cells and electrochemical supercapacitors. A mixed phase of tin instead of single phase composed of uniformly distributed irregular spherical grains in a nanometer regime scale was obtained. Tin oxide film electrode showed efficient photoperformance when subjected to dye-sensitized solar cells. The interfacial and specific capacitances of 118.4 μF/cm2 and 43.07 F/g, respectively, in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte were confirmed from cyclic-voltammetry measurement. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
