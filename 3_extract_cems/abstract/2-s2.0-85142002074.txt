The advancement in structured nanomaterials is crucial for the development of supercapacitor electrode materials. Current challenges in electrode materials, such as high-volume change, poor electronic/ionic conductivity, low energy density, and biocompatibility have been significantly improved by evaluating numerous nanostructures. Among various nanostructures, nanomaterials with three-dimensional structures have been greatly explored, emphasizing larger electrochemical active surface areas beneficial as electrode materials. Herein, we summarized the material development of hierarchical structures resembling and mimicking earth-like and marine life-like morphology for supercapacitor electrode materials. Further, we elucidated future ideas on the sustainable production of hierarchically nanostructured materials, assembly methods, and perspectives. Overall, the review aims to offer expanded research perspectives and insights not only into supercapacitor electrodes but into many other electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.
