A self-charging power system composed of cellulose organohydrogel based supercapacitor and triboelectric nanogenerator is constructed in the present work. Cellulose organohydrogels with flexibility, optical transparency, conductivity and excellent low temperature tolerance are fabricated via a dissolution and regeneration process. The optical transmittance, elongation at break, and conductivity of the cellulose organohydrogel reach 93%, 242%, and 1.92 S/m, as well as excellent anti-freezing property down to −54.3 °C, potential as flexible conductive device in harsh conditions. When demonstrated as energy storage device, the cellulose organohydrogel based supercapacitor demonstrates excellent supercapacitor performances, durability against deformation and resistance to low temperature. When demonstrated as energy harvesting device, the cellulose organohydrogel based triboelectric nanogenerator displays stability, and resistance to both low temperature and a large number of operation cycles. As the cellulose based triboelectric nanogenerator is integrated with cellulose based supercapacitor, a flexible and anti-freezing self-charging power system is built, capable of driving miniaturized electronics, demonstrating great potential as wearable power system in harsh conditions.
