Self-supporting AC (activated carbon)-FWCNT (few-wall carbon nanotubes) hybrid electrodes were fabricated by mixing of ACs with high specific surface area (SSA) and sub-millimeter-long FWCNTs. In order to fabricate the hybrid electrodes, AC and FWCNT were mixed in a weight ratio of 9:1, dispersed by bath-sonication and vacuum-filtrated on a membrane filter. The addition of FWCNTs gives conductivity and mechanical strength, and replace metallic current collectors in thick (0.1 mm) electrodes. For making an electrode, three different ACs that derived from walnut shell (WS), that from apricot stones (AS), and that commercially used for capacitors (YP-80F, Kuraray Chemical Co., Osaka Japan), were used with FWCNT in weight ratio of AC:FWCNT = 9:1. An electrode based only on FWCNT was also prepared as a reference for comparison. Electrochemical properties of the obtained electrodes were investigated by the cyclic voltammetry method (CV). Electrochemical characteristics were measured using the three-electrode cell contained of YP80F-FWCNT, AS-FWCNT, WS-FWCNT as a working electrode, a YP-80F-FWCNT counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode with an electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Also, the morphological properties of obtained electrodes were studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), the SSA was investigated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis. SSA, conductivity, and resistivity of AS-FWCNT and WS-FWCNT electrodes were summarized. Both the AS-FWCNT and WS-FWCNT hybrid electrodes showed specific capacitances of about 140 F/g at 1 mV/s and about 100 F/g at 100 mV/s, which are similar or even better than the AC-CNT hybrid electrode made of commercialized AC (YP-80F).
