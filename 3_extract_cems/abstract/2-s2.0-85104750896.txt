Fabricating supercapacitors (SCs) based on ionic liquid (IL) as an electrolyte is an effective strategy to enhance the devices' operating voltage and energy density. Herein, a novel MnO2-based electrode with superior electrochemical behaviors in IL electrolyte has been put forward. Remarkably, MnO2 nanoneedles are steadily wrapped by two-dimensional porous N-doped carbon (PNC) which is derived from graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) as the sacrificial template. Beneficial from abundant active sites, suitable porous structure and enhanced electric conductivity, the resultant MnO2/PNC electrode exhibits large specific capacitance, remarkable rate capability, and favorable electrochemical kinetics in IL electrolyte. As a result, a high-performance flexible SC with long-term cycling stability has been assembled based on the MnO2/PNC electrode and IL electrolyte, indicating its potential applications in flexible and portable electronics.
