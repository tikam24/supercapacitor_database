Silicon carbide (SiC) nanowires (NWs) are grown on flexible carbon fabric by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and Ni(OH)2 are deposited on the surface of SiC NWs by electrochemical cathodic deposition. The capacitive performance of the as-prepared electrode was calculated based on pure Ni(OH)2 and a very-high rate capability is achieved. A high specific capacitance of 1724 F g-1 is got at 2 A g-1 and the electrode still has a specific capacitance of 1412 F g-1 at an ultrahigh charging/discharging current density of 100 A g-1. The excellent rate capability means great power characteristics of the supercapacitor electrode. With the charge/discharge rate of 100 A g-1, a high power density of 27.5 kW kg-1 is achieved and the energy density still holds 59.4 Wh kg-1. Solid-state supercapacitor based on SiC NWs@Ni(OH)2 on carbon fabric is also made and shows good flexible and cycling properties.
