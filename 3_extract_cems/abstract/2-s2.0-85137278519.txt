β-Ni(OH)2 supported over g-C3N4 was synthesized by two simple approaches. Its catalytic activity in reducing hazardous para-nitrophenol (PNP) to the industrially important para-aminophenol (PAP) was studied in detail. The applicability of this material as a supercapacitor electrode was also studied. The material shows 100% conversion efficiency with a rate constant of 65.4410 × 10−3 s−1. The catalytic efficiency and the supercapacitor electrode behaviour of the material can be explained based on the structure of β-Ni(OH)2 nanoparticle and the synergy between β-Ni(OH)2 and g-C3N4.
