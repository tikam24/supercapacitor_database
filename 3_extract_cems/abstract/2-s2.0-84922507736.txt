To achieve a reasonable power split scheme of Li battery pack and supercapacitor hybrid electric vehicles, we propose dynamic programming (DP) based predictive control algorithm (PCA) in this paper. First, the model of the vehicle plant is established consisting of mathematical models of supercapacitor and Li battery pack. Then, the PCA based control system is designed in order to make full use of future road information. Thirdly, a DP-based-controller is proposed to minimize the cost function which consists of power loss and constrains of output. The simulation suggests that the proposed strategy can generate reasonable power split by taking the power loss, constraints of two sources and flatness of power output of Li battery pack into account.
