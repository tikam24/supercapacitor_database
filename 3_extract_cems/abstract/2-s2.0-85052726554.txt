Highly efficient electrode materials with high specific capacitance, good rate capability, and durable cycling stability are of great importance for supercapacitors (SCs). Herein, we report a highly active electrode material based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the supporter and copper cobalt bimetallic sulfide as the active material. The CuCo2S4/CNTs electrode exhibits a good electrochemical performance with a high specific capacity of 1690.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, good rate capability with 62.6 % capacitance retention at 50 A g−1, and good cycling stability that retains about 95.5 % of the capacitance after 10 000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitors (ACS) are self-assembled by using CuCo2S4/CNTs as the positive electrode and CNTs as the negative electrode, exhibiting a high energy density of 37.32 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800.7 W kg−1. This work provides directly empirical evidence for the design and optimization of the supercapacitive performance of transition-metal compounds.
