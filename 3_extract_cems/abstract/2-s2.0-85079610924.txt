Results of a study of the texture and electrochemical properties of polyaniline—carbon composites used as electrodes supercapacitor are presented. The composites were prepared by polymerization of aniline in the presence of carbon materials with different texture characteristics and monomer content. It was shown that the texture characteristics and electrochemical properties of the carbon/polyaniline composite materials are determined by porous structure of the starting carbon material and by the content of the polymer. The maximum specific capacitance (465 F g−1) was obtained for the composite material based on carbon material with specific surface area of 2290 m2 g−1 and polyaniline content of 61 wt %.
