As one kind of energy storage device that can be rapidly charged and discharged, supercapacitors have shown a broad application prospect in electric vehicles, micro-energy storage devices, aerospace, and other fields. Transition metal nitrogen/oxide films have excellent electrochemical properties and mechanical stabilities, which makes them promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. The thin films prepared by physical vapor deposition (PVD) possess advantages of easily adjusted composition and structure, good adhesion strength between the films and substrates, and large-scale production, which can be applied in the field of supercapacitors, especially for the preparation of flexible thin-film supercapacitors devices. In this paper, the research progress of nitrogen/oxide thin-film supercapacitors by PVD is reviewed. The feasibility of metal oxynitrides and multicomponent nitride thin-film electrodes prepared by PVD, and the development prospect of PVD flexible thin-film supercapacitors are discussed.
