Manganese and cerium (Mn-Ce) oxides were prepared under nitrogen and high-temperature oxidation via a bath precipitation method as materials for electrode assemblies in supercapacitors. The prepared Mn-Ce oxide composite was demonstrated to have a high specific capacitance of 163.7 F g−1 with 78.4% cyclic stability after 3000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirms that MnO2 improves the conductivity of CeO2. Results from XPS analysis suggest that the introduction of MnO2 enhances the concentrations of oxygen vacancies. Finally, band structure, density of states and Mulliken population were calculated using density functional theory, and the findings are consistent with the experimental and characterization results. Because of their excellent performances, Mn-Ce bimetallic oxides are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
