Graphene-based materials, including pure graphene, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide, and graphene-polymer nanocomposites, as well as graphene-nanoparticle metal hybrids, have found widespread application in both energy and environmental remediation technologies. This introductory chapter provides an overview of the major related areas where graphene-based materials are expected to have a significant impact. Among energy-related topics, the use of graphene-based materials in solar cells, supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and as catalysts for fuel cells is covered. Graphene-based materials possess several properties, including antimicrobial, adsorbent, and photocatalytic properties, that make them attractive for environmental applications. The latter half of this chapter focuses on recent developments in the use of graphene-based materials as environmentally benign solvents, sorbents, and photocatalytic materials for air, water, and soil decontamination, and as membranes for water treatment. A discussion of the main challenges that need to be overcome in order to fully integrate such technologies into existing processes is also provided.
