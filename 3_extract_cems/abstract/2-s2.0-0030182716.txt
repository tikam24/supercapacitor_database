Electrochemically conducting polymers represent an interesting class of materials for applications in electrochemical capacitors. This work illustrates the characteristics of a symmetric supercapacitor based on p-doped poly(pyrrole) electrodes and on a gel membrane as the electrolyte. The performance of the device has been tested by impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic discharges and prolonged cycling tests. The results indicate that high power densities can be obtained in low resistance, polymeric electrolyte configuration.
