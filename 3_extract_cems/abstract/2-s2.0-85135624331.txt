Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have recently emerged as an important class of functional materials and been demonstrated to be outstanding supercapacitor electrode materials and catalysts for electrochemical water splitting. While extensive investigations have been devoted to monometallic TMPs, multimetallic TMPs have lately proved to show enhanced electrochemical performance compared to their monometallic counterparts, thanks to the synergistic effect between different transition metal species. This topical review summarizes recent advance in the synthesis of new multimetallic TMP nanostructures, with particular focus on their applications in supercapacitors and electrochemical water splitting. Both experimental reports and theoretical understanding of the synergy between transition metal species are comprehensively reviewed, and perspectives of future research on TMP-based materials for these specific applications are outlined.
