We prepared solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) composed of poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether acrylate (1A9OMe) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([EMIm][OTF]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide ([EMIm][TFSI]) as the ionic liquid. The SPEs formed by appropriately adding ionic liquids in the 1A9OMe prior to thermal cure. The ratio of 1A9OMe and ionic liquid was 1:9, 3:7, and 5:5, respectively. The characterization of solid polymer electrolytes were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in the attenuated total reflectance mode (FTIR-ATR), Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and glavanostatic charge-discharge test. The highest ionic conductivity of SPEs was found to be 4.90×10−4 S/cm in a 1A9OMe/[EMIm][OTF] of 3:7. As IL contents were increased, the specific capacitance of supercapacitor was increased. The specific capacitance of supercapacitor for ionic liquid with large ion size was lower than that for ionic liquid with smaller ion size.
