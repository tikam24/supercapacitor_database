An advanced binder-free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors has been designed by growing 3D nanostructured NiO-Co3(VO4)2 compound on nickel foam. Such unique nanocomposite combined separately the advantages of the perfect cycling stability and rate capability of Co3(VO4)2 and the high specific capacitances of NiO. Furthermore, the nanostructure of NiO-Co3(VO4)2 could provide higher specific surface area and more active sites. As a result, this electrode exhibited remarkable specific capacitances of 1166 F g-1 at a current density 0.5 A g-1, perfect cycle stability of cycle efficiency 99.4% after 5000 cycles and excellent electrochemical performance than the single oxide electrodes. To enhance energy density, the asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled where NiO-Co3(VO4)2 and activated carbon acted as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The maximum specific capacitance of 109 F g-1 and the specific energy of 38.8 W h kg-1 are demonstrated for a cell voltage between 0 and 1.6 V, exhibiting a high energy density and stable power characteristics. And this work also demonstrates the feasibility of rational design of advanced integrated compound electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
