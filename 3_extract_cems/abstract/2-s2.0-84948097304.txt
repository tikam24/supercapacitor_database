Functionalized carbon nanotubes (MWNT-COOH) was selected as conducting wrapping agent to prepare composites of MWNT-COOH and carbonized polyaniline (C-PANI), to improve the supercapacitive performance of C-PANI. The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope which showed that C-PANI was trapped in the conductive network of MWNT-COOH. The electrochemical measurement results indicated the increased specific capacitance and enhanced cycling stability of C-PANI with the addition of MWNT-COOH. When the weight ratio of C-PANI and MWNT-COOH was 4:1, the specific capacitance of the composites was 149 Fg-1, and the capacitance retention was 93.7% after 1000 charge-discharge cycling.
