In this paper, to solve the low robustness caused by special meteorological data in the traditional optimization configuration process, a multi-objective optimization model for economy, stability and environmental protection of micro-grid system is established, and restriction associated with electric energy storage state of battery and super capacitor, maximum instantaneous power requirement and power balance is built. On this basis, the multi-objective optimization issue of microgrid is analyzed. Firstly, the multi-objective optimization issue is transformed into a single target solution by utilizing the linear weighted method. Secondly, the optimal configuration combination of wind/light/micro gas turbine/battery in the microgrid is obtained based on the high robust fast particle swarm optimization algorithm. Finally, some examples related to pre- and post- robustness improvement are established, and comparisons of the economic and environmental protection are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
