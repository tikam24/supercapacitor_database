NiMoS2 is a promising material for various functional applications and highly compatible with GO to make hybrid nanocomposites with excellent characteristics for supercapacitor electrode material. Deposition of NiMoS2 was achieved on the rGO(reduced Graphene Oxide) surface to form a NiMoS2−rGO nanocomposite by the method of the facile hydrothermal synthesis process. XRD pattern shows the crystalline nature of composites. Raman and EPMA result interpreting the composites formation and elements compositions, respectively. The sheet-like morphology of rGO was found in the composites by FESEM images. Particles distribution was confirmed by HR-TEM. The electrochemical properties of the pure NiMoS2 and NiMoS2–rGO composites have been studied by cyclic voltammetry analysis. The results revealed that the NiMoS2/5% rGO nanocomposites exhibit high specific capacitance compared to pure NiMoS2 due to the synergistic effects of NiMoS2 and rGO in the composite material. The photocatalytic behavior of the prepared nanocomposites for dye degradation was tested. The quantity of rGO has significantly improved the photocatalytic behavior of NiMoS2/rGO composites. The studies on degradation mechanism, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, pore size distribution behavior and % of removal of MB reveal the enhanced photocatalytic performance of sysnthesised composites.
