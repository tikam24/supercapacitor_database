Herein, we fabricated oxygen vacancy-Fe2O3@polyaniline (O-Fe2O3@PANI) composites directly grown on surface of carbon cloth via successively hydrothermal process, annealing process, chemical reduction, and in situ polymerization. Polyaniline (PANI) is fabricated in situ on oxygen vacancy-Fe2O3 (O-Fe2O3), and forms a porous PANI skeleton at the same time, thus forming a hierarchical structure of O-Fe2O3 particles connected by conductive skeleton. The designed O-Fe2O3@PANI not only shows enhanced cycling stability (90% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1), but also exhibits an improved specific capacitance (309 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1). Furthermore, the symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) assembled by O-Fe2O3@PANI presents high energy density of 12.125 Wh kg−1 at high power density of 250 W kg−1 and notable cycling life (100% retention over 10,000 cycles). The results demonstrate that the O-Fe2O3@PANI electrode is promising as electrode material for supercapacitors.
