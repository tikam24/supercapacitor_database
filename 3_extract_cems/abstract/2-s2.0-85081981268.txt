The development of electrode materials with excellent performance and unique structure is the key to improve the energy storage of asymmetric supercapacitors. This work reports the deposition of cobalt-organic frameworks (Co-MOF) material on the surface of the nickel foam (NF) by solution method, and uses it as precursor (Co-MOF/NF). Ni-Co@Co-MOF/NF nanomaterials were prepared by electrodeposition on Co-MOF/NF electrodeposited nickel-cobalt materials without adhesives and conductive additives. The Ni-Co@Co-MOF/NF material covered the precursor uniformly, forming a three-dimensional cross-porous structure such as a nano-honeycomb. It is noteworthy that the specific capacitance of the Ni-Co@Co-MOF/NF electrode at 1 A/g is 2697 F/g, and the rate performance at 20 A/g is 79.7%. The assembled Ni-Co@Co-MOF/NF//AC has good electrochemical cycle stability, with of a retention rate of 80.2% after 10,000 cycles. When the power density is 853 W/kg and the energy density is 61.4 Wh/kg, Ni-Co@Co-MOF/NF//AC is realized.
