With the advancement in the technology, application of microelectronic gadget has seen an upsurge. The progress of the microscale devices is significantly dependent on the development of microscale energy storage devices with outstanding charge storage properties. Supercapacitors have long cycle life and higher power density as compared to the rechargeable batteries. These are reasons why it is tempting to integrate the modern electronic gadgets with micro-supercapacitors as the energy storing mode. Despite the tremendous research dedicated in this field, there are still some challenges faced and needs more research to further improve the physical as well as the electrochemical properties of the micro-supercapacitor devices. In this chapter, we have discussed about the various device architecture designs and the state of art of it. Further different device preparation methods have been discussed with outlining their advantages and the disadvantages. This is following by a short and precise discussion about the patterning and micro-supercapacitor systems which have been developed recently. We have also discussed in detail various works reporting the various applications of MSCs in different fields. Lastly, the chapter has concluded on a note of the future direction of research assumed in this field. The architecture design of the micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) and brief description of the reaction mechanism have been provided. This is followed by the device preparation methods. We have also discussed in brief the device patterning and various systems integrating MSCs. Finally, discussion about applications and future developments have been discussed.
