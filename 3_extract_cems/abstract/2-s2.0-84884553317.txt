Chemical doping with foreign atoms is an effective approach to intrinsically modify the properties ofthe carbon materials. Herein, boron-doped graphene (BG) was prepared through pyrolysis of grapheneoxide (GO) with boric acid (H3BO3) in an argon atmosphere at 900°C. Both boron-doping and reductionof GO to graphene were simultaneously achieved under the thermal treatment processing. Namely, athigh temperature condition, H 3BO3was converted into boron oxide (B2O 3) accompanied by diffusing B2O3vapor into the graphene nanosheets, then boron atoms can replace the carbon atoms inside thegraphene layers and thereby substitutionally doped into the graphene lattice. The boron content in BGincreased with prolonging the reaction time and reached the highest value of 4.7% after 3 h of pyrolysis,which in turn affected their electrochemical properties. The as-prepared electrode of BG-900-3h exhibitsthe highest capacitive behavior (172.5 F g-1, 0.5 A g-1) and superior cycling stability (maintaining 96.5%of initial capacity after 5000 times of cycling). Remarkably, the boron-doping increased the capacitanceof BG-900-3h by about 80% compared to pristine graphene. These results imply that the doping of boroninto graphene lattice induces remarkable performance enhancement, and thus make the doped materialssuperior to those of pristine graphene as electrode materials for supercapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
