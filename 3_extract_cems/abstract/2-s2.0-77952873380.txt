Using crystalline V2O5 (c-V2O5) powders as raw materials, amorphous V2O5 (a-V2O5) is prepared by H2O2-c-V2O5-sol-gel technoque. The effects of the concentration ratio of H2O2/c-V2O5, stirring time, aging time, the kinds of aqueous electrolyte, Cu2+ doping on the structure and electrochemical properties of a-V2O5 are analyzed. The results of XRD and electrochemical tests show that the material has amorphous structure with nano-sized particles, and the optimal conditions are as follows: 0.04 g/mL as the concentration ratio of H2O2/c-V2O5, 12 hours of stirring, 4 days of aging, and 1 mol/L of KOH concentration in solution. Under above conditions the product has excellent electrochemical performance, with charge-discharge at 30 mA/g its initial specific capacitance can be 55.2 F/g. Constant current charge-discharge measurements show that the specific capacitance of a-V2O5 electrode can reach 111.4 F/g when 0.5% Cu2+ added into a-V2O5.
