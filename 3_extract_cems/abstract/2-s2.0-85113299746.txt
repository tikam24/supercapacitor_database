Supercapacitors (SCs) have generated a great deal of interest regarding their prospects for application in energy storage due to their advantages such as long life cycles and high-power den-sity. Graphene is an excellent electrode material for SCs due to its high electric conductivity and highly specific surface area. Conductive polymers (CPs) could potentially become the next-genera-tion SC electrodes because of their low cost, facile synthesis methods, and high pseudocapacitance. Graphene/CP composites show conspicuous electrochemical performance when used as electrode materials for SCs. In this article, we present and summarize the synthesis and electrochemical performance of graphene/CP composites for SCs. Additionally, the method for synthesizing electrode materials for better electrochemical performance is discussed.
