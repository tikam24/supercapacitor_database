A novel activation method involving hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and a pressure-induced low temperature oxidation has been demonstrated for cellulose derived HTC char by using hydrogen peroxide as an active di-oxygen source. The optimized porosity versus gravimetric capacitance results from cellulose derived HTC char synthesized at 220 °C. Almost homogeneous and small particle size micro-ellipse/sphere, relatively high surface area and narrow pore size distributions lead to a high bulk density, i.e. 0.73 g cm−3, of coating-type electrodes, which is much denser than those manufactured from steam-activated carbons for supercapacitor industry, i.e. 0.52 g cm−3. The resulting carbon prepared herein achieves a relatively high volumetric capacitance in an organic electrolyte-based supercapacitor, reaching a competitive value of an industrial system with the features being environment-friendly, cost-effective as well as high yield, and less energy consumption.
