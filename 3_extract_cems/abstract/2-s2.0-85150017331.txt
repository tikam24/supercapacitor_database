Graphene and its derivatives have proved to be highly efficient in various applications. The inherent properties of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are highly exploited for multiple applications. Studies have revealed that the properties of these nanoparticles are highly elevated when metal oxides (MOs) are introduced to their surface. Various reported synthesis procedures for GO and rGO have been discussed, including the green approach for reducing GO to rGO. The properties of graphene and its derivatives GO, rGO, and metal oxide/rGO (MO/rGO) composites and their application in supercapacitors and catalysis have been discussed in this review article. Structural, vibrational, optical, morphological, and electrochemical characterizations of GO and rGO have been discussed. High specific capacitance (CS) values, cyclic retention, energy density (ED) and power density (PD) have been addressed for the graphene-based materials used in electrical double-layer capacitance (EDLC), pseudocapacitors and hybrid supercapacitors. Also, the applications of these nanomaterials for catalyzing several chemical reactions have been discussed.
