Binder-free MoO 3 /GO/MWCNTs/graphite sheets were successfully fabricated via electrodeposition of graphene oxide and functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube onto graphite sheets followed by electrodeposition of molybdenum oxide. The capacitive behavior of the MoO 3 /GO/MWCNTs/G sheet was found to be superior with respect to those of MoO 3 /MWCNTs/graphite and MoO 3 /GO/G sheets. The high wettability, interconnected structure and synergetic effects between MoO 3 , GO and MWCNTs made the MoO 3 /GO/MWCNTs/G sheet exhibited a high areal capacitance of 103 mF cm −2 at current density of 0.7 mA cm −2 in 1.0 M KCl. An all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor device prepared by using the MoO 3 /GO/MWCNTs/G sheet as both positive and negative electrodes showed high cell voltage of 2.5 V and remarkable cycle life of 86.8% retention after 2000 cycles, suggesting the possibility for practical applications in energy storage device.
