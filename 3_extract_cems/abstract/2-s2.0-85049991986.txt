A novel adaptive energy management strategy is proposed for real-time power split between fuel cells (FCs) and supercapacitors (SCs) in a hybrid electric vehicle in view of the fact that driving patterns greatly affect fuel economy. The driving pattern recognition (DPR) is achieved based on the features extracted from the historical velocity window with a multilayer perceptron neural network. After the DPR has been obtained, an adaptive fuzzy energy management controller is utilized for power split according to the required power for vehicle running. In order to prolong the FC lifetime while decreasing the hydrogen consumption, a genetic algorithm is applied to optimize critical factors such as adaptive gains and fuzzy membership function parameters for several standard driving cycles. In the proposed method, the future driving cycles are not required and the current driving pattern can be successfully recognized, demonstrating that less current fluctuations and fuel consumption can be achieved under various driving conditions. Compared with conventional energy management systems, the proposed framework can ensure the state of charge of SCs within the desired limit.
