Reported herein is a facile solution-processed substrate-independent approach for preparation of oriented coordination polymer (Co-BTA) thin-film electrodes for on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). The Co-BTA-MSCs exhibited excellent AC line-filtering performance with an extremely short resistance-capacitance constant, making it capable of replacing aluminum electrolytic capacitors for AC line-filtering applications.
