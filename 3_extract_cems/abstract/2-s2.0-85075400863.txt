Walnut Shell-derived hierarchical porous carbon has been successfully synthesized by the efficient KOH activation process. The hierarchical porous carbon material activated at 600 °C, has the specific micropore area of 1037.31 m2 g−1 and micropore volume of 0.51 cm3 g−1, which leads to have electrochemical performances of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and supercapacitors. Specifically, as the hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, the walnut shell-derived carbon material activated at 600 °C exhibits a lower onset potential of 6.00 mV, a smaller Tafel slope of 69.76 mV dec−1 and outstanding stability above long-term cycling. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the sample possesses specific capacitance of 262.74 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, the remarkable rate capability of 224.60 F g−1 at even 10 A g−1 and good long-term stability. A symmetric supercapacitor shows the highly energy density of 7.97 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 180.80 W kg−1. This novel and low-cost biomass material is very promising for the electrocatalytic water splitting and supercapacitors.
