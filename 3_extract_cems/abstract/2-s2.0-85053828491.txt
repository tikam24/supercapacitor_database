A high-efficiency bidirectional DC-DC converter for electric vehicle supercapacitor systems is presented. Compared with traditional IGBT power devices, wide bandgap devices can be effective here, but cost and technical issues such as gate oxide reliability are seen as drawbacks. A potentially attractive alternative device is the silicon super-junction MOSFET. However, the behaviour of the intrinsic diode and output capacitance of this device is problematic. An external diode network can be used to provide intrinsic diode deactivation. The selection of these diodes and their interaction with the device output capacitances is investigated. The proposed circuitry is demonstrated in a 1.1kW converter operating from 400V and switching at between 50kHz and 125kHz.
