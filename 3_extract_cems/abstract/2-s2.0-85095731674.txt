In this study, an efficient electroactive material of CoCu2O4 with nanoflowers-like architecture has been developed by simplistic and low-cost hydrothermal technique without binders. The CoCu2O4 nanoflowers architecture provides large surface area and boosts the rating of ion accessibility and the speed of electrons transfer and thus enhances the electrochemical activities. In aqueous electrolyte, the present CoCu2O4 nanoflowers electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 354.12 C g−1 at 2 A g−1. After 3000 long and continuous charging/discharging cycles, 97.3% of the initialing capacity has was retained. This super-active electrochemical properties of the CoCu2O4 nanoflowers architecture are mainly attributed to the enhanced surface area and to the improved ion transportation, which make it a promising candidate as an electrode material for energy storage supercapacitors.
