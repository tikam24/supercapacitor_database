This paper proposes a contribution to control strategy for hybrid power source based on fuel cells as the main energy source and supercapacitors as the auxiliary power source for vehicle applications. First, 3-phase parallel boost converters and 3-phase parallel bidirectional converters are proposed with a switching interleaving technique as controls. Mathematical models of the FC and the supercapacitor converters are given, then an analysis of classical hybrid architectures using fuel cell (FC)/Supercapacitors is presented. A simulation model of the system is developed using the Energetic Macroscopic Representation and the simulation results are presented to validate the operation of the proposed method in the hybrid system.
