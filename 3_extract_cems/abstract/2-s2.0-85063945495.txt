In shaping a clean and green energy environment, the installation of a self-rechargeable supercapacitor in an electric vehicle has the goal of decreasing the emission of unwanted gases, which can be realized by adopting a perovskite solar cell for self-charging the supercapacitor. In this work, a CsPbBr2.9I0.1 perovskite-sensitized solar cell is integrated for the first time with an asymmetrical supercapacitor for a photo-supercapacitor application. Prior to this integration, the performances of the perovskite-sensitized solar cell and supercapacitor are individually examined. The perovskite-sensitized solar cell displays a good efficiency, with the ability to retain 70% of its efficiency after a week of storage in a dark humidity-controlled desiccator and 33% of its efficiency under UV and air exposure at a high relative humidity of more than 80% for 24 h. The asymmetrical supercapacitor exhibits a high areal capacitance of 150 mF cm-2 with a capacitance loss of only 4% after continuous cyclic performances, which shows its potential for the photo-supercapacitor application. The photo-supercapacitor device is sensitive to light, with the photovoltage and photocurrent plunging to zero in the absence of light, and provides an areal capacitance of 30 mF cm-2. It thus unlocks opportunities for photo-supercapacitor applications in line with green energy development.
