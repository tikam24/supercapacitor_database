One of the most cutting-edge areas of study in alternative and renewable energy applications is the creation of extremely efficient electrode materials for high power devices. In-depth research is being carried out on energy-storage technology for the benefit of future civilisation in order to address problems including rising fuel cost, pollution, and global warming. Doped ZnO nanostructures received lot of attention in recent years due to their unique characteristics, which render them suitable for energy-storage devices. Herein, we report 3, 6, and 9 wt% Sr-doped ZnO synthesised by simple and cost-effective co-precipitation route. The as-prepared sample was displayed by different physico-chemical tools. The substantial specific capacitance (C sp) of 698 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1 was displayed by 9 wt% Sr-doped ZnO electrode, and it also retained 95.4% of its initial capacitance even after 5000 GCD cycles at the current density of 1 Ag−1. The improved capacitance behaviour of 9 wt% Sr-doped ZnO electrode was accredited to its huge number of active redox sites favourable for quick electron/ion transport.
