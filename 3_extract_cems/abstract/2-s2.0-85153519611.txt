Accessibility to sustainable and reliable electrical energy for remote area power supply (RAPS) systems under high penetration levels of wind energy requires adopting appropriate technologies and controllers. In recent years, energy storage has gained significant attention for smoothing inherent voltage and power fluctuations of standalone systems. This paper presents a filtration-based fractional-order PI (FOPI) controller optimized by Gases Brownian Motion Optimization (GBMO) algorithm to manage an active battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in a wind-dominated RAPS system. The GBMO algorithm has a high accuracy and convergence rate among optimization algorithms introduced in recent years. Moreover, a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) guarantees the wind turbine generator's maximum power point tracking (MPPT) at any wind condition while mitigating its fluctuating torque. The proposed RAPS system uses the advantages of the FOPI controller, the GBMO optimization algorithm, the FLC-based MPPT algorithm, and a high-pass filter to manage precise coordination between different components of the RAPS system. The high-pass filter decouples high and low-frequency voltage oscillations to modify the HESS performance and relieve battery stress, thereby extending its lifespan. The proposed controller's performance and robustness are verified in comparison with an optimal PI controller based on GBMO under turbulent wind speed and load step changes in a detailed model of the system. The results demonstrate the superiority of the optimal FOPI controller over the optimal PI controller.
