The nickel-based metallic organic framework (Ni-MOF) [Ni2(OH)2(C8H4O4)] material with a hierarchical microblocks structure is efficiently synthesized in 2 h by the ultrasonic method. At the moment Ni-MOF is used as the electrode materials and the supercapacitors (SCs) perform very well with great electrochemical capacity which exhibited particular electric capacitance of 631 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. This is one of the highest performances and the shortest synthesis time reported so far for MOFs. Besides, there is a battery – SC hybrid SC assembled by using Ni-MOF and activated carbon. On the condition of having a power density of 302.2 W kg−1 with the voltage window of 1.2 V, the SC produces an energy density of 28.5 W h kg−1. During the same period, the SC maintains outstanding cycling stability capacitance retention of 85.5% after 3000 cycles at current density of 10 A g−1. The great electrochemical capability is due to the distinct crystal texture and particular morphological feature. Herein, it is displayed that the ultrasonic method is a fast and effective approach for preparing Ni-MOF SC electrode materials.
