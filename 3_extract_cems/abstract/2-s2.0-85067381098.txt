This paper evaluates possibility of using a new hybrid system based on variable speed diesel generator (VSDG), Li-ion battery bank and supercapacitor bank (SC) for a rubber tire gantry crane (RTGC) used in container terminals. Existing commercial hybrid systems face difficulties producing high efficiencies, higher life span, and lower initial investment cost due to inheriting characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors. In the proposed power system, a variable speed diesel generator act as the principal energy source, while a Li-ion battery bank and SC bank act as an energy storage system. The battery supports the diesel generator during steady demand and further, it absorbs a part of energy during regeneration. The energy management strategy, control the power flow from different sources while maintaining battery state of charge (SOC) level within a narrow band. Unlike most battery systems, this narrow band operation of battery system increases its life span while reducing capacity fade. The originality of this study can be emphasized from this narrow band SOC control technique. Simulation results for real operational load cycles are presented showing a stable system operating under defined current limits which can enhance lifetime of battery system and increase fuel saving by downsizing 400 kW constant speed diesel generator to 200 kW VSDG.
