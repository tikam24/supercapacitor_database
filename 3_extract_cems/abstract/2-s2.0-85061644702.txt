Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can be supplied by hybrid energy storage systems (H-ESSs). Such kind of system needs to be handled by complex energy management strategies (EMSs) considering several objectives. Besides, to evaluate such EMSs, an optimal benchmark could be developed. Dynamic programming (DP) is suitable for that purpose because of its ability to obtain the optimal solution. However, it is non-trivial to address an energy management problem with multiple objectives by using DP because of the complexity of the system and computational issues. This paper develops a DP-based optimal EMS for a hybrid truck supplied by battery/supercapacitor HESS using a bi-level approach. This approach decomposes the EMS into optimal sub-strategies regarding the structure of the studied system. The validation of the optimal strategy is demonstrated by simulation results.
