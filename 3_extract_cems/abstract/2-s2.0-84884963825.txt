We fabricated a stretchable micro-supercapacitor array with planar SWCNT electrodes and an ionic liquid-based triblock copolymer electrolyte. The mechanical stability of the entire supercapacitor array upon stretching was obtained by adopting strategic design concepts. First, the narrow and long serpentine metallic interconnections were encapsulated with polyimide thin film to ensure that they were within the mechanical neutral plane. Second, an array of two-dimensional planar micro-supercapacitor with SWCNT electrodes and an ion-gel-type electrolyte was made to achieve all-solid-state energy storage devices. The formed micro-supercapacitor array showed excellent performances which were stable over stretching up to 30% without any noticeable degradation. This work shows the strong potential of a stretchable micro-supercapacitor array in applications such as wearable computers, power dressing, electronic newspapers, paper-like mobile phones, and other easily collapsible gadgets.
