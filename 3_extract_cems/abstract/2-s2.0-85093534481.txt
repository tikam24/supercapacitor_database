A 2D boron nanosheet that exhibits high theoretical capacitance, around four times that of graphene, is a significant supercapacitor electrode. However, its bulk structure with low interlaminar conduction and porosity restricts the charge transfer, ion diffusion, and energy density. Herein, we develop a new 2D hetero-nanosheet made of anisotropic boron–carbon nanosheets (ABCNs) by B−C chemical bonds via gas-phase exfoliation and condensation bottom-up strategy. The ABCNs are constructed into high flexible supercapacitor electrode by microfluidic electrospinning. The ABCN electrode greatly promotes smooth migration and excessive storage of electrolyte ions due to large interlayer conductivity, ionic pathways, and accessible surfaces. The flexible supercapacitor delivers ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 167.05 mWh cm−3 and capacitance of 534.5 F cm−3. A wearable energy-sensor system is designed to stably monitor physiological signals.
