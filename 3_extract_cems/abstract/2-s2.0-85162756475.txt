Structural supercapacitors hold promise to expand the energy capacity of a system by integrating load-bearing and energy-storage functions in a multifunctional structure, resulting in weight savings and safety improvements. Here, we develop strategies based on interfacial engineering to advance multifunctional efficiency. The structural electrodes were reinforced by coating carbon-fiber weaves with a uniquely stable conjugated redox polymer and reduced graphene oxide that raised pseudocapacitive capacitance and tensile strength. The solid polymer electrolyte was tuned to a gradient configuration, where it facilitated high ionic conductivity at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces and transitioned to a composition with high mechanical strength in the bulk for load support. The gradient design enabled the multilayer structural supercapacitors to reach state-of-the-art performance matching the level of monofunctional supercapacitors. In situ electrochemical-mechanical measurements established the device durability under mechanical loads. The structural supercapacitor was made into the hull of a model boat to demonstrate its multifunctionality.
