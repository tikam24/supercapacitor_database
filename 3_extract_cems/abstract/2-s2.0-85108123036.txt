A high-efficiency rational design of a durable material produced from waste materials for sustainable energy generation and storage systems is a formidable challenge. This paper describes the large-scale synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon (PS-C) from waste polystyrene with a short processing time using the thermal plasma method. The as-synthesized PS-C exhibited an electrochemical capacitance of 482 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 and a capacitance retention of 95% at a current density of 6 Ag−1 after 5000 charge–discharge cycles. This reported specific capacitance and cyclic performance are attributed to the morphology, nitrogen doping, and structural integrity resulting from the synergy of the material.
