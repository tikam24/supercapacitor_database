A bendable supercapacitor cathode was fabricated by growing hetero-structured Co(OH)2/NiS compounds onto the surface of carbon cloth (CC). The detailed structure and composition of as-prepared samples were revealed by a series of physical characterization. In a three-electrode system, a specific capacitance as high as 1.136 mAh cm−2 (1231 F g−1) at 2 mA cm−2 was achieved on the Co(OH)2/NiS/CC electrode. A flexible asymmetric capacitor composing of Co(OH)2/NiS/CC cathode and active carbon anode delivered a high stability verified by the almost unchanged capacity after 8000 cycles of energy-conversion process. The high capacitor performance originated from the unique structure makes obtained Co(OH)2/NiS/CC electrode a promising material for use in energy storage.
