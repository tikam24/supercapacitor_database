In our work, a Cu9S5/Fe2O3composite with nanosphere morphology is prepared by an efficient one-pot solvothermal selective sulfurization. The structure investigation confirms that there is uneven charge distribution at the interfaces of Cu9S5and Fe2O3. Furthermore, the corresponding electrochemical measurements reveal the detailed redox kinetics process about Cu2+/Cu+, Fe3+/Fe2+, and (S2)-/S2-. When the obtained Cu9S5/Fe2O3composite is used as a negative electrode, it exhibits a high specific capacity (348.2 mA h g-1at 1 A g-1) with good rate capability. Moreover, a hybrid capacitor (HCP) assembled with Cu9S5/Fe2O3as negative and Ni-Co hydroxide/Cu(OH)2/CF as positive electrodes, respectively, shows a high energy density with a corresponding high power density (64.54 W h kg-1at 757.81 W kg-1) and a high specific capacitance (47 mA h g-1at 1 A g-1) with a capacity retention of 45.68% (21.5 mA h g-1) even at 20 A g-1in a solid-state gel electrolyte. Thus, a facial fabricated anode material with outstanding electrochemical properties for HCPs is provided.
