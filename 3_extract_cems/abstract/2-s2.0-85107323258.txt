Either CoxSy transition metal sulfide or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) has become major electrode material for supercapacitor. Herein, nanostructured RGO@CoxSy composites were optimized by different sulfur sources and a one-step solvothermal method. The nano-sesame sphere RGO@Co4S3 (NSS-RGO@Co4S3) and nano-crispy stuffed nori RGO@Co3S4 (NCSN-RGO@Co3S4) were formed from thiourea and TAA, respectively. The synergistic effect of RGO and CoxSy promoted the electrochemical properties of RGO@CoxSy electrode material for energy storage. The synergistic effect between RGO and CoxSy and the structure–function relationship of RGO@CoxSy improve the electrochemical energy storage of nanostructured RGO@CoxSy. NSS-RGO@Co4S3 was given to priority to energy storage than NCSN-RGO@Co3S4 due to the crack between NSS-RGO@Co4S3 nanoparticles could shorten the ion diffusion path. A high specific capacitance of 1085 F·g−1 with 0.5 A·g−1 and energy density of 37.67 Wh⋅kg−1 at a power density of 0.125 KW⋅kg−1 for nanostructured NSS-RGO@Co4S3 was obtained, whose specific capacitance is nearly 1.3 times as large as NCSN-RGO@Co3S4 and about 96 times larger than one of RGO. It is realized to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials with nanostructural modulation. This study showed the nanostructured RGO@CoxSy can effectively control and broaden the other electrode material to electrochemical energy storage.
