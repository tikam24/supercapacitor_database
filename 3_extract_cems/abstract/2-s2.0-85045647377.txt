Compact-size kilohertz (kHz) AC-supercapacitors are being pursued for ripple current filtering and pulsed energy storage. However, their development is limited by a small areal capacitance density due to very thin electrode used for meeting frequency requirement. In our work, crosslinked carbon nanofiber aerogel (CCNFA) was investigated as freestanding electrode for kHz AC-supercapacitors with an areal capacitance density as large as 4.5 mF cm-2 at 120 Hz, 5-10 times larger than most reports. The CCNFA was obtained in a rapid plasma carbonization process of bacterial cellulose. The fabrication route adopted here is simple and straightforward, and the produced CCNFA electrode was found to be very suitable for high-frequency AC-supercapacitors. The operating voltage range of CCNFA based AC-supercapacitors can be expanded to 3 V by utilizing an organic electrolyte. In addition to AC-Supercapacitor performance, the morphology and material properties of bacterial cellulose aerogel and CCNFA were also reported.
