We have successfully fabricated the core-shell like hybrids of nanoparticles of CuCo2S4@NiCo(OH)2 Nanosheets on Ni-Foam through hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. Crystalline nature of the electrodes is confirmed by XRD and TEM. The formation of the NiCo(OH)2 has been long-established by FTIR analysis. Nanoparticle nature of the hydrothermally prepared CuCo2S4 and nanosheet morphology of electrodeposited NiCo(OH)2 have been recognized by SEM and TEM analysis. Chemical composition of the electrode material is confirmed by XPS. The specific capacitance of fabricated core shell hybrids of CuCo2S4@NiCo(OH)2 is 2340 F/g at a current density of 1A/g with good cycle stability in the 2000th cycle at a current density of 20 A/g. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitor has exhibited the capacitance of 102 F/g at 1A/g with 92% of its initial capacitance retention in the 2000th cycle at 2 A/g. The achieved energy/power density of the hybrid symmetric capacitor is 32 Whkgâˆ’1/750 Wkg-1. Core-shell like hybrids of CuCo2S4@NiCo(OH)2 has a tendency to meet their demands in supercapacitor applications.
