2-D hexagonal mesoporous carbon is combined with polyaniline by a simple chemical oxidation polymerization. As-prepared samples are characterized via Fourier transform infrared spectrum, nitrogen sorption analysis and transmission electron microscopy. The experimental results demonstrate that polyaniline is linked with the functional groups on the surface of mesoporous carbon via the chemical bonds. The electrochemical tests reveal mesoporous carbon and polyaniline have a strong synergetic effect, which not only enhances the stability of polyaniline, but also increases the capacitance and energy density of the composite materials. A wide potential window of 1.1 V for the composite is obtained in aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance and specific energy density are as high as 470 F/g and 76.4 Wh/kg, respectively.
