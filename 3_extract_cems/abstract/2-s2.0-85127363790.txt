Core-shell electrodes with high mass loading exhibit considerable potential for use in various energy storage systems. The capacitance values of pseudocapacitor materials are increasingly approaching their theoretical values. However, preparing electrode materials with high mass loading and excellent specific capacitance remains difficult. In this study, NiCo2S4@MoS2 core/shell nanorod arrays were successfully synthesized on Ni foam by using a three-step hydrothermal strategy. The mass loading of the core / shell nanorod array was 11 mg cm−2 (more than 8 mg cm− 2). To deliver a current density of 3 mA cm−2, the area ratio capacitance of the electrode material was up to 8.86 F cm−2(719.32 F g-1), which implied excellent charge storage capacitance, high mass loading, and excellent rate performance. The NiCo2S4@MoS2 electrode exhibited capacitance retention of 88.987.7% after 6000 cycles. Furthermore, NiCo2S4@MoS2 //AC exhibited a maximum energy density of 48.63 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250.1 W kg−1, and remarkable cycling stability with a capacitance retention of approximately 75.8% after 6000 cycles.
