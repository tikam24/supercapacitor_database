Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) with a lamellar structure has emerged as a promising negative electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs) due to its high theoretical specific capacity. Meanwhile, the improvement of electrochemical properties strongly depends on the size, shape and morphologies of Bi2S3nanomaterials. Herein, the hierarchical Bi2S3nanorod-stacked hollow microtubes are self-assembled through a facile self-sacrificing template strategy from bismuth-based metal-organic framework microprisms. Benefiting from the unique structures with a large specific surface area (54.3 m2 g-1), the as-prepared Bi2S3exhibits an ultrahigh specific capacity (532 C g-1 at 1 A g-1) as a negative electrode for SCs, outperforming other reported Bi2S3materials.
