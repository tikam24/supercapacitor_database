A hybrid power system consists of a fuel cell and an energy storage device like a battery and/or a supercapacitor possessing high energy and power density that beneficially drives electric vehicle motor. The structures of the fuel cell-based power system are complicated and costly, and in energy management strategies (EMSs), the fuel cell's characteristics are usually neglected. In this study, a variable structure battery (VSB) scheme is proposed to enhance the hybrid power system, and an incremental fuzzy logic method is developed by considering the efficiency and power change rate of fuel cell to balance the power system load. The principle of VSB is firstly introduced and validated by discharge and charge experiments. Subsequently, parameters matching of the fuel cell hybrid power system according to the proposed VSB are designed and modeled. To protect the fuel cell as well as ensure the efficiency, a fuzzy logic EMS is formulated via setting the fuel cell operating in a high efficiency and generating an incremental power output within the affordable power slope. The comparison between a traditional deterministic rules-based EMS and the designed fuzzy logic was implemented by numerical simulation in three different operation conditions: NEDC, UDDS, and user-defined driving cycle. The results indicated that the incremental fuzzy logic EMS smoothed the fuel cell power and kept the high efficiency. The proposed VSB and incremental fuzzy logic EMS may have a potential application in fuel cell vehicles.
