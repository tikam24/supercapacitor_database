Micro-/nanostructures with unique structural features could be endowed with intriguing properties. A mesoporous flowerlike NiCo2S4 was synthesized via hydrothermal method followed by thermal annealing treatment. The resultant NiCo2S4 presented flowerlike structure constructed with rich porous nanosheets, and then delivered a high specific surface area. Because of the 3D hierarchical structure, the NiCo2S4 electrode revealed amazing pseudocapacitive properties with high specific capacitance (1516 F/g at 2 A/g) and a favorable rate capability (89.3% from 2 to 16 A/g). Moreover, the specific capacitance remained 89.6% of its initial value after 1000 cycles. The superior results indicated that mesoporous flowerlike NiCo2S4 could be a promising material for supercapacitor electrodes.
