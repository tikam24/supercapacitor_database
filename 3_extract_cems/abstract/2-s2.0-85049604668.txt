Here in, we report a simple and facile method to synthesis morphology oriented transition metal (Nickel) doped polyaniline (Ni2+/PANI) by chemical oxidative polymerization with the assistance of ultrasonic irradiation. Physicochemical property of the materials examined through XRD and FT-IR. The morphological feature exposed that the sonochemical assisted Ni2+ doped PANI is differing from the conventional method and it reveals a notable electrochemical property as in the form of specific capacitance (370 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) with improved rate capability and sustained cycling performance due to its typical interconnected nano-fibrillar morphology than the other synthesized materials. These intriguing features realized from the properly arranged nanostructure with perfect doping and make as a promising candidate as an electrode material in supercapacitor applications.
