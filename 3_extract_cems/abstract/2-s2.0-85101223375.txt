Energy crisis and environmental pollution have been one of the major global issues. In this regard, the search for new energy storage materials is cheap, flexible and high-performance supercapacitors electrode which has become intensive. Also, reducing the amount of organic dyes polluting in water is a great significance. Herein, one-step electropolymerization of methylene blue on carbon fiber and the resulting films were applied to the supercapacitor. The high performance is associated to the outstanding conductivity, electrochemical stability and superior mechanical flexibility of carbon fiber. A new flexible electrode for supercapacitors was successfully fabricated by demonstrating with a good electrochemical performance and a promising alternative to reduce the water pollution.
