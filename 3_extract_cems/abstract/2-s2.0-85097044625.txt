Supercapacitor-like Na-ion batteries have attracted much attention due to the high energy density of batteries and power density of capacitors. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), is a promising anode material. Its performance is however seriously hindered by its low electrical conductivity and the sluggish diffusion of sodium ions (Na+) in the TiO2 matrix. Herein, this work combines porous TiO2 nanocubes with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to enhance the electrical conductivity and accelerate Na+ diffusivity for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). In this composite, an interwoven scaffolded TiO2/CNTs framework is formed to provide abundant channels and shorter diffusion pathways for electrons and ions. The in-situ X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry confirm the low strain and superior transport kinetics in Na+ intercalation/extraction processes. In addition, the chemically bonded TiO2/CNTs hybrid provides a more feasible channel for Na+ insertion/extraction with a much lower energy barrier. Consequently, the TiO2/CNTs composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a capacity of 223.4 mAh g−1 at 1 C and a capacity of 142.8 mAh g−1 at 10 C (3.35 A g−1). The work here reveals that the combination of active materials with CNTs can largely improve the utilization efficiency and enhance their sodium storage.
