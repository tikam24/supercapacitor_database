Herein, we report the synthesis of porous carbon material derived from the renewable source of Cassia fistula flower petals by a single-step direct-carbonization process. The sheetlike porous carbon (CFSPC) derived from C. fistula flower petals displays an uneven sheetlike morphology, hierarchical porous structure, and a high specific surface area of 556 m2g-1. It exhibits a high specific capacitance of 324 F g-1at the current density of 1 A g-1and long cyclic stability of 95.3% with nearly 100% Coulombic efficiency over around 10 000 charge-discharge cycles in a two-electrode configuration. CFSPC also delivers a maximum specific energy of over 48.2 Wh kg-1and a specific power of 687 W kg-1. These electrochemical performance results demonstrate that the as-synthesized sheetlike porous carbon derived from readily available greener resources like C. fistula flower petals may serve as promising electrodes for energy storage.
