The rapid development of portable electronics has contributed to an urgent demand for versatile and flexible electrodes of wearable energy storage devices and pressure sensors. We fabricate a stretchable electrode by coupling the nickel-cobalt sulfide (NiCoS) nanosheet layer with Ag@NiCo nanowire (NW) networks. NiCoS wrinkled nanostructure, highly conductive networks, and intense interactions between substrate/networks and active materials/networks endow the electrodes with excellent energy storage capacity, superior electrochemical/mechanical stability, and good conductivity. A high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor is developed using the composite electrode. It operates in a wide potential window of 1.4 V and achieves a maximum energy density of 40.0 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1.1 kW kg−1; it also exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility and good waterproof performance. Moreover, a sandwiched capacitive pressure sensor constructed using the same electrodes has a wide sensing range (up to 260 kPa), low detection limit (∼47 mN), fast response (∼66 ms), and excellent mechanical stability (10 000 cycles). This study demonstrates that the appropriate design of the functional electrode facilitates the construction of various high-performance devices, denoting the versatility of our electrodes in the development of wearable electronics.
