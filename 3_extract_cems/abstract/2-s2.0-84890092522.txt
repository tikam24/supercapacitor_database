Reduced graphene oxide-CoFe2O4 (RGO-CoFe 2O4) composite for supercapacitor electrodes has been investigated. On the basis of the morphological and structural characterization of the sample by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, the electrochemical performances of the sample were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry in 0.50 mol L-1 Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. It was shown that the specific capacitance (123.2 F g-1) of RGO-CoFe 2O4 composite was highly improved compared with that of RGO (89.9 F g-1), GO-CoFe2O4 (21.1 F g -1) and CoFe2O4 (18.7 F g-1) at the current density of 5 mA cm-2. The capacitance retention of about 78.1% for RGO-CoFe2O4 after 1000 cycles indicated that it has high cycle stability. Â© Pleiades Publishing, Ltd., 2013.
