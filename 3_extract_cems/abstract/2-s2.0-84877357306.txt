Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) has been deposited on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using DC reactive magnetron sputtering of molybdenum for supercapacitor applications. The deposits of MoO3 have been developed under different intervals of time. The structure and surface morphology of the deposits have been characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). X-ray diffraction peaks of the composite films reveal the formation of crystalline structure of MoO3. The electrochemical performance of the composite films was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. The composite film exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 70 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The nanocomposite electrode material shows specific capacitance which is almost four fold increase with respect to that of bare MWCNTs. The effect of coating duration on specific capacitance has been studied. The nanocomposite film is found to display good cycleability, even up to 1000 cycles. Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.
