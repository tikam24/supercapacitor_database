Engineering vanadium-based materials with high conductivity, superior redox performance, and high operating voltage has attracted widespread attention in energy storage devices. Herein, we demonstrated a simple and feasible phosphorization technique to design three-dimensional (3D) network-like vanadyl pyrophosphate ((VO)2P2O7) nanowires on flexible carbon cloth (CC) (VP-CC). The phosphorization process enabled the VP-CC to increase the electronic conductivity, and the interconnected nano-network of VP-CC opens pathways for fast charge storage during the energy storage processes. Specifically, the 3D VP-CC electrodes and LiClO4 electrolyte designed as a Li-ion supercapacitor (LSC) demonstrate a maximum operating window of 2.0 V with a superior energy density (Ed) of 96 μWh cm-2, power density (Pd) of 10,028 μW cm-2, and outstanding cycling retention (98%) even after 10,000 cycles. In addition, a flexible LSC assembled utilizing VP-CC electrodes with a PVA/Li-based solid-state gel electrolyte exhibits a high capacitance value of 137 mF cm-2 and excellent cycling durability (86%) with a high Ed of 27 μWh cm-2 and Pd of 7237 μW cm-2. Considering excellent energy storage features, the highly conductive vanadium-based material has been utilized as an ideal electrode for various flexible/wearable energy storage devices with superior performance.
