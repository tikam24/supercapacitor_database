The proceedings contain 31 papers. The topics discussed include: integration of distributed generation system and electric vehicle charger in V2G mode for grid voltage sag mitigation; selective harmonic elimination using adaptive feed-forward compensation in single-phase stand-alone voltage source inverters; fault detection in transmission lines using summation of squared three-phase currents; classification of diabetic retinopathy fundus images using deep neural network; event-triggered control of frequency in interconnected power systems; fractional order modeling and parameter estimation of supercapacitor; a comparative study of maximum power tracking of turbines of wind energy conversion systems; and islanding detection and transfer of distributed generation system from grid connected to standalone mode.
