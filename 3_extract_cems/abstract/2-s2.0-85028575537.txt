Colloidal carbon spheres were synthesized with hydrothermal method by taking glucose as raw material. By using colloidal carbon spheres as carbon precursor and ferrocene as iron source, a series of carbon nanospheres/Fe3O4 composites with different Fe3O4 contents were prepared under high temperature condition. The structure of composites was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical performances of composites were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, alternating current impedance and cycle-life testing. The study results showed that Fe3O4 nanoparticles are successfully attached to the carbon nanospheres. The composites have excellent energy storage capacity, high charge–discharge efficiency and well cycle stability.
