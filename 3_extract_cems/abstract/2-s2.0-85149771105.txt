This report presents a facile approach of surface activation for significantly enhancing the energy storage performance in a Ni-Cu-Mn ternary alloy system. The activated surface accompanied by selective chemical dealloying resulted in a highly uniform, in situ-generated nanoporous, flaky surface enriched with hybrid oxides. The activated surface exhibits outstanding volumetric capacitance of 3862.5 F/cm3 at a current density of 2 A/cm3 with 95% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles. Moreover, the symmetric device delivers the volumetric capacitance of 286 F/cm3 at the current density of 1 A/cm3 with a high power density and energy density of 750 W/L and 89.37 Wh/L, respectively.
