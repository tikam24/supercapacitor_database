In this work, sulfur-doped graphene-coated electrodes are prepared by cyclic voltammetry in different potential ranges and different cycles (from 10 to 50) for selective modification of electrodes by different functional groups. The prepared electrodes are characterized by spectroscopic, microscopic and electrochemical methods. In scanning electron microscopic analysis, formation of graphene layers and their porous structure have been determined. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic and cyclic voltammetric analyses are also used in electrochemical characterization of the electrodes. Then, the prepared sulfur-doped graphene-coated electrodes by using cyclic voltammetry in one-step and low cost are used as electrode materials of supercapacitor for the first time in the literature. Since the mesoporous structure of the electrodes prepared in lower potential ranges increases, specific capacitance of the electrodes increases from 74 to 1833 mF cm−2 with 10 mA cm−2 current density. This result shows that specific capacitances of prepared electrodes are higher than those of the electrodes prepared with metal-doped in the literature.
