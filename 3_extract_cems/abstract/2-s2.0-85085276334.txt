A novel cellulose nanofiber based flexible N-doped carbon mesh was prepared via the simple computerized numerical control (CNC) wet spinning and carbonization process using celluose nanofiber, graphene oxide and silk fibroin as raw materials. The cellulose nanofiber based flexible N-doped carbon mesh not only has welded microstructures at the intersection, but also has highly wrinkle microstructures along the axially oriented orientation. The N-doped carbon mesh materials exhibit excellent electrical conductivity with good flexibility. When the carbonization temperature is 1200 C, the sheet resistance of the carbon-based flexible mesh is only 27 ± 10 Ω/sq. In addition, the maximum area specific capacitance of flexible N-doped carbon mesh symmetric interdigital solid supercapacitor is about 4.5 mF cm−2 at a current density of 2.5 μA cm−2. The N-doped carbon mesh also displays excellent folding endurance. The capacitance retention rate is up to 152% after folding 50,000 times.
