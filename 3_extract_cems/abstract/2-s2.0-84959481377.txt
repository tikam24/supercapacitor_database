Two-ply yarn supercapacitors behave like conventional textile yarns to power next generation electronic textiles. To improve the capacitance of the yarn, we produced a metal filament reinforced carbon nanotube composite yarn which was further in situ polymerized with polyaniline nanowires for use as electrodes. The wearable two-ply yarn supercapacitor made from the composite electrodes possesses very high capacitance (91.67 mF cm-2) and energy density (12.68 Î¼W h cm-2), and excellent long term cycling stability for charging-discharging and flexing deformation. The two-ply nanocomposite yarn supercapacitors have been connected in series and in parallel to power miniature electronic devices in smart textiles.
