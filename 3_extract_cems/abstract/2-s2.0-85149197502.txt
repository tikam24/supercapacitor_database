Electric vehicle (EV) is developed because of its environmental friendliness, energy-saving and high efficiency. For improving the performance of the energy storage system of EV, this paper proposes an energy management strategy (EMS) based model predictive control (MPC) for the battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which takes stabilizing the DC bus voltage and improving the efficiency of the system as two major optimization goals. In addition, an enumeration algorithm is presented to solve the optimization function. The experimental results show the performance of the proposed EMS which is able to enhance the overall instantaneous power and prevent the battery from overloading. Meanwhile, compared with the results of a single battery storage system, the maximum amplitude of the battery current in the HESS is reduced by 40.81% and whole system energy loss is reduced by 24.13% with the proposed power management strategy.
