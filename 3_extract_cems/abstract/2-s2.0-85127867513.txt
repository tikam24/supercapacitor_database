Ruthenium nitride was successfully deposited on a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) forest grown on a stainless-steel mesh substrate by radiofrequency plasma-assisted pulsed laser deposition. This novel dry fabrication method for flexible supercapacitor electrodes eliminates toxic byproducts and the need for any binder component. Experimental results show a successful thin film coating of the individual MWCNTs with RuNxunder various synthesis conditions. The electrochemical characterization demonstrates a significant improvement in capacitance of the synthesized RuNx-MWCNT electrode compared to the bare MWCNT forest, with a large potential window of 1.2 V. Capacitance values as high as 818.2 F g-1(37.9 mF cm-2) have been achieved.
