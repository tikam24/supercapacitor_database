Because of high specific surface area, rich active sites and superior electron conductivity, element-doping porous carbon@metal nanoparticles composite is identified as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. Herein, guar gum (GG) and melamine are used as carbon and N sources, respectively. Because of the high affinity between Cu(OH)2 and GG, gel fibers with high yield and good size distribution can be obtained; after carbonization and pickling, the N-doping porous carbon@Cu composite fiber (NPCF@Cu), with high specific surface area, rich porous structure, and uniform distributed Cu nanoparticles, has been successfully prepared. Results show that the NPCF@Cu-10 exhibits high specific capacitance (334.6 F g−1 at 2 A g−1) and excellent rate capability (62.7% capacity retention at 50 A g−1 versus that of 2 A g−1). Furthermore, its superior electrochemical performance in two-electrode configuration demonstrates that the NPCF@Cu can be utilized as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
