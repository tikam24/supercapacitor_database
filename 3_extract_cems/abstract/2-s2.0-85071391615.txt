Super-capacitors, lithium ion batteries, aluminium air batteries, lithium air batteries, lithium sulfur batteries, and zinc-air batteries can be utilized for flexible electronic device applications as their energy storage devices. All of them possess desired features of all-dimension-deformability and weaveability. Also they can be part of bigger picture by integrating with flexible, wearable and energy harvesting devices, helping them to self-power and multi-function. In this paper we have presented materials perspective and requirements of constitutional parts (electrodes, electrolytes) of these energy storage devices. Their electrical, mechanical, environmental constraints, design principles, material, structure and challenges for integration have been discussed. Flexible electronics applications in various fields have also been mentioned.
