Currently, the exploration of energy conversion/storage devices for harsh environment applications with satisfying property is still a grand challenge. In the present work, the highly robust and flexible micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) based on (Ta, Ti, Nb)C nanowires (NWs) and activated carbon hybrid structures as the electrode materials are reported. Given to the inherent advantages of (Ta, Ti, Nb)C NWs, e.g. stable electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility, and abundant porous structure stemed from cross-linked (Ta, Ti, Nb)C NWs and bamboo-based active carbon, the as-prepared (Ta, Ti, Nb)C/C-MSCs show high electrochemical performance, mechanical stability, and temperature tolerance over a wide temperature range. Remarkably, the as-constructed (Ta, Ti, Nb)C/C-MSCs can endure the sub-ambient temperature operation down to −50 °C with a capacitance retention of 82.7% and present capacitance retention up to 97.7% over one cycle of cooling and heating between −50 and 25 °C, compared with that at room temperature. Even under progressive variation in temperatures ranged between 25 and -50 °C, the capacitance retention keeps up to 92.6% over 9000 cycles, representing their promising to be serviced as highly robust MSCs against harsh low-temperature conditions for energy storage.
