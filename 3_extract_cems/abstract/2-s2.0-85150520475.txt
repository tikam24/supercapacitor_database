We report on fabricating manganese-lanthanum sulfide/graphene oxide (MnS-La2S3/GO) composite electrodes by cost-effective economical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for high-performance flexible symmetric supercapacitors. The prepared MnS-La2S3/GO composite electrode possesses a high specific surface area of 156 m2 g−1 and a porous thin multilayer nanosheet structure, which helped to achieve improved supercapacitive performance. The assembled MnS-La2S3/GO flexible symmetric supercapacitor device exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a cell voltage of up to 1.6 V, specific energy of 54.26 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 1.3 kW kg−1 and demonstrates higher capacitance retention of 92.51% after 10,000 cycles.
