Simulation results show that a fourfold reduction in peak battery current, and a 40% increase in vehicle range can be achieved by hybridization of a conventional lead acid battery powered neighborhood electric vehicle with supercapacitors and a controlled DC/DC converter. The reduced battery current could lead to lower total vehicle cost of ownership through reduction in the battery replacement cost.
