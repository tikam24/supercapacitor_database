The development of flexible supercapacitors (SCs) with high energy density, excellent deformation and cycling stability has great meaning for flexible electronic. Herein, polyaniline array@carbon nanotubes/partially reduced graphene oxide hybrid fiber (PANI@CNT/PRGO) was rationally designed and fabricated. The PANI array were vertically and uniformly grown on CNT/PRGO fiber by controlling the nucleation sites on the fiber. This unique structure enabled the ion to rapid diffusion and the electron to fast transport and sufficient utilization of active sites. The strong interfacial interaction between PANI and CNT/PRGO fiber can reduce the risk of PANI shedding from the fiber during mechanical deformation and long-term cycling. As a consequence, a fiber-shaped SC fabricated by PANI@CNT/PRGO fiber can deliver high volumetric capacitance of 50.2 F cm−3 at a current density of 60 mA cm−3 with 62.5% capacitance retention at 2000 mA cm−3. More encouragingly, the device not only possesses outstanding flexibility and deformation stability (Retention 96.6% after 2000 bending cycles) but also owns prominent long-term stability (Retention 95.8% after 20,000 cycles). Furthermore, the device can yield an outstanding energy density up to 6.97 mWh cm−3. This findings may carve out a new path for regulating the nucleation sites to control the distribution of nanomaterials on graphene fiber, thus obtain hybrid fiber electrodes with outstanding electrochemical performances.
