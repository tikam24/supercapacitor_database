One-dimensional (1D) NiMoO4{dot operator}xH2O nanorods and β-FeMoO4 microrods are successfully synthesized by simple hydrothermal method without using any organic solvents. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns reveal the single phase formation of nickel molybdate (NiMoO4{dot operator}xH2O) and pure monoclinic phase of β-FeMoO4. The growth of one dimensional morphology of both the molybdates are identified from scanning and transmission electron microscopes (SEM and TEM). The cyclic voltammogram envisage the pseudocapacitance behavior of NiMoO4{dot operator}xH2O and β-FeMoO4 through the reversible redox reactions of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ ions. An asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using NiMoO4{dot operator}xH2O nanorods and β-FeMoO4 as a positive and negative electrode, respectively. The β-FeMoO4||NiMoO4{dot operator}xH2O asymmetric supercapacitor delivers a capacitance of 81Fg-1 at a current density of 1mAcm-2. The cell exhibits a high energy density of 29Whkg-1 and good cycling stability even after 1000 cycles. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.
