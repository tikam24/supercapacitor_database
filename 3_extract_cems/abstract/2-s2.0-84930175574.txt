Influence of separator material on the high and low frequency series resistance, characteristic time constant, energy and power densities of the supercapacitors (SCs), based on two identical ideally polarizable microporous titanium carbide-derived carbon electrodes in different electrolytes: 1M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 in acetonitrile (AN) solution, 1M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 in dimethyl carbonate, ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate (DMC:EC:PC) mixture, and 1-ethyl-3- methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ionic liquid, has been tested by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and constant power discharge methods. Four different separator materials were studied, two commercial ones TF4425 and Celgard2400, and two self-made PVDF membranes with different morphologies. Influence of temperature on the SC characteristics has been performed at +24 and -30 Â°C with SCs completed with 1M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 in AN and in DMC:EC:PC electrolytes. It was established that the separator material structure and chemical composition noticeably influences the high frequency series resistance, phase angle, characteristic time constant and power density values of SC.
