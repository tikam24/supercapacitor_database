A strategy for the synthesis of nanostructured metal carbides that can convert oxides into carbides while maintaining their original nanomorphology is proposed in this study. TiC nanotube arrays (TiC NTAs) were successfully prepared by electrodeoxidation and carbonization in a low-temperature molten salt (600 °C) using TiO2nanotube arrays (TiO2NTAs) as precursors. The effects of different factors on the heritability of nanostructures are discussed in detail. TiC NTAs have a highly ordered and directional array structure, a large specific surface area, excellent electrical conductivity, and outstanding chemical stability. Quasi-solid-state supercapacitors based on TiC NTA electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical energy storage properties such as low charge transfer resistance, high energy density (4.2 μW h cm-2), and excellent cycle stability (90% retention after 10,000 cycles). This study demonstrates a high-performance supercapacitor nanoarray material and provides a general method to synthesize nanostructured metal carbides.
