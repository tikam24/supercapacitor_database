Activated carbons (ACs) based on wood charcoal were synthesized via sodium hydroxide activation and studied as electrode material in supercapacitors (sulfuric acid electrolyte). In focus were the porous structure of the ACs and their electrochemical properties as a function of the synthesis conditions. The data of surface area and pore volume and pore size dimensions (determined by N2 adsorption and evaluated based on three theories) of the ACs activated at 700Â°C and with NaOH/carbonizate ratios of 2 and 3.7 are reported, such as the specific capacitance (F g-1), specific resistance (Ohm cm), electrolyte volume (mm3 g-1) and the specific power capacity of a cell (Wh kg-1) of the supercapacitors made of various ACs. It was established that the porosity is increasing with increasing activation temperature and activator rate while the specific capacitance of the device increased up to 390 F g-1 based on elementary cell mass.
