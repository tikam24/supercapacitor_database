Supercapacitors are attractive energy storage devices for their excellent stability and charge and discharge capability. Electrode materials are the key determinant of supercapacitor applications. Polyaniline-based composite materials are used in the fabrication of energy storage devices widely and they are showing good cyclic performance. This study describes the synthesis of polyaniline-chitosan composite by the polymerization of aniline in acidic medium and the dispersion of synthesized polyaniline in the chitosan matrix. The morphology and structural properties of the synthesized composite were studied by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TGA, and the electrochemical properties were assessed by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. The composite was used as supercapacitor electrode material and its electrochemical performance was evaluated by a typical three-electrode cell in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Chitosan plays the role of a binder and the composite showed a remarkable charge storage capacity of 426.9 F. gâˆ’1 at 1 mA with high cyclic stability over 500 cycles with 74% capacitance retention. This study successfully attempts to eliminate the harmful binder polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) generally used in supercapacitor electrodes. Based on the results, polyaniline -chitosan composite with high storage capacity can be considered as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
