This summary paper introduces several circuitry implementations of the super-immittances, i.e. super-inductors and super-capacitors. The proposed circuits are ready neither for immediate design nor practical applications; further analysis is required here to answer stability questions or quantify other limitations. These networks are derived by using systematic procedure based on the matrix method of the unknown nodal voltages with prescribed form of input immittance. Doing this the realizations can be without inductors, electronically tunable via trans-admittance of the operational trans-admittance amplifiers. Proper functions of derived individual two-terminal elements are preliminary verified by Orcad Pspice circuit simulator. The non-ideal and parasitic properties of the used active elements are studied only briefly leaving the place for future research.
