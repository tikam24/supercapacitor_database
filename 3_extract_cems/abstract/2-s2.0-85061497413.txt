1T-Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid fibers with good strength and energy storage performance were fabricated through a wet-spinning method. They can be widely used in wearable energy storage devices/textiles as fibrous electrode materials. In the hybrid fibers, graphene oxide nanosheets (NSs) are modified with ultrathin and large area MoS 2 NSs to enhance the exposed active sites and pseudocapacitive activity. The pseudocapacitive, all-solid-state hybrid fiber shaped supercapacitor (ASFS) provides high strength (109.44-204.27 MPa) and high specific capacitances (134.38 F g −1 , 332.85 mF cm −2 and 221.9 F cm −3 at a current of 50 mA). The capacitance of the hybrid supercapacitor is maintained at 100% of the initial capacitance when bent by 30 and 60 degrees. Then, 3 symmetrically assembled tandem and parallel ASFS groups in textile (ASFSs-T) were fabricated and show tunable voltage output, tailored capacitance, and outstanding flexibility. These high strength electrochemical electrode materials could be potential candidates for applications in practical and large-scale energy storage systems and clothing textiles.
