Real-time simulation test beds for new zero-emission hybrid electric vehicles are considered as an attractive challenge for future transport applications that are fully recommended in the laboratory environment. In contrast, new zero-emission hybrid electric vehicles have a more complicated charging procedure. For this reason, an efficient simulation tools development for hydrogen consumption control becomes critical. In this vein, a New Zero Emission Hybrid Electric Vehicle Simulation (NZE-HEVSim) tool for the dynamic Fuel Cell Hybrid-Electric System is proposed to smartly control multisource activities. The designed system consists of a proton-exchange membrane fuel cell used to provide the required energy demand and a Supercapacitor system for energy recovery assistance in load peak or in fast transient. To regulate the supplied power, an efficient Real-Time Embedded Intelligent Energy Management (RT-EM-IEM) is implemented and tested through various constraints. The proposed intelligent energy management system aims to act quickly against sudden circumstances related to hydrogen depletion in the basis required fuel consumption prediction using multi-agent system (MAS). The proposed MAS strategy aims to define the proper operating agent according to energy demand and supply. The obtained results prove that the designed system meets the objectives set for RT-EM-IEM by referring to an experimental velocity database.
