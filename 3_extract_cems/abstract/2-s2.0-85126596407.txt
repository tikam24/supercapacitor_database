The transition mixed spinel ferrites (SFs) are the components used in the current modern technology and these include better elements whose ionic radii and oxidation state for exploring their electrochemical (EC) - photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting properties. In the current work, Ca2+ - doped MgFe2O4 NPs are synthesized and characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the crystal structure and particle size. The EC characteristics such as cyclic voltammetry were used to perform the super capacitive (SC) behavior of Ca2+ - doped MgFe2O4 electrodes. The cyclic voltammetry measurements analysis confirmed the prepared electrode's EC activity behavior. The current study was performed to examine the EC behavior of Ca2+ - doped MgFe2O4 electrodes in 1 M KOH electrolytes. The Mg0.9Ca0.1Fe2O4 revealed a significant specific capacitance (SP) of 221.57 F g−1 at 0.33 A g−1 current density (CD). Accordingly, Mg0.9Ca0.1Fe2O4 may be employed as a favorable electrode for supercapacitor applications. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Ca2+ - doped MgFe2O4 electrodes was performed as electrocatalysts in 1 M KOH. The Mg1−xCaxFe2O4 (x = 0.1, 0.3 & 0.5) NPs could be significant agents for PEC water splitting applications. The current study may lead to a new insight into the growth of a new class of mixed transition SFs for energy and environmental applications.
