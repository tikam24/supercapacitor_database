Porous carbon with a high specific surface area was prepared using a cheap coconut shell as raw material, and then the porous carbons were treated with nitric acid vapor in a closed reactor to improve the hydrophilicity of carbons. Using scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), physical adsorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle tests to measure the morphology, pore structure, composition, and hydrophilicity of carbons. The influence of nitric acid vapor on the morphology and structure of porous carbon materials at different temperatures was explored. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge and discharge, and electrochemical impedance methods were used to investigate the supercapacitor performance of porous carbon materials. The results showed that the specific surface areas and pore volumes of the porous carbon vapor were reduced after the post-treatment of nitric acid vapor, and the decrease was more obvious with the increase of the treatment temperature, while the hydrophilicity was getting better. Electrochemical test results showed that the porous carbon material (CSC-100) treated with 100 ℃ nitric acid vapor had the best supercapacitor performance. In the three electrodes system with 6 mol·L-1 KOH as the electrolyte, when the current density was 0.5 A·g-1, the specific capacitance of CSC-100 can reach 452.9 F·g-1, while the specific capacitance of untreated carbon (CSC) was only 350.4 F·g-1. The capacitance contribution analysis shows that the good hydrophilicity and surface functional groups of CSC- 100 increase not only the electric double-layer capacitance but also improve the pseudocapacitance.
