Supercapacitor is a latest technology in the field ofelectrical energy storage devices. Electrical energy storage will be a critical issue in all renewable energy storage systems. Supercapacitor technology along with conventional battery/ fuel cell can address many issues involved in it. Capacitance and internal resistance are considered as output parameters in any supercapacitor modeling methods. However pulse current is also very important and providing high pulse current is the primary goal of supercapacitor connection in energy storage system. Hence, pulse current is considered as an output parameter in the presented work. This paper presents the use of response surface methodology for optimization of pulse current of an aqueous metal oxide based supercapacitor. Â© 2012 IEEE.
