The rapid development of supercapacitors has led to an increasing demand for the exploitation of stable and excellent electroactive electrode materials. Herein, a novel hybrid material of N, P co-doped hollow carbon microspheres (N/P-HCS) and ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets was facilely constructed for the electrode material of supercapacitors through a two-step synthetic strategy including the preparation of N/P-HCS and subsequent growth of MnO2 nanosheets on N/P-HCS. The N/P-HCS@MnO2 hybrid possesses a N/P-HCS core and a porous shell composed of ultrathin MnO2 nanosheets. Moreover, the morphology and content of MnO2 in the hybrid can be controlled by designing the stoichiometric chemical reaction between N/P-HCS and KMnO4. The hybrid electrode exhibits excellent electron transport, fast electrolyte ions diffusion, rapid and reversible Faradaic reaction, and good rate performance. Additionally, a green asymmetric supercapacitor was manufactured using typical hybrid N/P-HCS@MnO2-30 as positive electrode and N/P-HCS as negative electrode, which displayed a high energy density of 32.21 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 449.8 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability (capacitance retention of 94.5% after 3000 cycles). These results show that the N/P-HCS@MnO2 might be an attractive electrode material for practical application in advanced supercapacitor.
