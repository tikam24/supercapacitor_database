DC micro-grids are the key technology for integrating distributed renewable energy resources (DERs) in the decentralized generation system since most of them are DC inherent. Energy storage systems play important role in stabilizing DC micro grids. In recent years hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) draw a tremendous attention because of their excellent dynamics. In this paper, novel DC-DC single-inductor double-input bidirectional converter is presented for integrating the HESS to the DC micro-grid. The steady-state analysis of proposed converter is presented. Small-signal model of the converter is derived out and control strategy is demonstrated. Finally, detailed simulations are carried out in MATLAB SIMULINK. The capability of proposed converter for proper power-sharing between the battery and the super capacitor is validated through simulations.
