In this study, N, S co-doped bamboo fiber derived carbon has been prepared when K3Fe(CN)6 and thiourea are selected as graphitization catalysis and dopant, respectively. The derived carbon possesses a large SBET, suitable graphitization degree, excellent conductivity and wettability of electrolyte, and particularly, it exhibits a unique sheet-like microstructure derived from the layer stripping of gas produced by thiourea pyrolysis, and these microstructure features are very beneficial for energy storage. Typically, the derived carbon displays a high specific capacitance of 328 F/g and an acceptable rate capability of 61.3% at 15 A g−1 in three-electrode systems. Meanwhile, the derived carbon-based coin-type symmetric supercapacitors are assembled in an aqueous electrolyte and an ionic liquid electrolyte, respectively, and they all show a considerable synergetic energy-power output performance (21.2 Wh kg−1 at 454 W kg−1 in aqueous electrolyte, and 61.6 Wh kg−1 at 300 W kg−1 in ionic liquid electrolyte), indicating the potential application of the derived carbon in supercapacitors.
