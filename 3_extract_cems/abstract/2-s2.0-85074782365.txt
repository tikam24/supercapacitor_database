In this work, carbon fiber clothes (CFC) supported 1T phase MoS2 anode material is synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method. The CFC-MoS2 composites has high specific capacitance of 1485.08 F g−1 at the current density of 2 A g−1, and the 54% of initial capacitance can be remained at the current density reached to 15 A g−1. The 87.5% of initial capacitance can be harvested even at the ceaseless cycled for 10,000 cycles at 4 A g−1. In addition, the MgAl layered double hydroxides and graphene oxide (MgAl-LDH-GO) cathode composite material is synthesized. The MgAl-LDH-GO cathode exhibits high specific capacitance (1208.50 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and long cycle life (76.9% retention during 10,000 cycles). Finally, we successfully assemble the CFC-MoS2//MgAl-LDH-GO asymmetric supercapacitor. It has high energy density of 326.54 Wh kg−1 at power density of 1500 W kg−1, and the energy density can be remained at 279.56 Wh kg−1 even the power density reach to 12 kW kg−1. This excellent performance satisfied the current demand of the high power and energy density. Thus, the lightweight (<0.25 mg/cm2), ultrathin (<0.8 mm), and the favourable electrochemical performance make it suitable for the next generation energy storage device.
