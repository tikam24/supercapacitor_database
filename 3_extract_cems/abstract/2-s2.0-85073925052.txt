Copper cobaltite (CuCo2O4) porous structures with different morphologies are prepared through a hydrothermal method and subsequent annealing process. The tunability of morphologies is succeeded by simply regulation of solvent medium and amount of the polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) which is served as structure directing agent. All the prepared samples have a mesoporous nature. Specifically, the CuCo2O4-porous structures with flowers morphology have a higher surface area (43.2 m2 g−1) and porosity (0.18 cm3 g−1) than the other porous nano structures such as flakes, blades and wires. The maximum specific capacity of CuCo2O4-Flowers is 466.4 C g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The cycling stability of CuCo2O4-Flowers shows capacity retention of 86.3 % at a high current density of 15 A g−1 after completion of 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the CuCo2O4-Flower shows superior performance than the CuCo2O4-Flakes, Blade and Wires.
