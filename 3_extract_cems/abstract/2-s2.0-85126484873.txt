Electric Vehicles are one of the key solutions to multiple environmental issues. With multiple countries shifting their focus to clean energy and slowly drifting away from the use of fossil fuels, they will be vital to efficient and environment-friendly transportation soon. One of the key problems with Electric Vehicles is that they rely on large lithium-ion batteries weighing hundreds of pounds. These are typically made with cobalt, nickel, and manganese, among other components, and they cost thousands of dollars while also proving to be an environmental burden. This paper discusses the implementation of a full-bridge CLLC resonant converter that behaves bidirectionally and increases the efficiency of the charger by implementing soft switching in forward as well as reverse modes of operation. The CLLC converter demonstrated is multiple inputs with a battery and a supercapacitor having a single output that is a battery. These models, their execution and extensive analysis based on simulation results and graphs obtained from MATLAB/Simulink 2020b have been discussed in the paper.
