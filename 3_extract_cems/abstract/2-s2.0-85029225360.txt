(Figure Presented) Fe2O3 is one of the promising negative electrodes for asymmetric supercapacitors. But the rather low conductivity and poor cycling stability hinder its practical application. Herein, we report a facile electrochemical deposition technique to prepare porous Fe2O3 nanosheets on carbon fabric (CF-Fe2O3). The obtained Fe2O3 displays highly porous nanosheet structure with reduced ion diffusion length and significantly enhanced conductivity. As a flexible supercapacitor electrode, the CF-Fe2O3 hybrid electrode delivers a large areal capacitance of 1.56 F cm-2, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability without capacitance decay after 5000 cycles. A packaged solid-state supercapacitor device based on the flexible CF-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits an areal capacitance of 842 mF cm-2 and a volumetric energy density of 6.75 mWh cm-3, together with superior cycling performance which remains 93% capacitance after 4000 cycles. Moreover, the device performance is well retained under various bending and twisting states.
