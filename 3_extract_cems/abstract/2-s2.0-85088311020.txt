In view of the problem of insufficient driving distance of electric vehicles, the supercapacitor (SC) and DC/DC converter are connected in parallel to form a fully active hybrid energy storage system (HESS), in which the battery is used as the main power source, and the SC is used as the auxiliary power source, and they are connected to the bus through a bidirectional DC/DC converter. A power distribution control strategy based on sliding mode control is proposed. The proposed control strategy includes a sliding mode controller to accurately track the reference values of battery and supercapacitor current, a voltage controller is used to maintain bus voltage stability, and the stability analysis is based on the Lyapunov method. The simulation results show that the proposed sliding mode control strategy can accurately track the reference value of the battery and SC current, and stabilize the bus voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is fully proved.
