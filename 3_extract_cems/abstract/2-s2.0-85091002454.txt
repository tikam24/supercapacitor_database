This review focuses on describing the current state-of-the-art research in the synthesis of 3D architectures for electrochemical capacitor applications. The selection is based on both template and non-template strategies. Particular attention has been paid to carbon materials because of their structural interconnection, as they create not only the desired hierarchical porous channels but also ensure high conductivity and mechanical stability. A comprehensive overview of electrode materials is presented here with a detailed discussion of composite solutions, including their advantages and disadvantages. Numerous examples from the literature are presented for individual solutions. The future challenges posed for this type of material are finally summarized.
