This paper presents an integral sliding mode control of a synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) operating as part of an urban electric vehicle. On the sources side of the electric vehicle, an energy management strategy (EMS) based on a frequency decoupling strategy is applied to supervise a battery-super-capacitor hybrid power system (HPS). These two sources are linked in parallel to the DC bus through two bidirectional DC-DC converters, allowing for independent control of each source's power flow. On the traction side, an integral sliding mode control is design for robust stabilization and disturbance rejection of the synchronous reluctance motor (SynRM) drive system. In order to verify the efficiency of the proposed control technique and evaluate the performance of the sources energy management strategy, a comprehensive simulation of electric vehicle was carried out using Matlab/Sim ulink software.
