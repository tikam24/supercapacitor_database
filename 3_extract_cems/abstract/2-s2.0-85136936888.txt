This work reports a comparative study of electrolytic behavior of PEDOT:PSS-SPGO nanocomposite-based supercapacitor devices in aqueous and polymer gel electrolytes. Initially, more purified and finely dispersed graphene oxide (SPGO) was synthesized by using a spray dryer process. Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS was mixed in a certain optimum concentration with SPGO and a PEDOT:PSS-SPGO nanocomposite was prepared. The utility of PEDOT:PSS-SPGO nanocomposite was investigated by fabricating its supercapacitor devices. Here, the incorporation of SPGO enhanced the electrochemical performance of the PEDOT:PSS by developing the PEDOT:PSS-SPGO nanocomposite. The prepared nanocomposite-based device exhibited the highest Csp of 134.66 and 155 F g−1 in polyvinyl alcohol-phosphoric acid (PVA-H3PO4))polymer gel and aqueous 1 M H3PO4 electrolytes, respectively, at 5 mV s−1 which were higher than that of pure PEDOT:PSS and SPGO. In addition, this nanocomposite showed a good energy density and high-power density of 10.79 W h kg−1 and 1529.29 W kg−1, respectively, in aqueous electrolyte.
