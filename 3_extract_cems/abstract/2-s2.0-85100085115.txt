Nickel-manganese layered double hydroxide (NiMn-LDH) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam by hydrothermal method, with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as template agents. The prepared NiMn-LDH materials with different morphology exhibit high capacity and cycle stability. In particular, the P-NM material fabricated by choosing PVP as template agents presents a high specific capacity of 692.8 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent durability (81.3% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). Besides, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device based on P-NM and activated carbon electrode delivers an energy density of 57.71 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 798.41 W kg−1, and satisfactory cycle stability (capacity retention 70.27% after 2000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical properties of NiMn-LDH materials indicate the potential applications as electrode materials in hybrid supercapacitor.
