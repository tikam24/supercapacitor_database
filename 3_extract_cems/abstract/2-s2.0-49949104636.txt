Highly porous sheets comprised of single walled carbon nanotubes and doped polypyrrole (SWNT-PPy) were prepared by vacuum filtration of SWNT-PPy methanol dispersions. The employed preparation procedure is an extension of conventional bucky-paper fabrication technique for the multi-component system. A number of nanocomposites with nominal SWNT:PPy compositions ranging from 1:0 to 1:1 were obtained and tested. Electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic spectroscopy technique in aqueous 1 M NaCl electrolyte. The highest specific capacitance of 131 F/g was obtained for nanocomposite with 1:1 SWNT:PPy ratio. Prospective applications of prepared materials range from supercapacitors to electrodes for batteries and electromechanical actuators. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
