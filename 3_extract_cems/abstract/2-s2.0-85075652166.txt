Facile and high-performance electrode materials are crucial for the conversion and storage of clean energy. A gold-supported nanostructured NiFeCoPr hydroxide is synthesized by directly electrodepositing praseodymium-doped nickel-cobalt-iron hydroxide onto a gold-deposited nickel foam (NF) substrate. The resultant monolithic NiFeCoPrO-Au/NF electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (1792 F g-1 at a current density of 10 A g-1), excellent rate capability (1445 F g-1 at a current density of 70 A g-1), and eminent capacitance retention (99.5% after 30 000 cycles) in 3 M KOH electrolyte. When used as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst, NiFeCoPrO-Au/NF shows high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction with a small Tafel slope of 28 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte and excellent stability over 10 h. These characteristics demonstrate the enormous potential of the NiFeCoPrO-Au/NF electrode for applications in electrocatalysis and supercapacitors.
