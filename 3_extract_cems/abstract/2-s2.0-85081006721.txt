This chapter discusses the work performed in electrochemical energy storage devices using cluster beam deposition (CBD) technique. The works are divided in four groups according to the energy storage mechanism and the role performed by the cluster in the system: (1) electrical double-layer supercapacitors (EDL SCs) built by C clusters that act as building blocks, are electrically conductive and polarizable; (2) redox SCs with redox active clusters (with charge transfer) on the surface of a porous conductive electrode; (3) Liâ€“O2 batteries in which the reactions between Li+ and O2 molecules are catalyzed by Au clusters; and (4) Li-ion batteries (LIBs), in particular, intercalated layers of Si and clusters that behave as scaffolds and determine the mechanical and electrochemical response of the electrode. The particularities of cluster deposition, the physicochemical properties and electrochemical response of the electrodes, and the advantages of using CBD are discussed for each point.
