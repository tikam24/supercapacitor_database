Nowadays the Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) are being endorsed by the population extensively. So, to exploit the RESs effectively, the concept of Energy Storage System (ESS) has been described in the literature. An ESS can balance the instability and the power demanded by the load, continuing its study and reliable nature. So far, Battery has been proved to be a leading energy storage device as compared to other devices and can be used as an ESS. But a solitary ESS fails to satisfy the assets in the matter of lifespan, cost, durability, dynamic response, and capability. So, to overcome these problems, a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) using a Battery and a SuperCapacitor (SC) has been proposed in this framework. A SC can diminish the strain of the Battery and function as a buffer to counter the oscillations in power. The system is designed using MATLAB/Simulink domain and the simulation output shows an effective dynamic response of the HESS than that shown by an ESS alone. A PID controller is included that operates the parameters such that the system can yield quick feedback. However, the demerit of the PID controller is that it cannot respond to nonlinearity in a system. So, to dynamically tune the PID controller parameters for optimal operation, a robust Weighted Superposition Attraction Algorithm (WSAA) has been implemented in this work. For justifying the enhancement in systems transient stability, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) analysis has been done and the values obtained are well within the IEEE-517 limits.
