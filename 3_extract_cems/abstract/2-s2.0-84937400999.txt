A new concept is introduced to fabricate flexible, on-chip supercapacitors by electrophoretically depositing highly dispersed reduced graphene oxide/polypyrrole on interdigital-like electrodes. By the unique method, the deposited films could construct on the substrate facilely and uniformly. The prepared all-solid-state device demonstrates high volumetric capacitance (about 147.9 F cm<sup>-3</sup>), high energy density (13.15 mWh cm<sup>-3</sup> at a power density of 1300 mW cm<sup>-3</sup>) and excellent cycling stability (approximately 71.7% of the initial capacitance retained after 5000 cycles). Compared with other supercapacitor, the device demonstrated here is lightweight, flexible and inexpensive.
