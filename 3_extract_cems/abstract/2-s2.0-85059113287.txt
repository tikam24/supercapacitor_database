The woollen-like structure of Copper Oxide (CuO) thin films has been synthesized via chemical method using aqueous ammonia as a complexing agent which is directly used as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. CuO electrode achieved maximum specific capacitance of 576 F/g, exhibited for 5 mV/s scan rate with the small Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) value of 0.72 Î©. The highest energy density, power density and Coulomb efficiency of CuO electrode was observed having values of 19.65 Wh/kg, 916.66 W/kg and 82.01% respectively at current density of 1 mA/cm2. CuO thin films are found to have monoclinic structure as confirmed from X-ray Diffraction (XRD). It is observed that as the deposition time enhances the crystallite size also increases, whereas micro-strain, dislocation density and distortion parameters decrease. The FESEM results confirmed woollen-like structure of CuO thin films. Surface wettability shows hydrophilic nature with the liquid interface. The EDS spectra confirmed the Cu and O elements present in the prepared samples. The BET analysis shows that the CuO thin film has high surface area of 39.58 m2/g with mesoporous characteristics. These results show that electrode will be a potential material in the supercapacitor applications besides it is cost-effective.
