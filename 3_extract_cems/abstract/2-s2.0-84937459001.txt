Vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) core/shell hybrid aerogels with different MWCNT contents are controlled synthesized through a facile mixed growth and self-assembly methodology. V2O5 coated MWCNTs from the in situ growth of V2O5 on the surface of acid-treated MWCNTs incorporate with V2O5 nanofibers from the preferred orientation growth of V2O5 in a one-step sol-gel process. These two kinds of one-dimensional fibers self-assemble into a three-dimensional monolithic porous hybrid aerogel. Owing to its high specific surface area, favorable electrical conductivity and unique three-dimensional and core/shell structures, the light weight hybrid aerogel (about 30 mg cm-3) exhibits excellent specific capacitance (625 F g-1), high energy density (86.8 W h kg-1) and outstanding cycle performance (>20 000 cycles). And the optimal content of MWCNTs in hybrid aerogels for the highest-performance supercapacitor is 7.6%.
