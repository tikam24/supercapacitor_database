The paper reports a kind of NiCo 2 O 4 material with urchin-like morphology. This material was prepared using a facile strategy of hydrothermal process followed by calcinations, and exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance. For example, it delivers a specific capacitance high up to 1167Fg-1 at 1Ag-1 and still retains a value of 1095Fg-1 at 10Ag-1, showing a good rate capability; after suffering from 3000 cycles at 10Ag-1, the specific capacitance has only a decay of 12%, presenting a good cycling stability.
