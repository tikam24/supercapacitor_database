The NiO/rGO composites were synthesized by hydrothermal preparation of precursors and then calcination of precursors into composites. The microscopic phase structure and morphology of the samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR and Raman. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic current charge and discharge test and the AC Impedance Test were used to study the electrochemical property and cycle performance of the NiO/rGO composite electrode. The results show that the incorporation of graphene and nickel oxide effectively increases the reversibility of NiO as an electrode material. The special structure of graphene provides a continuous network and more active sites for redox reactions. In the 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the specific capacitance of the NiO/rGO composite reached 171.3Fg when the current density was 0.5A/g, and the average specific capacitance only decreased by 20.93% after 2000 cycles at current density of 5 A/g.
