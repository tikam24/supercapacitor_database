Vanadium dioxide (VO2) received tremendous interest lately due to its unique structural, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. VO2 has been extensively used in electrochromic displays and memristors and its VO2 (B) polymorph is extensively utilized as electrode material in energy storage applications. More studies are focused on VO2 (B) nanostructures which displayed different energy storage behavior than the bulk VO2. The present review provides a systematic overview of the progress in VO2 nanostructures syntheses and its application in energy storage devices. Herein, a general introduction, discussion about crystal structure, and syntheses of a variety of nanostructures such as nanowires, nanorods, nanobelts, nanotubes, carambola shaped, etc. are summarized. The energy storage application of VO2 nanostructure and its composites are also described in detail and categorically, e.g. Li-ion battery, Na-ion battery, and supercapacitors. The current status and challenges associated with VO2 nanostructures are reported. Finally, light has been shed for the overall performance improvement of VO2 nanostructure as potential electrode material for future application.
