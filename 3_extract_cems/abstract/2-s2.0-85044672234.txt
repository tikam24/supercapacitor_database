This study reports the hydrothermal synthesis and electrochemical performance of Cobalt Tungstate (CoWO4) and Carbon nanotubes and Cobalt Tungstate nanocomposite (CNT-CoWO4) as supercapacitor electrode material. The active materials are directly deposited on carbon cloth substrates to fabricate binder free electrodes which exhibited specific capacitance of 1443 F g-1 and 1486 Fg-1 at 5 mVs−1 scan rate for CoWO4 and CNT-CoWO4 samples, respectively. As a result of increase in potential window (1 V for nanocomposite CNT-CoWO4 as compared to 0.6 V for CoWO4) and higher specific capacitance in three electrode system, CNT-CoWO4 electrode delivers higher energy density than the CoWO4 electrode. A symmetric capacitor is fabricated from CNT-CoWO4 nanocomposite electrodes. The performance of symmetric capacitor, operated within a potential window of 1.5 V, is comparable to the asymmetric devices. Furthermore, the device delivered maximum energy density of 12 W h kg−1 at 432 W kg-1 power density.
