Poly(3,4)-ethylenedioxythiophene/graphene oxide/iron oxide (PEDOT/GO/Fe2O3) ternary composite was synthesized using a simple one-step electropolymerization. The electrochemical studies showed that the specific capacitance of PEDOT/GO/Fe2O3 composite was three times higher (221 F g− 1) than the binary composite of PEDOT/GO which was 73 F g− 1 at 25 mV s− 1. The upsurge performance was believed to be contributed from anchoring particles of Fe2O3 on the wrinkly PEDOT/GO that acted as a spacer in order to maximize the utilization of the electroactive materials for electrochemical reaction. Furthermore, the PEDOT/GO/Fe2O3 composite was also able to attain a specific power of 8 Wh kg− 1 at a specific power of 493 W kg− 1 at 1 A g− 1 and exhibited excellent long-term stability performance even after 1000 cycles owing to the high mechanical strength provided by GO. These performances make PEDOT/GO/Fe2O3 composite as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
