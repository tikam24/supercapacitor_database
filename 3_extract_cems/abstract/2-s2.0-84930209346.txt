Integrated nanodevices with the capability of storing energy are widely applicable and thus have been studied extensively. To meet the demand for flexible integrated devices, asymmetric supercapacitors that simultaneously realize energy storage were fabricated by growing NiCo2O4@NiMoO4 hybrid nanowires on nickel foam, thus obtaining the positive electrode, and employing active carbon as the negative electrode. The as-assembled integrated systems were characterized by their improved energy storage (areal specific capacitance of 6.30 F cm-2 at 60 mA cm-2 and specific capacitance up to 1242 F g-2 at a current density of 10 mA cm-2), enhanced power density and energy density by increasing the potential window from 0 V to 1.6 V. Such flexible integrated devices might be used in smart and self-powered sensory, wearable, and portable electronics.
