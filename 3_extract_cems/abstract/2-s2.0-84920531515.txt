The widely used energy storage system for electric vehicle and electric operating machine based on battery has critical disadvantages. A solution for this problem is the use of battery/Supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS) due to advantages of SC in high power density, high cycle capability, and long life time. However, energy density of electric energy storage is much lower than the one of combustion engine. A solution for these problem is the repetitive charge for HESS via Wireless Power Transfer (WPT). In order to improve the transmission efficiency, the method of using a DC-DC converter to control secondary input impedance has been proposed in previous research. In this paper, a framework of HESS with WPT charging system is proposed for vehicle and electric operating machine application. Furthermore, capacity of HESS with WPT repetitive charging is designed, based on the requirements of the application.
