Co3O4 nanoflakes/N-doped graphene (NG) has been synthesized through a facile two-step synthesis route. The phase composition and morphology of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). It is found that introduction of NG has effects on the morphology of Co3O4 and leads to a well distribution of Co3O4 nanoflakes. The electrochemical properties of as-synthesized materials were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The composite presents an enhanced supercapacitor performance than the pristine Co3O4 nanoflakes, mainly due to the strong synergistic effect of the NG and Co3O4.
