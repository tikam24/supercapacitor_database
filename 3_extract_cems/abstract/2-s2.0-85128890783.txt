At present, electronic markets aim to develop new energy storage devices which are lightweight, portable, and flexible. In the present study, a flexible as well as a light weight energy storage device has been fabricated using tungsten oxide material. By a simple and effective hydrothermal technique, highly crystalline monoclinic tungsten oxide nanomaterial has been synthesised and the electrochemical performance of this material for supercapacitor energy storage application were analysed. Structural, optical and morphological studies were conducted using X-ray diffraction technique, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and FESEM analysis. The electrochemical performance studies are carried out in two electrode set up. The supercapacitor device exhibits a specific capacitance of 64 F g -1 at 5 mV sâˆ’1.
