In this paper, a simple and effective control approach to exploit the primary frequency support competency of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WT) is presented. Furthermore, a small rating supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is also integrated to reinforce the frequency regulation in the studied multi-area power system. A control-oriented strategy is employed to develop a discrete-time predictive control (DPC) for SCESS. The dynamic energy level thresholds are generated by representing the SCESS primary control by a first-order lag block for obtaining a discrete-time state-space model which yields the modified power constraints. Furthermore, the power thresholds of the power conditioning system (PCS) are chosen meticulously. The uprightness of the proposed scheme is manifested by the time-domain simulation results exhibiting considerable damping of the power system oscillations along with substantial curtailment in frequency nadir, with all the power and energy constraints of SCESS accounted for. The eigenvalue analysis is also carried out to validate the MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation results.
