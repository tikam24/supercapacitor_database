The capacitive performances of WO3 coated on graphite (G), either bare or modified with carbon nanowalls (CNW) or with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), were assessed. At WO3 deposited on bare graphite, it appears that the areal capacitance of the oxide deposited by continuous electrodeposition (8.5 mF cm−2), estimated from voltammetric results, is about seven times higher than that of the pulse-electrodeposited one (1.25 mF cm−2) suggesting that the former method is more appropriate. Further, WO3 was deposited by continuous electrodeposition on graphite modified with CNW or rGO. The results show that the presence of CNW enhances the capacitive performances of WO3-based electrodes by about nine times (the areal capacitance of WO3/CNW/G is ca. 78 mF cm−2) whereas the presence of rGO is less significant (ca. 35 mF cm−2). Furthermore, this high areal capacitance of WO3/CNW/G electrode was also confirmed by the charge–discharge tests, which recommends it for supercapacitor applications.
