Supercapacitors possess a great potential application in electric vehicles due to high power density, short charge-discharge time, long cycle life and low maintenance cost. The performance of supercapacitor is determined by electrode materials. Polyaniline has been extensively reported for the use of supercapacitors because of its high theoretical specific capacity, easy synthesis, low cost and good electrical conductivity. However, polyaniline occurs volume swelling and shrinkage during the repeated charge-discharge process, which leads to decreasing electrochemical capacitive performance. Polyaniline composited with graphene is a good way to improve the electrochemical capacitive properties, which is attributed to synergistic effect. Therefore, the methods including insitu polymerization, oil-water interfacial polymerization, electrochemical polymerization, layer-by-layer assembly method and so on for preparing graphene-polyaniline composite were reviewed in this paper. The ideas of utilizing three dimensional network graphene and modified graphene-polyaniline composite were proposed in order to improve the electrochemical capacitive properties of as-prepared composite.
