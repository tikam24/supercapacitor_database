Nanosized Bi2WO6 particles were successfully synthesized by sonochemical method with an objective to develop an inexpensive and eco-friendly electrode material for supercapacitors. The prepared materialwas subjected to various thermal, structural, morphological, compositional, electrical and electrochem-ical studies. Bi2WO 6 nanoparticle with homogeneous distribution was achieved through sonochemicalprocess. The lattice parameter and atomic positions of Bi 2WO6 structure were refined through Reitveldanalysis. The electrochemical performance of Bi2WO6 nanoparticles was investigated in various aqueouselectrolytes such as 1 M NaOH, 1 M LiOH, 1 M Na2SO4, 1 M KOH and 6 M KOH solutions. Among these,the material exhibited an enhanced electrochemical performance in KOH electrolyte due to its smallerhydration sphere radius, high ionic mobility and lower equivalent series resistance. The charge-dischargestudies rendered a specific capacitance of 608 F/g in 1 M KOH at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2. Bi2WO6 exhibited an excellent coulombic efficiency and specific capacitance of around 304 F/g at 3 mA/cm2inthe potential range from -0.9 to 0.1 V vs Hg/HgO in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The above results assured thatBi2WO6 could be utilized as suitable negative electrode material for supercapacitor applications and 1 MKOH could be its desirable electrolyte. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
