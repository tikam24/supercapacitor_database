In this work, firstly, we synthesized functionalized graphene oxide (SGO) by using of 1-methyl,3-buthyl- imidazole ionic liquid, tri phenyl phosphine, 1,6-diamino hexane in DMSO medium. Secondly, ZIF-67 and ZIF-8 as metal organic framework (MOF) were synthesized via chemical procedures. Afterward, dealing with improving electrochemical properties of the poly ortho aminophenol (POAP), we fabricated SGO/ZIF-67/POAP and SGO/ZIF-8/POAP films through electro-polymerization of POAP by employing of SGO/ZIF-67 and SGO/ZIF-8 to consider as the active electrode for SCs. The structural and valance state of the prepared samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical performances of these electrodes were comparatively analyzed through electrochemical impedance spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry tests. The results showed that the incorporation of SGo/ ZIF-67 improved the capacitive performance of POAP electrode. SGO/ZIF-67/POAP composite electrode exhibited higher capacitance value and maximum energy density as compared with ZIF-67/POAP, SGO/ZIF-8/POAP and pure graphene electrodes. This study reveals new high potential materials with high active surface area, low resistance and long cycle-life (aqueous media) features for electrochemical redox capacitors.
