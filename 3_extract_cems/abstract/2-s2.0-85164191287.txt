This work was aimed at preparing the composites TiO2@CNTs via facile sol-gel route and investigating the electrochemical performance in neutral aqueous electrolyte 1 M Na2SO4 with a high voltage of 1.8 V The synergistic effects between TiO2 and CNTs in composite electrode were offered a significantly high specific capacitance of 227 F·g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV·s−1. The EIS analysis evidenced not only the pseudocapacitance process of composite TiO2@CNTs with the combination of non-Faraday and Faraday process but also the superior electrochemical performance of TiO2@CNTs-5%. The ionic diffusion coefficients of TiO2@CNTs-5%, TiO2@CNTs-3%, and TiO2@CNTs-1% were calculated 1.47 × 10−17 cm2·s−1, 1.12 × 10−17 cm2·s−1, and 0.71 × 10−17 cm2·s−1, respectively. Moreover, TiO2@CNT electrodes have been utilized to assemble a symmetrical supercapacitor which has delivered an excellent capacitance of 97.3 F·g−1 at a current rate of 1 A·g−1. The device shows a long-term stability upon 5000 cycles without degradation, and the energy density of TiO2@CNTs was 15–43.8 Wh·kg−1 in the power density range of 1800–18,000 W·kg−1.
