A novel titanium, nitrogen co-doped carbon material was designed via a one-step solvothermal reaction at a moderate temperature. Characterization by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy illustrates that carbon materials without titanium doping possess a morphology of porous flakes, whereas the inclusion of titanium results in the deposition/intercalation of island-shaped TiO2 nanoparticles on these carbon flakes. Both the volumetric energy density and the cycling stability are significantly improved by titanium doping. Electrochemical measurements show that the introduction of titanium leads to a high volumetric capacitance of 285.5 F cm-3 at 0.5 A g-1 current density. Electrodes prepared with the new materials also exhibit excellent cycling stability, where there is no capacitance loss after 40 000 cycles in the 6 M KOH electrolyte at a high charge/discharge current of 30 A g-1. The volumetric energy density of the as-obtained symmetrical supercapacitor reaches 11.99 W h L-1, which is competitive to that of lithium thin-film batteries (1-10 W h L-1). This journal is
