In this work, a UV窶的R assisted intense pulsed light (IPL) process was used for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). It was found that the reduction efficiency of GO was enhanced compared to those of other reduction methods such as only intense pulsed light irradiation or other chemical method. An optimal condition for the reduction of GO was investigated by varying conditions and combinations of the UV窶的R assisted IPL. The graphene films reduced by the UV窶的R assisted IPL were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. As a result, we found the optimum condition of the UV窶的R assisted IPL process for the reduction of GO without any damage to the GO sheet. Also, the reduced GO based electrode was fabricated with nickel foam for the electrical double layer capacitor and its performance was tested using three electrode electrochemical method.
