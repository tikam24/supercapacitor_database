The electrochemical supercapacitor performance of a VSe2-reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid has been reported for the first time. The hybrid was synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal route at different concentrations of graphene oxide, i.e. 0.15, 0.3, and 0.75 wt%. Enhanced supercapacitor performances were observed in the case of the hybrid obtained at 0.3 wt% of GO. It showed a specific capacitance of ∼680 F g-1 at a mass normalised current of 1 A g-1 which was ∼6 and ∼5 fold higher than those of bare VSe2 and bare RGO, respectively. Furthermore, a high energy density of ∼212 W h kg-1, power density of ∼3.3 kW kg-1, and ∼81% retention of the initial capacitance even after 10 000 cycles of charge-discharge were observed.
