Several nanoscale fine-tuned micro- and mesoporous carbon powders C(Mo2C) produced by reacting M02C with Cl2 at various temperatures were studied and characterized using XRD and Raman spectroscopy methods and compared with low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption measurements data. Supercapacitors based on two ideally polarizable nanoporous carbon electrodes and different mesoporous commercially available separators in acetonitrile (AN) as the solvent for the 1.0 M (C2H5)3CH3NBF4 electrolyte have been completed and tested by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance methods.
