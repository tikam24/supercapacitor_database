There is an urgent need to develop means of greener synthesis strategies based on harmless activated chemical reagents, sustainable, economical and effective carbon precursors as active materials for supercapacitors. In this respect, the design and production of carbon-based electrode of supercapacitor with high catalytic activity is of great significance. The BET surface area of the N-S-doped carbon hollow sphere (N-S-CHS) is as large as 556 m2 g−1. The N-S-CHS electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 439.98 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, after 4000 cycles of constant current charge and discharge, the specific capacitance remains 92.3%. This work highlights the crucial role of metallic-free materials for applications in the energy storage and conversion.
