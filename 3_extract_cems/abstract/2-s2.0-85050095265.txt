There are various sources of energy used in day to day life like solar energy, wind energy, fossil fuels. Even a single day of mankind cannot be imagined without these various kind of energy. In this, electrical energy is the most widely used in today's generation. The various kind of energies is converted into electrical energy for most efficient output. As the energy is converted, there should be some or the other means to store the energy like mobile power banks are used to store electrical energy and utilize it when required. Supercapacitors are used for storing energy. Supercapacitors can store 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume than electrolytic capacitors, can charge and discharge at the much faster rate than batteries. This paper presents effect of ball milling variation on performance of supercapacitor. In the supercapacitors, electrode material consists of an activated carbon-vulcan XC 72 and manganese dioxide in equal ratio. Effect of change in ball milling time, a shape of the balls and size of the balls have been studied and presented in this paper. Effect of these parameters on the various parameter of supercapacitor such as internal resistance, capacitance, power density and energy density have been studied. All the results shown are accurate and comparable.
