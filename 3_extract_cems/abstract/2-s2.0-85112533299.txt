In this study, the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5), functionalized carbon nanotubes (f‐CNT), and polypyrrole (PPy) based composites films have been prepared through a facile synthesis method and their electrochemical performance were evaluated as freestanding negative electrodes of supercapacitor. A hydrous V2O5 gel prepared by treating V2O5 powder with H2O2 was mixed with f‐CNT to obtain V2O5/f‐CNT composite film. V2O5/f‐CNT composite was then coated with PPy through vapor phase polymerization method. The PPy deposited on the V2O5/f‐CNT prevented the dissolution of V2O5 and thus resulted in an improved the capacitance and cycle life stability for V2O5/f‐CNT/PPy composite electrode. V2O5/f‐CNT/PPy freestanding negative electrode exhibited a high areal capacitance value (1266 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2) and good cycling stability (83.0% capacitance retention after 10,000 charge‐discharge cycles). The superior performance of the V2O5/f‐CNT/PPy composite electrode can be attributed to the synergy between f‐CNT with high conductivity and V2O5 and PPy with high‐energy densities. Thus, V2O5/f‐CNT/PPy composite based electrode can effectively mitigate the drawbacks of the low specific capacitance of CNTs and the poor cycling life of V2O5.
