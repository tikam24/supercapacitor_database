Supercapacitor require electrode which has high surface area so that it able to store large amounts of charge. In this study, electrode was synthesized from carbon of Borassus Flabellifer L fiber which was carried out through activation and carbonization processes. Raw material was calcined at 4000 C for 4 hours followed by activation with NaOH 1 M. The carbonization was then conducted in Nitrogen gas flowing by temperature variations; 6500 C, 7500 C, and 8500 C with a constant heating rate of 200 C/min. Based on XRD data, it was shown that the material has formed Reduced graphene Oxide (RGO) which has main peaks at (2Î¸) 240 and 440 with higher purity in higher temperature. SEM results clarified more pores formation at higher temperature which is mesoporous. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) test was done to determine the capacitance value. By RGO forming with high porosity, it is suitable for supercapacitor electrode application and CV test has examined that heating of Borassus Flabelifer L fiber at 8500 C with 5 mV/s scan rate has the highest specific capacitance by 8.25 F/gram with Energy density is 4.125 watt/gram.
