Scalable production of portable micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) is of critical importance to meet the increasing demand of miniaturized electrochemical energy storage devices in the future, which still remains challenge. Herein, by taking inspiration from temperature-dependent viscosity feature of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), we present a facile and straightforward approach for large area production of flexible and wearable in-plane MSCs on PET film through a laser assisted thermal paste-tear strategy. The poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride)-mediated MXene/graphene framework as electrode exhibits high flexibility and mechanical stability, which delivers a capacitance of 241 mF/cm2 and energy density of 12.05 Î¼Wh/cm2, superior to most of MXene based micro-supercapacitors reported previously. Impressively, a nearly 200 integrated micro-devices array on PET film can be directly produced through a simple paste-tear operation within a short time. Moreover, a strip-shaped micro-devices array is easily achieved by simply cutting, which can power a variety of the commercial electronics, such as Christmas tree, blue LED light, electronic watch, and etc. This work provides an insight and efficient way to construct integrated miniature power source arrays in the future.
