At present, the specific capacity and cyclic stability of single cobalt manganese oxide are still insufficient to meet the application requirements. In this work, (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4/g-C3N4 electrode materials with different mass ratios were synthesized by adjusting the composite ratio of g-C3N4 and (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4. The results of the three-electrode test system show that the electrochemical performance of the composite sample is improved compared with that of pure (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4. When the mass ratio of g-C3N4 to (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 is 1:9, the electrochemical performance is the best. This is because layered g-C3N4 can provide more active sites for electrochemical reactions and increase the wettability of the material, thus improving the electrochemical reaction process. The power density of the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor CMO/GCN-2//AC can reach 16800 ​W ​kg−1 at an energy density of 14 ​Wh kg−1.
