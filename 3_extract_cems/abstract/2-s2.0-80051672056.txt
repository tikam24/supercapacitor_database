In this study, a simple and controllable two-step electrochemical process is described for the synthesis of graphene sheets (GS) film on a cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) sheet electrode. Namely, the main procedures involve the electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of graphene oxide (GO) film onto ITO electrode and the subsequent in situ electrochemical reduction (ECR) of GO to generate GS film. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement demonstrates that most of the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO film have been removed after ECR. By electrochemical measurements, the maximum specific capacitance of the prepared GS film electrode was calculated to be 156 F g-1, besides, the capacitance retention of the material remained 78% after 400 times of cycling, showing a promising prospect as supercapacitor materials.
