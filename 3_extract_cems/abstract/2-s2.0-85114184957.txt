Reasonable structural design and metal-doping play significant roles in the optimization of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Herein, in situ growth of Molybdenum-doped amorphous cobalt acid nickel nanoneedles on Ni foam (Mo-NiCo2O4/NF) has been successfully synthesized by a simple hydrothermal-annealing strategy. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical nanostructures and doping-optimized electronic structural configuration, the cross-link network structure of Mo-doped amorphous NiCo2O4 with large specific surface areas exhibit excellent supercapacitor performance and electrocatalytic activity. As expected, the optimized Mo-doped NiCo2O4 samples possess a specific capacitance of 3970 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and remarkable rate performance. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor obtains a maximum energy density of 35 Wh kg−1 (420 W kg−1) and keeps a capacitance retention of 107% after 5000 cycles. As an electrocatalyst, Mo-NiCo2O4/NF shows a rapid self-reconstruction process during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that produces rich oxygen vacancies and thus exhibits remarkable long-term stability. The nanocomposites exhibit small overpotential (280 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (43 mV dec-1). These results strongly demonstrate that both local amorphous phase and porous hierarchical structure design from Mo dopant provide superiorities for the synthesis of efficient and stable multifunctional electrode materials for energy storage and conversion.
