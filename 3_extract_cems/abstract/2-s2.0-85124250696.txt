A large amount of tobacco straw residues is produced around the world every year. These tobacco straw residues are usually incinerated or landfilled directly, which cause environmental pollution and waste of resources. Therefore, it is necessary to find a green way to recycle these tobacco straw residues. Converting tobacco straw residues into biomass carbon materials for supercapacitor electrode materials is an appropriate way. In this study, tobacco straw core carbon (TSC) was obtained from tobacco straw core waste, which was carbonized directly in the tube furnace without N2. The tobacco straw core carbon had a higher specific surface area because of the self-activation of the H2O and CO2 in the carbonization. A variety of analytical instruments were used to characterize the prepared porous carbon. Herein, this work can provide new ideas for energy materials, and solve the problem of the disposal of tobacco straw residues. What's more, it also can provide a sustainable development opportunity for tobacco farmers to alleviate poverty, dig potential and transform.
