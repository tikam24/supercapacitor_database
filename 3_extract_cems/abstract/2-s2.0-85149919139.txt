With the technological development of wearable devices, there are increasing demands for stretchable conductor that have stable electro-mechanical performance. In this study, a stretchable PDMS composite electrodes using ternary systems of fillers consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) / carbon nanotube (CNT) / silver nanowire (AgNW) is explored in a perspective of electro-mechanical response. PDMS matrix is mixed with binary fillers of CNT and PEDOT:PSS, which is followed by AgNW peeling-off process. The PDMS composite is mechanically reliable especially under tensile deformation, which showed a high rupture strain of ~102% and tensile strength of ~2.7 MPa. In addition, the PDMS composites shows the stable electro-mechanical response, where high electrical conductivity is sustained even under stretchable conditions, showing an electrical resistance value of ~11.7 Î©/cm under 40% of strain. As a demonstration, a supercapacitor using the PDMS composites is demonstrated that shows reliable electrochemical performance.
