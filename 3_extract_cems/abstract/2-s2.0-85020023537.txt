Nickel (II) oxide (NiO) nanosheet grown on N-doped carbon hollow spheres (NiO/NCHS) with hierarchical pore structure are obtained via facile chemical bath deposition followed by calcination at 350 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. Phase structure measurements indicate that the material is composed of NiO and N-doped carbon. The NiO/NCHS composite exhibits a unique flower-like morphology, where ultrathin NiO nanosheets are vertically grown on the surface of NCHS. This hierarchical nanostructure is beneficial for facilitating electron and electrolyte ion transport and accelerating the reversible redox reaction. The specific capacitance of the NiO/NCHS composite (585 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) is higher than that of pure NiO particle (453 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Meanwhile, the NiO/NCHS composite exhibits excellent rate performance and superior cycling stability over 6000 cycles. The enhanced supercapacitive performance of the NiO/NCHS nanocomposite indicates that it can be an appealing candidate electrode material for supercapacitors.
