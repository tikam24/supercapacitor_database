Fiber-like MnO2 was synthesized by liquid-phase reaction. By adding PAM modifier to the agar, a new type of supercapacitor membrane was prepared in order to improve the general performance of agar. When the amount of PAM is 800 ppm in the modified agar, the absorbency reaches 400.1%, the rate of rention reaches 335.1%, the discharge capacity is 23.4 F/cm3 in the supercapacitor. Other properties, such as cycle life, ESR and toughness are also improved.
