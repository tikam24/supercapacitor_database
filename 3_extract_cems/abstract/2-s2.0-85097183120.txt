Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been considered as the promising energy storage materials due to their unique crystalline structure. In this work, the VSe2 nanoparticles are vertically anchored on N-doping carbon (NC) hollow nanosphere (VSe2@NC) for aqueous energy application. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the VSe2@NC electrode exhibits outstanding electrochemical properties with high specific capacitance and excellent cycling life. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled by using VSe2@NC cathode and activated carbon anode. It shows high energy density of 85.41 Wh Kg−1 at a power density of 701.99 W Kg−1, and high-stable cycling performance of 90% retention after 2000 cycles. The superior properties are attributed to the particular hollow structure design, which accommodates both the high specific capacity of VSe2 and the desired electrical conductivity of N-doping carbon sphere template.
