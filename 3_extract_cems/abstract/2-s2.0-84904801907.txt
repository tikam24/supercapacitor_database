Porous Co3O4 nanoplates with high surface area are prepared via pulse cathodic deposition followed by heat-treatment. The mechanisms of hydroxide formation during electrodeposition, and oxide formation on heating are proposed and discussed. The obtained oxide product is characterized by XRD, IR, SEM and TEM techniques. The supercapacitive investigations by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests showed that the prepared nanoplates have high contribution in the redox reactions, where they can deliver 420.5 F g-I at the applied discharge current density of 5 A g-I, and an excellent long-term cycling stability (90% capacity retention after 1000 cycling at the current density of 5 A g-I). These findings suggest the potential application of the prepared nanoplates in the electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.
