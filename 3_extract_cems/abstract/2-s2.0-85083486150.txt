Exploring electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance is the key to the development of applications in energy storage and conversion. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) vanadium sulfide/carbon nanotubes/reduced graphene oxide (VS4/CNTs/rGO) composite is synthesized by a simple one–step hydrothermal method. VS4 short nanorods cover the both sides of the rGO sheets, and CNTs distribute at the edge of the composite to form a sandwich-like structure, which effectively prevents the accumulation of rGO. Due to the special 3D hierarchical structure, VS4/CNTs/rGO exhibits a large specific surface area and a rich pore structure, and the addition of CNTs and rGO also improves the electrochemical properties of VS4. At 1 A·g−1, VS4/CNTs/rGO exhibits a capacitance of 497 F·g−1 (1374.0 C·g−1) in the voltage range of −1.4 to 1.4 V, which is much higher than those binary materials including CNTs/rGO, VS4/CNTs and VS4/rGO. The VS4/CNTs/rGO symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device shows a remarkable electrochemical performance in a large potential window up to 2.2 V. The capacitance of VS4/CNTs/rGO SSC device can reach 1003.5 mF·cm−2 (2207.6 mC·cm−2) at 0.5 mA·cm−2, and it exhibits an energy density of 6.75 Wh·m−2 (72.07 Wh·kg−1) at a power density of 1.38 W·m−2 (14.69 W·kg−1). The high capacitance and energy density of the VS4/CNTs/rGO composite in the high voltage interval make it as the potential energy storage material.
