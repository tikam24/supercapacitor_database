A new nickel metal organic framework (MOF) based on 4-cyan-5-acidamide-bisimidazole were fabricated using hydrothermal method. The Co@Ni-MOFwasprepared by doping Ni-MOF with Co2+through post-synthetic modification method. The bimetallic Co0.4Ni1.6P was obtained through phosphorization of Co@Ni-MOF and showed high specific capacity 330F/g at 1 A/g and capacity retention was 96% over 5000 cycles. The supercapacitor device was prepared (Co0.4Ni1.6P//AC) and demonstrated specific energy of 30.9 Wh/kg at power of 806 W/kg. These results provided a new way to design bimetallic phosphide (MOF-based materials) for supercapacitor application.
