The low voltage ride through (LVRT) is the key technology to the development of grid connection for wind power, while the crowbar protection circuit is one of the most effective methods to improve the capacity of LVRT. And most importantly, the capacity of LVRT of wind power is influenced by not only the choice of resistance values and operation duration of crowbar, but also the stability of DC-link bus. A method is presented to judge clearance time of crowbar according to negative sequence current of asymmetrical fault and the ultracapacitor-based voltage regulation method for DC-link bus. The two methods can properly improve the fault ride-through capability of doubly-fed induction generator(DFIG). The test model of DFIG is established on the DIgSILENT platform and the simulation results is validated the proposed methods.
