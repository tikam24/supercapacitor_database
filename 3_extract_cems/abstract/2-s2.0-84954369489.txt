Supercapacitors with the ability to charge/discharge at fast rates of up to 300 V s-1 are developed with monolithic electrodes of metal nanowire (NW) arrays. The defects in the NW-array electrode considerably influence the device performance. Both the energy and power densities can be simultaneously improved by removing the defects using a homemade defect-free anodic aluminium oxide mold.
