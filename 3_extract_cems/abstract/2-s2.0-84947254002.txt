This work reveals, for the first time, the synergistic improvement of electrical conductivity and supercapacitive behaviour of PAni prepared via solvent-free solid state synthesis method using the combination of dopants at appropriate ratios. The improvements in electrical and capacitive behaviour are comparable or even better than PAni composites with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs). PAni has been prepared via solvent-free synthesis route by simultaneous dual doping with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and citric acid (CA) at the different ratios of [CA]:[CSA] as 1:3, 2:2 and 3:1. Dual doped PAni exhibits synergistic improvement in conductivity (up to 4.8 Ã— 10-2 Scm-1) and capacitive behaviour (up to 303.1 Fg-1) as well which have been compared with that of PAni/MWCNTs composites containing 2, 4 and 8 wt% MWCNTs. PAni doped with [CA]:[CSA] = 3:1 exhibits higher conductivity than the composite containing 4 wt% MWCNTs, and even higher specific capacitance than the composite with 8 wt% MWCNTs loading.
