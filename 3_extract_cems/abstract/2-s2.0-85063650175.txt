This investigation involves the synthesis of Cu doped α-MnO 2 nanoparticles through modified Chemical route. Obtained nanoparticles (diameter_˜5 nm to ˜18 nm) are found mostly stable at high temperature and its size can be modulated by Cu doping and post sintering temperature variation. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge performance indicate the excellent cycling stability along with a maximum capacitance of 229.5 F/g for current density of 1 A/g. Our fabricated device is also capable to power up 73 numbers of LED for 10 min after being charged for 10 s. From the photocatalytic experiment, degradation efficiency of 73.1% has been achieved by using even ultra diluted aqueous solution (0.0025 g/L) of active material to degrade the pollutant dye like Brilliant Green of 5 ppm concentration. Entire results suggest that the synthesized materials are the promising candidate to be used in photocatalysis and supercapacitive application purpose.
