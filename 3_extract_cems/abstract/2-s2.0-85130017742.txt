In this work, the densely distributed and core-shell structured Cu(OH)2@NiFe-LDH nanoarrays on copper foam (COH@NF-LDH/CF) are constructed by a facile and feasible in situ oxidation method combined with potentiostatic electrodeposition. This distinct core-shell structure as well as the synergetic effect between Cu(OH)2 and NiFe-LDH provides a tremendous advantage, such as sufficient chemical active spots, the pathway for electron and ion transfer, to enhance the electrochemical performance of COH@NF-LDH/CF. In particular, the area capacitance of synthesized COH@NF-LDH/CF can reach 4.139 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, which remarkably precede the single bare Cu(OH)2 (198 mF cm−2) or NiFe-LDH/CF (71 mF cm−2) electrode materials at the same current density. Furthermore, the sample COH@NF-LDH/CF is investigated and found to have excellent cycle stability (maintained 86.47 % after 5000 cycles). More importantly, the COH@NF-LDH/CF electrode also can be utilized directly as the positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as the negative electrode to assemble a facile asymmetric supercapacitor, which achieves a voltage window of up to 1.5 V and demonstrate up 65.56 Wh kg−1 brilliant energy density under 750 W kg−1. Therefore, their results indicate that COH@NF-LDH/CF core-shell structure nanocomposites may have a great prospect of application in energy storage.
