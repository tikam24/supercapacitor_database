Polyaniline doped with Ag+ (PANI/Ag+) films was synthesized by cyclic voltammetry as monomer. The structure and morphology of PANI and PANI/Ag+ films were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical behaviors of PANI doping different concentrations of Ag+ were investigated. The relationship between electrochemical properties of a series of transition metal ions doped PANI/Mn+ films and the ratio of electronic affinity and ionic radius (Ea/r) was also researched. The results suggest that the PANI/0.12 mol/L Ag+ films show a larger specific capacitance of 1000 F/g at a current density of 3 mA/cm2 and better cycle stability of 71% after 1000 cycles compared with that of PANI, of which the specific capacitance and cycle stability are 591 F/g and 46%, respectively. The results suggest that the ratio of electronic affinity and ionic radius (Ea/r) has direct effect on the performance of PANI/Mn+ film.
