A simple method is demonstrated to prepare functionalized spongy graphene/hydrogenated titanium dioxide (FG-HTiO2) nanocomposites as interconnected, porous 3-dimensional (3D) network crinkly sheets. Such a 3D network structure provides better contact at the electrode/electrolyte interface and facilitates the charge transfer kinetics. The fabricated FG-HTiO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The synthesized materials have been evaluated as supercapacitor materials in 0.5 M H2SO4 using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different potential scan rates, and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at different current densities. The FG-HTiO2 electrodes showed a maximum specific capacitance of 401 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and exhibited excellent cycling retention of 102% after 1000 cycles at 100 mV s-1. The energy density was 78.66 W h kg-1 with a power density of 466.9 W kg-1 at 0.8 A g-1. The improved supercapacitor performance could be attributed to the spongy graphene structure, adenine functionalization, and hydrogenated titanium dioxide.
