The paper presents a physical mathematical model of the movement of a prototype vehicle equipped with an electric drive system powered by two sources of hydrogen fuel cell and supercapacitors. The model is based on the analysis of the forces acting on the vehicle during motion, taking into account both resistance to motion and propulsion. The model also considers the flow of electrical energy from two sources: a hydrogen fuel cell and supercapacitors, taking into account energy buffering. The aim of the model was to develop a tool to analyse fuel consumption at different control strategies of energy flow in a vehicle. The paper also presents the results of model identification for the Hydros prototype vehicle developed at Lublin University of Technology for the Shell Eco Marathon competition. Model validation was performed for a selected run during the 2019 London competition. High agreement of the model with the results of the actual vehicle was obtained.
