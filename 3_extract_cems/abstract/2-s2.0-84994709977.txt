In this study, we have reported a facile growth of ultrathin mesoporous manganese cobalt sulfide (MCS) nanosheet arrays on Ni-foam substrate by a facile electrodeposition approach for high performance supercapacitor applications. We have developed the extremely energy-saving and rapid synthetic methodologies for the growth of highly active binary transition metal sulfide. The nanosheet architectures have been characterized using the techniques such as XRD, FESEM, TEM, XPS and Raman spectroscopy to understand the growth mechanism. The high porosity, high surface area and good electrical conductivity of the MCS nanosheets arrays make it a promising electrode material for supercapacitor. MCS nanosheets exhibit a high specific capacitance of 2421 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 along with excellent cycling stability, demonstrating its potential as an efficient electrode material for next generation supercapacitors.
