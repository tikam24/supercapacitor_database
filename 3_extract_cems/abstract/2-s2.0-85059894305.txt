This paper proposes a frequency-based method for sizing the hybrid energy storage system in order to smoothen wind power fluctuations. The main goal of the proposed method is to find the power and energy capacities of the hybrid energy storage system that minimizes the total cost per day of all the systems. The energy management strategy used in this paper is designed as a two-level energy distribution scheme: the first level is responsible for setting the output power of hybrid energy storage system, the second level manages the power flow between the battery and supercapacitor. The hybrid parallel particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the control parameters of energy management strategy. In addition, the proposed method uses the piecewise fitting function to describe the lifetime of battery. Obtained results show that the hybrid energy storage system with the proposed energy management strategy is able to offer the best performances for the wind power system in terms of cost and lifetime.
