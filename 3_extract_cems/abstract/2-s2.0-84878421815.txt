In the present paper, we have reported the in-situ chemical synthesis and characterizations of polyaniline with both HCl and Zirconium (IV). The polyaniline was synthesized by electrochemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer using ammonium peroxodisulphate as oxidizing agent. The doped PANI was charecterized by Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Visible), Fourier transfrom infrared (FT-IR), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Field emission scanning electon microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. FESEM and TEM study showed that the morphology of PANI changed after doping with Zirconium salt. All electrochemical charcterizations were peforrmed by conventional three electrode system where glassy carbon electrode, platinium wire and stanadard calomel electrode (SCE) were used as working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The cyclic voltammtry study(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS)study and charge discharge test (CCD) of Zr doped PANI showed better performance and higher specific capacitance of 323 F/g compareed to HCl doped PANI.
