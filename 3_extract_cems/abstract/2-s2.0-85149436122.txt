Designing transition metallic chalcogenides with rGO as a potential porous platform for growth are vital to upsurge the electrochemical energy storage capabilities of supercapacitors' electrodes. This work reports hydrothermally prepared agglomerated NiZrSe3 nanoparticles and a porous NiZrSe3/rGO, where the latter exhibits superior charge storage properties. In comparison to NiZrSe3 with specific capacitance (Cs) of 1415.7 F/g, the porous modulated material NiZrSe3/rGO delivers an exceptional Cs of 2750.8 F/g at current density of 2 A/g in the 3-electrode setup. Due to its the outstanding electrochemical performance, NiZrSe3/rGO is employed as a redox featured electrode material, and further integrated with activated carbon (Act–C) as a capacitive featured electrode material to construct a hybrid asymmetric supercapacitor with widened potential window and enhanced energy density. The constructed asymmetric supercapacitor unveils a specific capacitance of 140.77 F/g at current density of 1.2 A/g and rate capability of 53.6 % at 7 A/g while functioning stably under the potential range of 0–1.65 V. Moreover, it achieves extremely high energy density of 53.22 Wh/kg at power density of 990 W/kg with its long-life span in regard to cyclic stability of 80.31 % after 10,000 charging-discharging cycles. In general, this work illustrates the significance of NiZrSe3/rGO as a highly redox active cathode material in hybrid featured asymmetric supercapacitors for future renewable energy storage systems.
