In order to reduce the agglomeration of graphene and improve its supercapacitor performance, graphene oxide was functionalized with p-phenylenediamine, and PANI/PPD-RGO nanocomposites were prepared with aniline monomer by in-situ polymerization. The morphology, structure and supercapacitor performance of the composite were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS, Raman and electrochemical measurements. Results showed that after functionalization and in-situ polymerization, the layer spacing of PANI/PPD-RGO increased, and PANI was more evenly dispersed in the structure of the composites. PANI/PPD-RGO exhibited superior supercapacitor performance, benefiting from its unique chemical structures, intrinsic electrochemical properties and the synergistic effect of PPD-RGO and PANI. The specific capacitance of PANI/PPD-RGO composite was 635.2 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.
