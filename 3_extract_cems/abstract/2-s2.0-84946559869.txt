ZnO/Ag hierarchical nanostructure is fabricated by solution-based photoreduction process to demonstrate a photoelectrochimical (PEC) cell charging supercapacitor. The photoreduction process ensures rapid and simple route for employing of Ag nanoparticles onto the surface of ZnO nanorod with well-dispersed and clear crystallization structure. The fabricated ZnO/Ag hierarchical nanostructure showed improved optical and photoelectrochemical properties. Subsequently, the ZnO/Ag hierarchical nanostructure is used as photoanode for PEC cell with enhanced output photocurrent and stability. Furthermore, the PEC cell was connected to lab-made supercapacitors to turn on a light emitting diode. The photoreduction-processed ZnO/Ag hierarchical nanostructures provide a promising and simple production method for energy source in water splitting applications.
