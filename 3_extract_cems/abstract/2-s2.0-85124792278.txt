The advanced supercapacitor is of great significance for renewable energy storage. Achieving its high energy and high power densities remains a huge challenge. Herein, the contribution of ion-size asymmetry to the charging behavior of a supercapacitor is systematically studied using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). We track the time evolution of the ionic microstructure inside the porous electrode and its reservoir and reveal a kinetic charge inversion in the asymmetrical ion-size cases. Compared with the symmetrical ion-size case, we find that the ion-size asymmetry has a double-edged sword effect on the energy storage of a supercapacitor: it accelerates the charging process yet reduces the differential capacitance. Additionally, the energy density and power density can simultaneously increase in the asymmetrical cases, which provides important insights toward the experimental design of supercapacitors with high energy and high power densities.
