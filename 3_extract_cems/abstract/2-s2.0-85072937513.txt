In this work, highly N/P co-doped porous carbons (NPCs) have been synthesized by an ultra facile, self-activation green strategy, only used L-histidine and phytic acid as precursors. With the benefit of the self-activation strategy of the precursors, no extra traditional activators are needed for porous structures of NPCs. The as-prepared NPC-0.5-800 sample displays high contents and uniform heteroatom doping (N: 5.4%, P: 6.3%, O: 12.14%), high specific surface area (787 m2/g) and large pore volume (0.43 cm3/g). These characteristics enable the NPC-0.5-800 sample to exhibit a good specific capacitance of 290.2 F g−1 and a good cycling stability (95.0%) in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, the NPC-0.5-800-based symmetric supercapacitor in 1 M NaSO4 electrolyte shows a high energy density (20.8 Wh kg−1) at the current density of 1 A g−1. Importantly, it exhibits excellent cycling performance (97.1% of capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). The work not only provides the self-activation green method to fabricate NPCs with good electrochemical performances, but also designs materials of different N/P content and pore size distribution for further supercapacitor applications.
