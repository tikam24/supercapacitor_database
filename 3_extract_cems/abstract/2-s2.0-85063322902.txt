In this article, manganese tungstate (MnWO4) microflowers as electrode materials for high performance supercapacitor applications are prepared by a one-pot sonochemical synthesis. The crystalline structure and morphology of MnWO4 microflowers are characterized through X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the MnWO4 microflowers are investigated using cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MnWO4 microflowers as electrode materials possess a maximum specific capacitance of 324 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 in the potential window from 0 to +1 V and an excellent cycling stability of 93% after 8000 cycles at a current density of 3 mA cm−2. An asymmetric supercapacitor device is fabricated using the MnWO4 and iron oxide (Fe3O4)/multi-wall carbon nanotube as the positive and negative electrode materials, it can be cycled reversibly at a potential window at 1.8 V. The fabricated ASC device can deliver a high energy density of 34 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1 with cycling stability of 84% capacitance retained after 3000 cycles. The above results demonstrate that MnWO4 microflowers can be used as promising high capacity electrode materials in neutral electrolyte for high performance supercapacitors.
