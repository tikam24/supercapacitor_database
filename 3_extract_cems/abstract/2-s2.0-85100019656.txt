The intrinsic faradic reactivity is the uppermost factor determining the charge storage capability of battery material, the construction of p-n junction composing of different faradic components is a rational tactics to enhance the faradic activity. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide@cobalt nickle sulfide@nickle cobalt layered double hydroxide composite (rGO@CoNi2S4@NiCo LDH) with p-n junction structure is designed by deposition of n-type nickle cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo LDH) around p-type reduced graphene oxide@cobalt nickle sulfide (rGO@CoNi2S4), the charge redistribution across the p-n junction enables enhanced faradic activities of both components and further the overall charge storage capacity of the resultant rGO@CoNi2S4@NiCo LDH battery electrode. As expected, the rGO@CoNi2S4@NiCo LDH electrode can deliver high specific capacity (Cs, 1310 ± 26 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good cycleability (77% Cs maintaining ratio undergoes 5000 charge-discharge cycles). Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on the rGO@CoNi2S4@NiCo LDH p-n junction battery electrode exports high energy density (Ecell, 57.4 Wh kg−1 at 323 W kg−1) and good durability, showing the prospect of faradic p-n junction composite in battery typed energy storage.
