Hybrid ion capacitors (HICs) are emerging as promising energy-storage devices exhibiting the advantages of both batteries and supercapacitors. However, the difference in the electrodes' specific capacities and rate capabilities makes it extremely challenging to achieve optimum mass balancing for a full-cell HIC device. Here, we demonstrate a method to predict well-performing mass ratios of electrodes for a Na-HIC by analyzing the capacities of anodes and cathodes as a function of the actual current densities experienced by the individual electrodes. We employ a simple design tool, a "Ragone Plot Simulator", to predict specific energy and specific power on Ragone plots and study the performance trend of devices with varying electrode mass ratios. The validation of the proposed method is done based on the experimental data obtained from several hybrid ion capacitor devices reported in the literature, which closely matches with the simulated Ragone plots. Further, we exemplify the validity of our calculations by comparing the simulated Ragone plot with that of a Na-HIC fabricated using in-house-made carbon. This unique approach presents a simple, generalized, yet never reported, method, which could be employed as a design tool to guide the selection of optimized HIC devices for the intended applications.
