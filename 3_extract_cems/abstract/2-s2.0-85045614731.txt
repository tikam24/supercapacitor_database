A ternary nanocomposite with poly (3,4 ethylene dioxythiophene:poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)-MnO2 nanowires-graphene oxide (PMn-GO) was synthesized by using simple chemical route. The formation of the nanocomposite was analyzed by using X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Field-emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) revealed the formation of MnO2 nanowires and graphene oxide nanosheets. The highest specific capacitance (areal capacitance) of 841 Fg −1 (177 mFcm −2) at 10 mVs −1 and energy density of 0.593 kWhkg −1 at 0.5 mA were observed for PMn-GO, indicating a constructive synergistic effect of PEDOT:PSS, MnO2 nanowires and graphene oxide. The achieved promising electrochemical characteristics showed that this ternary nanocomposite is a good alternative as an electrode material for supercapacitor.
