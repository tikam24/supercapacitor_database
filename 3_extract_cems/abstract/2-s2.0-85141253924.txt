This paper provides a novel application for the Archimedes wave swing (AWS) device that converts the sea waves into electrical energy using a linear permanent magnet synchronous generator (LPMSG), which is connected to a rectifier that extracts the most significant energy from sea waves and reduces the stator losses. The generator's power combined with a photovoltaic (PV) system provides a total of 250 kW, sufficient for feeding a V3 Tesla Supercharging system, which is currently the latest and most advanced electric vehicle (EV) charging technology. The hybrid system is connected to a DC link, its voltage is stabilized using a supercapacitor energy storage system, and the output is provided to a buck converter that reduces the voltage for the Tesla Supercharger. The control system comprises seven proportional-integral (PI) controllers with four anti-wind back-calculation coefficients to improve transient stability. The PI gains are optimized using the Golden Jackal Optimization Algorithm (GJOA), and the system stability is evaluated by applying different disturbances like a sudden variation in the DC load, temporary DC short circuit, and connection of the EV in various modes such as a grid to vehicle and vehicle to grid modes. The results obtained by the GJOA are compared with the Particle Swarm Optimization and the hybrid Augmented Grey Wolf Optimizer and Cuckoo Search algorithms. Finally, hybrid renewable energy systems can efficiently be employed in EV supercharging stations as validated with the strategy proposed in this work.
