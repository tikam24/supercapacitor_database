Performing diverse application tests on synthesized metal oxides is critical for identifying suitable application areas based on the material performances. In the present study, Ni-oxide@TiO2 core-shell materials were synthesized and applied to photocatalytic mixed dye (methyl orange + rhodamine + methylene blue) degradation under ultraviolet (UV) and visible lights, CO oxidation, and supercapacitors. Their physicochemical properties were examined by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. It was shown that their performances were highly dependent on the morphology, thermal treatment procedure, and TiO2 overlayer coating.
