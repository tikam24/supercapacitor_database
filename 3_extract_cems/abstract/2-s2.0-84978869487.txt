Well-aligned CoWO4 nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam substrates have been fabricated by using a facile hydrothermal process. The interconnected CoWO4 nanosheets with abundant open spaces are uniformly deposited on the skeleton of the nickel foam. When investigated as binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors, the CoWO4 nanosheet arrays exhibit a specific capacitance of 1127.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and remarkable cycle performance. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled by using CoWO4 nanosheets and activated carbon as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The ASC device delivers a maximum energy density of 48 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 365 W kg−1. The results demonstrate that CoWO4 nanosheet arrays could be potential electrode materials for energy-storage systems.
