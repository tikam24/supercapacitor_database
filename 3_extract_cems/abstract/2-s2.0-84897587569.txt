Here we illustrate a facile and economical strategy for the bulk production of aqueous graphene dispersions via a simple ball milling process assisted with non-ionic industrial surfactant. Moreover, this surfactant is readily removed using ethanol to acquire high-quality graphene flakes. The fabricated graphene electrode shows excellent high-rate charge-discharge performance suitable for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
