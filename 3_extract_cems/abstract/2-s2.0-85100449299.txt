In order to overcome the current energy and environment crisis caused by fossil fuels depletion and greenhouse gas emission, it is indispensable to introduce new, eco-friendly, high-performance materials into energy conversion and storage applications. 2D transition metal oxides (TMOs) are regarded as the promising candidates due to their excellent electrochemical properties. However, their innate poor electronic conductivity greatly restricts their applications in energy conversion and storage. This review discusses and summarizes the developed strategies to overcome the limitation through surface modification including defect engineering, heteroatom incorporation and interlayer doping, as well as hybridization with conductive materials. In addition, a detailed summary of their synthesis and applications in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and electrocatalysis is included. Finally, future prospective such as opportunities and challenges is discussed for the successful implementation of 2D TMOs in the field of energy applications.
