In this work, pure graphene hydrogel (GH) and graphene/Ag nanoparticle (GH-AgNP) composite hydrogels with various wt% of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 30, and 50% Ag were produced. Samples were characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, and SEM analysis. Supercapacitor electrodes based on pure GH and GH-AgNP composite hydrogel were fabricated without the use of any additives and adhesives, and their electrochemical behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). High specific capacitances of 252 F/g and 180 at scan speeds of 10 and 200 mV/s for pure hydrogel and specific capacitances of 260 to 143 F/g for composite hydrogels were observed, respectively. GCD analyses implied that GH-AgNP composites possessed lower internal resistance (IR), therefore better rate capabilities. Consequently, it seems that the optimization of GH-AgNP composite hydrogels is an effective way of reducing the supercapacitorâ€™s internal resistance and thereby increasing the power and improving supercapacitor performance. It was observed that the addition of Ag nanoparticles to graphene hydrogels, even with low wt%, significantly reduces the charge transfer resistance. In a GH-AgNP sample with an Ag/GO ratio of 1%, the charge transfer resistance value was reduced by 77%, while the specific capacitance was reduced by just 8%.
