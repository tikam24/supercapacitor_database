Capacitor is commonly found in storage related applications although it has low storage capacity. The high capacity supercapacitor is then invented. This high capacity improves the charging and discharge rate. Hence instead of only relying on the LeadAcid battery (LAB), supercapacitor is another way of energy storage. It aims to reduce the dependent of the LAB and prolong the battery’s life cycle. The investigation of supercapacitor in the energy storage system (ESS) that modeled through MATLAB/Simulink software was done in this project. The energy management system distributes energy according to the threshold of the State of Charge (SOC) of the battery pack and supercapacitor. Photovoltaic energy harvester and piezoelectric energy harvester are the charging medium for supercapacitor. The boost converter and buck-boost converter are modeled in MATLAB Simulink in order to obtain the desired output. Effective power management via optimal discharge selection between the battery pack and supercapacitor bank is the key to maximize the LAB’s lifetime. Results showed that the threshold value of SOC for supercapacitor to take over the task should not be less than 75%.
