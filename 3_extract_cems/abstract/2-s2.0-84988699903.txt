The interwoven WS 2 nanoplates supported on carbon fiber cloth (WS 2 /CFC) have been successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal process. XRD and XPS confirm the formation of WS 2 /CFC. SEM images show the good dispersion of WS 2 nanoplates with interwoven structures on the surface of CFC. Thanks to the 3D framework of CFC, WS 2 nanoplates realize overall excellent-dispersion interwoven on the surface of CFC compared with pristine bulk WS 2 with severe aggregation. Moreover, CFC not only serves as excellent conductive substrate to accelerate electron transport rate, but also contributes to the close combination between WS 2 and CFC for long-term stability. The electrochemical measurements show that WS 2 /CFC exhibit a high specific capacitance of 399 F g −1 at 1.0 A g −1 , demonstrating the obviously enhanced capability compared with pristine bulk WS 2 . Furthermore, WS 2 /CFC realizes ultra-stable cycling stability with 99% of retention of capacitance after 500 charge-discharge cycles. It may provide novel access of designing carbon-based transition metal disulfides composites for excellent super capacitive properties.
