Since energy consumption and pollution levels are increasing worldwide, the traditional fossil fuel-based generation methods are open to debate. A considerable number of countries are promoting the use of renewable resources in order to set a new energetic scenario. Wind power generation needs to improve some specific aspects that hinder its development. Several devices have been designed and are currently in use to solve the problem of energy volatilitysince they are able to store energy in different forms for a given period of time. All these devices have different characteristics; therefore, they behave dissimilarly under certain operating conditions. Lead-acid batteries are being used either for energy or power applications. However, there exist other devices that may provide better performance. These devices are here described and compared, coming to the conclusion that some of them will substitute current technology in the near future if they are able to improve several indicated aspects.
