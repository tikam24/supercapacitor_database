Inspired by natural vein-textured leaves, a 2D nanochanneled graphene film with high packing density and efficient ion transport pathways is proposed to facilitate high rate capabilities while maintaining high energy density. The 2D nanochannels serve as pathways for efficient ion diffusion parallel to the graphene planes in all-solid-state micro-supercapacitors with interdigitated electrode geometry.
