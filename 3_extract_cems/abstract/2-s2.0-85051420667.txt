Amorphous Ni (OH)2 nanobox-like materials were synthesized using Cu2O as template. Ni (OH)2/reduced graphene oxide (Ni (OH)2/rGO) composites were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The results obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy indicated that the Ni (OH)2 nanobox structure broke into small pieces of 50–100 nm under high temperature and high pressure during the hydrothermal process, and successfully covered the entire graphene surface. Electrochemical studies showed that a specific capacitance of 626.84 F g−1 was obtained at a current density of 1 A g−1. When the current density increased from 1 to 5 A g−1, the capacitance retention rate reached 50%. After 2000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles, the capacitance of Ni (OH)2/rGO composite decreased 30% of initial capacitance compared to 55% for pure Ni (OH)2. The rational design, interesting structure, and ideal electrochemical performance of this graphene-based composite indicate its potential application in high-energy storage systems.
