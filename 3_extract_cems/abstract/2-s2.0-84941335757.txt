β-Ni(OH)2 and its composite with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were synthesized by hydrothermal process. Their electrochemical properties such as specific capacitance, energy density, power density, coulombic efficiency and charge-discharge cycles were investigated by Cyclic voltammetry (CV), Chronopotentiometry (CP) and Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The materials were analyzed for their textural and structural properties by different analytical techniques such as Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The diffraction peaks obtained from PXRD studies and the TEM images of the materials inferred the formation of hexagonal nanostructured β- Ni(OH)2 in both pure and composite materials. The composite material exhibited better electrochemical supercapacitance performance than pure β-Ni(OH)2. Their specific capacitance values were found to be 1882 F g-1 and 819 F g-1 respectively at a scan rate of 2 mVs-1. The presence of MWCNTs enhanced the specific capacitance value of β-Ni(OH)2 nearly by 57% at 2 mVs-1. Chronopotentiometric studies conducted at a current density of 5 A/g indicated that the composite material was stable up to 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Another interesting observation made is that the composite material exhibited 100% coulombic efficiency where as it was only 84% for β-Ni(OH)2 at 5000th cycle. The composite material gave an energy density of 40 Wh/kg which was nearly 4 times that of β-Ni(OH)2.
