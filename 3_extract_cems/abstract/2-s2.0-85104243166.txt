Here, a flexible electrode based on three-dimensional melamine foam-derived macroporous carbon (3D-FC) loading graphene oxide (GO), Schiff base polymer (SPB) foam-derived carbon (CNDS), and polyaniline (PANI) arrays are employed for supercapacitors. The commercial melamine foam is prepared into ultralight and flexible 3D-FC by high-temperature carbonization, and then the GO is uniformly distributed into 3D-FC to form 3D-FC/GO, which avoid the aggregation of GO. The SPB foam is grown on 3D-FC/GO and subsequently is transformed into CNDS by carbonization for loading PANI. The uniformly distributed GO connected the fibers of 3D-FC to improve the electrical conductivity. The macropores of 3D-FC/GO/CNDS/PANI enhance the mass transfer. The PANI is vertically arrayed on 3D-FC/GO/CNDS to form flexible 3D-FC/GO/CNDS/PANI. The as-prepared 3D-FC/GO/CNDS/PANI as electrode materials exhibits a rapid electron transport and good performance with a specific capacitance of 2814.5 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1.
