The synthesis of initial ZnO nanorods as template and subsequent formation of α-MnO2 nanorods are presented in this paper for the first time. A possible formation mechanism of the nanorods is also proposed. The diameters of the as-synthesized α-MnO2 nanorods are less than 20 nm and the average lengths are about 100 nm. When investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatical charge-discharge (CD) tests, the resulting α-MnO2 nanorods exhibit good electrochemical performances in terms of its maximum specific capacitance of 167 F g- 1 at 0.4 A g-1 and good cycling stabilities during the 1000 cycles, suggesting that it is a promising candidate as supercapacitor materials. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
