This paper proposes a new three-phase flyback current-fed push-pull bidirectional dc-dc converter, which in both senses operation of the proposed converter is analyzed and explained even as the DC transfer function in continuous, discontinuous and critical conduction mode has been presented. The proposed converter is suitable for the dc microgrids bus, such as those having fuel cells, PV array and wind turbine as the DC source power supply. Where bidirectional power flow related with battery or supercapacitor bank charge and discharge is necessary.
