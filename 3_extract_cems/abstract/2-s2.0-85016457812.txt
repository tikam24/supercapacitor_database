The sol-gel method and thermal reduction method were effectively combined to prepare the SnO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid materials. And an all-solid-state supercapacitor was further fabricated using above materials. The supercapacitor exhibited good electrochemical performance and stability, which showed the SnO2/rGO hybrid materials may have a wide range of potential applications in electrochemical capacitors. The experimental results indicated that the sol-gel/thermal reduction method was a facile and practical approach, which may offer positive guide and may be applicable for design of the various metal-oxide (MOx)/rGO hybrid materials for capacitor or cell.
