Utilization of the waste toner in wasted print cartridge was beneficial to the environmental protection and resource recycling. Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> has been obtained from the waste toner via magnetic separation and heat-treatment in present study. XRD measurement revealed the recuperated sample has ferriferrous oxide structure without other crystalline impurity. The electrochemical performances of recuperated Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, as the electrode active material for supercapacitor, was conducted by cyclic. voltammetry and charge-discharge process. The results showed that the specific capacitance of Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, achieved 76.5 F/g under 50 mA/g current density, which possessed typical capacitive behaviors and good cycling stabilities. Based on the preferable electrochemical performances, Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, recovered from waste toner may be a potential alternative as electrode material for supercapacitor.
