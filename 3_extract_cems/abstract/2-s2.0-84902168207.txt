Nanostructured porous MnO2 film on Ni foam substrate was fabricated via a CV electrodeposited route for the first time. The obtained MnO2 film had a 3D network structure and a high mass loading from 6 to 18 mg cm-2. This material achieved a maximum specific capacitance of 2790 mF cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2 and 864 mF cm-2 at 20 mA cm-2, and the specific capacitance can be retained above 90% after 1000 cycles at 5 mA cm-2. The fabricated AC//MnO2 asymmetric supercapacitor can reach a specific capacitance of 67 F g-1 and an energy density of 37.22 Wh Kg -1 with its capacitance retention of 80% after 1000 cycles at 2.5 mA cm-2.
