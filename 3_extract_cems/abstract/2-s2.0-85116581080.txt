The potential window of an aqueous supercapacitor cathode is usually less than 1.3 V, which hinders the enhancement of the energy density and can be conquered by activating the multiple redox reactions of the cathode. Herein, tetragonal phase Na0.91MnO2 nanosheets/nanowires arrays with high cation content are produced in situ on an electrochemically treated carbon cloth by an electrochemical oxidation method. It is observed that the Na0.91MnO2 nanosheet/nanowire array electrode can operate stably within the potential window of −0.6 V to 1.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) with an ultrahigh capacity of 856 C g−1 and an outstanding stability and excellent rate ability. With a carbon fiber fabric with a large surface area as the anode, the Na0.91MnO2 cathode in the two-electrode cell can still operate stably within the voltage range from 0 to 2.07 V (still within the range of the three redox peak couples, demonstrating a high energy density of 138 Wh kg−1, an excellent power density of 33 kW kg−1 as well as 100 % retention even after 120 000 cycles. This work may pave the way for the development of an aqueous supercapacitor cathode with a wider potential window.
