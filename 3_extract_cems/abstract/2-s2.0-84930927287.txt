Abstract Ordered mesoporous carbons anchored with MnO nanoparticles (Cs-Mn) for supercapacitor have been produced by a simple double-template strategy. Pluronic F127 and polyurethane (PU) foam are used as the soft and hard template, respectively, and phenolic resol as a carbon source, and the MnO nanoparticles were in-situ anchored by directly dissolved solid Mn(CH3COO)2Ã—2H2O in the phenolic resol solution through evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) of the mesostructure on the struts of the PU foam scaffold, followed by carbonization. The microstructure, morphology and electrochemical performance of Cs-Mn were investigated by small angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectropy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption and electrochemical measurements. Results show that Cs-Mn have a hexagonally ordered mesostructure. The pore size of Cs-Mn centered at ca. 2.0-4.2 nm, high specific surface area (222 m2/g) and great pore volume (up to 0.14 cm3/g). The electrochemical measurements show that the Cs-Mn as an electrical double-layer capacitor electrode presents high specific capacitance of 100 F/g at a current density of 0.125 A/g and excellent rate capability using 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution.
