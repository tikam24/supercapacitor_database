The nanoflower-sphere-like Ni0.85Se has been prepared by one-pot mixing solvothermal method, exhibiting higher specific capacitance of 1010 F g−1 and rate feature than Ni0.85Se-1 and Ni0.85Se-3, respectively. Furthermore, a novel Ni0.85Se-2//AC ASC was assembled which expands output voltage can achieve to 1.7 V and offers an energy density of 18.1 W h kg−1 at the power density of 844.5 W kg−1, cycling life of 82.22% capacitance retaintion after 3000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Therefore, the nanoflower-sphere-like Ni0.85Se can become a potential electrode material for energy storage devices.
