The low energy densities of supercapacitors limit their utilization as energy storage and energy conversion devices. To overcome this limitation, here we present a ternary nanocomposite of reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2/polyaniline (PANI), with methane sulfonic acid as dopant, having weight percentages of 14%:14%:72% (G14NP), respectively, as an electrode material for supercapacitor. With 1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as the electrolyte, the supercapacitor yields a high energy density of 120.48 W h kg−1, comparable with those of Li-ion batteries. The G14NP also exhibits good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 602.40 F g−1 and a power density of 2584.83 W kg−1, at a current density of 1 A g−1. The G14NP also exhibits a promising stability of its electrochemical performances even after 16,500 cycles at a potential scan of 400 mV s−1. Remarkably, the composite performs exceptionally well at a potential window available in an aqueous electrolyte. The sustainability to high current loading while charging and its power backup application is satisfactorily demonstrated, by charging with a commercial 9 V battery.
