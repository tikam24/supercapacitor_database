Solid leather wastes (SLW) based porous carbons were used as the electrode material for supercapacitors in acid (H2SO4) medium. Electrochemical investigations indicate that samples activated at 900 Â°C shows a maximum capacitance of 1833 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, SLW porous carbon electrodes show excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles at a constant current density of 20 A/g. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies propose porous carbons developed from SLW could be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitors even in strong acid electrolyte medium.
