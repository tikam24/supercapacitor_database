Variations of marine current speed may lead to strong fluctuations in the power extracted by a marine current turbine (MCT). During a short-time period, swell effect is the main cause for the current speed variations. The conventional tip speed ratio maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm will require the MCT to accelerate or to decelerate frequently under swell effect, which can cause severe fluctuations in the generator power. This paper focuses on power smoothing control of the grid-connected MCT system. In the first step, a modified MPPT algorithm with filter strategy is proposed in generator-side control to mitigate the fluctuation of generator power. In the second step, a supercapacitor (SC) energy storage system (ESS) is added to compensate the residual power fluctuations. Â© 2010-2012 IEEE.
