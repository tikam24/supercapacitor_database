There is an ongoing effort to improve the energy storage capacity of graphene-based supercapacitors. These supercapacitors store energy in the electric field between the charge carriers in the graphene and the counter ions in a liquid electrolyte. To characterize this double layer, we use the Hall effect to determine the charge carrier density in graphene as a function of voltage. We disentangle the separate roles of double-layer capacitance (the electrostatic contribution) and quantum capacitance and compare the performance of different electrolytes. Our results highlight the advantages of Hall effect measurements for probing the electrostatics of graphene-electrolyte interfaces.
