A one-pot and energy-saving method was developed to manufacture defective manganese oxide materials. The insertion of zinc ions improves manganese oxide conductivity results in a significant increase in number of defects in the lattice to provide abundant active sites for energy storage. The synthesized zinc doped manganese oxide achieved a maximum capacity of 392 F g−1 in the three-electrode system, the corresponding supercapacitor reached an outstanding energy density of 55.28 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 555.6 W kg−1, while maintaining 95.2% of the initial capacity after 10,000 cycles. This research sheds new insights to the preparation of defective materials by a simple one-step method for energy storage applications.
