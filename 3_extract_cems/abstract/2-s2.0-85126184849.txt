In the present study, Bi0.85Mg0.15PO4 nanostructures were synthesized at 600Â° C via simple microwave technique. Structural and morphological properties of the synthesized sample were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD analysis revealed the monoclinic phase formation of Bi0.85Mg0.15PO4 nanostructures without any impurity peak and the average crystallite size through Scherrer's formula is found to be 37 nm. SEM study exhibits that synthesized material is in nano size scale. The electrochemical properties of the as prepared sample were studied by galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement in three electrode system with 2M KOH solution as an electrolyte. Specific capacitance is calculated from cyclic voltammetry i.e. 368 Fg-1 at 2 mVs-1 and its value found to be decreasing by increasing scan rate from 2 mVs-1 to 50 mVs-1. The investigation reveals that this synthesized electrode material can be utilized for supercapacitor applications, providing sustainable and economic benefits.
