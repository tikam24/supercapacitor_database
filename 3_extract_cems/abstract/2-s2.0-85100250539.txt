In this context, we synthesize pristine and transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) (TM)-doped uniform, 3D-rhombohedral manganese carbonate (MnCO3) microcrystals using a simple hydrothermal method. The substitution of different TMs notably induces structural defects in the 3D-rhombohedral microcrystals as evidenced by X-ray diffraction data and micro-Raman spectra. From the detailed investigation, the optimum Fe-MnCO3 sample exhibits a higher specific capacity of 55.83 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 with a remarkable rate capability of 64.39%. This is attributed to uniform morphology, abundant electroactive sites, homogeneous particle size, a higher amount of structural defects, and lower electronic/ionic resistance. Further, aqueous and solid-state hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) were fabricated using 3D-rhombohedral Fe-MnCO3 as a positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode in aqueous KOH and PVA/KOH polymer gel electrolytes, respectively. The aqueous HSC (AHSC) and solid-state HSC (SHSC) devices deliver maximum energy densities of 22.38 and 19.74 Wh kg-1 at power densities of 374 and 380 W kg-1 along with good initial capacitance retentions of 88.85% and 82.63% after 10,000 cycles, respectively. The practical applicability of fabricated devices is proved by successfully powering a pair of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of different colors (red, green, and blue) using two SHSCs connected in series.
