If were not by their low electrochemical stability, aqueous electrolytes would be the preferred alternative to be used in electrochemical energy storage devices. Their abundance and nontoxicity are key factors for such application, especially in large scale. The development of highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes, so-called water-in-salt electrolytes, has expanded the electrochemical window of aqueous electrolyte up to 3.0 V (whereas salt-in-water electrolytes normally shows up to 1.6 V), showing that water can be an alternative after all. Many devices, ranging from metal-ion batteries to electrochemical capacitors, have been reported recently, making use of such wider electrochemical stability and enhancing devices energy density. Different salts have also been proposed not only to gain in costs but also to improve physicochemical properties.
