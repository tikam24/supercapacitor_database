An energy storage system based on Supercapacitor (SC) for metro network regenerative braking energy is investigated. The control strategy according to the various power requirement in metro line and different characteristics of these storage devices is proposed to manage the energy and optimize the power supply system performance. In order to estimate the required ESS (energy storage system), line 5 of Beijing metro network is modeled through a novel approach, in different Running interval conditions based on the real data obtained from Beijing metro office. A useful method is proposed to predict the instantaneous regenerative energy which is delivered to each substation before applying ESS and based on that the ESS configuration for each substation is determined. A simplified mathematical model of the whole metro network has been developed and the main features of the control strategy have been developed. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of suggested control and the energy saving obtained for metro trains. Â© 2014 ISSN 1881-803X.
