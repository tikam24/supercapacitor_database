Two kinds of activated carbon were obtained from phenolic resin and coal tar pitch carbon foams by vapor activation, with specific surface area of 961 and 953m2/g respectively. Their morphology and pore structure were characterized with scanning microscope and BET nitrogen adsorption instrument, while the charge discharge performance was investigated by constant current and cyclic voltammetry methods. The results showed that, the phenolic sample owns more abundant and larger micropores under 1. 0nm than the pitch's. The larger micropore size benefited its charge discharge performance especially at higher current. Working at 1.0mA, the two samples showed similar capacitance, which was 106.28 and 105.1F/g for the phenolic and the pitch's respectively. However, when working at 50mA, they performed much differently, the capacitance for the phenolic and the pitch's decreased to 41.94 and 17.23F/g respectively, showing that the micropores under 1.0nm obviously effected on the performance of the anode material. Cyclic voltammetry test showed the electrochemical window for phenolic carbon was wider than that of pitch carbon at 100mV/min.
