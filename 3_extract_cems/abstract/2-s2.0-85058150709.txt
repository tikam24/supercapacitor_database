Cobalt-doped graphene-coupled hypercrosslinked polymers (Co-GHCP) have been successfully prepared on a large scale, using an efficient RAFT (Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization) emulsion polymerization and nucleophilic substitution reaction with Co (II) porphyrin. The Co-GHCP could be transformed into cobalt-doped porous carbon nanosheets (Co-GPC) through direct pyrolysis treatment. Such a Co-GPC possesses a typical 2D morphology with a high specific surface area of 257.8 m2 g-1. These intriguing properties of transition metal-doping, high conductivity, and porous structure endow the Co-GPC with great potential applications in energy storage and conversion. Utilized as an electrode material in a supercapacitor, the Co-GPC exhibited a high electrochemical capacitance of 455 F g-1 at a specific current of 0.5 A g-1. After 2000 charge/discharge cycles, at a current density of 1 A g-1, the specific capacitance increased by almost 6.45%, indicating the excellent capacitance and durability of Co-GPC. These results demonstrated that incorporation of metal porphyrin into the framework of a hypercrosslinked polymer is a facile strategy to prepare transition metal-doped porous carbon for energy storage applications.
