High-capacitance electrode materials are extremely useful in high-performance supercapacitors. Here, an N and O codoped mesoporous carbon (MPC) material is reported. The MPC-3 exhibited a substantial capacitance of 306.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. NiCo2S4 grown in situ on the MPC-3 formed the composite material (NCS/MPC). This composite material, 0.4-NCS/MPC-3, showed a specific capacitance of 551.8C g−1 at 1 A g−1; cyclic capacity was exceptional 95.9%, after 10,000 cycles. A 0.4-NCS/MPC-3//MPC-3 HSC device exhibited an energy density of 57.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 750 W kg−1. The device displayed a stable capacity of 90.2% after 10,000 cycles. This process is inexpensive and simple, highlighting value in the field of energy storage.
