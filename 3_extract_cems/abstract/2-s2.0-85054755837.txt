Cobalt-based composites are generally investigated as cathode for supercapacitor due to its excellent electrochemical properties. Here, we explore its application as anode with the potential window of −0.3–0 V in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Interconnected Co3O4/CoO/Co(OH)2 nanosheets array is one-step electrodeposited on the surface of active carbon cloth, but showing low capacitance. Surprisingly, after in-situ compositing with MnO2 (ratio of Mn4+ is ∼23%), the hybrid MnO2/cobalt composites nanosheets array anode delivers ∼705 F g−1 at 0.68 A g−1, much higher than that of ∼161 F g−1 for pristine Co3O4/CoO/Co(OH)2. Besides, using NiCo2S4 nanosheet array@ nickel foam as cathode, the asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits high specific capacitance of 198 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. This work manifests a promising strategy to explore novel anode material and improve their properties, which holds great promise in energy storage/conversion devices.
