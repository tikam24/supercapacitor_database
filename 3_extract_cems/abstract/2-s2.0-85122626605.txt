The 3D porous structured NiS/CuS nanocomposite was prepared by a wet chemical method for supercapacitors and spintronic device applications. NiS/CuS nanocomposite exhibited high specific capacitances than NiS nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction reveals that the synthesized NiS and NiS/CuS have an orthorhombic and hexagonal structure with no impurities. Scanning Electron Microscope demonstrated that the CuS substitution provokes the 3D porous structure into the porous structured spherical nanoparticles. The obtained optical indirect bandgap is 1.97 and 2.37 eV for NiS and NiS/CuS correspondingly. An electrochemical impedance spectrum of 3D porous NiS/CuS has a higher charge transfer rate. NiS nanoparticles exhibit ferromagnetism while NiS/CuS nanocomposite showed the paramagnetic type in the existence of a magnetic field. Compared with pure NiS, NiS/CuS nanocomposite exhibits higher supercapacitor performance and paramagnetic properties.
