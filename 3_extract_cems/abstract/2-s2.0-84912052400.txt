The low voltage ride through (LVRT) of dual tri-level converter based direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous wind power generation set with rated capacity of 2MW is taken as the research object. The converter at the generator side is controlled by dual closed-loop based maximum peak torque to current ratio, and for the converter at the grid side a novel control strategy, in which the unity power factor control is applied during steady state and the coordinated control of reactive power prioritized with active power restricted is applied during grid transient fault, is put forward. The analysis on equivalent models of vanadium redox battery (VRB) and super capacitor are performed, and taking dual-directional DC/DC conversion circuit as the interface for the hybrid energy storage system and the DC bus of wind power generation unit the symmetrical and unsymmetrical deep voltage sags are quantitatively simulated, and the contrastive simulation of the implementation of LVRT ability of generation units by adopting the DC bus unloading circuit, the improved control strategies and the hybrid energy storage system respectively is carried out. Results of this research show that using above-mentioned three schemes the LVRT of direct-driven permanent magnet synchronous wind power generation units can be implemented when serious grid voltage sag occurs, and using the hybrid energy storage pattern composed of VRB and super capacitor the LVRT of generation sets can be enhanced better and the active power recovery process of power grid can be accelerated.
