Achieving both high energy and power densities from energy storage devices is a core strategy to meet the increasing demands of high performance portable electronics and electric transportation systems. Li-ion capacitor is a promising hybrid technology that strategically exploits high energy density from a Li-ion battery electrode and high power density from a supercapacitor electrode. However, the performance and safety of hybrid devices are still major concerns due to the use of graphite anodes which form passivation layers with organic electrolytes at lower potentials. Here, we explore 2D nanosheets as both anode and cathode electrodes to build a high power system without compromising energy density. Owing to the high electrical conductivity and multivalent redox activity at higher potentials, the Li-ion intercalation electrode is capable of maintaining large energy density at higher current rates with less safety risk than conventional systems. Hybrid devices consisting of all in all 2D electrodes deliver energy density as high as 121 Wh g-1 (at 240 W kg-1) and retains 29 Wh g-1 at high power density of 3600 W kg-1.
