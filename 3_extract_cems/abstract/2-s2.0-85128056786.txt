Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is used to suppress intermittent loads, which requires that HESS can suppress the change of power shortage in the distribution network with the continuous fluctuation of intermittent load power. Due to the randomness of power fluctuation of intermittent load, it is necessary to design the charging and discharging strategy of energy storage components in HESS. In this paper, considering the frequency characteristics of the intermittent load, a State of Charge (SOC) feedback energy control strategy considering the frequency model of intermittent load is proposed. Based on the model predictive control theory, aiming at the SOC state of two kinds of energy storage components in HESS: battery and supercapacitor, the predictive model is established and predicted. The predictive value and reference trajectory are introduced into the corresponding optimization function determined by the control strategy to control the power reference signal to realize the SOC feedback control. At the same time, it can realize the optimal distribution of HESS energy and increase the service life of the system.
