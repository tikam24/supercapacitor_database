Micro/nano-structured Mn3O4 with an open three-dimensional flower-like morphology were fabricated by a facile solvothermal approach using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant and CH3CH2OH as a solvent. The Mn3O4 microspheres were self-assembled by one-dimensional nanowires; in addition, a dandelion-structure formation mechanism of the Mn3O4 microspheres is discussed. The Mn3O4 microspheres used as a supercapacitor electrode in 1 mol L-1 Na2SO4 electrolyte have a specific capacitance value of 286 F g-1 at a low current density of 0.5 A g-1, and can still retain 80% (230 F g-1) and 73% specific capacitance (210 F g-1) when the current densities are increased ten-fold (5 A g-1) and twenty-fold (10 A g-1), respectively. In addition, the capacitance retention is 90% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1. In comparison with Mn3O4 synthesized in N,N-dimethylformamide solvent at 0.5 A g-1 and 5 A g-1, the specific capacitance obtained increased by 18.7% and 17.4%, respectively.
