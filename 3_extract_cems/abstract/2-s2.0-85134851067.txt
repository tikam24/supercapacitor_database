Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) materials have aroused tremendous interest in solar light to energy conversion, sustainable and renewable products generation, and energy storage fields owing to their convenient mass transfer channels, high surface area, enhanced interaction between matter and light, plentiful reactive sites as well as tunable composition. In this review, the state-of-the-art 3DOM materials as well as their preparation methods and the relevant applications including photo/electrocatalytic sustainable energy conversion, solar cells, Li ion batteries and supercapacitor are thoroughly outlined. Meanwhile, the unique merits and mechanisms for 3DOM materials in various applications are revealed and discussed in depth. Moreover, the strategies for designing 3DOM materials and the enhanced performance for applications are correlated, which can be significantly valuable to help readers to promptly acquire the comprehensive knowledge and to inspire some new ideas in developing 3DOM materials for further improved performances. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of 3DOM materials for sustainable energy conversion/production, solar cells and energy storage fields are outlooked. We sincerely look forward to that this critical review can facilitate the fast developments in designing highly efficient 3DOM materials and the relevant applications.
