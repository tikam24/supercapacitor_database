In recent years, the recycling of low-cost and wide-source biomass has caused great concern. The obtained biomass-derived porous carbon (BDPC) is widely used as the electrode material of new energy storage device in the field of electrochemistry due to its unique properties such as large specific surface area, developed pore structure, acid and alkali resistance, excellent conductivity, and adjustable pore size. At the same time, efficient energy storage devices have been gradually developed and upgraded. Various hybrid supercapacitors (sodium ion, potassium ion, lithium ion, zinc ion, etc.) are widely used as new green energy equipment in hybrid power vehicles and portable electronic products. In this review, various activation methods and mechanisms are introduced in detail, and the application and research progress of biomaterials in electrochemical energy storage in the past three years are reviewed. The effects of different activation processing methods on the surface modification and micromachining of the obtained carbon materials on the electrochemical performance are briefly discussed. Finally, this paper summarizes the current research status of biomass-derived porous carbon in energy storage, potential future development directions and current challenges to promote the application of biomass-derived porous carbon materials in various fields, which provide useful insights for further development and utilization of biomass.
