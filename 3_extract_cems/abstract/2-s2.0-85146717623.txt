Optimal sizing and energy management strategies for a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system of a full-electric vehicle is presented in this paper. Both the sizing procedure and the energy management system have been designed to minimize an appropriate cost function that aims at preserving energy usage, by penalizing battery degradation as well. Consequently, the proposed sizing procedure aims at reducing system losses to the maximum extent, by complying with voltage and volume constraints. The proposed energy management system aims at regulating supercapacitor energy content in accordance with vehicle speed through a variable-gain proportional regulator. The effectiveness of both solutions has been verified through a simulation study, whose results highlight enhanced performance in comparison with a conventional filter-based approach.
