In this report, we describe the structure of a robust and highly conductive 3D graphene oxide hydrogel. The reduced graphene oxide hydrogel or rGH is fabricated by a crosslinking reaction with ethylene diamine followed by a hydrazine reduction. The material showed a high electrical conductivity of 1351 S m-1 and a specific surface area of 745 m2 g-1 with 10.3 MPa break strength. When used as electrodes for a supercapacitor, it showed a high specific capacitance of 232 F g-1. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
