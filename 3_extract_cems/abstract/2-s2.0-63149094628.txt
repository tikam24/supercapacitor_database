Two poly(acrylic acid)-based gel electrolytes have been characterized for their application to MnO2nH2O supercapacitors. The gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) consist of either poly(acrylic acid) or poly (acrylic acid)-co-poly(acrylamide) with 1 M KCI aqueous solution (weight composition, polymer: KCI : H2O 9%: 6.7%: 84.3%). The GPEs show no fluidity, while possessing ionic conductivities in the order of 10-1S cm-1 The electrochemical performance of MnO2-GPE supercapacitors have been investigated, and compared with liquid electrolyte counterpart. While both GPEs can give high initial capacitance, the copolymer one gives remarkably enhanced cycled stability. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
