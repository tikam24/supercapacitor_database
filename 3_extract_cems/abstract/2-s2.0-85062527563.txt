The energy densities of most supercapacitors (SCs) are low, hindering their practical applications. To construct SCs with ultrahigh energy densities, a porous titanium carbide (TiC)/boron-doped diamond (BDD) composite electrode is synthesized on a titanium plate that is pretreated using a plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) technique. The porous and nanometer-thick TiO 2 layer formed during PEO process prevents the formation of brittle titanium hydride and enhances the BDD growth during chemical vapor deposition processes. Meanwhile, the in situ conversion of TiO 2 into TiC is achieved. Combination of this capacitor electrode with soluble redox electrolytes leads to the fabrication of high-performance SCs in both aqueous and organic solutions. In 0.05 m Fe(CN) 6 3−/4− + 1 m Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution, the capacitance is as high as 46.3 mF cm −2 at a current density of 1 mA cm −2 ; this capacitance remains 92% of its initial value even after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles; the energy density is up to 47.4 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 2236 W kg −1 . The performance of constructed SCs is superior to most available SCs and some electrochemical energy storage devices like batteries. Such a porous capacitor electrode is thus promising for the construction of high-performance SCs for practical applications.
