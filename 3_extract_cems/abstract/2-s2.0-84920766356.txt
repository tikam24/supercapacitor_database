Copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticles have been prepared by a facile sonochemical method using copper nitrate and thiourea as precursors. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the formation of hexagonal CuS. The Field-emission scanning electron microscope showed the formation of CuS nanoparticles with size in the range of 50 nm. Moreover, the electrochemical properties of the prepared CuS nanoparticles are examined by the use of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The cyclic voltammetry studies show a maximum specific capacitance of about 62.77 F/g at a 5 mV s-1 scan rate. The electrochemical impedance studies such as Nyquist and Bode plots suggested that the pseudocapacitive properties of the prepared CuS nanoparticles.
