Heteroatom-doped mesoporous carbons have gained significant attention for their high energy density in supercapacitors. In this present study, we report the synthesis of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) co-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NPMC) by a simple and scalable technique wet impregnation method in one step using an ordered mesoporous silica template (SBA-15). Low-angle XRD patterns, transmission electron micrographs and N2 sorption measurement confirmed the synthesized materials ordered mesoporous nature (interconnected honeycomb 2D hexagonal pores of size ~ 10 nm). The charge storage capacity of NPMC is explored both in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. NPMC exhibited a significant faradaic process in an aqueous medium, whereas it was absent in non-aqueous. NPMC delivered a high specific capacitance of 183 F g−1 with remarkable capacitance retention of 94% even after 10000 charge–discharge cycles at 5 A g−1 current density in the aqueous medium. In a non-aqueous medium, NPMC exhibited an impressive energy density and power density of 41 Wh kg−1 (@1 A g−1) and 14400 W kg−1 (@20 A g−1), respectively. The retention of the ordered mesoporous structure of carbon with doping is the novelty of this work. It paves new ways to generate high-performance materials compared to the undoped ones for supercapacitor and battery applications. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
