Carbon nanomaterials that are electrochemically bifunctional and active in supercapacitor and hydrogen-evolution-reaction (HER) applications have attracted recent research attention. We have prepared porous carbon spheres - doped Ni, Co - alloys by using a hydrothermal method with melamine and pectin as precursors and with the addition of nickel nitrate and cobalt nitrate. The corresponding materials exhibit good electrochemical performance and excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER. The overpotential (OP) of the as-prepared materials can achieve 240 mV keeping a Tafel slope (TS) of 55 mV dec−1 at 10 mA cm−2 in an acid (0.5 M H2SO4) solution. The corresponding samples maintain stability after 24 h and 5000 cycles in the chronovoltage and cyclic voltammetry methods, respectively. When the as-prepared materials are oxidized by 30% H2O2 for 12 h, the corresponding as-prepared oxidation samples exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in a supercapacitor application. The specific capacitance (SC) of the as-obtained materials reaches 312 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with decent rate capability and cyclic stability. This work provides new applications for bifunctional electrochemically active materials.
