High dispersion of NiCo2O4 nanorods and porous NiCo2O4 nanobundles decorated on RGO have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method, followed by calcination in one step. By adjusting the starting metal sources to realize the synthesis of different morphologies of NiCo2O4. The morphology and the microstructure of the as-prepared composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) techniques. Among them, the porous RGO/NiCo2O4 nanobundles gives a higher specific capacitance of 1278F/g at 1A/g and 719F/g at 20A/g, showing a remarkable rate capability. The excellent electrochemical performances could ascribed to the unique structural feature with higher surface area. It could be anticipated that the synthesized electrode material will gain promising applications in supercapacitors and other devices because of their outstanding characteristics of controllable capacitance and facilely synthesized.
