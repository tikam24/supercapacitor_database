Herein, we report the NiMn2O4 (NMO), a supercapacitor electrode based on the binary metal nanocomposite which was synthesized using facile combustion method varying its annealing temperature. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the formation of cubic structured NMO NCs with high crystallinity. The cube shaped morphology of NMO NCs and their decreasing particle size with increasing temperature were visualized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM). Moreover, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis demonstrates the pseudo capacitive behavior of NMO-3 NCs and evaluated its high specific capacitance of 82.24F/cm2 at 5 mV/s. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of NMO1, NMO2, and NMO3 NCs exhibit low solution resistance (Rs) of 3.04, 1.87, and 3.53 Ω respectively and low charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 65.2, 75.8 and 74.2 Ω respectively. The cyclic stability of NMO3 NC delivers superior capacitive retention of about 81.96 % even after 3000 cycles. Thus the obtained results revealed that, the proper optimization of synthesis condition could potentially enhance the performance of active materials.
