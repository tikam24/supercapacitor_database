As redox-active based supercapacitors are known as highly desirable next-generation supercapacitor electrodes, the targeted design of two ferrocene-functionalized (Fc(COOH)2) clusters based on coinage metals, [(PPh3)2AgO2CFcCO2Ag(PPh3)2]2⋅7 CH3OH (SC1: super capacitor) and [(PPh3)3CuO2CFcCO2Cu(PPh3)3]⋅3 CH3OH (SC2), is reported. Both structures are fully characterized by various techniques. The structures are utilized as energy storage electrode materials, giving 130 F g−1 and 210 F g−1 specific capacitance at 1.5 A g−1 in Na2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. The obtained results show that the presence of CuI instead of AgI improves the supercapacitive performance of the cluster. Further, to improve the conductivity, the PSC2 ([(PPh3)2CuO2CFcCO2]∞), a polymeric structure of SC2, was synthesized and used as an energy storage electrode. PSC2 displays high conductivity and gives 455 F g−1 capacitance at 3 A g−1. The PSC2 as a supercapacitor electrode presents a high power density (2416 W kg−1), high energy density (161 Wh kg−1), and long cycle life over 4000 cycles (93 %). These results could lead to the amplification of high-performance supercapacitors in new areas to develop real applications and stimulate the use of the targeted design of coordination polymers without hybridization or compositions with additive materials.
