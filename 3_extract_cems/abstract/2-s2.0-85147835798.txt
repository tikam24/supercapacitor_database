This chapter presents general concepts on various energy storage devices and their advancement for renewable energy resources. Present-day technologies are based on the need to conserve traditional energy sources and move into the much more sustainable use of energy. These technologies include renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, smart grids, and emergency services. All these systems require an energy storage facility to provide solutions to power quality problems and proper integration and energy management of renewable energy resources (RER) into the grid. This chapter initially analyses the different energy storage devices and their characteristics. An extensively used energy storage device for distributed power generation is the battery. The operation of the battery shows non-linear behavior due to factors like temperature, aging, capacity fade, chemical degradation, etc., which makes the study more complex. Hence, different battery modeling techniques are analyzed with the simulation study. One of the emerging methods for improving battery life and system performance is hybridization with a complementary storage device. This chapter further discusses the different hybridization techniques in DC power generation and control strategies for the same. Finally, the chapter discusses the applications and future challenges of energy storage devices in the modern era.
