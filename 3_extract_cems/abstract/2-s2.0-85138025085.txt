In the present work, we synthesized copper sulfide (CuS) nanostructure using the co-precipitation technique by employing two different copper precursors such as copper nitrate, copper chloride with water as a solvent in order to investigate the effect of different precursors on the electrochemical behavior of CuS nanostructures as electrode material for supercapacitor application. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the pure phase (hexagonal-P63/mmc) formation of CuS nanostructures. The morphological and elemental compositional studies are done by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy respectively. Electrochemical characterizations like cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were utilized to analyze the super capacitive properties of the fabricated electrode material in a three-electrode system using 2 M KOH solution as an aqueous electrolyte. The highest value of specific capacitance is found to be 346.66F/g at 2 A/g for the sample synthesized via copper nitrate precursor. Furthermore, it also displayed good cycling stability with more than 80 % retention of capacitance over 500 GCD cycles. Hence, the analysis of the result revealed that precursors play a major role in modifying the electrochemical properties.
