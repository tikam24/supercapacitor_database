The research is devoted to comparison of energy characteristics of linear capacitor and super-capacitor during their charge from the accumulator battery. The features of influence of the final voltages on the electrical energy losses at charge linear capacitors from the accumulator battery and supercapacitors are established. The conditions of decrease of the losses in the capacitor charging circuits are defined.
