Abstract: Nano-sized Bi3+-doped iron oxide (n-Bi-IO) particles were prepared through a one-pot electrochemical procedure, and the product was evaluated using x-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Based on the analyses, the average size of the n-Bi-IO was determined to be 10 nm. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) evaluations revealed that the specific capacitance of the material reached 235 F g−1 at a discharge condition of 0.2 A g−1. n-Bi-IO had a 94.2% capacity retention after 2000 GCD cycles. Further vibrating sample magnetometery analyses showed that the product has enhanced superparamagnetic qualities (i.e. Mr = 0.15 emu g−1 and HCi = 2.71 G) in comparison to iron oxide nanoparticles (i.e. Mr = 0.95 emu g−1 and HCi = 14.62 G). Given the results, the product is considered to be a promising material for developing high performance supercapacitor electrodes. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
