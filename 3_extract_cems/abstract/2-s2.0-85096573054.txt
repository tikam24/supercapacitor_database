Supercapacitor is an energy storage device that has high energy and power density. One of the main component in supercapacitor cells is electrode. A production of activated carbon made from mesocarp of Bintaro fruit as a supercapacitor cell electrode has been successfully. Activated carbon electrodes were prepared through a pre-carbonization process, chemical with KOH 0.5 M activator, carbonization process using N2 gas and physical activation using CO2 gas. In this study, the physical activation process was carried out with temperature variations of 650°C, 750°C, 850°C and 950°C which of KAMBB-650, KAMBB-750, KAMBB-850 and KAMBB-950 respectively. Microstructure analysis shows amorphous structure for the carbon electrodes which is by the presence of peaks at an angel of 2θ around 24° and 44°. The increasing physical activation cause smaller Lchigh specific capacitance. In this study, the optimum temperature obtained in 850°C of KAMBB-850 sample. High specific capacitance as high as 267,6 F/g was found on KAMBB-850. The lowest capacitance obtained at carbonization temperature 950°C of KAMBB-650 sample with specific capacitance as high as 71,4 F/g.
