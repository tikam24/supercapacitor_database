The certain unique qualities present in the reduced graphene oxide that make them versatile for a myriad of applications. Unlike graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide is a conductive material and well suited for use in electrically storage materials, such as supercapacitor devices. In this study, we synthesize the reduced graphene oxide by modified hummer's method as well as the characterization of solid state electrode was done by various devices. The optical properties of synthesized reduced graphene oxide were characterized using Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, chemical interaction were studied by using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, The structural property of the sample was assessed using, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), The energy storage characteristics were determined by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance measurements.
