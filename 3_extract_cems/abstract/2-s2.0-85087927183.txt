A wireless charging intelligent car is designed and manufactured. It includes a set of wireless charging device. The car chassis is equipped with a wireless charging receiving device. The super capacitor is used as the energy storage device to receive the electric energy from the transmitting device. The fine wire is used as the guide track, and the capacitance sensor is used to detect the trace of the fine wire. The test results show that the car can charge and drive automatically.
