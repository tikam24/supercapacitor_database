Fibriform supercapacitor (FSC) based on cotton thread (CT) produced by dip-coating presents great potential in wearable electronics. However, active materials especially for reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets tend to restack on the surface of CT and are difficult to permeate into the inside of CT, thus fading performance. In this work, each cotton yarn (CY) obtained by uncoiling CT is uniformly covered by GO (GO-CY) and RGO coated CT (RGO-UCDCT) is obtained through twisting these GOCYs, followed by subsequent reduction. Uncoiling dip-coating alleviates the restacking of RGO sheets on the surface of CT. Thus, the FSC based on RGO-UCDCTs exhibits superior performance including high volumetric capacitance of 1.85 mF cm-3 and good rate capability. The findings provide a cost-effective procedure of uncoiling dip-coating for improving performance of CT based FSC.
