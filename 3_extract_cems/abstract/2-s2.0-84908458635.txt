In this paper, effect of recharging power by using ESS(Energy Storage System) was investigated when ESS was applied to the train. The recharging power was analyzed and measured: Also, by applying ALVT algorithm, effective recharging and discharging were studied. By using this process, recharging and discharging of the super capacitor were improved which led to enhancing the use of recharging power from the urban Railway vehicles.
