Carbon nanocomposites are widely used in hydrogen storage materials and high-capacity electrode materials due to their unique structure and excellent performance. Inspired by Sandwich biscuit, we report a green and convenient method for preparing CoS2-carbon nanofiber composites (CoS2-CNFs). The CoS2-CNFs are prepared by electrospinning technology and hydrothermal process. The structural and morphological properties of CoS2-CNFs were characterized through X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope, Raman spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the CoS2-CNFs reaches 378 F g−1, over 75.6% of initial capacitance is retained as the current density improves from 1 to 10 A g−1 and also exhibits an excellent cycling performance with 89.5% capacitance retention after 1000 times charge/discharge cycles. This result suggests that the CoS2-CNFs could yield them potentially promising candidates for future energy storage systems.
