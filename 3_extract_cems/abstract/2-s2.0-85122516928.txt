Energy storage is big problem nowadays depend on the challenges of conventional storage devices. Supercapacitor offers promising alternative approach for increasing power demands of energy storage devices with their high power density, less charge discharge time ability and long cycle life. In this review classification of supercapacitors is done based on materials used for electrodes and performance of the various type of supercapacitor is reviewed. In carbons activated carbon is most widely used material in supercapacitor electrodes. Amorphous nanostructured oxides, mixed metal oxides are also proposed for high performance supercapacitor devices. Recent development in the field of MnO2 based composites and electrodes prepared by green approach for supercapacitor application is discussed. Recent development in the field of supercapattery is also discussed, supercapattery exhibits comparable performance to battery in energy capacity and to supercapacitor in cycle life and power capability.
