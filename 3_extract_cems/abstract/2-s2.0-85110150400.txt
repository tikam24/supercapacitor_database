MXenes have excellent electrochemical performance due to their remarkable electrical conductivity and abundant surface functional groups. However, the smaller interlayer spacing and self-stacking limit their practical applications. Herein, the Ba2+ ions pillared Ti3C2 MXene (Ba2+-Ti3C2) with enlarged interlayer spacing has been successfully fabricated by electrostatic self-assembly. The pillared Ba2+ ions between Ti3C2 layers can enlarge interlayer spacing, increase specific surface area, expose more active sites and provide open ions transfer channels due to its pillaring effects on the layered structure of Ti3C2. The Ba2+-Ti3C2 exhibits a higher specific capacitance (168Fg-1 at 0.2Ag-1) than pure Ti3C2 (123 Fg-1 at 0.2Ag-1) and outstanding cycle performance, which remains at 164 Fg-1 after 1100 cycles at 1Ag-1. The Ba2+-Ti3C2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor achieved a high power density of 1140WKg-1 as well as long cycle stability with capacitance retention of 86.35% at a current density of 1Ag-1 after 4000 cycles. The results demonstrate that expeading interlayer spacing can obviously enhance and optimize the supercapactive performance of MXenes, providing an idea to design the 2D energy storage materials with large interlayer spacing and high rate capability.
