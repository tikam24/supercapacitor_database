Porous α-Fe2O3 nanostructures have been synthesized by a simple sol-gel route. The α-Fe2O3 nanostructures are poorly crystalline and porous with BET surface area of 386 m2 g-1. The high discharge capacitance of α-Fe 2O3 electrodes is 300 F g-1 when the electrodes are cycled in 0.5 M Na2SO3 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The capacitance retention after 1000 cycles is about 73% of the initial capacitance at a current density of 2 A g-1. The high discharge capacitance of α-Fe2O3 in comparison with the literature reports are attributed to high surface area and porosity of the iron oxide prepared in the present study. As the iron oxides are inexpensive, the capacity of α-Fe2O3 is expected to be of potential use for supercapacitor application. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
