Strong, solid polymer electrolyte ion gels, with moduli in the MPa range, a capacitance of 2 μF/cm2, and high ambient ionic conductivities (>1 × 10-3 S/cm), all at room temperature, have been prepared from butyl-N-methyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (PYR14TFSI) and methyl cellulose (MC). These properties are particularly attractive for supercapacitor applications. The ion gels are prepared by codissolution of PYR14TFSI and MC in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which after heating and subsequent cooling form a gel. Evaporation of DMF leave thin, flexible, self-standing ion gels with up to 97 wt % PYR14TFSI, which have the highest combined moduli and ionic conductivity of ion gels to date, with an excellent electrochemical stability window (5.6 V). These favorable properties are attributed to the immiscibility of PYR14TFSI in MC, which permits the ionic conductivity to be independent of the MC at low MC content, and the in situ formation of a volume spanning network of semicrystalline MC nanofibers, which have a high glass transition temperature (Tg = 190 °C) and remain crystalline until they degrade at 300 °C.
