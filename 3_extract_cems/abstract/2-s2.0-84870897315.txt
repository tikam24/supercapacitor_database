Nickel molybdate (α-NiMoO4) nanoparticles were prepared by a solution combustion synthesis (SCS) technique and, for the first time, were studied as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors. High specific capacitance (1517 F g-1) and energy density (52.7 W h Kg -1) were delivered by nano-α-NiMoO4 at a current density of 1.2 A g-1, due to the pseudocapacitive nature of the material. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
