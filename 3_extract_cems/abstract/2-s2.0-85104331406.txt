High-performance energy storage and sensing devices have been undergoing rapid development to meet the demand for portable and wearable electronic products, which require flexibility, extensibility, small volume and lightweight. In this study, we construct a lightweight and flexible self-powered sensing system by integrating a highly stretchable strain sensor with a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor based on ZnSe/CoSe2//ECNT (ECNT: electrochemically activated carbon nanotube film). The ZnSe/CoSe2 two-dimentional nanosheets on carbon nanotube (CNT) films are synthesized through a simple and efficient strategy derived from ZnCo-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The density functional theory (DFT) simulations show the higher conductivity of the ZnSe/CoSe2/CNT electrode than the CoSe2/CNT electrode. Due to the synergistic properties of self-supported two-dimentional ZnSe/CoSe2 nanosheets with high specific surface area and the high pathway of one-dimention CNTs, the nanocomposite electrode provides efficient transmission and short paths for electron/ion diffusion. The asymmetric supercapacitor provides a stable output power supply to the sensors that can precisely respond to strain and pressure changes. The sensor can also be attached to a garment for measuring a variety of joint movements. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
