Supercapacitors are high energy density and power density materials in the electronics industry. Noble metals and their composites have been the most successfully applied in supercapacitors. This review is focused on noble metal-based materials that have been used to improve electrochemical supercapacitors over the last decade. This review describes the role of various noble metals, binary composites with transition metals, binary composites with carbon-based materials, and ternary composites containing both transition metals and carbon-based materials as supercapacitor electrode materials. The effects of the electrode material, growth tactics, structure, size and morphology of the nanostructured materials on device performance are discussed.
