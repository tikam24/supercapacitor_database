MnO2 was doped into a conducting copolymer, poly(aniline-co-o-aminophenol) (PANOA), via a one-step process during the chemical oxidative polymerization. The doping of MnO2 could enhance the electrochemical activity and reversibility of the copolymer. When used as the electrode materials of a supercapacitor, the capacitive behaviors of the as-prepared PANOA-MnO2 were superior to those of pure PANOA, especially at high potential scan rate and high charge-discharge current density. The MnO2 doped copolymer also had an excellent cyclic performance.
