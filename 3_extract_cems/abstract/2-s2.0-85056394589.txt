Covalent functionalization is a way to tune the electrochemical properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) monolayers. The wide bandgap insulator h-BN may become metallic conductor upon functionalization with strong oxidants, such as (fluorosulfonyl)oxy radicals (·OSO2F), as known since 1978 (Bartlett et al in J Chem Soc Chem Commun 5:200, 1978), with electrical conductivity of 1.5 S/cm (Shen et al in J Solid State Chem 147:74, 1999) that greatly surpasses commercial cathode material LixCoO2 while retaining excellent ionic conductivity. Functionalized boron nitrides (FBN-s) have great potential for cathode applications in energy storage devices, for example, in solid-state batteries. While (fluorosulfonyl)oxy functionalization is unlikely to result in rechargeable cathodes, similarly to graphene fluoride (CFx), some other FBN-s discussed here may do. In the present work, fluorene, oxygen and combined oxygen and boron trifluoride functionalizations are studied, on the basis of band structure calculations. Due to the open surfaces of FBN-s, fast ionic diffusion with Li, Na and Mg ions is possible, enabling batteries with voltages of 2.1–5.6 V, theoretical energy densities of 800–1200 Wh/kg and fast charge and discharge.
