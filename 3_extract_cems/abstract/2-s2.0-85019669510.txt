In this work, we design a novel and facile strategy to synthesize a three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked structural composite with PANI and MOF-derived N-doped porous carbon composite (3CPC). The novel and facile method realize interconnected structure composed of an ultrahigh surface area of N-doped porous carbon and conductive PANI fiber, which can offer more contact area between the electrode material and electrolyte to provide more active sites for charge storage and shorten the pathway for electron transfer. As a result, the 3CPC shows an extraordinarily efficient specific capacity of 755 F g−1 and good cycling stability at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which suggests its potential application as an efficient material for supercapacitor.
