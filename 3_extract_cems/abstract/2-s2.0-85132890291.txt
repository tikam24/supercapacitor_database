Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are one of the most advanced crystal materials assembled by organic ligands as linkers and metal ions as center ions, which can be used as excellent materials for batteries and supercapacitors due to their high adjustable pore sizes, controllable structures, and specific surface areas. Carbon-based functional materials (e.g., graphene, reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes) have excellent electrochemical properties, thermal stability and electrical conductivity. The controllable integration of MOFs and carbon-based functional materials can further enhance the electrochemical stability and electrical conductivity of pristine MOFs. The assembled MOF/carbon-based functional materials composites possess superior rate, cycling properties and high reversibility, enabling the obtained MOF/carbon-based functional materials composites to be applied in wider fields. This review summarizes the recent research progress of MOF/carbon-based functional materials composites in the field of batteries and supercapacitors. In addition, the difficulties and challenges encountered by MOF/carbon-based functional materials composites are put forward. Finally, the future development of MOF/carbon-based functional material composites in electrochemical energy storage devices is prospected.
