The complete study on the synthesis of biomass waste-based activated carbon monolith from Tectona grandis leaf for supercapacitor electrode materials has been successfully studied. This study was performed through a combination of chemical and CO2 activation methods. The KOH was used as an activating agent in the chemical activation process. The pyrolysis process includes carbonization and CO2 activation used integrated systems were conducted at temperature of 600°C under N2 gas atmosphere, and CO2 activation at different temperatures, specifically 750, 800, 850, and 900°C. The Tectona grandis leaf-based activated carbon (TL-AC) samples show different structures such as carbon rod (750°C), carbon sheet (800°C), and carbon fiber (900°C). The optimum-specific capacitance of the TL-AC samples as high as 168 F g−1 in 1 M sulfuric acid solution using two-electrode configuration. This study provides an economic approach needed in the preparation of electrode materials with different structures for energy storage systems by abundant materials.
