The rational design of free-standing hierarchical core-shell nanoporous architectures is a good strategy for fabricating next-generation electrode materials for application in electrochemical energy conversion/storage systems. Herein, hierarchical core-shell 3D Co9S8@Nix:Moy-Se nanowire arrays (NWAs) are constructed by a low-cost, straightforward two-step hydrothermal method and an effective electrodeposition process. The optimal 3D Co9S8@Ni0.5Mo0.5-Se NWA electrode displays an excellent specific capacity of 460.81 mA h g−1with a corresponding areal capacity of 0.93 mA h cm−2at 1.5 mA cm−2. It also demonstrates superb rate capability (∼68.4% capacity retention at 20 mA cm−2) and remarkable cycling stability (∼94.3% capacity retention after 10 000 charge and discharge cycles). Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled using the hierarchical 3D Co9S8@Ni0.5Mo0.5-Se NWAs as the positive electrode, and the as-obtained Fe2O3@PANNFs/N-rGO aerogel as the negative electrode. The assembled Co9S8@Ni0.5Mo0.5-Se//Fe2O3@PANNFs/N-rGO ASC shows a larger operating voltage range of 1.7 V, a high electrochemical energy storage capability (96.90 W h kg−1at 1158 W kg−1), and excellent cycling stability (∼94.47% retention of the original capacity after 10 000 cycles). The all-solid-state ASC device that is also fabricated exhibits a high output working potential window of ∼1.8 V, and an outstanding energy density of ∼102.94 W h kg−1at ∼1534 W kg−1, demonstrating that the hierarchical 3D Co9S8@Ni0.5Mo0.5-Se NWA electrode material is a potential candidate for high-performance energy storage devices.
