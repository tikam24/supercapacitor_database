The permanent magnet synchronous generator is increasingly popular due to its advantage of small in size, higher energy density, lower maintenance cost and ease of control. In order to maintain the stability of the grid under fault conditions, an energy storage device becomes vital. Most of the works done for LVRT/FRT using crowbar protection or chopper resistor have been used for dissipating the excessive energy during voltage dips, which increase the temperature across the resistor. However, the proposed energy storage device, super capacitor can cope up with the rapid power fluctuations and stabilize the output power for several tens of minutes. The characteristic of LVRT is found to be enhanced with super capacitor when compared to chopper resistor. In addition to this, super capacitor can be accessed at any operating condition. Simulation results have been obtained using MATLAB-SIMULINK software and analyzed. It is observed that super capacitor based PMSG performs well.
