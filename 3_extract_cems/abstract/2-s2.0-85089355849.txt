In this work, Co3O4 nanowires grown on Ni foam have been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal approach, revealing large capacity of 310.4 C g−1 and superior cycling stability of 80.3% capacity retention after 6000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitors were fabricated based on Co3O4//AC device, which delivers an energy density of 0.4 mWh cm−3 at power density of 3.99 mW cm−3 and an excellent cycle life of 79.2% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles.
