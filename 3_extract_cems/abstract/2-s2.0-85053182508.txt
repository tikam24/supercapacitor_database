Fibrous aggregates of single-walled carbon nanohorns (carbon nanobrushes: CNBs) were prepared by CO2 laser ablation of an iron-containing carbon target with rotations under nitrogen atmosphere and ambient pressure. The rotation speed of the target and concentration of iron contained in it were controlled so as to increase the yield of CNBs. As a result, many CNBs were obtained at a rotation speed of 1 rpm and iron concentration above 1 at. %, although the samples still contained spherical single-walled carbon nanohorn aggregates (CNHs). The sheet resistivity of the samples containing both CNBs and CNHs decreased with the CNB content, which indicates that the CNBs formed a good conducting path. By forming supercapacitor electrodes, the capacitances of mixture of CNBs and CNHs, CNHs, and activated carbon were similar, i.e., 20, 21, and 23 F/g, respectively, at 0.1 A/g. However, the capacitance of the mixture of CNBs and CNHs at a discharge current of 5 A/g was about 1.4 and 6 times higher than that of the CNHs and activated carbon. These newly discovered CNBs should definitely increase the advantages of nanocarbon in various fields, especially in electronic devices.
