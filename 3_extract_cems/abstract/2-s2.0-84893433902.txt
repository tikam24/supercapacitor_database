High-performance planar supercapacitors have attracted increasing attention because of their thin, light and flexible abilities. Here we developed novel flexible symmetrical planar supercapacitors (FSPSCs) by using the multi-layered MnO2/Ni/graphite/paper electrodes that were fabricated by sequentially coating a graphite layer, Ni layer, and MnO2 layer on ordinary cellulose paper. The MnO2/Ni/graphite/paper electrodes show a large specific capacitance (Csp) of 175 mF cm-2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The assembled FSPSCs based on the multi-layered MnO2/Ni/graphite/paper electrodes exhibit a large volumetric Csp (1020 mF cm-3 at 5 mV s-1) and a superior long-term cycle stability (less 4% loss of the maximum Csp after 6000 cycles). The FSPSCs based on the multi-layered MnO 2/Ni/graphite/paper electrodes may open up new opportunities in developing novel supercapacitor devices because of the low-cost, high performance, and facile large-scale fabrication procedures.
