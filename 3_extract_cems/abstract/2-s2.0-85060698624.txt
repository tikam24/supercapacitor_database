In this study, Ni 2 CoS 4 nanoparticles were coated on the surface of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) nanosheets using a hydrothermal process. The composition and morphology of the nanocomposite thus obtained were characterized using different spectroscopic techniques. When subjected to cyclic voltammetry and constant current chronopotentiometry in alkaline media, the charge storage properties and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared Ni 2 CoS 4 @g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite were found to be superior not only to those of Ni 2 CoS 4 nanoparticles and their monometallic counterparts (Co 3 S 4 @g-C 3 N 4 and Ni 3 S 4 @g-C 3 N 4 ) but also to those of g-C 3 N 4 nanosheets, Ni 1.5 Co 1.5 S 4 @g-C 3 N 4, and NiCo 2 S 4 @g-C 3 N 4 . Moreover, the Ni 2 CoS 4 @g-C 3 N 4 nanocomposite exhibited a high charge storage capacity of 246 mAh g −1 or 2210 F g −1 at a discharge current of 1 A g −1 , an excellent rate capability (over 86% retention at 40 A g −1 ), a high cycling stability (85% of charge storage capacity retention after 4000 charge-discharge cycles), and a high columbic efficiency of 99% at a discharge current of 40 A g −1 . Based on the results obtained, such hybrid nanocomposites may be claimed to be good candidates for use as electrode materials in energy storage devices due to their high performance at high current densities, good stability, and high columbic efficiency.
