A control strategy of wind and hydrogen hybrid grid-connected power generation system is presented. The control strategy can realize that the energy is distributed reasonably into power unit(wind turbine), long-term slow storage unit(electrolyzer and fuel cell)and short-term fast storage unit(supercapacitors)of hybrid system, and also ensure that the pressure of hydrogen tank and state of charge of super capacitors run within safe range to improve the penetration rate of wind energy, stabilize the DC bus voltage and smooth the grid-connected power. The hybrid gridconnected power generation system of wind power/hydrogen production/fuel cell/super capacitor is built up based on the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. And four simulation results show that the fuel cell and electrolyzer can compensate/ consume slowly the power difference between the power generated by wind turbines and the power required by load, super capacitor can quickly smooth unbalance power caused by response delay of electrolyzer and fuel cell, and ensure the power output of hybrid system is consistent with load demand all the time.
