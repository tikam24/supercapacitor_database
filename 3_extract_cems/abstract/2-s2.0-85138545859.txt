Dendrite-like three-dimensional (3D) MgCo2O4/C nanofibers were fabricated by using a simple single-needle electrospinning method and adjusting the carbonization temperatures. The dendrite-like 3D MgCo2O4/C nanofibers are composed of 1D MgCo2O4/C nanofibers as trunks and secondary carbon nanowires/nanotubes as branches. The diameters of the 1D MgCo2O4/C nanofiber trunks and carbon nanotube/nanowire branches are approximately 500 nm and 20–40 nm, respectively; the lengths of these branches are approximately 200–500 nm. The dendrite-like 3D MgCo2O4/C nanofibers possess a large specific surface area of 314.027 g/m2 and excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor owing to their unique structural features. The growth mechanism of the dendrite-like 3D nanofibers was also investigated.
