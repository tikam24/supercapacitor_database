Constructed with both capacitive and battery-like electrodes, hybrid supercapacitor devices have been adopted as promising energy storage devices for their favorable power and energy densities. Design and fabrication of capacitive and battery-like electrode materials endowed with high specific capacitances/capacities, high rate performance and desirable durability are crucial to improve the overall energy storage performances of hybrid supercapacitors. As emerging porous crystalline materials, metal-organic frameworks with favorable porous properties, tunable chemical compositions and adjustable structures/morphologies can lead to desirable energy storage performances of hybrid supercapacitors. In this review, started from the classification of supercapacitors and electrode materials, the recent advances of pristine metal-organic frameworks, metal-organic framework composites and metal-organic frameworks derived materials applied for hybrid supercapacitor were elaborated. Furthermore, based on previous contributions, challenges and perspectives of metal-organic framework-based materials for hybrid supercapacitor application were summarized.
