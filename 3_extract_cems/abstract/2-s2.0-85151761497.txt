Supercapacitors have emerged as potential candidates for energy storage devices. Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) have been explored for the fabrication of high-performance supercapacitor applications. The expanding number of distinctive sorts and amounts of commercial items containing fabricated nanomaterials may produce unused sort of nanowastes that can be discharged into the environment amid the generation of the commercial nanoproducts. Life cycle contemplations are an imperative perspective of the secure utilize of new materials and chemical risk assessment (CRA) emerged as a foremost significant perspective in assessing and evaluating the safety of ENMs. There are parcels of challenges confronted with the case of nanomaterials evaluation depending on the association of ENMs with the encompassing compartments. The improvement of approved test guidelines and conventions would greatly aid the univocal hazard identification of ENMs. Ultimately, the introduced nanosafety approach will grow socioeconomic benefits, superior environment, and livelihood, which advances more speculation in vitality ventures toward economic improvement.
