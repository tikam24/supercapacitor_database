Metal oxides and carbon composites have been proved to be promising materials in energy storage system. Herein, we report CuO/C composite nanofibers prepared by a facile electrospinningmethod and its application as the anode materials for supercapacitors. The phase and morphology of CuO/C composite nanofibers were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Specific surface areas were tested by pore size and surface area analyzer and the carbon content of CuO/C composite nanofibers were confirmed by the thermal gravimetric analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge test of the pure CuO nanofibers anode and CuO/C nanofibers anode prepared with different CuO/C proportions were investigated. The results showed that the CuO/C anode prepared with the largest C proportion reached the highest specific capacity of 69.76 F g-1 compared with the pure CuO nanofibers anode of 32.88 F g-1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy suggested that the CuO/C composite electrode have a lower Warburg resistance than the pure CuO electrode, which indicated that the electrical conductivity of CuO had increased by adding carbon materials.
