In this article, we report a facile and simple approach for tuning graphene nanosheet structures (GNS) with different ions in the electrolytes through cathodic plasma exfoliation process in electrochemical reactions. We obtained sheet- and onion-like GNS when aqueous electrolyte NaOH and H2SO4, respectively, were present during plasma exfoliation in the electrochemical reactions, as evidenced from scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images. Moreover, the onion-like GNS exhibited a specific surface area of 464 m2 g−1 and a supercapacitive performance of 67.1 F g−1, measured at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in 1 M NaCl; these values were much higher than those (72 m2 g−1 and 21.6 F g−1, respectively) of the sheet-like GNS. This new approach for efficiently generating tunable stacked graphene structures with different ions, in the cathodic plasma exfoliation process, has promising potentials for use in energy storage devices.
