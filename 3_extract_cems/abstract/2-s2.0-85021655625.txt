Flexible and highly efficient energy storage units act as one of the key components in portable electronics. In this work, based on CuCo2S4 nanospheres, a flexible all-solid-state coaxial fiber supercapacitor is designed and produced via a low cost and facile method. The as-fabricated flexible device exhibits high specific capacitance, high energy density, excellent rate capability and outstanding long-term cycling stability. This approach can be an efficient strategy for the preparation of novel and low-cost electrodes for various applications.
