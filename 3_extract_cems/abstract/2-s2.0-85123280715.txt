The main problem restricting the development of electric vehicles is that the on-board power supply system needs to meet the requirements of both high power density and high energy density, and a single power supply cannot meet this demand. Therefore, a hybrid control strategy of logical threshold control and fuzzy control is proposed to reasonably distribute the power between lithium battery and ultracapacitor. Logic threshold control is used when electric vehicles are braking and fuzzy control is used when they are accelerating. The NEDC (New Europe Driving Cycle) Cycle condition was simulated by using Matlab /Simulink simulation software. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can reasonably distribute the output power of the lithium battery and the ultracapacitor, and improve the energy use efficiency.
