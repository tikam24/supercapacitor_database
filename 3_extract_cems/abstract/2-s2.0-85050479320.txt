An original vibrational energy harvesting device with regard to the vibrational performance of far-end cables was designed under the condition that no power can be supplied to the far end of freight cableways in transmission and distribution projects. The device was designed to have a Y-shaped radial gear-rack structure. The random vibrations of the cable are converted into three one-way rotary motions of a Y-shaped device terminal using a Y-shaped rack unit and one-way gear-rack units. The device then harvests the electric energy through a super-capacitor and supplies power to equipment in areas out of the reach of the power supply along the cableway. An analysis and dynamic simulation of the Y-shaped rack unit and one-way gear-rack units demonstrate that the Y-shaped layout of the device adapts well to the random vibration of the cable. The device was proven to have successfully harvested the vibrational energy of the cable in several directions on its radial plane, showing good prospects in supplying power to far-end wireless surveillance equipment for freight cableways in remote mountainous areas.
