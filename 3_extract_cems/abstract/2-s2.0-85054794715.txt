The use of advanced pseudocapacitive electrode for improved energy density of supercapacitors has been given much attention recently. Herein, we develop a promising electrode architecture that contains carbon textiles uniformly covered with NiCo2-xFexO4 nanotubes, which are directly used as electrode materials in energy storage devices through a simple and feasible two-step method, and then a short period of post annealing treatment was adopted. The prepared NiCo2-xFexO4 nanotubes/carbon textiles composite electrode possesses a high specific capacitance of 2057 F g-1 when the discharging current is 1 A g-1 and a superior long-life stability with 90.32% retention of specific capacitance after 3000 cycles. The increased capacitive property is ascribed to the increased specific surface area, the vacancy formation, and the unique nanotube structure.
