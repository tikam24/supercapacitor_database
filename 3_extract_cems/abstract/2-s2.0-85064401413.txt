Manganese based materials have been considered to be one type of important electrode materials in energy storage and conversion devices. Two types of colloidal nanocrystal assemblies (CNAs) of MnFe2O4 had been investigated as the electrode materials by using aqueous electrolytes containing bivalent and trivalent metal ions. Experimental results showed that CNAs assembled by 16 nm nanocrystals (MnFe-1Sf) displayed specific capacitance of about 32.0 F g−1 and 43.2 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 in aqueous solutions containing Mg2+ or Al3+ ions, respectively. However, the capacitances of CNAs composed of large nanoparticles (MnFe-2 Ac) increased respectively up to around 58.2 F g−1 and 45.1 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. MnFe-1Sf delivered the specific capacitance of 30.6 F g−1 and 51.7 F g−1 in electrolytes of Na2SO4 mixed MgSO4 and MgSO4 mixed ZnSO4 at 0.1 A g−1 while 36.2 F g−1 and 44.4 F g−1 for MnFe-2 Ac, respectively. MnFe-1Sf showed a better cycle stability than MnFe-2 Ac either in MgSO4 or in Al2(SO4)3 electrolytes. The wide potential window during cyclic voltammetry brings the electrochemical diversification of the CNAs based electrodes in various electrolytes. Based on the experimental data and crystalline features of the CNAs, the structure-property relationship has been discussed and analyzed.
