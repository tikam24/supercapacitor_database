An organic-organic self-assembly hydrothermal synthesis strategy coupled with carbonization is reported to fabricate nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon microspheres (N-OMCMs) from m-aminophenol-formaldehyde resin. The obtained N-OMCMs possess high-surface-area ordered mesoporous structure, moderate nitrogen content and micrometer-sized sphere-like morphology. And the N-OMCMs exhibit a large specific capacitance up to 288 F g−1, excellent rate performance (222 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) and long-term stability.
