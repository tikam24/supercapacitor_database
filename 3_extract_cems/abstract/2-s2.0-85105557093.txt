Aiming at the problem of photovoltaic active power fluctuations affecting the stable operation of the power grid, a hybrid energy storage smoothing output fluctuation control strategy considering the dual evaluation indicators of photovoltaics is proposed. Firstly, according to different time scales, two evaluation indicators with volatility and smoothness as smoothing output fluctuation targets are established. Secondly, based on the improved ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) method, the photovoltaic active power signal is decomposed, and the power is reconstructed into high-frequency and low-frequency parts with the gray correlation degree, and the commands of final high-frequency supercapacitor and low-frequency battery smoothing output fluctuation are obtained. Then, the moving average filter smooth curve is used as the charge/discharge target reference power to obtain the charge/discharge power commands of the hybrid energy storage instruction, and use a hybrid energy storage battery pack composed of batteries and supercapacitors to smooth output fluctuations at a time scale of 5min and a single battery pack composed of supercapacitors to smooth smoothness at a time scale of 1min. The smoothness follows the smooth output fluctuations, then getting different time scales of energy storage system priority smoothing output fluctuation strategy. Finally, taking a photovoltaic power station in Xinjiang as an example, a comprehensive comparison of various photovoltaic power decomposition methods and different evaluation indicators verifies the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.
