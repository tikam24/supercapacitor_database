The primary global research scheme of the 21st century is nanotechnology. Looking forward to the future, nanotechnologies’ generalized diffusion will seem to turn them into supplies, generating more space for privileged and superior values of applications such as information technology, nanoenergy, nanobiotechnologies, and nanomaterials. In general, nanotechnology is the understanding and controlling of the matters of dimensions of approximately 1–100 nm, in which a unique phenomenon facilitates novel applications. The application domains covered by nanotechnology are discussed in detail in this chapter.
