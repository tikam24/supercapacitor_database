This paper provides concept of capturing the different kinds of energy conversions that can be in form of motion, physical force, heat energy and solar energy and converting all form of energy into useful electrical energy. It can provide endless supply of energy to electronic device also has attracted large number of researchers and has bought a growing amount of attention to energy harvesting. The hybrid human powered power generating unit is an electronic device, purpose of proposed model is to supply electricity for charging devices when the user is out of reach to the charger or charging port. This device basically transforms many different kind of energies to electricity (direct current) example piezoelectric plate produces electrical energy when mechanical force is applied on it and another we have Peltier plate (thermal electric generator) which transforms temperature differences into electrical energy. The proposed model is very much portable, so any individual easily can carry with them. This device does not need any external power supply to charge it, because this device made up of four energy inducing elements or can say transducers and one buck booster which step up the output voltage of the energy produced or induced by the generating elements assembled with a super-capacitor. This device is very useful in the situation where the person doesn't have power source around and need to charge any electronic device. This device can replace your heavy power bank with this light weighted device. Anyone can easily use this electronic device simply by squeezing it and shaking horizontally, these all physical movements induces electrical energy and got stored in super capacitor and further consume by the charging devices.
