A simple approach has been developed to fine-tune SiO2 spheres into low-density SiO2 spheres with the total volume increased by etching in a NaBH4 solution, followed by the preparation of the SiO2/MnO2 and low-density SiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanocomposites. The core-shell nanocomposites with uniform diameters from 200 to 350nm can be observed on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). With the reaction time increasing, the thickness of manganese oxide shells around the silica core thickens, while the electrochemical properties are observed to present a parabola style. Interestingly, the low-density SiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanocomposites deliver the maximum specific capacitance of 298.3 F g-1 far more than the SiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanocomposites (179.8 F g-1), and possess desirable electrochemical stability (5000 cycles retained 86.3%). All of these findings indicate that the low-density SiO2/MnO2 core-shell nanostructures appear to be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors application.
