Graphene nanosheets, polyaniline (PANI), and nanocrystallites of transition metal ferrite {Fe3O4 (Mag), NiFe2O4 (NiF), and CoFe2O4 (CoF)} have been prepared and characterized via XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, UV–vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharges, and impedance spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements showed that supercapacitances of hybrid electrodes made of the ternary materials are higher than that of hybrid electrode made of binary or single material. The ternary hybrid CoF/graphene (G)/PANI electrode exhibits a highest specific capacitance reaching 1123 Fg−1, an energy density of 240 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1, and a power density of 2680 Wkg−1 at 1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance, with 98.2% capacitance retained over 2000 cycles. The extraordinary electrochemical performance of the ternary CoF/G/PANI hybrid can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the individual components. The PANI conducting polymer enhances an electron transport. The Ferrite nanoparticles prevent the restocking of the carbon sheets and provide Faradaic processes to increase the total capacitance.
