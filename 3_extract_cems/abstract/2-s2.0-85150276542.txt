Three-dimensional porous nanostructured materials are considered superior materials for energy storage applications due to their high storage capability. A nickel copper-cobalt oxide (NCC) composite with a uniform 3-D porous nanostructure (positive electrode materials) and luffa sponge-derived activated carbon (LPAC) with honeycomb-like structure (negative electrode materials) were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal and chemical method. A sample of the nickel-copper cobalt oxide-5 (NCC-5) nanocomposite reached a high specific capacitance of 1048 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. The NCC-5 nanocomposite sample shows a retention capacity of 93 % after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles with 95 % of Coulombic efficiency (CE). The LPAC illustrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 909 F/g at 1 A/g of current density, compared to the best literature value of 400 F/g. The full-cell NCC-5//LPAC delivered an energy density of 65 Wh/kg, corresponding to a power density of 500 W/kg. The supercapacitor devices connected in series could glow 55 red LEDs for 5 min.
