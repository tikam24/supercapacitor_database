In present work, we propose a sodium dodecyl sulfate-assisted strategy to fabricate three-dimensional highly nitrogen/sulfur co-doped porous carbon by directly carbonizing melamine-formaldehyde-thiourea resin. More importantly, sodium dodecyl sulfate can be linked with resin polymer through electrostatic organic–organic interaction and serves as pore-forming and sulfur-doping agents. Furthermore, by adding various amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the specific surface areas and nitrogen/sulfur contents are well regulated. When sodium dodecyl sulfate is 20 g, the sample possesses high surface area (939 m2 g−1), large pore volume (1.34 cm3 g−1), and high contents of nitrogen/sulfur (13.62 at% and 3.96 at%, respectively). In the two-electrode test, it delivers good coulombic efficiency (90.9% at 1 A g−1) and cycling stability (94.7% of capacitance retentions at 4 A g−1 after 10,000 cycles) in alkaline electrolyte and high energy density (31.9 Wh kg−1) in EMIMBF4/AN solution.
