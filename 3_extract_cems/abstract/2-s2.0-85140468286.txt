The randomness of photovoltaic power generation and the disorder of electric vehicle charging have a significant impact on the transmission capacity of the smart park tie line. Energy storage can help to stabilize the power fluctuation of the tie line and improve distribution network operation reliability. In this paper, the park's source and load uncertainty models are established to determine the original transmission power of the distribution network tie line, and then the tie line's power control model is established to ensure that the power fluctuation rate of the distribution network tie line varies within a certain range. The power required for hybrid energy storage stabilization is calculated, and the high-pass filtering algorithm is used to allocate it. The amount of power required to stabilize the supercapacitor and lithium battery is calculated. The hybrid energy storage capacity configuration model is built on top of these. The hybrid energy storage constraints are constructed using the maximum annual income of the hybrid energy storage as the objective function, and the adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) is used to solve the problem, resulting in the hybrid energy storage's optimal capacity configuration. Finally, an example is used to simulate the model. The simulation results show that this method can keep the tie line's power fluctuation rate within a narrow range as much as possible, which can be used as a reference for a smart park's energy storage configuration.
