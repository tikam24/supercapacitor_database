After graphite oxide assisted the liquid phase shear exfoliation of attapulgite, the good dissociation and dispersion of attapulgite rod crystals are realized. Due to the spatial hindrance effect of attapulgite, which prevents the stacking of RGO sheets, the attapulgite-reduced graphene oxide three-dimensional porous hydrogel with abundant pore structure enables rapid transfer of electrolyte ions and exhibits good electrochemical performance and rate performance. The assembled flexible solid-state supercapacitor has a high operating voltage window and good flexibility and cycle stability. At a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2, it has an area specific capacitance of 127.33 mF cm-2. A series of solid-state supercapacitors can be used as the power supply for LED lights.
