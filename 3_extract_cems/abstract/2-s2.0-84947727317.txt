In this paper, a unified energy management scheme is proposed for renewable grid integrated systems with battery-supercapacitor hybrid storage. The intermittent nature of renewable-energy resources (RES), coupled with the unpredictable changes in the load, demands high-power and high-energy-density storage systems to coexist in today's microgrid environment. The proposed scheme dynamically changes the modes of renewable integrated systems based on the availability of RES power and changes in load as well. The participation of battery-supercapacitor storage to handle sudden/average changes in power surges results in fast dc link voltage regulation, effective energy management, and reduced current stress on battery. In addition, the proposed energy management scheme enables the real power transfer along with ancillary services such as current harmonic mitigation, reactive power support, and power factor improvement at the point of common coupling. The proposed scheme is validated through both simulation and experimental studies.
