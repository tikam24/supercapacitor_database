In this paper, we report a novel and facile structure of graphene aerogel dispersed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) loaded with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8). ZIF-8 was well intertwined by CNTs and this interconnecting composite framework was dispersed in the aerogel matrix. This continuous interconnected network enhanced the conductivity of ZIF-8 while the porous structure of ZIF-8 facilitated fast mass transport of electrolytes to all the electrochemical active materials. The obtained aerogel electrode delivered high area capacitance of 961 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 according to galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement. This facile structure of graphene aerogel may promote the direct use of MOFs as electrodes in the field of energy storage.
