The negative effect of low temperature on the capacitive behavior of MnO2 nanorods in 4 M KOH is studied by cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance techniques. The results show the discharge specific capacitance reduces from 270 to 80 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 as the temperature decreases from 20 to -20 C due to the faded mass transportation and charge transfer processes at low temperature. After introducing p-phenylenediamine (PPD) in the electrolyte, the specific capacitance reaches to 156 F g-1 at 2 A g-1. The improvement on low-temperature capacitance is thought to come from the synergic effect of PPD and MnO2 by combining two pseudocapacitance charge-storage mechanisms taking place in the electrode and electrolyte together.
