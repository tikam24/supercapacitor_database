FIB-SEM, XPS, TOF-SIMS and electrochemical methods have been used for the characterisation of physical properties and chemical composition of microporous carbide derived carbon electrodes, prepared from TiC at 950 °C (noted as TiC-CDC) after 40000 charge/discharge cycles. Changes in surface chemical composition of TiC-CDC electrodes, includes partial contamination with reaction intermediates (F2, CHO-, CN-, organic radicals), and Al current collectors, like partial dissolution of Al from positively charged electrode and deposition of Al onto the negatively charged TiC-CDC electrode surface, have been analysed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
