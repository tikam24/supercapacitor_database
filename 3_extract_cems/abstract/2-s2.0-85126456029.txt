This paper investigates a general description of a hybrid energy hub (HEH) including multiple energy carriers, such as electricity, hydrogen gas, and heating. The real hybrid energy hub model is based on a conceptual approach for the inclusion of distributed resources. Couplings between the different energy carriers are regarded explicitly, enabling investigations in power and energy flow. The model consists in a smart microgrid with multiple and hybrid energy sources, storages and loads, including electric vehicles charging stations and hydrogen, completely controlled and monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition platform (SCADA). All the components communicate by an open protocol to the main control for management, analysis and diagnostic. The completely open and flexible structure makes this platform ideal for the conception, simulation and experimental development of innovative systems in the field of microgrids and hybrid energy systems.
