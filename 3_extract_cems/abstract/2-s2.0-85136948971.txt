In our modern society, supercapacitors, in combination with batteries, are one of the predominant technologies in energy storage systems. The increasing demand for portable electronic devices has expanded the research in identifying novel materials, advanced designs, and processing technologies to meet with the requirements for good mechanical stability, excellent electrochemical capability in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. Among the prevailing electrode materials investigated, environmentally friendly waste biomass carbon-based electrodes are recently gaining much research interest as supercapacitor electrodes owing to their immense electrochemical stability, versatility, and ease in fabrication. In this chapter, we aim to summarize the recent advancements in emerging agricultural waste biomass-based electrode supercapacitors. Moreover, this chapter reviews the future outlook for the improvement of biomass-based carbons electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
