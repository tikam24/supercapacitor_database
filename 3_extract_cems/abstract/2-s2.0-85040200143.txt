Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an effective spacer to prevent the re-stacking of graphene layers. However, the aggregation of CNTs always reduces the specific surface area of resulting CNT/graphene composites. Meanwhile, different pores always have different contributions to the specific capacitance. In this study, CNT/graphene composites with different porous structures are synthesized by co-reduction of oxidized CNTs and graphene oxide with different mixing ratios. With an optimized CNT content of 20%, the CNT/graphene composite shows 206 F gâˆ’1 in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte. It is found that pores larger than twice the size of electrolyte ions can make greater contributions to the specific capacitance.
