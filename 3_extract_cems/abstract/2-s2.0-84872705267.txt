The electrochemical properties of poly sodium 4-styrenesulfonate intercalated graphite oxide (PSSGO) have been investigated in a 1 M H 2SO4 electrolyte. We observed capacitor behavior at scan rate of 1-25 mV/s in a cyclic voltammetry. Specific capacitance obtained from galvanostatic charge and discharge measurements were 6 F/g to 102 F/g at 1 A/g to 0.1 A/g, respectively. The specific capacitance of PSSGO is relatively high compared to that of the precursor graphite oxide in which the specific capacitance was 11-20 F/g at 0.03 A/g. Capacitance retention was 73% after 3000 cycles, proving reliable cyclic stability up to 3000 cycles. Â© 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.
