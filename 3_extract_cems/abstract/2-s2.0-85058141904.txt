Particle extraction through liquid-liquid interface (PELLI) was used for the extraction of MnO2, Mn3O4, FeOOH and ZnO particles from an aqueous synthesis medium to the n-butanol phase. The benefits of PELLI were demonstrated by the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes, which showed good electrochemical performance at high active mass loadings. Octyl gallate (OG) was found to be an efficient and versatile extractor for the ceramic particles. The phase transfer of the particles resulted in reduced agglomeration, which allowed for improved electrolyte access to the particle surface and facilitated their mixing with conductive multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) additives. It was shown that OG is a promising extractor material for the fabrication of ceramic-ceramic, ceramic-metal and ceramic-MWCNT nanocomposites. The strong adsorption of OG on the particle surface involved bridging or chelating bidentate bonding of the catechol group to the metal atoms. The capacitive properties of FeOOH-MWCNT electrodes were tested in the negative potential window. MnO2-MWCNT and Mn3O4-MWCNT electrodes were investigated for charge storage in the positive potential window. The highest capacitance of 5.7 F cm−2 for positive electrodes was achieved using MnO2-MWCNT composites with active mass loading of 36 mg cm−2. The Mn3O4-MWCNT electrodes exhibited improved capacitance retention at high charge-discharge rates.
