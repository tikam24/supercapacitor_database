Fe3O4 supported on nitrogen-doped graphene was prepared by a facial one-pot hydrothermal method. The cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge and discharge, AC impedance and cycle times were tested in 1.0 mol/L Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The results of electrochemical measurements show that the Fe3O4 nanorings (NRs)/amine modified reduced grapheme oxide (NH2-RGO) composites have high capacitance, good conductivity, excellent ion diffusion behavior and strong stability. In neutral electrolyte, the specific capacitance measured under the current condition of 1.0 A/g was as high as 145 F/g, and the capacitance retention after the 1000-cycle constant-current charge-discharge test was 99.7%. Therefore, Fe3O4 NRs/NH2-RGO composites have a good prospect as supercapacitor electrodes.
