A kind of novel mesoporous, electrochemical active material, amorphous MnO 2 has been synthesized by an improved reduction reaction and using supramolecular as template. The synthesized sample was characterized physically by thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope (TEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement, respectively. Electrochemical characterization was performed using cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry in 2 mol/l KOH aqueous solution electrolyte. The results of BET and TEM analysis indicated that supramolecular template plays an important role in the process of big specific surface area mesoporous material forming. After sintering at 200 °C, the sample still remained an amorphous structure, and its specific capacitance reached 298.7 F/g and presented a very stable capacitance after 500 cycles. In addition, the electrochemical process, such as ion transfer and electrical condition, was also investigated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. © Springer-Verlag 2007.
