Hierarchical nanosheet-based NiMoO4 nanotubes were synthesized by a hydrothermal treatment and a subsequent in situ diffusion reaction method. The nanotubes with a high surface area of 128.5 m2 g-1 were composed of highly ordered ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of less than 10 nm. When used as electrodes in electrochemical capacitors, the hierarchical nanotubes exhibited excellent electrochemical performances. The specific capacitance of the hierarchical nanotubes was up to 864 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The results indicate that the hierarchical nanosheet-based NiMoO4 nanotubes are very promising for applications in energy storage and other electrochemical devices. Furthermore, the strategy presented here is facile, and may be expended as a typical method to synthesize other kinds of metal molybdate nanotubes.
