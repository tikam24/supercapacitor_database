Both transition-metal oxide and carbon-based nanocomposites play important roles in the electrochemical properties. The rational design of carbon-based transition-metal oxides could accelerate the electrochemical double layer and Faradaic redox reaction kinetics, which increases the electroactive sites in the supercapacitor applications. Here, we synthesized SnO2/MWCNT nanocomposite through a simple hydrothermal method and used it as electrode material for energy storage applications. The physiochemical characterization was tested by using various techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, and TEM. The SnO2/MWCNT electrode material delivered a maximum specific capacitance of 255 F/g at 2 A/g and 93% of capacitance retention after 1000 GCD cycles at 10 A gâˆ’1 in an alkaline medium.
