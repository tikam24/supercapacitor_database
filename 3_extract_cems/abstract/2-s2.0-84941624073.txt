High performance electrochemical double-layer (EDL) supercapacitor was fabricated with highly efficient electro-active electrode based on mesoporous carbon nanofibers (MCFs) materials. The prepared MCFs from dextrose as carbon source exhibited the high surface to volume ratio, large pore volume and high mesoporous nature. The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were carried out to investigate the capacitive and electrochemical behavior of fabricated EDL supercapacitor based on MCFs electrode. A reasonably high specific capacitance of 201 F/g at current density of 0.6 A/g was achieved by the fabricated EDL supercapacitor based on MCFs electrode. A relation of capacitive performance, specific surface area, accessible average pore size and current density was manifested to evaluate the impact of capacitance parameters. The fabricated EDL supercapacitor based on MCFs electrode attained the ultra high energy density of 54.7 W h/kg and reasonable power density of 0.842 kW/kg at the current density of 0.6 A/g. The fabricated EDL supercapacitor manifested an excellent stability by keeping about 88% of initial capacity after 1000 cycles.
