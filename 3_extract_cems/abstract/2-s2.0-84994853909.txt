A Genecon is an inexpensive hand-cranked dc electric generator. You can use it to charge a one-farad supercapacitor.1 If you stop cranking the handle, the capacitor will discharge, sending a current into the Genecon and thereby causing the handle to start turning as an electric motor. How does the current direction compare before and after you stop cranking the handle? How does the direction of the turning of the handle compare before and after you stop cranking the Genecon?
