Zirconium-based materials have emerged as momentous candidates for next-generation batteries and supercapacitors, owing to their distinctive chemical and physical properties. For instance, garnet-Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 can be used as an electrolyte for solid-state lithium-ion batteries, which delivers high bulk lithium-ion conductivities in the range of 4.0×10 −4 S cm −1 at 20 °C. We provide a comprehensive review of up-to-date research progress in zirconium-based materials. The most recent advances in the field of zirconium-based electrodes, electrolytes, coatings, and separator materials for rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are summarized. Moreover, the electrochemical performances in terms of the specific capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability of zirconium-based materials are reported. Finally, we discuss the limitations and challenges of zirconium-based energy storage materials, followed by their present status and prospects for future research. We believe that this Review will be helpful for researchers and scientists who are seeking promising materials for batteries and supercapacitors.
