Mn2O3/MnCO3 microcubes (MCs) are prepared using a hydrothermal method on stainless steel substrate as a current collector by a binder-free approach. The effect of hydrothermal reaction parameters (i.e., reaction time, reaction temperature, and calcination temperature) on structural, morphological, and electrochemical supercapacitor performance of Mn2O3/MnCO3 MCs is investigated. The supercapacitor study confirmed that the Mn2O3/MnCO3 MCs with reaction time 6 h, reaction temperature 120 °C, and calcination temperature 400 °C exhibits 265.7 F g−1 specific capacitance at 0.4 mA cm−2 current density. In addition, it offers excellent capacity retention of 111.1% after 10000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. Such low-cost synthesis, excellent cyclic stability MCs are favorable for energy storage devices.
