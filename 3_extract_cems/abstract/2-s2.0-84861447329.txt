1D hierarchical tubular MnO 2 nanostructures have been prepared through a facile hydrothermal method using carbon nanofibres (CNFs) as sacrificial template. The morphology of MnO 2 nanostructures can be adjusted by changing the reaction time or annealing process. Polycrystalline MnO 2 nanotubes are formed with a short reaction time (e.g., 10 min) while hierarchical tubular MnO 2 nanostructures composed of assembled nanosheets are obtained at longer reaction times (>45 min). The polycrystalline MnO 2 nanotubes can be further converted to porous nanobelts and sponge-like nanowires by annealing in air. Among all the types of MnO 2 nanostructures prepared, tubular MnO 2 nanostructures composed of assembled nanosheets show optimized charge storage performance when tested as supercapacitor electrodes, for example, delivering an power density of 13.33 kW•kg 1 and a energy density of 21.1 Wh•kg 1 with a long cycling life over 3000 cycles, which is mainly related to their features of large specific surface area and optimized charge transfer pathway. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
