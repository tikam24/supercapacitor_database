The following paper encompasses a simple yet novel and robust control strategy to mitigate the adverse effects of Pulsed Power Loads (PPL) in the naval shipboard comprising of AC/DC micro grid. The control strategy is optimally designed for a carefully crafted AC/DC Hybrid infrastructure consisting of Photo-Voltaic (PV) and Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) consisting of battery and supercapacitor(SC). The promising nature of the control lies in the fact that any power surge in the DC bus is transiently handled by the super-capacitor owing to high power density whereas the battery ramps at a rate slower than its HESS counterpart. The uncompromising property of the control lies in the fact that it has been taken to account for the battery and the SC dynamics, thus it enhances the lifetime of the battery in addition to it reduces the maintenance costs of the battery. Above all the reliability of the power is further ensured by taking into account a gas powered generator which comes into play when the PV power falls short at the DC bus. The above said philosophy is validated in MATLAB/Simulink with the proper justifications.
