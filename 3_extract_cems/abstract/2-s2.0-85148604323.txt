Supercapacitors are considered as important energy conversion and storage devices, and one-dimensional carbon nanofibers derived from electrospinning have been widely applied for supercapacitor electrode materials. The integration of carbon and metal hydroxide materials has become particularly important in order to pursue their higher electrochemical properties. In this paper, a one-dimensional core-shell electrode with Ni(OH)2 as shell and carbon nanofibers as core (Ni/CNFs@Ni(OH)2) was fabricated by electrospinning, high-temperature carbonization and hydrothermal synthesis. This electrode exhibited high energy storage performance (785 F g−1 (1 A g−1)), good coulombic efficiency and cycling stability. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled with activated carbons as negative electrode and Ni/CNFs@Ni(OH)2 as positive electrode demonstrated a good energy storage performance (62.5 F g−1 (1.6 V)). Meanwhile, this ASC displayed a significant energy density of 22.2 Wh kg−1 at 800 W kg−1 and an outstanding rate capability, indicating that Ni/CNFs@Ni(OH)2 had a high potential application value in supercapacitors.
