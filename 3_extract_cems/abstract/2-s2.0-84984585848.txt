Polythiophene incorporated carbon materials have sought huge attention due to various improved electrochemical properties including enhanced electrical conductivity. Our work includes the synthesis of polythiophene (PTP)-multi-wallcarbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via in-situ polymerization method. The homogeneous distribution of MWCNT in PTP was confirmed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM). Examination of the specimen using X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform-Infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the composite formation. Other electrochemical characterizations like electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV)of the PTP-MWCNT composite affirmed that incorporation of MWCNT improves the electrochemical properties of neat PTP including a significant increase in the capacitance. Hence making PTP-MWCNT isa better material for supercapacitor application than neat PTP.
