In this study, dicobalt tetrasulfide (NiCo2S4) nanoneedles were successfully synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method on nickel foam. A layer of polypyrrole (PPy) was further wrapped on the surface of the NiCo2S4 nanoneedles by in-situ polymerization. The obtained NiCo2S4@PPy composite was investigated for supercapacitor applications, which exhibited a capacitance of 1842.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor device fabricated with an activated carbon negative electrode and NiCo2S4@PPy positive electrodes exhibited an energy density of 41.2 Wh kg−1 at 402.2 W kg−1 with a high charge–discharge cycling stability (92.8% after 5000 cycles). These results demonstrate that NiCo2S4@PPy electrodes have broad application prospects as energy storage electrode materials.
