Electrolytes in modern electrochemical power sources are based on the usage of aprotic highly polar solvents. We have to keep in mind, that lithium ion battery (LIBs), sodium ion batteries (SIBs) and electrochemical supercapacitors (SC) cannot work without solutions of corresponding ionic compounds in them. LIBs use standard lithium salt electrolyte 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DMC. The goal was to find sodium salt electrolyte(s) with electric conductivity values similar to lithium salt electrolytes. In this study the electric conductivity of 288 different samples of lithium salts (LiCIO4, LiBF4, and LiPF6) electrolytes in different concentrations, sodium salts (NaC104, NaBF4 and NaPF6) electrolytes in different concentrations and fluorinated salts ((C2H5)4N(BF4) and (CH3)4N(BF4)) electrolytes in different concentrations was measured. The electric conductivity and the electrochemical behaviour of the electrolyte samples were measured at a lab room temperature using impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and linear voltammetry (LSV) measurement methods.
