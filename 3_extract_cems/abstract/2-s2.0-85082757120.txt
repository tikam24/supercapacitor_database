The randomness and volatility of wind energy bring great challenges to wind power grid-connected. The hybrid energy storage technology based on electrolysis cell hydrogen production and super capacitor has become an effective way to stabilize wind power fluctuations. Based on the establishment of the grid-type wind-hydrogen coupling system working characteristic constraint and the minimum initial investment cost of the hybrid energy storage system, an alkaline electrolytic cell-super capacitor hybrid storage based on low-pass filtering-fluctuation observation is proposed. The method can be configured, and a hybrid energy storage coordinated control strategy based on the super capacitor SOC (state of charge) is developed. The case study results show that the hybrid energy storage system configuration method and control strategy proposed in this paper are effective, which can reduce the fluctuation of wind power grid-connected power to meet the grid connection standard.
