Electric Vehicles represent one of the key technologies to reduce CO2 emissions; their effective potential in real world driving conditions strongly depends on the performance of their Energy Management System. Range anxiety is an obstacle to the acceptance of electric vehicles caused by driver’s uncertainty regarding their vehicle’s state of charge and the energy required to reach their destination. Another one of the shortcomings of Electric Vehicle technologies is the high cost of batteries. Any enhancement in such points will make Electric Vehicles a well-built competitor for IC engines. The material cost for the Zebra battery is much lower compared with lithium batteries. In addition the cycle life better than 1000 cycles in zebra battery. Supercapacitors are one of the major components which play vital role in energy storage area. It also reduces the stress to batteries. The Multiple sources are modeled and analyzed by connecting the supercapacitor in parallel with ZEBRA battery. The combination shown was much cost effectives and range reassurance with addition battery maximum power demand will be reduced and also the internal power losses get minimized. The model is done by MATLAB®/Simulink® environment and the output results had been analyzed for the different vehicles input parameters. The results are consolidated based on the range of vehicle and State of charge of the battery. The main objective of this paper is to develop standard operating procedure for the design, simulation and consolidated analysis of the Hybrid Electric Vehicles.
