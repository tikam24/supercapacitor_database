To achieve highly efficient energy storage and conversion in electrochemical energy devices, the research of rationally designed method is crucial to improve performances of MXene-based catalysts and electrodes. Herein, an ultraviolet-assisted strategy is demonstrated to synthesize Ag@N-doping Ti3C2Tx (Ag@N-Ti3C2Tx) composites and N-promoted free electron number and the electron bound in Mxene are used to generally boost the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis and supercapacitor performance. The prepared Ag@N-Ti3C2Tx catalyst displays a high catalytic ability with an overpotentials of −153 mV and corresponding Tafel slopes (137.9 mV dec−1) lower than pristine Ti3C2Tx catalysts (−156.7 mV dec−1). Theoretical analysis and refined structural characterization indicate that the HER activity correlates well with the structural characteristic, active components, and electronic structure. As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the nano-Ag@N-Ti3C2Tx exhibits high specific capacity of 223.3 F g−1, outstanding capacity retention rate of about 68% from 1 to 10 A g−1 in rate performance and 96% capacity retention after 2000 cycles in stable performance. The synthetic approach offers a new vision for tuning the electrocatalytic activities of N-rich Ag@MXene materials.
