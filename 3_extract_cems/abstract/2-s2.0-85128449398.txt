Using a process-enhanced micro-impinging stream reactor (MISR) and a co-precipitation route, NiCo2S4 and NiCo2S4/rGO electrode materials were successfully prepared, respectively. Owing to its excellent micromixing performance, the MISR-prepared NiCo2S4/rGO composites had a smaller size and less agglomeration than the same composites prepared in a traditional stirred reactor (STR). The specific capacity of the MISR-prepared composites was as high as 198.0 mAhg −1 under the current density of 1 Ag −1. The cycling stability of the composites also improved significantly after being modified with reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and they displayed a fine cycling stability, which maintained a retention rate of 83.6% after 1000 cycles of charging and discharging.
