In this study, SnO2-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites (NCs) were synthesized via a hydrothermal method using tea extract as a reducing agent. The composition and structural properties of the NC were analysed using different techniques such as X-ray diffractometry, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The prepared NCs show good photocatalytic activity of 98% within 60 min towards methylene blue dye. Moreover, the prepared NCs exhibit good structural stability after being used in catalysis. Furthermore, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were used to examine the supercapacitor behaviour of the synthesized SnO2-rGO NCs. Due to the conducting nature of rGO, excellent electrochemical performance of the SnO2-rGO composite was observed. The combined effect of SnO2 and rGO in a binary composite leads to an enhanced specific capacitance of 296 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The SnO2-rGO NCs show advantages in terms of both catalytic and energy storage applications compared with their bare counterparts (SnO2 and rGO). Therefore, SnO2-rGO NCs may be a suitable material for use in environmental water cleaning purposes and energy storage devices due to their high efficiency and stability.
