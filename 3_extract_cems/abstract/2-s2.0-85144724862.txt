Energy devices with multifunctional applications, such as integrating two different energy devices, are emerging as promising strategies to elevate energy technology. This is, however, an alarming challenge that appeals to a single electrode material with multifunctional applications to minimize cost. Herein, a novel and cost-effective dual-functional self-powered aqueous electrochemical energy device (DAEED) was successfully assembled by integrating asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) and overall water splitting (OWS) devices using a unique P-doped NiMoO4/MoO2 (denoted NMO-MO-P) nanorods as the trifunctional electrode. NMO-MO-P exhibits excellent supercapacitor (SC) storage and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic ability owing to the tuning of the electronic structure synergistic interfacial and doping engineering. The as-prepared NMO-MO-P trifunctional electrode offers a 1.50 V operating NMO-based ASC device and a 1.50 V bifunctional NMO-based overall water splitting (OWS) in aqueous alkaline KOH solution. The similar operating potentials of both ASC and OWS devices allow the electrical energy stored by the NMO-based ASC device to simultaneously and in a self-powered way generate H2 and O2 from the as-assembled DAEED. This present work creates more opportunities towards achieving cost-effective EEDs technology.
