This paper presents the hybrid electric vehicle and it's characteristics in standardized European driving schedule. The results are obtained through the mathematical model and simulation of the driving characteristics for hybrid electric drive which uses super-capacitor as energy storage unit. This work is part of the experimental working stand for electric and hybrid car drive research, which was developed in the research Centre Josef Bozek at the Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague.
