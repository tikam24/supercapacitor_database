Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as a novel electrode material in terms of energy storage and conversion, owning to their stable porous architectures and exceptionally specific surface area. In this study, we have synthesized Ni-MOF and bimetallic Zn/Ni-MOF via a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Comparing with the pure Ni-MOF, the as-prepared Zn/Ni-MOF exhibits a superior energy storage capacity (878 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), better rate performance (536 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) and cycling stability (72% retention over 2500 charge/discharge cycles). In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on the Zn/Ni-MOF-1/NF//RGO shows a remarkable supercapacitive performance with the energy density of 30.51 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1, and a superior cycling stability of 80.3% retention over 5000 cycles.
