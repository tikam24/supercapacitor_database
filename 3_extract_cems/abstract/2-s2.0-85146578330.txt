Thin film multiwall carbon nanotubes-polythiophene (MWCNT-PTh) with ruthenium (Ru) and palladium (Pd) metals were synthesized by a simple method of liquid-liquid interface reaction technique (LLIRT) and used as a supercapacitor electrode. The prepared MWCNT-PTh-Ru/Pd composites exhibited a specific capacitance, specific energy, and specific power of 86.0 F/g, 10.75 Wh k/g, and 280.43 Wh k/g at 0.3 mV/s, respectively. Superior conductivity and fast charge and discharge rate were achieved due to the excellent mechanical reinforcement by the polymer and Ru/Pd oxides. The synergic effect was achieved by the layer-by-layer deposition with the Ru/Pd and the MWCNT-PTh which provides a strong mechanical and electronic connection between the current collector (MWCNT-Ru/Pd) and the active materials (polythiophene). Furthermore, the Ru/Pd nanostructures prevented the agglomeration of MWCNTs. MWCNT-PTh-Ru/Pd composite electrode cyclic voltammetry curves remain in a stable form even at high sweep rates, indicating excellent capacitance performance, good cycling stability, and rapid diffusion of electrolyte ions into the active electrode material with outstanding rate potential.
