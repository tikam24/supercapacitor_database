Ternary nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) has attracted more and more attention as a promising electrode material for high performance supercapacitors (SCs) due to its high theoretical capacity, unique crystal structure and excellent electronic conductivity. In this study, a template-free chemical co-precipitation method as a general strategy has been easily developed to fabricate mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanospheres with a high specific surface area of 216 m2 g-1, which can be further self-assembled into 3D frameworks. The key to the formation of mesoporous NiCo2O4 nanospheres with a desired pore-size distribution centered at âˆ¼2.4 nm is a unique preparation method assisted with sodium bicarbonate as a complex agent. When tested as electrode materials for SCs, the NiCo2O4 electrodes delivered excellent electrochemical performances with high specific capacitance (842 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1), superior cycling stability with no capacity decrease after 5000 cycles (103% initial capacity retention), and great rate performance at a 10-time current density increase (79.9% specific capacitance retention). Furthermore, as expected in a NiCo2O4-based asymmetric supercapacitor device, a superior energy density as high as 29.8 W h kg-1 at a power density of 159.4 W kg-1 could be achieved. These results highlight a general, eco-friendly, template-free strategy for the scale-up fabrication of a promising mesoporous NiCo2O4 electrode material for high-performance SC applications.
