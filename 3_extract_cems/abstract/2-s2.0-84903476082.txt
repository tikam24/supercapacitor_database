NiMoO4 nanowires (NWs) grown radially on carbon cloth with good electrochemical properties have been synthesized by a cost effective hydrothermal procedure. The NiMoO4 NWs supported on carbon cloth was directly used as integrated electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. The NiMoO4 NWs yielded high-capacitance performance with a high specific capacitance of 1.27Fcm-2 (1587Fg-1) at a charge and discharge current density of 5mAcm-2 and 0.76Fcm-2 (951Fg-1) at 30mAcm-2 with a good cycling ability (76.9% of the initial specific capacitance remains after 4000 cycles). An aqueous symmetric supercapacitor device with a maximum voltage of 1.7V has been fabricated, delivering both high energy density (70.7Whkg-1) and power density (16,000Wkg-1 at 14.1Whkg-1). These results show that the NiMoO4 nanowires with large surface area, combined with the flexible carbon cloth substrate can offer great promise for large-scale supercapacitor applications.
