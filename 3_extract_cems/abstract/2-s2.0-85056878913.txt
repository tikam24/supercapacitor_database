Graphene-based electrodes have continued to gain attention for application in lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). This work demonstrates the promising electrochemical performance of LICs with reduced graphene oxide-carbon nanotubes (rGO-CNT) electrodes prepared by electrostatic spray deposition (ESD). The rGO-CNT anode was pre- lithiated by direct contact method prior to the LIC assembly. The resulting rGO-CNT // lithiated rGO-CNT LIC system operated within 0.01 V to 4 V delivered a specific capacity up to 94.5 mAhg-1 at 0.1 Ag-1 The LIC also displayed 76.7 % capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 0.5 Ag-1. A maximum energy density of 170 WhKg-1 and maximum power density of 1385 Wkg-1 were obtained.
