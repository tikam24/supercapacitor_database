The exponential population growth and the escalating price of the petroleum products are forcing the present transportation system (TS) towards the electrified TS. In this paper, an electric based TS is presented, which utilizes a large capacity battery (LCB) to charge/discharge from/to the grid, to charge the city buses and also to charge the Electric Vehicles (EVs). The city buses consist of supercapacitors and the EVs consist of battery packs for energy storage purpose. The LCB acts as a load to the grid in off-peak hours along with EVs (i.e. LCB and EVs charges from the grid) and LCB alone acts as a source in peak hours (i.e. LCB discharges to the grid). The Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) takes care of charging/discharging of the LCB from/to the grid and an aggregator takes care of charging the EVs from LCB in off peak hours of the grid. This entire arrangement has been analyzed at a single city bus stop (CBS) in the Guwahati city TS network and verified. This system is clean and green in use, which helps in reducing the pollution created by TS in urban regions.
