The development of high-performance electrodes that increase the energy density of supercapacitors (SCs) (without compromising their power density) and have a wide temperature tolerance is crucial for the application of SCs in electric vehicles. Recent research has focused on the preparation of multicomponent materials to form electrodes with enhanced electrochemical properties. Herein, a siloxene–graphene (rGO) heterostructure electrode-based symmetric SC (SSC) is designed that delivers a high energy density (55.79 Wh kg−1) and maximum power density of 15 000 W kg−1. The fabricated siloxene–rGO SSC can operate over a wide temperature range from –15 to 80 °C, which makes them suitable for applications in automobiles. This study shows the practical applicability of siloxene–rGO SSC to drive an electric car as well as to capture the braking energy in a regenerative brake-electric vehicle prototype. This work opens new directions for evaluating the use of siloxene–rGO SSC as suitable energy devices in electric vehicles.
