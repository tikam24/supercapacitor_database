Conductive polymers (CPs) have been widely used as electrode materials in supercapacitors because of their facile synthesis, low cost, and high capacitance. However, their practical application in micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) has been hindered by the manufacturing complexity and dimensional limits due to their low processability, and the very poor cycle-life due to its volumetric change in the charge-discharge process. Here, we present CPs-based MSCs with a unique structure of polypyrrole (PPy)@Ag-wall interdigitated electrodes fabricated by combing micro-3D printing Ag-wall and electrochemical polymerization of PPy. Benefiting from the unique structure and effective interface of PPy@Ag-wall interdigitated electrodes, these all-solid-state MSCs (S < 0.25 cm2) offer an area capacitance (C/A) up to 90 mF cm−2, coupled with a long cycle-life (capacitance remains 109 % after 10,000 cycles), great flexibility (capacitance remains 95 % after bending for 1000 times), and a very low interfacial resistance (2.88 Ω). In conclusion, this unique design of the PPy@Ag-wall interdigitated electrode structure not only achieves the formation of the arbitrary structure of CPs, but also greatly improves its cycle-life, promoting the CPs-based MSCs for the future miniature energy storage device.
