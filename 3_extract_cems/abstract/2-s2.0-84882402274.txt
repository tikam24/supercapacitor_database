Analytical derivation of constant power loaded supercapacitor behavior is presented in the paper. Simple RC model based on manufacturer datasheet extracted parameters is employed. Power and energy related figures of merit are obtained from the derived expressions and compared to the datasheet provided values. It is revealed that some of the performance characteristics provided in most of the datasheets are theoretical and cannot be achieved in practice. The process of a realistic Ragone plot derivation based on the proposed method is described in the paper as well. It is shown that the lower limit of supercapacitor voltage imposes certain limits on power and energy capabilities of the device. Extended simulation and experimental results are provided in order to reinforce the proposed method and justify the selected RC model for describing the supercapacitor performance. By appropriate comparison of simulations and experiments it is proven that the selected model, while being oversimplified and low order, may be used to predict supercapacitor behavior with reasonable accuracy to perform at least an initial design.
