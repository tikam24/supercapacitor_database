This paper presents the concept of electronic battery (e-Battery) for energy storage systems. The proposed e-Battery is a combination of ultra capacitor bank and power electronic converters. This paper looks at issues related to chemical batteries and proposes the concept of an e-Battery. The proposed e-Battery overcomes many of the drawbacks of a conventional chemical battery. The control strategy developed for the closed loop operation of the proposed e-Battery is also presented in this paper. The performance of the proposed e-Battery is verified through detailed time domain simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC. A hardware prototype is built to validate the performance of the proposed e-Battery experimentally.
