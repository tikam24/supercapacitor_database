Purpose: Effect of ultrasonic irradiation on change of electron structure as well as fractal one of activated carbons and motivation that these changes are most responsible for the improvement of functional parameters in supercapacitors, were the aim of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: Experimental studies were carried out by means of impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, X-Ray diffraction, small angle X-Ray diffraction, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy, IR-spectroscopy, Micro-Raman spectroscopy and galvanostatic cycling methods. Findings: Ultrasonic modification of carbon is effective method to increase the specific capacitance as well as power of carbon-based supercapacitors. Changes of parameters of double electric layer are tightly related with change of fractal dimension and allow increasing the percolate mobility of charge carries. Research limitations/implications: This research is a complete and accomplished work. Practical implications: Carbon materials, modified by ultrasonic irradiation, can be used as promising electrode materials in energy storage devices of new generation. Originality/value: This work is of urgent importance for studying of physical and chemical processes in energy storage systems. It is shown that method of ultrasonic irradiation is highly effective for modification of carbon-based materials as electrodes in supercapacitors. Â© 2012 International OCSCO World Press.
