Due to metal–organic framework (MOF) has special internal structure characteristics, it has been regarded as excellent templates for preparing electrode materials. Here, nanorods Ni-MOF-74 derived NiSe nanoparticles wrapped by reduced graphite oxide (RGO) has been successfully prepared through a selenization strategy. The introduction of RGO not only improves the electrical conductivity and stability but also enhances the interfacial interaction and transport kinetics for both ions and electrons between supercapacitor electrodes. Indeed, the NiSe@RGO composites electrode for supercapacitors shows an improved electrochemical performance with specific capacity of 781C g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 90% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor NiSe@RGO//AC device is assembled with NiSe@RGO composites as the positive electrode, delivering energy density of 52.8 Wh kg−1 at power density of 930 W kg−1 and outstanding long-term cycling retention (98 % of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1). Therefore, the NiSe@RGO composites could be served as an excellent potential electrode material for further applications of high-performance supercapacitors.
