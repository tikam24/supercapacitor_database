Oxygen-deficient CC−WO3−x nanoplates and hollow microspheres on carbon fabrics cloth were synthesized utilizing a simple solvent-thermal route. The obtained CC−WO3−x possess an improved electronic conductivity because of the oxygen-deficient effect and a higher specific surface area due to the unique nano-structural features. The CC−WO3−x exhibits a high capacitance of 804 F g−1, excellent rate performance (>80 %) while the current density is enhanced five-fold and superior cycling stability by retaining 109.5 % after 14000 cycles at 30 mV s−1. In addition, an asymmetric electrochemical capacitor (ASC) reveals a competitive energy storage performance (50.7 W h kg−1 at 1.3 KW kg−1). The reasons for its good electrochemical property are that the novel hybrid nanoplates and hollow microspheres structure with oxygen-deficient and binder-free, which is conducive to exposing more electroactive sites and enhancing electrical conductivity, therefore accelerating ion diffusion, facilitating charge transportation, and promoting the capacitive contribution for rapid charge-discharge kinetics synchronously.The route is anticipated to reveal a new way to prepare hybrid nanostructure with oxygen-deficient and binder-free metal oxide-based electrode material.
