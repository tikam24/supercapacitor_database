Common fabrication techniques typically require multiple and complex MEMS processing steps to create 3D electrode architectures. Here we report on the use of Additive Fabrication metal printing based on Selective Laser Melting (SLM) technology to produce 3D titanium interdigitated electrodes. This was used as a platform to deposit polypyrrole and the resultant structure was evaluated for use as a capacitive electrode. We also demonstrate a solid-state interdigitated supercapacitor using a poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-H3PO4 polymer electrolyte. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
