This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) used to ensure an efficient power split, in a dual-source Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) based on full-active parallel topology. The proposed HESS is used to provide energy for a pure electric vehicle (P-EV), based on a Li-ion battery and Supercapacitor (SC). The construction and organization of the studied system, was conducted using the Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) approach. The main objective of this work, is to assure the regenerative braking control and reduce the impact of the battery degradation factors through the SC integration. The evaluation of the proposed architecture and EMS was performed through simulation, using Matlab/Simulink models under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).
