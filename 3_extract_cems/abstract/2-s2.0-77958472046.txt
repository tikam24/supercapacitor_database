Supercapacitors offer a solution for supplementing and increasing battery life by fulfilling peak power demands in automatic meter reader (AMR) applications. The supercapacitor is charged from the primary power supply in these applications, but functions as a backup power source when the primary source fails or peak power has to be provided. Supercapacitors also work in parallel with batteries for applications that require constant low power discharge for continual function and a pulse power for peak loads. Supercapacitors solve another big challenge encountered by designers of battery-powered AMR circuits due to voltage drop in their system designs in addition to benefiting peak current demand performance. These capacitors also prevent large voltage swings by maintaining a fully charged state to act as a power reserve or to perform critical functions in the event of power loss in addition to satisfying peak power demands.
