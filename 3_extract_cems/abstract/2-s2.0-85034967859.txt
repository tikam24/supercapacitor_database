In this work, we report about melt- and wet-spinning of graphene nano-composite fibres with different polymer matrix materials. In case of melt-spinning, the development of a textile supercapacitor with melt-spun polyamide-6 yarns including 1 wt% of graphene is reported. Melt spinning of graphene/polyamide-6 is performed at pilot scale leading with winding velocities of 1,400 m/min. Subsequently, the graphene/polyamide-6 yarns are processed to woven fabrics and transferred into a supercapacitor. Electrical capacities of 1.14 and 1.82 mF/g are achieved for atlas- and plane-weave woven fabrics. In case of wet-spinning, trials with graphene and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and the investigation of the obtained fibres' properties are reported. By incorporation of 10 wt% of graphene into the polymer material, an increase of the tensile strength about a factor of 10 can be observed. Furthermore, after-treatment steps of drying and drawing are investigated.
