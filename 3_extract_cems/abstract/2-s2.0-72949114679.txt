This paper deals with the lifetime of supercapacitors used in transportation. Increasing onboard electrical devices require adapted storage elements like supercapacitors to supply all electrical systems. Reliability and lifetime are two major factors for electrical storage system. Based on accelerated ageing, some supercapacitors have been studied using a dedicated test bench. Temperature, voltage, current and power cycling are monitored since supercapacitor ageing are affected by these parameters. An ageing law suitable for a transport application is obtained and discussed.
