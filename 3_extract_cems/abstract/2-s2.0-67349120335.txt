An electronic power transformer (EPT) with supercapacitors storage energy system is proposed in this paper. The proposed system consists of an EPT, a supercapacitor bank and a bidirectional dc-dc converter. The supercapacitor bank is connected to the dc link in EPT through the dc-dc converter. The advantage of the proposed system over the EPT is to provide added ability to ride voltage momentary interruptions, as well as the voltage sags and voltage swells. Furthermore, the main circuit parameters design and controller design of proposed system are presented in detail. The performance of proposed system is analyzed using simulations based on MATLAB/SIMULINK, and the proposed system is also implemented in laboratory based on DSP TMS320F2812. Simulation and experimental results have verified the ability of the proposed system and the validity of the design. Crown Copyright Â© 2009.
