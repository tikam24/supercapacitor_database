The energy storage unit of More Electric Aircraft (MEA) comprises of the combination of battery and super-capacitor to handle power imbalances. This energy storage unit charges when there is excessive power is available and can be utilized during power deficiency at the node. Generally, the batteries are used to regulate the DC bus voltage. The preferred batteries i.e. lithium-ion, lead acid etc. have low power density and limited no. of charging and discharging cycles. The quick burst of power imposes a stress on the battery and reduces its life. The super capacitor has high energy density and therefore it can rapidly supply the quick bursts of demanded power. The power quality of distribution system with ultra-capacitor is improved even in the presence of quick power bursts. This paper review major control schemes to utilize the combination of the battery and super capacitor (SC). This paper particularly focuses on the control schemes and the corresponding responses. The paper also summarizes the situations and scenarios in which the reviewed control strategies are incorporated. The meaningful simulation results are shown and comparisons are made to verify the effectiveness of reviewed control schemes.
