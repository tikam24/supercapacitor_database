In order to obtain supercapacitor materials with high specific capacitance and good cycle life, The 3D-Fiberbased graphene (3D G) was prepared with a two-step carbonation by watermeon flesh as carbon source. At last CeO2-MnO/3D G composite was prepared with the Hydrothermal method. The results show thatthe 3D G exhibits an excellent BET-surface area of 332 m2路g-1 due to the good spatial structure. CeO2-MnO/3D G composite are featured with a 3D conductive network structure, and metal oxide particles between the graphene sheets grow evenly, with about 10 nm in diameter. The electrochemical testing results show that the CeO2-MnO/3D G composite exhibit an excellent capacitance of 308.5 F路g-1 with the current density of 1 A路g-1, MnO:CeO2=4:1 and composite load at 80% in 0.5 mol路L-1 Na2SO4 solution. Meanwhile, the CeO2-MnO/3D G composite also show outstanding cycling stability with 95.5% of the capacitance retention after 1000 cycles of charge/discharge. The high electrochemical properties of the CeO2-MnO/3D G composite is mainly attributed to the synergy of two metal oxide composite load with graphene.
