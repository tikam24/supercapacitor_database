WO3 nanorods as electrode material are synthesized using the hydrothermal method. X-ray Diffraction pattern confirmed the pure phase development of as-prepared material. Further, the shape and size of the particles of synthesized samples are explored by SEM, and FTIR spectra confirmed the functional groups and bonding vibrations associated with the synthesized sample. The electrochemical study was done using the three-electrode system in different aqueous electrolytes i.e. H2SO4, KNO3 and KOH. The maximum specific capacitance of 741 F/g at 1 mA is achieved in the H2SO4 electrolyte. Trassati and Dunn methods were employed which revealed the contribution of capacitive and diffusion currents.
