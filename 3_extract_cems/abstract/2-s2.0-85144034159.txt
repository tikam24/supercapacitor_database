The installation of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) are now fast increasing, reducing fossil fuel use. Due to the fact that RESs are typically grid-connected to the power-system via grid following fast-response voltage source converters, the amount of mechanical inertia synchronised in the power system is decreasing. As a result, the power system will be more sensitive to load and generation variations, causing larger frequency fluctuations which, in turn, could result in undesirable load-shedding, or large-scale blackouts. This paper presents a performance evaluation of a concept of emulating virtual inertia via power-electronics and a energy storage unit in terms of a supercapacitor connected to the DC-bus. Simulation and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed combination of frequency estimation and frequency derivative estimation. The paper shows the feasibility of using virtual inertia and how it could be implemented.
