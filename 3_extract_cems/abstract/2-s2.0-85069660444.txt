Transition metal sulfides (TMS) are a promising pseudocapacitive electrode materials for supercapacitors as their high theoretical capacitance and electrochemical activity. However, its extensive application is limited due to relative unfavorable nanostructure and low surface reactivity. Herein, a hierarchical core-branch electrode material composed of Zn substituted nickel cobalt sulfides nanosheets branched on the NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays combining with conductive carbon cloth (denoted as CC/NiCo2S4@Zn–Ni–Co–S NSAs) is successfully fabricated as excellent cathode for asymmetric supercapacitors. Remarkably, the integration of componental and structural advantages endows the as-prepared CC/NiCo2S4@Zn–Ni–Co–S electrode with better electrochemical performance including ultrahigh specific capacitance (1201 C g−1/2668 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate capability (704 C g−1/1564 F g−1 at 50 A g−1) and remarkable cycling stability. More importantly, the assembled CC/NiCo2S4@Zn–Ni–Co–S//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor operates in a high voltage window of 1.7 V with a superior energy density of 60.2 W h kg−1 at power density of 849.9 W kg−1 and long-term cycling stability with 91.2% retention after 10 000 cycles. This strategy provides a facile, cost-effective solution to the rational fabricate high performance electrode materials for energy storage devices.
