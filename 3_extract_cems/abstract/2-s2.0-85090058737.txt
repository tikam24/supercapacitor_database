The construction of advanced micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with both wide working-voltage and high energy density is promising but still challenging. In this work, a series of nitrogen-doped, cross-coupled micro-mesoporous carbon–metal networks (N-STC/MxOy) is developed as robust additives to 3D printing inks for MSCs fabrication. Taking the N-STC/Fe2O3 nanocomposite as an example, both experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that the well-developed hierarchical networks with abundantly decorated ultrafine Fe2O3 nanoparticles not only significantly facilitate the ion adsorption at its three-phase boundaries (Fe2O3, N-STC, and electrolyte), but also greatly favor ionic diffusion/transport with shortened pathways. Consequently, the as-prepared N-STC/Fe2O3 electrode delivers a high gravimetric capacitance (267 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1) and outstanding stability in a liquid-electrolyte-based symmetric device, as well as a record-high energy density of 114 Wh kg−1 for an asymmetric supercapacitor. Particularly, the gravimetric capacitance of the ionogel-based quasi-solid-state MSCs by 3D printing reaches 377 F g−1 and the device can operate under a wide temperature range (−10 to 60 °C).
