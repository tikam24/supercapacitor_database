In this article, a new dc-dc multisource converter configuration-based grid-interactive microgrid consisting of photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid energy storage (HES) is proposed. Control structure along with power sharing scheme to operate the system under various operating modes, such as: 1) grid-connected mode; 2) islanded mode; 3) state of charge of battery (SoC-{b}) less than or greater than specified limits; and 4) operating renewable sources (PV and wind) at maximum power point, is presented. The detailed analysis, modeling, and design of the proposed configuration and control structure are presented. The key highlights of the proposed configuration are: 1) low component count; 2) voltage boosting, voltage regulation of supercapacitor and power-sharing among the battery and supercapacitor are inherent; and 3) simple control structure with a reduced number of sensors. Supercapacitor-battery-based HES is interfaced which effectively handle the power fluctuations due to the wind, PV, and sudden load disturbances. Integration of supercapacitor to respond to high-frequency fluctuations increases the lifetime of battery storage and reduces the sizing of the storage unit. The proposed system is verified through digital simulation and experimental results.
