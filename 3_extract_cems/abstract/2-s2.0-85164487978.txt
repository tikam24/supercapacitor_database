In this experiment, polyaniline was doped with different concentrations of hydrochloric acid, and polyaniline was grown on the PVA/Paam composite multi-network hydrogel by in-situ polymerization. Chemical properties, pressure sensitive properties and photosensitive properties of the composite multi-network hydrogel at the optimal doping concentration were investigated. The polyaniline powder was characterized by FT-IR spectrum, UV spectrum, SEM and XRD. The performance of the composite multi-network hydrogel was tested by charge-discharge test, cyclic voltammetry test, chronoamperometry, potentiometric dissolution analysis method, and different wavelengths of monochromatic light irradiation. In the electrochemical test, it was determined that when the doping concentration of hydrochloric acid was 0.5 mol/L, the electrochemical performance of the multi-network hydrogel supercapacitor was the best, the charging and discharging time was the longest, and the area specific capacitance was 412.5 mF/cm2. In the pressure sensitive performance test, I-T and V-T curves with obvious peaks were obtained, and the amplitude and period of the peak shape corresponded to the exercise intensity and frequency one-to-one. In the photosensitivity test, it was determined that the multi-network hydrogel had the best photosensitivity when doped with 0.35 mol/L hydrochloric acid. It shows that the prepared hydrogel has good electrochemical properties, pressure-sensitive properties and photosensitivity properties at the same time, and has broad prospects in the application of supercapacitors, photosensitive materials and sensors.
