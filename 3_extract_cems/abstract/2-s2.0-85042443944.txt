This work presents a novel urban transportation system based on supercapacitor driven electric vehicle. These electric vehicles will be charged at the bus stops located at a distance of 1-2 kilometres from each other. The bus stops have a large capacity flow batteries that are charged during off-peak hours of the grid. This reduces the stress on the grid during peak hours and drives the transportation system smoothly. Supercapacitor has high power density that makes it ideal for frequent start and stop type applications. Supercapacitor based electric vehicles are thus beneficial for dense city driven conditions. The additional advantage of the system is the integration of distributed solar power system into the power distribution network of a city. In this paper a conceptual idea is presented.
