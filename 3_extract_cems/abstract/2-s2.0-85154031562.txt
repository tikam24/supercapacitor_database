Two-dimensional metal carbides (MXene) have become promising candidates for fabricating the supercapacitors. Ti2CTx is more popular in the MXene family due to its lighter mass and excellent electrochemical properties. In this paper, multilayer Ti2CTx is synthesized via choosing the Al layer of etched Ti2AlC raw material. Under the condition of ultrasonic treatment, the as-prepared electrode based on few-layer Ti2CTx nanosheets possess high specific capacitance and strong rate ability. Compared with the etched Ti2CTx, the capacitance performance of ultrasonic Ti2CTx has been greatly improved, which the specific capacitance changes from the initial 133 F g−1 to 284 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the fabricated electrode remains 91% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles of constant current charge and discharge at 1 A g−1. This work demonstrates that the fabricated Ti2CTx electrode has excellent capacitive properties and promotes potential use in supercapacitors.
