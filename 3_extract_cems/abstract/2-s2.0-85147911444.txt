To solve the challenge of low efficiency and high operation cost caused by intermittent high-power charging in an energy storage tram, this work presents a collaborative power supply system with supercapacitor energy storage. The scheme can reduce the peak power of the transformer, therefore reducing the grid-side capacity and improving the efficiency. However, there is a lack of quantitative analysis on the performance improvement of the solution. The energy efficiency models of critical components are proposed to evaluate the efficiency of the system, and energy efficiency optimization is conducted. Taking an operational tram line as an example, the improved charging efficiency and reduced operating costs are derived. Further, the ground energy storage capacity is designed and implemented. The measured data demonstrates that the energy efficiency of the optimized charging system is improved, which proves its effectiveness and practicability.
