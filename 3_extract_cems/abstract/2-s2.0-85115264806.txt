For successful integration of renewables with the existing power systems, energy storage systems are increasingly being used. This paper proposes the development of a discrete mode control strategy for integrating a small rating supercapacitor energy storage (SCS) into a wind embedded multi-area power system for cost effective and improved AGC. Global optimisation toolbox (MATLAB) is used to make the primary control loop of SCS to mimic a first order lag relation. This is purposely done for achieving a dual objective. On one hand SCS is being forced to follow faithfully the command from the master controller and on the other hand discrete version of the representative model of inner control loop is utilised for a control design procedure which while considerably reducing the frequency and tie-power deviations, ensures constrained operation of SCS. To virtually validate the proposed scheme, relevant modelling issues are addressed and a simulation platform is developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment.
