As a new type of smart device, soft actuators have received great attention due to their simple structure, fast response, and widely using. But so far, most of the soft actuators are driven by a single stimulus. Also, soft actuators with only a function of actuation can no longer meet the demands of versatile applications. Hence, a multi-functional and integrated actuator based on the composites of polyaniline@carbon nanotube–cellulose nanofiber (PANI@CNT–CNF) is proposed. As served as a component of soft actuators, the PANI@CNT–CNF/polymer actuator can respond to humidity and light with rapid and repeatable bending motions. The PANI@CNT–CNF/polymer actuator can be applied in biomimetic applications, such as humidity-driven flowers, and light-driven worms. Further, an integrated actuator that can simultaneously use the functions of actuation and energy storage is designed and proposed. The integrated actuator can be driven by near-infrared light with a maximum bending angle of 45°. Besides that, the capacitance of the integrated actuator is 39.8 mF demonstrating the ability of energy storage. Finally, the integrated actuator is applied to simultaneously bend and power light-emitting diode lights, showing the advance of the integrated actuator. We believe that the integrated actuators with a function of energy storage can be applied to various complex environments and have prospects for applications in smart devices.
