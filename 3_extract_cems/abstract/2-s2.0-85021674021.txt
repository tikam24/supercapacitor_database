A self-discharge estimation procedure for such an energy storage device as a pseudocapacitor has been developed. The electrode cyclic voltammogram analysis is involved. This procedure is based on the calculation of the energy irreversibly absorbed by an electrode as a result of transformation into heat or chemical energy related to the total energy transferred to the electrode. A single cycle time is considered. A number of model pseudocapacitive electrodes with different electrolytes have been tested according to this computational method. The high correlation coefficient (0.71) between the results obtained by this method and ones by direct potential drop measurement of the electrode in the open circuit is shown.
