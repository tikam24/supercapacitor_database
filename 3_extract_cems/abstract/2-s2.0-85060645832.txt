Graphene surface modification by heteroatom incorporation is an attractive strategy to construct flexible electrochemical capacitors. Herein, the steam-assistant heteroatoms of sulfur and phosphorus dual-doped graphene film (s-SPG) is fabricated via an ice-template and thermal-activation approach and they demonstrate an excellent pseudocapacitive behavior in flexible electrochemical capacitors. As probed by various microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, well-maintained porosity structure is formed during the freeze-drying and steam-activation treatment; the increased surface roughness is ascribed to heteroatoms doping by the formation of S- and P-containing functional groups as electrochemical active sites. A flexible device integrated by porous s-SPG film shows high pseudocapacitive behavior with high specific capacitance (169 F/g), rate capability (91.7%) and cyclic stability (92.5%). Even at the bend angle of 120Â°, no obvious change of specific capacitance is found indicating a good flexibility of s-SPG devices; the current study shows that s-SPG is a very promising electrode to realize the practical applications of all solid flexible supercapacitors.
