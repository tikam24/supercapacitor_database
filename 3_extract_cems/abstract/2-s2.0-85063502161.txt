Producing composite materials of carbon nanotubes and transition metal oxides is the most promising option for the development of next-generation electrochemical capacitors. Of great interest in this case is the method of electrophoretic deposition. AACVD-CNT and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O acted as initial components of the CNT/NiO composite, the latter also played the role of carbon nanotube surface charger. Several suspensions with AACVD-CNT, different in charger salt content were prepared. Eight deposition cycles were held with a duration of 0.5 minutes and a break of 5 minutes for drying. The voltage was 30 V, and the distance between the electrodes was 10 mm. Nickel foil was used as a substrate. The final samples of composite electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry to determine the optimal content of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in suspension. The best results were demonstrated by a sample obtained from a suspension with the charger salt content of 8 mg per 50 ml.
