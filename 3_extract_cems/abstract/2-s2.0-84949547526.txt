A sulfonated polyaniline (SPANI)/graphene nanocomposite has been fabricated as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The SPANI nanostructure that was uniformly embedded within the graphene network can effectively facilitate the charge transfer between graphene layers and improve the overall electrochemical performance. The as-synthesized nanocomposite has delivered high specific capacitance up to 262 F/g, excellent rate performance, and cycling stability with over 87% of capacitance retained after 10000 charge/discharge cycles.
