The composite hydrogel, composed of reduced graphene oxide and α-Fe2O3 fibres (rGO/α-Fe2O3), was successfully prepared by the hydrothermal procedure starting from GO and α-Fe2O3 nanofibres. According to the SEM and XRD results, α-Fe2O3 fibres are distributed between rGO sheets increasing the inter-sheet space. The rGO/α-Fe2O3 composite was tested as an active material in supercapacitor by means of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging/discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 0.5 mol dm –3 Na2SO4. The obtained results confirmed a positive effect of the α-Fe2O3 addition on capacitive properties. Improved capacitive properties of the composite make this material suitable for supercapacitor application.
