The light rail vehicles (commonly known as tramways or lightly laid railways) offer environmental advantages andhave evoked an impressive attraction. The hybrid energy-storage systems efficiently supply energy for the light rail vehiclesduring the travel. This study implements and analyses an ultracapacitor charger in hybrid energy-storage system for electricvehicle applications. Moreover, an ultracapacitor charger based on a full-bridge DC DC converter that utilises a synchronousrectification technique and high charging-current capability is presented. The proposed converter's current-doubler synchronousrectification reduces the secondary circulating current and recycles the energy of the leakage current to the power-source leadto further increase conversion efficiency. A prototype of this ultracapacitor charger, with an input voltage of 380 V and an outputvoltage of 14.6 V, has been implemented; the measured efficiency is 92.1% at a full load of 1 kW. In addition, the experimentalresults show the highest efficiency is 93.4% at an output power of 600 W. Furthermore, an ultracapacitor of 250 F is charged bythe presented converter with a charging current of 65 A, and experimental waveforms illustrate that the charging time of theultracapacitor voltage from 0 to 14.6 V is within 1 min.
