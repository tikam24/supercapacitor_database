Core–shell nanoparticles have much potential and exciting application in the supercapacitors field. The construction of unique core–shell nanostructures plays an important role in the efficient enhancement of the rate capacity and the stability of this material. The core–shell structure of the FeOOH@MnO2 synthesis procedures involves two main steps. Firstly, the spindle FeOOH was received by the hydrolysis of Fe3+. Then, Manganese sulfate monohydrate reacted with Potassium permanganate and forms Manganese dioxide crystal nucleus, which gradually grew into manganese dioxide nanosheets on the surface of FeOOH and finally obtain core–shell FeOOH@MnO2. The as-prepared FeOOH@MnO2 nanomaterials were used as capacitive materials and showed an excellent capacitance.
