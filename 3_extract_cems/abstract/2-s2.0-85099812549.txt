The sustainable biomass-derived porous carbon is promising in electrochemical energy storage devices because of its fascinating features. In this work, porous carbon materials are prepared from chinar fruit fluffs with a facile single-stage activation method by using phosphoric acid as the activation agent. By adjusting the preparation parameters (i.e., the dosage of phosphoric acid and calcination temperature), the optimal carbon (denoted as ACC-600-5.0) exhibits a mesopore-dominant hierarchical interconnected porous structure with high specific surface area (1758.5 m2 g−1). As the electrode material for three-electrode supercapacitors, ACC-600–5.0 displays a specific capacitance of 247.5 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 in 6.0 M KOH solution. Moreover, the ACC-600-5.0-based symmetric configuration shows an energy density of 21.99 Wh kg−1 at 400 W kg−1, which is still maintained as 17.33 Wh kg−1 at 8000 W kg−1. Also, the assembled two-electrode supercapacitor demonstrates a rate capability of 78.85% when the current density increases from 0.5 to 10.0 A g−1, as well as good cycling stability. This work offers a highly effective fabrication strategy for advanced carbon electrode materials from worthless or even harm biomass wastes for energy storage and conversion devices.
