The Sodium trivanadate thin films were successfully deposited by the cost-efficient spray pyrolysis technique on flexible stainless steel as substrates for the first time. The XRD and Raman analysis of the deposited thin film reveals the crystallinity and structural properties. SEM result unveils the morphology of the films. The chemical composition was determined by EDAX analysis. The XPS analysis of the film discloses the oxidation states of the vanadium present in the film. Supercapacitor studies were performed using a three-electrode setup in which 1M NaNO3 was used as an electrolyte throughout the study. Among the deposited films, the film annealed at 400 ËšC has an exceptional specific capacitance of around 255 F/g at a current density of 0.25 A/g. An asymmetric supercapacitor device has been fabricated for the better-performed film in three-electrode studies and it delivered a specific capacitance of 12.3 F/g at 0.25 A/g current density. Sodium-ion half cells were also constructed and tested for the same film. The cells obtained a capacity of 78 mAh/g at a high current density of 15 mA/g with a capacity retention of 80% even after 50 cycles. The contribution to the film's capacity comes from the pseudocapacitance-type behaviour of the thin film cathodes. The prepared additive and binder-free sodium trivanadate thin film electrodes could exhibit excellent Na-ion storage properties. Thus, the successful assembly of Na-ion batteries and supercapacitors by utilizing a single electrode bodes well for the growth of hybrid energy storage and delivery systems in the future.
