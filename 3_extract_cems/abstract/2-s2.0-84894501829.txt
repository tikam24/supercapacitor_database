Ti nanowire arrays (NAs) prepared by a facile and template-free hydrothermal method were used as three-dimensional (3D) current collectors for the electrodeposition of MnO2. The resulting Ti@MnO2 NAs exhibit remarkable electrochemical behavior with high specific capacitance, good rate performance and desired cycling stability. Â© 2014 Royal Society of Chemistry.
