Innovations are required for electric vehicles (EVs) to be lighter and more energy efficient due to the range anxiety issue. This article introduces an intelligent control of an organic structure solar supercapacitor (OSSC) for EVs to meet electrical load demands with solar renewable energy. A carbon fibre-reinforced polymer, nano zinc oxide (ZnO), and copper oxide (CuO) fillers have been used in the development of OSSC prototypes. The organic solar cell, electrical circuits, converter, controller, circuit breaker switch, and batteries were all integrated for the modelling of OSSCs. A carbon fibre (CF)-reinforced CuO-doped polymer was utilised to improve the concentration of electrons. The negative electrodes of the CF were strengthened with nano ZnO epoxy to increase the mobility of electrons as an n-type semiconductor (energy band gap 3.2–3.4 eV) and subsequently increased to 3.5 eV by adding 6% π-carbon. The electrodes of the CF were strengthened with epoxy-filled nano-CuO as a p-type semiconductor to facilitate bore/positive charging. They improve the conductivity of the OSSC. The OSSC power storage was controlled by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy intelligent system controller to meet the load demand of EVs and auxiliary battery charging. Moreover, a fully charged OSSC (solar irradiance = 1000 W/m2) produced 561 W·h/m2 to meet the vehicle load demand with 45 A of auxiliary battery charging current. Therefore, the OSSC can save 15% in energy efficiency and contribute to emission control. The integration of an OSSC with an EV battery can minimise the weight and capacity of the battery by 7.5% and 10%, respectively.
