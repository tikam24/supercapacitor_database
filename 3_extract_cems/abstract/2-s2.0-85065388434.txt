The present paper deals with a real-time assessment of a fuzzy â€“backstepping based control applied to a battery-supercapacitor (SC)hybrid energy storage system (HESS). To properly emulate the behavior of an electric vehicle, the proposed topology is extended to a PMSM drive, that represents the traction part. The proposed control scheme is divided into two parts: The first part plans a fuzzy logic power management approach, to operate the system in a smart way: First, It ensures an optimal load power-sharing, focusing the operation of the involved sources in a safe mode. Second, a quite regulation of both the dc bus and the SC voltage without additional controllers. The second part proposes a back-stepping direct torque control (BS-DTC), associated to a space vector modulation (SVM)strategy, to ensure decoupled torque and flux control of the PMSM machine. The experimental results, conducted on a small-scale system, controlled via two dSPACE 1104 cards, prove the effectiveness of the proposed control techniques, with good performances in dynamic and steady state.
