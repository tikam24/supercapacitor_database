Three-dimensional criss-crossed hydrous ruthenium dioxide (RuO<inf>2</inf>) nanotubes directly on a Ti substrate without any binder are successfully synthesized for the first time via a facile template method at a low temperature of 90 Â°C. A cobalt-hydroxide-carbonate nanowire array is used as the template and can be completely dissolved away during the formation process of the tubular structure. The synthetic strategy is much more cost-effective and facile than other physical/chemical methods. The obtained material possesses proper crystallinity and water content together with a distinctive structure, resulting in superior electron and ion transmission performance. When the binder-free electrode is used in a supercapacitor, it exhibits a remarkable high-rate performance with a specific capacitance of 745 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a high current density of 32 A g<sup>-1</sup>. This represents a retention of 88.7% compared to the value of 840 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 2 A g<sup>-1</sup>.
