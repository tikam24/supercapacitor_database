Supercapacitors have a wide range of possible uses as energy storage systems. In this study, we examined a new type of composite electrode material for supercapacitor applications made of M-Type cobalt doped barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets (BaCoFe11O19 NPs) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a two step process. The successful formation of composite material is confirmed by analyses such as XRD, FTIR, TEM, and XPS. The fabricated BaCoFe11O19/g-C3N4 composite electrode has a maximum specific capacitance of 314.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. It also retains its cycling stability with 94.3% capacitance retention after 10,000 charging-discharging cycles. As a result, the resultant BaCoFe11O19/g-C3N4 composite electrode has potential for use as an electrode material in high-performance energy storage systems.
