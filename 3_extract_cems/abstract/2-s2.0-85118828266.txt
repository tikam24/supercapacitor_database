Microwave synthesized activated carbon utilizing Tridax procumbens flowers is reported as supercapacitor electrode. Incomplete graphitization with disordered carbon structure and honeycomb-like surface morphology is achieved. In aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte, the material exhibits charge storage through non-faradaic, electrostatic accumulation/adsorption of charges at electrode-electrolyte interface. The charge/discharge curves confirm the capacitive behavior of the material with a specific capacitance of 168 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. A notable energy density of 2.46 W h kg−1 at a 163 W kg−1 power density is achieved in the assembled symmetric device making it a pertinent electrode material for supercapacitors.
