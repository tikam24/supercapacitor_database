A novel fuzzy energy management strategy (EMS) based on improved Q-learning controller and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed for the real-time power split between fuel cell and supercapacitor of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). Different from driving pattern recognitionâ€“based method, Q-Learning controller takes actions by observing the driving states and compensates to fuzzy controller, that is, no need to know the driving pattern in advance. Aimed to prolong the fuel cell lifetime and decrease its energy consumption, the initial values of Q-table are optimized by GA. Moreover, to enhance the environment adaptation capability, the learning strategy of Q-learning controller is improved. Two adaptive energy management strategies have been compared, and simulation results show that current fluctuation can be reduced by 6.9% and 41.5%, and H2 consumption can be saved by 0.35% and 6.08%, respectively. Meanwhile, state of charge (SOC) of supercapacitor is sustained within the desired safe range.
