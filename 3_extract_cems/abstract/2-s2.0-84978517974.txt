A novel copper/nickel-based manganese dioxide core-shell nanostructure can be prepared for supercapacitor electrodes using facile hydrothermal methods. Attributed to Kirkendall-type diffusion process, the “core” can transfer to hollow structure during the reaction interestingly. The faradic reaction occurs effectively in the electrode and electrolyte due to the high conductivity of Cu/Ni and large hollow channel structure. As a result, the electrode displays a high specific capacitance (374 F g−1 at current density of 0.25 A g−1), fine cycling stability (86.9% retention after 3000 cycles) and outstanding rate capability. These interesting findings suggest that the hybrid material can be a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrodes.
