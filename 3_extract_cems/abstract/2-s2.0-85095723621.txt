Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with large specific surface area and high porosity show a promising application in supercapacitors due to the excellent mass and electron transfer. Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) derived porous carbon usually exhibit sizeable specific capacity and admirable stability for supercapacitors, whereas the macroporous-free structure limits the electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a nitrogen-doped hierarchical ordered porous carbon (NHOPC), which is derived from a novel single-crystal ordered macroporous ZIF-8. Electron microscopy and nitrogen isothermal adsorption experiment identify the three-dimensional interconnected macro-meso-micropores of the NHOPC. By combining structural and electrochemical characterization, the effects of annealing temperature on the physical-chemical structure and electrochemical performance are discussed carefully, thus establishing a reasonable structure-activity relationship. The optimized NHOPC-900 exhibit an ultra-high specific capacity of 475.5 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cyclical stability, which attributes to a synergistic effect of large specific surface area, fast mass transfer, and nitrogen-doped matrix of the material.
