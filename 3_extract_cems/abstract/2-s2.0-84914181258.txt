Offshore wind power high voltage direct current transmission needs to be improved in terms of efficiency and reliability. The reduced matrix converter (RMC) was applied to offshore wind power generation system, and the RMC converter topology and its bi-polar voltage space vector pulse-width modulation were analyzed. In order to improve continuous operation in the case of the shore AC grid voltage drop, the topology of MTDC (MTDC, Multi-Terminal HVDC) transmission for offshore wind power generation based on RMC converter and its coordination control strategy between RMC, shore VSC and Super-capacitor energy storage system were proposed. Through super-capacitor energy storage, power balance control was achieved when AC voltage drop, and the ability of low voltage ride through was strengthened. A three-port RMC-MTDC through MATLAB were simulated, and the experimental results verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.
