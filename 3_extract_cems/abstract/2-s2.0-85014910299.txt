Free-standing NiO/MnO2 core-shell nanoflake structure was deposited on flexible carbon cloth (CC) used as electrode for high-performance supercapacitor (SC). The NiO core was grown directly on CC by hydrothermal process and the following annealing treatment. MnO2 thin film was then covered on NiO structures via a self-limiting process in aqueous solution of 0.5 M KMnO4 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 with a carbon layer serving as the sacrificial layer. Both the core and shell materials are good pseudocapacitive materials, the compounds of binary metal oxides can provide the synergistic effect of all individual constituents, and thus enhance the performance of SC electrode. The obtained CC/NiO/MnO2 heterostructure was directly used as SC electrodes, showing an enhanced electrochemical performance including areal capacitance of 316.37 mF/cm2 and special gravimetric capacitance of 204.3 F/g at the scan rate of 50 mV/s. The electrode also shows excellent cycling stability, which retains 89% of its initial discharge capacitance after 2200 cycles with >97% Coulombic efficiency. The synthesized binder-free hierarchical composite electrode with superior electrochemical properties demonstrates enormous potential in the application of flexible SCs.
