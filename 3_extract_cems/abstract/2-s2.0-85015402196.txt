This paper presents a frequency-based approach energy management in an Electrical Hybrid Boat (EHB) application. An association of a variable speed DieselPermanent Magnet Generator (Diesel-PMG) with a supercapacitor and a battery bank is proposed to satisfy energetic demand of EHB. The supercapacitor and the battery bank are connected to DC-link via bidirectional DC/DC converters, while the variable speed Diesel Generator is connected to DC-link through a three phase controlled rectifier. The two DC/AC converters connected to two electric motors are used as thrusters system which emulates energetic demand of Electrical Hybrid Boat in propulsion operations. Power requirements of the thrusters are then emulated in a programmable electrical load to simulate the load profile. The contribution of this paper is focused on load's profile sharing between a variable speed Diesel Generator, a supercapacitor and a battery bank according to dynamic responses of each source. The performances of proposed method are evaluated through experimental results obtained by a dSPACE-based test bench.
