One-dimensional (1D) electrode materials have been the most promising material for supercapacitors because of their unique features, such as 1D morphology with large surface area, high mechanical rigidity, excellent cyclic stability, and great electrical conductivity. Herein, we demonstrate a one-dimensional RuO2-N-doped carbon (1D-RuO2/C) composite, synthesized by a facile thermal method, for supercapacitor application. The 1D-RuO2/C composite delivers a specific capacitance (Cs) of 671 F/g under a current of 5 A/g with extraordinary capacitance retention of 93.46% after 5000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device (1D-RuO2/C//AC) was constructed using 1D-RuO2/C as the positive electrode material and activated carbon as the negative electrode material. The 1D-RuO2/C//AC device shows a Cs value of 53 F/g under 1 A/g current and delivers a power density (PD) of 751.66 W kg-1 at 16.71 Wh kg-1 energy density (ED). The ASC maintains approximately 98.65% of its initial value at 10 A/g discharge current. The high electrochemical activity of the 1D-RuO2/C composite is primarily due to the 1D morphology of RuO2, high surface area, synergistic interaction between RuO2 and carbon support, etc. We hope that this 1D-RuO2/C composite will find its application in energy storage systems.
