Solar radiation exfoliated reduced graphene oxide (SRGO) and polyaniline nanofibers (PANi NFs) containing composite is synthesized using the typical chemical oxidative polymerization. The composite exhibits an excellent specific mass capacitance of ~655 F/g owing to an optimal chemical interaction between SRGO and PANi NFs in the composite. Specific mass capacitance of the composite remains almost constant at different current densities making it expedient as a working electrode material in supercapacitors.
