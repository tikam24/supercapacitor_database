Protection of high voltage supercapacitor-based energy storage is considered. The proposed scheme of high voltage supercapacitor battery is developed on the basis of conventional protection schemes of high voltage AC capacitor batteries. Both normal and abnormal mode of high voltage supercapacitor-based energy storage are investigated by the means of computer modeling. It is shown that proposed protection is capable to detect outage of single supercapacitor unit under the given supercapacitors parameters scatter.
