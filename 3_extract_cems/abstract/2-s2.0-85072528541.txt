Aiming at the efficiency lowering of the battery in electric mining truck due to the impact of repeating charging and discharging with high power and large current,a life prediction model for a large-capacity lithium-iron phosphate battery in a 55 t battery electric mining truck is established. In a condition of meeting the power performance and energy requirements of vehicle, with enhancing vehicle fuel economy and battery service life as objectives, a parameter matching on battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system is conducted. With the rule-based hybrid energy control strategy, a simulation is performed on Matlab/Simulink platform by using ADVISOR2002. The results show that the hybrid energy storage system can effectively improve the energy efficiency of battery electric mining truck, extend the service life of battery and enhance the fuel economy and power performance of battery electric mining truck.
