To achieve high-performance supercapacitors, electrode materials with the accessible electrode area, electrons, and ions diffusion channels are strongly needed. Herein, the network-like holey NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam have been synthesized by a facile and efficient electrodeposition followed by calcination as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The nanosheets are interconnected and interlocked together to form a network-like structure with abundant open channels, and the arrays are about 2.3 μm in thickness. Interestingly, the holey nanosheets include numerous macropores (50–160 nm) and mesopores (3–10 nm), which contribute to the rapid electrolyte ions diffusion between the nanosheet layers and the increase of capacitances. The NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays electrode displays a high capacitance of 2.23 F cm−2 (1012.5 F g−1) at a current density of 5 mA cm−2, good rate capability of 67.3% at a current density of 50 mA cm−2, and high-cycling stability. These results indicate that the network-like holey NiCo2O4 nanosheet arrays electrode has a significant potential application in supercapacitors.
