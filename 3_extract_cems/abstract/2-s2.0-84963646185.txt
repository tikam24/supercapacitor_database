Hollow NiO ball-flowers closely assembled by porous nanosheets have been synthesized via a simple and template-free hydrothermal method. When applied to supercapacitor as electrode materials, the as-prepared NiO ball-flowers with hierarchical, porous, and hollow structures exhibited high specific capacitance value (734 F g−1) at a current density (1 A g−1), as well as good cycling stability. The outstanding electrochemical performance may be attributed to the morphology and structure of the nanosheet-assembled hollow ball-flowers which have the advantages of increasing specific surface area, facilitating the contact between the electrode and electrolyte, and accommodating the volume changes during faradaic reaction.
