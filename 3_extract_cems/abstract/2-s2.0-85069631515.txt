Abstract: Herein, CPTNTs material is synthetized by introducing CuO nanoparticles by an electrodeposition–thermal oxidation method onto platinum sputtered TiO2 nanotubes CuO/Pt-TiO2 NTs. The electrochemical properties and capacitive behavior of this as-prepared material are evaluated using the cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) measurements in 1 M of Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. Using this new binary nanocomposite material, we can attain a high specific capacitance of 423 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, with a long-term stability of 93% over 5000 cycles. The results demonstrated that this electrode could deliver a high energy density of 19.62 Wh Kg−1 and a power density up to 442.89 W Kg−1. Additionally, first-principles calculations were employed to investigate the electronic and transport structure of (Cu, Pt) co-doped TiO2, to understand further its electrochemical behaviors. These results obtained throughout this study were able to demonstrate that this new and firstly reported binary nanocomposite is a noticeable candidate for high performance supercapacitors.
