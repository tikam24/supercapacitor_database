In this work, we report the synthesis of sulfur-doped reduced graphene oxide (S-rGO) using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) by a facile one-pot approach via refluxing in deionised water. The undoped rGO chemical structure is partially reduced by NaBH4, whereas the addition of a small amount of Na2S with NaBH4 resulted in a better reduction of rGO. XPS analysis confirmed the successful doping of sulfur and Raman spectroscopy verified the increased defect density. The S-rGO electrode exhibits good power density (3202 W kg-1) with increased specific capacitance (392 F g-1) and cyclic stability (91%, 2000 cycles) in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The obtained results suggest that the simple tuning of the graphene oxide structure using Na2S with NaBH4 enhances the above properties. Moreover, this method is facile and allows the easy reproduction of bulk quantities of materials for use in commercial applications.
