Supercapacitors (SC) are energy storage devices with long durability, and high power density. Metal oxides, conducting polymers and carbon based nanomaterials are generally used as an electrode material in SC due to their high charge storage properties. Superior performance of SC can be achieved by making a composite of metal oxides with conducting polymer or with carbon based nanomaterials in order achieve synergy. Herein, we report a low temperature hydrothermal method for the synthesis of α-MnO2 nanorods (α-MnO2-NR) and the composite was prepared by in situ polymerization of polyaniline (PANT) with α-MnO2-NR. Uniform distribution of MnO2-NR on the PANI granules was observed in composite. Material characterization was carried out by using XRD, FTIR and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performance of the as-prepared materials was evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements in potential range of 0 to 0.8 V. PANI-α-MnO2-NR showed improved specific capacitance of 605 F/g at 1 A/g which is higher than that of individual component like pure PANI (515 F/g) and pure MnO2-NR (141 F/g) at 1A/g.
