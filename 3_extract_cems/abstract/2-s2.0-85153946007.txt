Pseudocapacitive electrodes with high rate retention and good cycling stability are highly desirable in constructing high-performance supercapacitors due to their rapid charge/discharge capacity and long service life, but they are still a challenge to realize. Herein, a ternary Fe3O4/reduced graphene oxide/phytic acid (PA)-doped polyaniline (F-RGO-p-PANI) hybrid has been prepared to address this challenge. Prompted by the multiple synergistic effects among RGO, Fe3O4, PA, and PANI, our F-RGO-p-PANI material exhibits a high specific capacitance (Cs) of 459.1 F g−1 with a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Interestingly, our supercapacitor displays both high capacitance retention (∼83.5%) under a broad current density range (from 0.25 to 20 A g−1) and high cycling stability (∼80.8%) over 10 000 cycles under a high current density (20 A g−1), better than previous results. Moreover, our supercapacitor also shows a high specific energy density of 58.1 W h kg−1 with a power density of 0.5 kW kg−1. These results imply that our ternary F-RGO-p-PANI holds tremendous potential in fabricating rapidly charged/discharged supercapacitors.
