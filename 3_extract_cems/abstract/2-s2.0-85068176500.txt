Soft chemical synthesis is used to obtain a hydrangea-type bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) supercapattery electrode that demonstrates considerable energy/power density and cycling life. Structure and morphology studies, initially, reveal a phase-pure polycrystalline and hydrangea-type surface appearance for Bi2MoO6, which upon testing in an electrochemical energy storage system displays supercapattery behavior, a combination of a supercapacitor and a battery. From the power law, an applied-potential-dependent charge storage mechanism is established for the Bi2MoO6 electrode material. A Trasatti plot evidences the presence of inner and outer surface charges. The hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode demonstrates a specific capacitance of 485 F g-1 at 5 A g-1 and a stability of 82% over 5000 cycles. An assembled symmetric supercapattery with a Bi2MoO6//Bi2MoO6 configuration demonstrates energy and power densities of 45.6 W h kg-1 and 989 W kg-1, respectively. A demonstration elucidating the lighting up of three light-emitting diodes, connected in series, by the symmetric supercapattery signifies the practical potentiality of the as-synthesized hydrangea-type Bi2MoO6 electrode in energy storage devices.
