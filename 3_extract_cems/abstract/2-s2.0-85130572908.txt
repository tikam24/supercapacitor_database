MXene is an emerging 2D material with rare combination of properties like electric and metallic conductivity, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, large surface area, size tunability, rich surface chemistry, flexibility, layered structure. Since the discovery of first member of the family, MXene (Ti3C2Tx) in 2011, MXene has drawn the attention and left the prodigious impact on the scientific community and opens the avenue for the plethora of applications. Due to the versatile properties; MXene is considered as the building block of the future materials and devices. In this review, the potential application of MXene and MXene based composites in various field like sensors (physical sensor and chemical sensor), electro and photocatalysis [carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR) etc.], energy storage (supercapacitor, batteries, hydrogen storage), electromagnetic interference shielding, bio-medical applications and optoelectronic application have been summarized.
