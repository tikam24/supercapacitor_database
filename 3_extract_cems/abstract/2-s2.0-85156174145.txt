The present work is an experimental comparison of various binary transition metal oxides (BTMOs) and their application as electrode material for supercapaitor (SC). The possibility of Molybdenum oxides and their nanostructures are explored in the field of energy storage devices however, very few works have been reported analyzing the potential of BTMOs as electrode materials for energy applications. Herein, CoMoO4, NiMoO4, MnMoO4 and CuMoO4 nanostructures were synthesized and implicated as an electrode for coin-cell based SC. The electrode materials were tested in both three and two-electrode system to conclude the suitable electrode for commercial application. Coin-cell device based on XMoO4║NrGO/CNT was fabricated and compared in this study. This comparative experimental study investigated the influence of the intrinsic properties of electrodes on specific capacitance. NiMoO4║NrGO/CNT delivered a capacitance of 261 F g−1 and capacity retention of 80 %. Also, depicted an energy density of 45.23 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 7500 W kg−1. This excellent electrochemical performance of the NiMoO4 electrode implies it will be a prospective candidate for supercapacitor application.
