Crystalline tin oxide, with nanometre size range in diameter, was synthesized using a solution phase approach. The oxide material showed the photocatalytic performance for the reduction of a xanthene based dye in presence of ultra-violet irradiation, where the conduction band electron is responsible for the reduction mechanism. In addition to that the calculated power density and energy density values of the synthesized tin oxide nanoparticles, in combination with graphitic carbon, is comparable with the electrochemical supercapacitor like materials.
