The poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/single-walled carbon nanotubes (PEDOT/SWNTs) composites with content of SWNTs varying from 4 wt% to 12 wt% were prepared by a simple solid-state heating method. The results from FTIR and UV-vis spectra showed that the composites were successfully performed by this method, and the strong interactions between the PEDOT and SWNTs occurred in the composite with 8 wt% SWNTs as compared to other composites. The galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements indicated that the PEDOT/SWNTs composite had higher specific capacitances than PEDOT, and the composite with 8 wt% SWNTs had the highest specific capacitance among the composites. The morphological studies showed that the composite with 8 wt% SWNTs exhibited a mixture of the plate-like PEDOT and nonuniformly distributed SWNTs. The further electrochemical tests on the composite with 8 wt% SWNTs showed that the composite had a high specific capacitance of 188 F g -1 at 0.5 mA cm -2 and a capacity retention of 66% over 1300 cycles.
