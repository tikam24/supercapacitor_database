The electrochemical enhancement of polyaniline (PANI) by adding nanomaterials is closely related with the dispersion state of the nanomaterials in PANI. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of well-mixed PANI/nanomaterials composites through solid-phase exfoliation and subsequent in-situ polymerization. Bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) or carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles were firstly ball-milled in the presence of calcium lignosulphonate to provide lignosulfonate (LS) noncovalently functionalized MoS2 nanosheets or CNTs, which were then used as skeletons for in-situ polymerization of aniline. The resulted nanocomposites exhibited enhanced electrochemical properties as compared with pure PANI. Typically, the ternary composite PANI/MoS2-LS/CNT-LS delivered a specific capacitance of 458.9 F/g, a 63% improvement than PANI at 1 A/g in a three-electrode system. Furthermore, excellent cycle stability (86% capacitance retention after 10, 000 charge-discharge cycles) and high specific energy (10.9 Wh/kg at specific power of 265.3 W/kg) were obtained in a coin-type symmetric supercapacitor. The study provides an efficient and facile approach for fabrication of conductive polymer/nanomaterials composite for supercapacitors with good stability and performance.
