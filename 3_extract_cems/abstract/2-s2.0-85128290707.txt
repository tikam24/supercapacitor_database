In this work, an outstanding nano-structured composite electrode is fabricated through the co-deposition of Co(OH)2 nanoplates and porous reduced GO (p-rGO) nanosheets onto Ni foam (NF). Through field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy observations, it was confirmed that porous reduced graphene oxide sheets are completely wrapped by uniform hexagonal Co(OH)2 plates. Due to the unique architecture of both components of the prepared composite, a high surface area of 234.7 m2 g−1 and mean pore size of 3.65 nm were observed for the Co(OH)2@p-rGO composite. The constructed Co(OH)2@p-rGO/NF composite electrode shows higher energy storage capability compared to that of Co(OH)2/NF and p-rGO/NF electrodes. The Co(OH)2/NF electrode shows specific capacitances of 902 and 311 F g-1 at 5 and 30 A g-1, while the Co(OH)2@p-rGO/NF electrode delivers 1688 and 1355 F g-1 under the same current loads, respectively. Furthermore, when the current load was increased from 1 to 30 A g-1, 74.5% capacitance retention was observed for the Co(OH)2@p-rGO/NF electrode, indicating its outstanding high-power capability, while the Co(OH)2/NF electrode retained only 38.5% of its initial capacitance. The fabricated Co(OH)2@p-rGO/NF//rGO/NF ASC device shows an areal capacitance of 3.29 F cm−2, cycling retention of 91.2% after 4500 cycles at 5 A g−1 and energy density of 68.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 895 W kg−1. The results of electrochemical tests prove that Co(OH)2@p-rGO/NF exhibits good performance as a positive electrode for use in an asymmetric supercapacitor device. The prepared porous composite electrode is thus a promising candidate for use in supercapacitor applications.
