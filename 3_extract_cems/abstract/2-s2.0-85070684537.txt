To achieve high-energy density of supercapacitors and maintain their intrinsic high power density, the operating voltage should be extended by assembling high specific capacitance electrode materials into an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device. Herein, an ASC was assembled based on a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous carbon framework (PRPC-1K) as a negative electrode and 3D sphere-like nickel nitride (Ni3N) nanosheets as a positive electrode in an aqueous KOH electrolyte. The PRPC-1K was prepared by a simple activation process with biomass poplar root as the carbon precursor, and the Ni3N nanosheets were successfully synthesized via a simple low-temperature hydrothermal and further urea-assisted nitridation process. Due to the unique structures and high capacitive performances of these materials, the Ni3N//PRPC-1K ASC assembled based on these two materials achieved the high energy density of 30.9 W h kg-1 at the high power density of 412 W kg-1 and acceptable electrochemical cycling stability with an 81% retention after 5000 cycles.
