The increasing demand for portable electronic devices and hybrid electric vehicles stimulates the development of supercapacitors as an advanced energy storage system. Here, we demonstrate a binder-free nickel hydroxide@nanoporous gold/Ni foam (Ni(OH)2@NPG/Ni foam) electrode for high-performance supercapacitors, which is prepared by a facile three-step fabrication route including electrodeposition of Au-Sn alloy on Ni foam, chemical dealloying of Sn and electrodepostion of Ni(OH)2 on NPG/Ni foam. Such Ni(OH)2@NPG/Ni foam electrode is composed of a thin layer of conformable Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes supported on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchically porous NPG/Ni foam substrate. The resulting Ni(OH)2@NPG/Ni foam electrode can offer highways for both electron transfer and ion transport and lead to an excellent electrochemical performance with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 3380 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. Even when the current density was increased to 50 A g−1, it still retained a high capacitance of 1927 F g−1. The promising performance of the Ni(OH)2@NPG/Ni foam electrode is mainly ascribed to the 3D hierarchical porosity and the highly conductive network on the NPG/Ni foam composite current collector, as well as the conformal electrodeposition of Ni(OH)2 active material on the NPG/Ni foam, which induces the formation of interconnected porosity both on the top surface and on the inner surface of the electrode. This inspiring electrochemical performance would make the as-designed electrode material become one of the most promising candidates for future electrochemical energy storage systems.
