In view of the intermittent and unstable output voltage of photovoltaic power generation module, a super-capacitor is designed as the control system to improve the power quality and power supply continuity of photovoltaic power generation system. The whole circuit includes maximum power point tracking converter, boost converter, super-capacitor bank, and microcontroller. With sufficient sunlight, the control system dispatches the photovoltaic power generation module output to provide power to the load and stabilizes output voltage fluctuations; when the sky is cloudy, the control system dispatches the stored energy in super-capacitor, served as an uninterruptible power source, to provide power to the load. The measured results show that the control system can effectively stabilize the output voltage of photovoltaic power generation module, improve the power quality, and enhance the reliability of load power consumption.
