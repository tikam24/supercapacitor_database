High energy density and safety are the goals in the pursuit of flexible energy storage devices. Herein, we report a novel flexible supercapacitor (SC) fabricated with a cross-linked poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) porous organogel electrolyte and carbon nanotube paper@poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (CNT@PDAA) film electrodes. The PVDF-HFP/tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate-acetonitrile (Et<inf>4</inf>NBF<inf>4</inf>-AN) organogel electrolyte, featured with a highly porous structure and chemical cross-linking, exhibits nonflammability, a broad electrochemical stable window, and high ionic conductivity of 14.4 Ã— 10<sup>-3</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>, as well as improved solvent resistance. The CNT@PDAA electrode displays good pseudocapacitive performance in a broad potential window due to p- and n-doping characteristics. Because of this rational design, the as-prepared flexible SC device achieves an excellent volumetric capacitance of 5.2 F cm<sup>-3</sup> and a high energy density of 5.16 mWh cm<sup>-3</sup> (41.4 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup>) at a power density of 0.051 W cm<sup>-3</sup> (0.41 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>). More importantly, a unit of as-assembled SC is shown to drive a commercially available product even in a bent state.
