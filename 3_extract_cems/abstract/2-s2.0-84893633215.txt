Integrated nanodevices with the capability of storing energy are widely applicable and have thus been studied extensively. To meet the demand for flexible integrated devices, all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors that simultaneously realize energy storage and optoelectronic detection were fabricated by growing Co3O4 nanowires on nickel fibers, thus giving the positive electrode, and employing graphene as both the negative electrode and light-sensitive material. The as-assembled integrated systems were characterized by an improved energy storage, enhanced power density (at least by 1860 % enhanced) by improving the potential window from 0-0.6 V to 0 - 1.5 V, excellent photoresponse to white light, and superior flexibility of both the fiber-based asymmetric supercapacitor and the photodetector. Such flexible integrated devices might be used in smart and self-powered sensory, wearable, and portable electronics. All on a single fiber: Fiber-shaped all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors were prepared on Ni or Ti fibers. Furthermore, the combination of a supercapacitor and a photodetector based on graphene on carbon fibers as light-sensitive material gave a flexible integrated system on a single fiber to simultaneously realize energy storage and photodetection.
