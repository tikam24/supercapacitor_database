A mild and environmental-friendly method is developed for fabricating a 3D interconnected graphene electrode with large-scale continuity. Such material has interlayer pores between reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and in-plane pores. Hence, a specific surface area up to 835 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and a high powder conductivity up to 400 S m<sup>-1</sup> are achieved. For electrochemical applications, the interlayer pores can serve as "ion-buffering reservoirs" while in-plane ones act as "channels" for shortening the mass cross-plane diffusion length, reducing the ion response time, and prevent the interlayer restacking. As binder-free supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a specific capacitance up to 169 F g<sup>-1</sup> with surface-normalized capacitance close to 21 Î¼F cm<sup>-2</sup> (intrinsic capacitance) and power density up to 7.5 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>, in 6 m KOH aqueous electrolyte. In the case of lithium-ion battery anode, it shows remarkable advantages in terms of the initiate reversible Coulombic efficiency (61.3%), high specific capacity (932 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 100 mA g<sup>-1</sup>), and robust long-term retention (93.5% after 600 cycles at 2000 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>). An ultra-light hierarchical graphene electrode is prepared via a new and environmental-friendly activation method. It has a specific surface area up to 835 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and a powder conductivity of 400 S m<sup>-1</sup>. As binder-free electrode, it delivers a robust and high specific capacitance in supercapacitors and a capacity in lithium-ion anodes with a very high charge/discharge rate.
