This paper presents an algorithm for sizing components in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles through separation of load power demand into high, low, and intermediate frequency components. The approach considers a combination of hybridization with fuel cell units, battery packs and super capacitors. A unique and exhaustive search is performed through iterative loops based on response times of energy sources, battery pack power limits, and DC-DC converter voltage conversion ratios. The approach also considers non-idealities such as battery hysteresis and battery and super capacitor resistive losses. Simulation and design results are presented for a high performance vehicle based on an aggressive drive cycle. The results show an approximately 41 % improvement in weight using a fuel cell and super capacitor hybrid combination and a 26 % improvement using fuel cell, battery and super capacitor hybrid combination over battery only or other hybrid combinations.
