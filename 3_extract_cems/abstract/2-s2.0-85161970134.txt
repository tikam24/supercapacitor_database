Bimetallic phosphides hold great promise for using in hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) as electrode material due to their synergistic effect of hetero-metal ions in ameliorating specific capacity and electrical conductivity. The production of bimetallic Ni1-xCoxP nanocrystals based on carbon-coated (Ni1-xCoxP@C) is described, and their potential application as positive electrodes in HSCs is also discussed. We give an insight into the significance of composition engineering for nickel-cobalt bimetallic phosphides in obtaining excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Ni0.9Co0.1P@C electrode reaches a maxima specific capacity as high as 4250 ± 48 mC cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 (1327 ± 15 C g−1 at 1 A g−1), outperforming most transition metal phosphides (TMP)-based electrodes reported recently. Utilizing Ni0.9Co0.1P@C as electrode, the obtained HSC device provides a desired energy density of 46.9 ± 2.2 Wh kg−1 at 1600 W kg−1 and continues to sustain 26.2 ± 1.3 Wh kg−1 at a significant power density of 8000 W kg−1, capacitance retention remaining at 89.4 % after 10,000 cycles. It is believed that the Ni0.9Co0.1P@C has significant promise for application in extremely effective and affordable HSCs, as well as probably in other energy storage devices.
