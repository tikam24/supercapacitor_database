Bundle-like Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2nanorods derived from metalâ€“organic framework (MOF) have been grown on nickel foam with a straightforward solvothermal technique, subsequent soaking in an alkalescent solution. The nickel foam supported bundle-like Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2nanorods could be directly applied to supercapacitors served as electrodes. Bundle-like Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2nanorods inherit the structure of the MOF. The special structure is benefit for the transport of electrons, diffusion of ions, and exposure of electrochemical active sites. More importantly, we have compared the performances of electrodes prepared by immersion in alkaline solution for different time, and it is found that the electrode material soaked for 11 h displays the improved specific capacitance (SC). The SC reaches 1957 F/g when the current density is 0.5 A/g, and the SC remains 73.68% at 30 A/g. After cycling of 4000 at 80 A/g, the SC retains 88%, showing excellent cycling stability. In view of the superior electrochemical performances, the bundle-like Co(OH)2/Ni(OH)2nanorods can serve as potential electrode materials applied in energy storage.
