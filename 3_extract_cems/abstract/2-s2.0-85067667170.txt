Introduction of graphene into the stable matrix of Mn3O4-polyaniline composite leads to supercapacitor electrode that can deliver specific capacitance >1000 F g−1. This is nearly double the value, which is observed in conventional type Mn3O4-polyaniline composite that is able to deliver ~500 F g−1, at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 in the voltage window −1 to 1 V. This value is also much greater than those obtained in most of the niche carbon or transition metal oxide based supercapacitors. Cycling studies, carried out at a current density 25 A g−1 and for 3000 cycles, indicated that the composite continue to retain nearly ~97% of the initial capacitance. The enhancement can be explained in terms of the connected percolated conductive path, which originates due to the dispersed graphene sheets.
