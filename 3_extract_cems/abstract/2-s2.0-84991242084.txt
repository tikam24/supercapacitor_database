Porous NiCo2S4 networks have been successfully synthesized by a facile one-pot solvothermal method without the use of any surfactant or template. Crystal structure, morphology, composition and surface area of the as-synthesized samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmet-Teller techniques. Owing to their porous nature and small crystalline size, the as-prepared NiCo2S4 networks based supercapacitor electrodes showed a high specific capacitance of 1250F·g-1 at 1A·g-1, and excellent cycling stability with the retention capacity of 70.3% after 5000 cycles in the KOH aqueous solution electrolyte.
