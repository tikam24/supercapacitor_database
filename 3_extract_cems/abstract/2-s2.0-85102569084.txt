In recent years, rapid technological advances have required the development of energy-related devices. In this regard, Supercapacitors (SCs) have been reported to be one of the most potential candidates to meet the demands of human's sustainable development owing to their unique properties such as outstanding cycling life, safe operation, low processing cost, and high power density compared to the batteries. This review describes the concise aspects of SCs including charge-storage mechanisms and scientific principles design of SCs as well as energy-related performance. In addition, the most important performance parameters of SCs, such as the operating potential window, electrolyte, and full cell voltage, are reviewed. Researches on electrode materials are crucial to SCs because they play a pivotal role in the performance of SCs. This review outlines recent research progress of carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides, sulfides, hydroxides, MXenes, and metal nitrides. Finally, we give a brief outline of SCs' strategic direction for future growth.
