The development of decentralized renewable energy sources has many advantages for the electrification of standalone sites. Their intermittency poses a real challenge to ensure optimal management of production and energy consumption flows. The solution is to store the energy to guarantee the satisfaction of the demand at every moment but also to avoid possible overvoltage in case of overproduction. It is still necessary to find a compromise between the conditions of use, performance, storage capacity and return on investment. The ideal solution is to design hybrid systems with high specific energy expressed in Wh/kg, such as lithium-ion batteries, associated with a high power density devices expressed in W/kg, such as supercapacitors (SC). In this paper, we focused the study on charge balancing process between supercapacitors. This is an important issue to help inverters to supply energy from balanced legs. The dynamic behavior of the system also allows us to use it as a load transfer system or as a load balancing system inside the electrical energy storage units. Analytical analysis and some experiments have been led in this study to show the usefulness of similar devices for polymorphic storage units, composed mainly of supercapacitors and controlled switches.
