In summer, the high temperature inside vehicles is a problem, because cooling a vehicle parked under the scorching sun is both time and energy consuming. Herein, a portable solar-powered cooling system (SPCS) is proposed based on a foldable-flower mechanism and wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. The proposed system consists of three main parts: a solar foldable-flower module (SFFM), an energy transfer module, and a temperature control module. The SFFM is a novel foldable mechanism that achieves a high space utilization through a rotating process and a folding process, like a flower opening its petals. The SFFM, equipped with photovoltaic (PV) cells, collects solar energy and converts it into electricity. The energy transfer module stores electricity from the SFFM in a supercapacitor via a WPT unit. The temperature control module achieves automatic temperature regulation using a cooling device. Experimental results show that output power reaches up to 7.571 W with a load resistor of 5 Ω, whereas the efficiency of the WPT reaches up to 73.6% with a load resistor of 15 Ω. Moreover, thermal simulation results illustrate that the proposed system achieves an average temperature reduction of 27.45 °C, making it feasible and effective to cool a hot vehicle cabin.
