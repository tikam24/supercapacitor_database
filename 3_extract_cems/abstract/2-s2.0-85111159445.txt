Nickel cobalt sulfide nanoparticles (NCS) embedded onto a nitrogen and sulfur dual doped graphene (NS-G) surface are successfully synthesizedviaa two-step facile hydrothermal process. The electrical double-layer capacitor of NS-G acts as a supporting host for the growth of pseudocapacitance NCS nanoparticles, thus enhancing the synergistic electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance values of 1420.2 F g−1at 10 mV s−1and 630.6 F g−1at 1 A g−1are achieved with an impressive capability rate of 76.6% preservation at 10 A g−1. Furthermore, the integrating NiCo2S4nanoparticles embedding onto the NS-G surface also present a surprising improvement in the cycle performance, maintaining 110% retention after 10 000 cycles. Owing to the unique morphology an impressive energy density of 19.35 W h kg−1at a power density of 235.0 W kg−1suggests its potential application in high-performance supercapacitors.
