Graphene gels have attracted intense research due to their excellent gravimetric performances in supercapacitors. However, their low volumetric capacitance and cycling stability limit their practical application. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) reduced graphene aerogel (RGAs) with hierarchical porous and high electrical conductivity were synthesized via simple low temperature chemical reduction method using graphene oxide as precursor and L-cysteine as reducing and functional agent. The sample RGAs-8 that prepared after reduction for 8 h displayed the highest mass density, higher electrical conductivity and cross-linked porous structure. Electrochemical measurements showed that the gravimetric capacitance and the volumetric capacitance of RGAs-8 reached as high as 203.9 F g −1 and 293.6 F cm −3 at 0.5 A g −1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, respectively. In particular, the capacitance of RGAs-8 showed no capacitance loss even after 300,000 charge/discharge cycles, clearly demonstrating a robust long-term stability.
