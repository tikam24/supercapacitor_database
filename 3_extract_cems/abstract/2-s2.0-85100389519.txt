Lignin has been proposed as electricity storage materials due to the redox activity of quinone (Q) and hydroquinone (QH2) groups, which can be formed in lignin. Scalable and low-cost lignosulfonate (LS)/graphite hybrid material electrodes have been developed. It is important to investigate the self-discharge mechanism for these electrodes since a high self-discharge rate was observed, which results in loss of energy density and power density. In this work, self-discharge measurements and models are applied to clarify the self-discharge mechanism of the LS/graphite electrodes. A combination of diffusion controlled, activation controlled and charge equilibration mechanisms are indicated during the self-discharge process at different charging voltages, due to the faradaic reactions of the Q/QH2 confined in the electrodes. Our work contributes deeper understanding of the structure and the self-discharge mechanisms of the biopolymer/graphite hybrid electrodes.
