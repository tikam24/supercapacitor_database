Development of renewable energy drastically improved over the decades in order to reduce carbon emission rate. The suitable size of energy storage required to store the energy that been produced to absorb the excess energy during low demand and inject to the grid back when the plants unable to support the demand. The inability of the renewable generation to provide stable power supply due to the inconsistence availability of the renewable resources itself. Suitable energy storage system will be used as medium to allow excessive energy that harvest during high availability of the resources to be stored and able to backup during high demand phase. Optimal location and size of energy storage system also can be integrated to improve power quality of the grid by providing stability control for voltage and frequency throughout the continuous reactive and active power exchanges respectively.
