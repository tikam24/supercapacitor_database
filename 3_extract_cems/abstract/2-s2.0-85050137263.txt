A promising electrode material for energy storage, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)@graphite-phase C3N4 composite is reported, which is prepared by a simple direct mixing process. The contents of g-C3N4 in the composite are investigated and optimized to give the best supercapacitor characteristics. The composite shows a good specific capacitance of 277 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4. More significantly, the composite exhibits the energy density of 10.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4245 W kg−1. After 5000 charge/discharge cycles, the capacitance retention rate still remains at 94.2%.
