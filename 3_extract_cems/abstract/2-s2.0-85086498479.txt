This work was resolved to scrutinize the charge storing properties of nanomaterials for super capacitor applications. The titanium dioxide (TiO2) and titanium dioxide/Silver (TiO2/Ag) were fabricated by green synthesis process using the Petals of flower rosa. The Ultraviolet Spectroscopy (UV) was used to study the optical property of the nanomaterials and obeys surface plasmonic resonance. The Photoluminescence (PL) was used to extract information on material composition, optical and electronic properties. The Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (FTIR) authenticated the presences of functional molecule in the nanomaterials. The X-Ray diffraction (XRD) studies were used to analyse the crystalline nature of the material. The Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopic (FESEM) images provided the spherical shape of TiO2 and rectangle shape of Ag nanomaterials. The purity of nanomaterials was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrum. The storage property of the nanomaterials was scrutinized by electrochemical studies. Improved specific capacitance (from 375 F/g to 624 F/g) was obtained by adding Impurity (Ag nanomaterials) to the base material. The Electrochemical Impedance studies were also conducted for fabricated nanomaterials and obtained the enhanced conductance (from 20.05 KΩ to 1.25 KΩ).
