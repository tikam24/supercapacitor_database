Herein, a rational design of combining both MXene and MoS2 nanosheets is reported. The heterogeneous 2D layered MoS2/MXene nanohybrid (MMX) is prepared by a simple surfactant assisted interstratification process is mainly to avoid the self-restacking of both the components. Moreover, this process can reduce the surface oxidation of MXene and preserve the physio-chemical properties of MMX. The obtained interlayered MMX structure provides more active electrochemical sites with the enhanced mass transfer between electrode-electrolyte interface and excellent structural durability. The MMX electrode represents a hybrid-type capacitance behaviour with a high specific capacitance of 583 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with a good rate capability of 82.5% and an excellent cycle stability of 96.5% at 5 A g−1 over 5000 cycles. Furthermore, β-Ni(OH)2||MMX asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated with 3 M KOH as the electrolyte. This device delivered a high specific capacitance of 153 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 90% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles at 5 A g−1, indicating its excellent storage capacitance. In addition, an exceptional energy and power densities of 54 W h kg−1 and 0.86 kW kg−1, can be achieved.
