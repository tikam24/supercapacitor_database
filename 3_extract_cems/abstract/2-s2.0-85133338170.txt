Porous flower-like SnS2 synthesized using the co-precipitation method can be used as a high-performance electrode material. The obtained 2D-like flake morphologies show excellent electrochemical performance. The performance of such morphologies grossly supersedes the performance of solid morphologies. The reasons are explained in detail. The improved performance of this porous architecture can be attributed to the enhanced active specific surface area with the accessibility of a larger number of redox active sites on the surface, which facilitates electrolyte ion diffusion during electrochemical responses. To explain the experimental results, a theoretical model is being reported, which establishes the role of porosity in the diffusion process of electrolyte ions within such materials. The porous material leads to a âˆ¼50% increase in the specific capacitance, without compromising rate capabilities or cycling stability, making it ideal for next-generation devices.
