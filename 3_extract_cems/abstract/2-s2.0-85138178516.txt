NiMoO4 shows good electrochemical properties for its multiple oxidation states. However, in practical application, NiMoO4 suffers from poor ion diffusion ability and slow electron transfer rate. In this work, the NiMoO4 nanoarrays with three different morphologies of sheets, rods, and fibers on the nickel foam substrate are successfully prepared, according to the difference of nucleation rate of NiMoO4 in different polar solvents during hydrothermal synthesis. Among them, NiMoO4 nanorods (NiMoO4-NRs) own the highest electrochemical activity due to their higher active surface area utilization. Furthermore, benefiting from the adequate crystal water inside, NiMoO4·1/2H2O-NRs exhibit good ionic diffusion ability. When examined for electrochemical performance experiments, NiMoO4·1/2H2O-NRs can achieve a rapid and reversible Faraday reaction, displaying a high area specific capacity of 2450 mC cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) using NiMoO4·1/2H2O-NRs as a positive electrode is assembled, which achieves a high energy density of 75.1 Wh kg−1 at 849.9 W kg−1 and excellent capacitance retention of 86.4% after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, NiMoO4·1/2H2O-NRs also present outstanding water electrolysis activity. It can afford ultralow overpotential in 1 M KOH solution (166 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER and 360 mV at 50 mA cm−2 for OER) and the current density retention of 99.4% (HER) as well as 89.1% (OER) after 10 h continuous electrolysis. The NiMoO4·1/2H2O-NRs designed in our work with optimal surface topography and moderate crystal water have a broad application prospect in both supercapacitors and electrolysis of water.
