The supercapacitor market is expected to grow quickly in the coming years due to the increased demand for them across a variety of applications. These supercapacitors come in multiple sizes, capacitances, energy, power, and voltage ranges and are occasionally specially designed for specific uses. Several significant players currently control the supercapacitor market, including Murata Technology, Eaton Corporation, Maxwell Technologies, Nippon Chemi-Con, and Nesscap. To meet growing demand and keep their competitive edge over rivals, these key firms put a lot of effort into supercapacitor research and development. In terms of cost-effectiveness, high-quality carbon as electrode materials, non-toxic electrolytes, and packaging materials, biomass play a crucial role in producing and marketing supercapacitors. Different biomass-based supercapacitors are used in various commercial applications and scaled up from lab to industrial levels. This chapter provides the market trends for biomass-based supercapacitors, the essential properties of biomass to be used in supercapacitors, the expected technology readiness level, and information on the characteristics of supercapacitor devices and components produced by various researchers.
