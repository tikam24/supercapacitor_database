Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of rGO/BiVO4 hybrid nanostructures by facile hydrothermal method. Morphological studies reveal that rGO sheets are embedded in the special dendritic fern-like structures of BiVO4. The rGO/BiVO4 hybrid architecture shows the way to a rational design of supercapacitor, since these structures enable easy access of electrolyte ions by reducing internal resistance. Considering the unique morphological features of rGO/BiVO4 hybrid nanostructures, their supercapacitive properties were investigated. The rGO/BiVO4 electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 151 F/g at the current density of 0.15 mA/cm2. Furthermore, we have constructed rGO/BiVO4 symmetric cell which exhibits outstanding volumetric energy density of 1.6 mW h/cm3 (33.7 W h/kg) and ensures rapid energy delivery with power density of 391 mW/cm3 (8.0 kW/kg). The superior properties of symmetric supercapacitor can be attributed to the special dendritic fern-like BiVO4 morphology and intriguing physicochemical properties of rGO.
