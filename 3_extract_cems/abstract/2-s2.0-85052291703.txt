In this work, the high conductivity nanocomposite of NiMoO4-PANI (polyaniline) is synthesized via chemical polymerization, while NiMoO4 nanorods are prepared with a solvothermal method. Furthermore, based on NiMoO4-PANI nanocomposite, we fabricate supercapacitor electrode, which shows an excellent chemical stability of 80.7% and a good specific capacitance of 1214 F g−1. In addition, we assemble an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device, which uses NiMoO4-PANI and activated carbon (AC) as positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The ACS device demonstrates 33.07 Wh kg−1 at 240 W kg−1, 93 F g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 and a high retention value (about 98.6% of original value after 5000 cycles) of capacitance. Finally, two white LEDs can work for 15 min by using the ASC device (finished charging). Thus it can be seen that such unique properties of the binary nanocomposite strongly couple the advantages of the impressively high cyclic stability of NiMoO4 and good electrical conductivity of PANI, respectively, which mainly give credit to synergistic effects of NiMoO4 and PANI.
