We report chemical in situ deposition of conducting polymer poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets through a simple hydrothermal polymerization method. The functional groups on graphene oxide (GO) were directly employed as an oxidant to trigger the polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), and the GO nanosheets were reduced into rGO accordingly in an aqueous environment. Well anchoring of ultrathin PEDOT on rGO through this oxidant-free method was confirmed by UV-Vis spectrum, FT-IR spectrum, SEM, and TEM analysis. The obvious enhancement of conductivity was observed after the covering of PEDOT on rGO, and this composite showed high conductivity about 88.5 S/cm. The electrochemical performance results revealed that rGO/PEDOT composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance about 202.7 F/g. The good synergetic effect between PEDOT and rGO also makes sure highly stable reversibility of composite electrode during charging/discharging process, and more than 90% initial capacitance retains after 9000 times cycles. In addition, the electrode based on rGO/PEDOT deposited on the cotton fabric shows excellent flexible ability with the evidence that 98% of the initial capacitance of electrode maintained after three thousands of free bending, which shows promising energy storage performance for flexible devices.: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
