Ni(OH)2 and Co-doped Ni(OH)2 ultrafine particles were synthesized by coprecipitation method. When the molar ratio of Ni2+:Co2+ in the precursor solution was 5:1, the resulted Co-doped Ni(OH)2 ultrafine particles displayed a high specific capacitance of 669.57 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A -1, and 94% initial specific capacitance remained after 500 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 16 A -1, showing better electrochemical performance than Ni(OH)2 ultrafine particles. The introduction of Co2+ improved the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH)2 electrode material.
