This article introduces a new configuration of the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) employing only a reduced-size rotor side converter (RSC) in tandem with a supercapacitor. In the proposed structure, the grid side converter (GSC) utilized in conventional DFIG-based WECSs is successfully eliminated. This is accomplished by employing the hydraulic transmission system (HTS) as a continuously variable and shaft decoupling transmission unit. This transforms the conventional constant-ratio drives by providing an opportunity to control the power flow through the generator's rotor circuit regardless of the wind turbine's shaft speed. This feature of HTS can be utilized to control the RSC power and ultimately regulate the supercapacitor voltage without a need for GSC. The proposed system is investigated and simulated in MATLAB Simulink at various wind speeds to validate the results and demonstrate the dynamic performance of the system.
