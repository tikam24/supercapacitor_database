Facile, electrochemical fabrication of reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) infused, Mn and Fe sulfide composites as electrodes for hybrid supercapacitors is reported. Deposition is carried out under galvanostatic mode. Electrochemical kinetics parameters are scrutinized by chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry. Exchange current density is lower for Mn2+ rich baths, which enhances charge-transfer limitations. Diffusion coefficient, specific capacitance and charge-transfer rate are increased by the presence of rGO network due to the enhanced surface area and interaction with electrolytes. From X-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier-transform infrared and Raman spectral data, nature of the bonding and crystal geometry are explored. Marcasite phase and Fe3S4 phases are absent. Composition of the composite films are correlated texturally and electrochemically on specific capacitance contribution. Indigenously designed computer simulation program, ‘Crystalsim’ is used to explore crystalline parameters. From galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, it is observed that Mn5Fe8S12@rGO has an optimum specific capacitance of 1611 F g–1 under chronopotentiometric mode at 1 A g–1. Nyquist analysis revealed that Mn5Fe8S12@rGO has relatively lower charge-transfer resistance and Warburg impedance when compared with Mn5Fe11S16@rGO and Mn10Fe26S37@rGO. Pyrite phase is enhancing the specific energy and coulombic efficiency, whereas rGO retards the charge-transfer resistance. For real-time deployment, time constant, charging-discharging characteristics and cycling stability for Mn5Fe8S12@rGO || MnS@rGO and Mn5Fe11S16@rGO || MnS@rGO hybrid capacitors are explored. Capacity retention is 92.8% at 1032 h with a one time-constant of 908.6 s for Mn5Fe8S12@rGO || MnS@rGO.
