Monoclinic Yb2S3 thin films have been deposited using hydrothermal method for the first time in literature. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of Yb2S3 thin film show non-uniform distribution of nanorods and nanoparticles. Water-Yb2S3 liquid–solid film system shows hydrophilic nature with the contact angle of 49.7°. Yb2S3 thin film shows better electrochemical supercapacitive response within the negative potential window of − 1.0 to 0 V/SCE in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Yb2S3 thin film achieved highest specific capacitance of 270 Fg−1 at 5 mVs−1 scan rate, indicating a potential anode electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitor devices. Impedance spectrum of Yb2S3 thin film shows supercapacitive behaviour of material.
