In this article the association of batteries and supercapacitors to supply a micro-hybrid vehicle will be presented. The specific power of the supercapacitors and its high lifetime (1 million of cycles) makes it very attractive for the high power applications. Unfortunately, the specific energy of this component is very low. For that this technology is associated with battery to supply the starter-alternator. Before the simulation and the validation of results, an identification of the starter alternator parameters is made. After that, the load torque generated by the ICE during the startup phase is computed. In the next part, all the hybrid energy supply (HES) is simulated using Matlab-Simulink software. In the last part, the validation of the HES supply for startup and the charging of the storage systems (battery and supercapacitor) when the vehicle is turned on. Â© 2011 IEEE.
