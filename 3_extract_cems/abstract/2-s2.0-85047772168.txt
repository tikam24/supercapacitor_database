We introduce the use of xurography as a facile plotter-assisted integration technique for an all-solid-state flexible micro-supercapacitors (mSCs), which is cost-effective and time-saving, by which 162 mSCs can be simultaneously produced on an A4 sized PET film. 3D-graphene networks (3DGNs) grown on a SiO2 template exhibited large surface area and outstanding electrical conductivity as active materials for mSCs due to the interconnected 3D structure. By simply mixing SWNTs and Ag NWs with 3DGNs, an excellent specific areal capacitance of 19 mF cmâˆ’2 was obtained from an as-prepared 3DGN/SWNT/AgNW mSC on a flexible substrate and 84% of the initial capacitance was maintained after 10,000 cycles. The device exhibited stable electrochemical performances under various deformation conditions. The subsequent transfer onto a textile further allowed the fabrication of a wearable particle detector, which confirmed a practical application of a mSC with good performance integrated via a plotter-assisted technique.
