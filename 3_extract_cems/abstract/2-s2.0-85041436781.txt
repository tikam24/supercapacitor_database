In this study, we report a two-dimensional In2O3 nanodiscs for solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. It exhibits high specific capacitance of 622 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and 412 F g−1 at 7 A g−1 based on individual electrodes. Further, the SSCs demonstrate a wide potential window of 1.0 V, excellent specific capacitance of 89.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, a high energy density of 12.5 W h kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1, and an outstanding stability with ∼97% rate retention after 10,000 cycles. The superior performances of the SSCs with 2D In2O3 nanodiscs material suggest their potential opportunity for future electronic applications.
