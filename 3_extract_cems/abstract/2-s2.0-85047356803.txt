Electrochemically stable MnO2/PIn nanocomposite was synthesized via in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization process. The structural and morphological properties were studied through FTIR and FESEM characterizing techniques. Sphere like PIn and MnO2 nanorods offers interacting surface for charge transfer action. The electrochemical properties were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The significant enhancement in capacitance value with 95% coulombic efficiency and relatively low equivalent series resistance (ESR)∼0.4 Ω proved that MnO2/PIn nanocomposite is an excellent performer as an electrode material in the spectrum of supercapcitors and optoelectronic devices.
