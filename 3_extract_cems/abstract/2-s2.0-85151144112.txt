In this paper, we have reported a low-concentration active electrolyte of KBrO3 for the supercapacitor’s application. The electrochemical processes were carried out in two concentrations of KBrO3 with 0.2 and 0.4 M. Additionally, we have reported a novel strategy for doping graphene during its fabrication process with a potassium bromide (KBr) solution. The chemical doping of graphene with KBr improved the electrochemical properties of graphene used as supercapacitors. HRTEM images confirmed the multi-layer graphene obtained by CO2 laser based on polyimide. The effect of KBr on the graphene lattice has been studied using Raman spectroscopy. The two electrodes of graphene and KBr-doped graphene were subjected to the electrochemical properties study as a supercapacitor by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques. The results exhibited the successful method of graphene doping and the stability of using KBrO3 as a suitable electrolyte for electrochemical processes with this lower molarity. The specific capacitance of the pristine graphene capacitor in 0.2 M of KBrO3 was 33 Fg−1, while this value increased up to 70 Fg−1 for KBr-doped graphene in 0.4 M of KBrO3. The specific capacity in mAhg−1 has also increased twofold. The results exhibited the possibility of using KBrO3 as an electrolyte. The supercapacitor performance almost showed good stability in the life cycle.
