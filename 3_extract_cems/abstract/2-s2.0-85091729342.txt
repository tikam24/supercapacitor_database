A new double-ligand Ni-MOF material was prepared using a one-step synthesis preparation and was evaluated as a supercapacitor electrode material. The synergistic effects provided by the double ligand and nickel significantly improved the material’s redox reaction capability, due to the large number of conjugated systems that contributed to improving the electronic conductivity of the material. When this novel Ni-MOF was used as the electrode material in a supercapacitor, a specific capacitance of 318 F g−1 was 1 A g−1. After 4000 cycles, the capacitance of the material was essentially unchanged, indicating excellent cycle stability. In addition, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) were assembled using the novel Ni-MOF material together with activated carbon (AC). The power density of the ASC was 225 W kg−1 at an energy density of 30.7 Wh kg−1. This reported work demonstrates an expansion of the application range of Ni-MOF and provides a new approach for the preparation of novel electrode materials.
