LaxSr1-xFeO3 (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) nanofibers (LSF-x) were synthesized by combining electrospinning and calcination. The structure, morphology and electrochemical behaviors of LSF-x were comprehensively researched through XRD, SEM, TEM/HRTEM, BET and electrochemical measurement. As a result, the obtained La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 nanofibers manifest prominent performances as an electrode material for supercapacitor application sinvolving enlarged specific surface area (27.96 m2·g−1) and rational pore size distribution. The specific capacitance of La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 reaches up to 523.2 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4, which is even better than other LSF-x and LaFeO3 derivatives materials previously reported. Besides, the La0.7Sr0.3FeO3 also possesses excellent rate capability and cycling stability with 83.8% of initial capacitance at 20 A·g−1 over 5000 cycles. Therefore, our study will be of great value in synthesizing perovskite-type oxide nanofibers and electrode material for applications in supercapacitor.
