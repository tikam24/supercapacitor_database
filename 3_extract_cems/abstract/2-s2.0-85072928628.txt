By incorporating a parallel wire collector in electrospinning process with a hot-drawing treatment, carbon fiber mats with well-aligned coal-derived carbon nanofibers (CCNFs) were successfully fabricated. It was previously reported that the well-aligned fiber orientation could facilitate the mass transfer of electrolyte ion. In this paper, we demonstrate that surface oxygen concentration, pore area/volume and electrical conductivity were also significantly enhanced by the well-aligned carbon fiber, compared the randomly aligned CCNFs. Consequently, the well-aligned CCNFs generated the areal specific capacitance of 1590 mF cm−2 at the current density of 4 mA cm−2 in 6M KOH solution, which outperformed the aligned carbon nanofibers derived from adding carbon nanotubes or graphene as fillers into polymer precursors. Finally, a carbon/carbon supercapacitor cell was assembled with the well-aligned CCNFs mats as electrodes, showing the areal energy density of 15 μWh cm−2 at the power density of 0.3 mW cm−2, as well as gravimetric energy density of 30 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 0.6 kW kg−1 and the volumetric energy density of 18.2 mWh cm−3 at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 88.6% specific capacitance of full cell was retained after 5000 cycles of charge-discharge running at current density of 1 A g−1
