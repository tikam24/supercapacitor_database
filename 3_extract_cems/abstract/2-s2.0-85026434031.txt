In this study, supercapacitors based on magnetic conductive polymer-graphene nanocomposites were investigated. The graphene was synthesized from graphite oxide and graphite by Hummers and electrochemical exfoliation method, respectively. The graphene was characterized using Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction. The nanocomposite was obtained by mixing graphene with polypyrrole or magnetic polypyrrole. The conductive ink consisted of the nanocomposite, solvent and binder. The supercapacitor electrodes were manufactured with the conductive ink by using copper foil. Supercapacitor cells were composed of the separator (PTFE) and electrolyte (ionic liquid materials or acids). The cells were characterized by measurement of the specific capacitance and charge-discharge characteristics. Cyclic Voltammogram (CV) plots and scan rate studies showed a good cell structure and charge-discharge characteristics. So far, 255 F/g specific capacitance values have been achieved. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis showed a healthy cell performance and a fast capacitor response.
