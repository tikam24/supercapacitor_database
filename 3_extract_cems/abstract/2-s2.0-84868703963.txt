Aiming to the synthesis of graphene/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) hybrid materials, an arcing-discharge method for an efficient and large-scale production has been developed. Furthermore, the performance of supercapacitors using this graphene/SWNT hybrid has been studied, which gives a remarkable result with the specific capacitance of ~350. F/g at 2.7. V and an energy density of ~68. Wh/kg in the standard industry organic electrolyte system. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
