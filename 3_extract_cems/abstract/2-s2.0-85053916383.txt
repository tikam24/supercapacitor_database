Due to the volatility and randomness, the direct grid-connection of wind power resources will influence the safe and stable operation of power system, so a hybrid energy storage system composed of the super capacitor, battery and compressed air energy storage is proposed. The super capacitor and battery comprise the energy storage system to smooth the short time scale power fluctuation, and the compressed air energy storage comprises the energy storage system to realize the long time scale peak load shifting, which controls the tie line power according to the upper and lower power limits. The cost model of the hybrid energy storage system with the consideration of the life loss is established. The simulative results verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid energy storage system, and it has better economy compared with the other energy storage schemes.
