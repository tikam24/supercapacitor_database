This paper introduces a method for modeling and identification of a simple dynamical system described by fractional-order differential equation. The Grï¿½nwald-Letnikov fractional-order derivative is approximated by a discrete-time Laguerre-based model, giving rise to a new discrete-time integerorder equation modeling the considered system. An application example involves a supercapacitor charging circuit. High accuracy of parametric identification for the circuit model, under moderate computational effort, is achieved on a real-life experimental data.
