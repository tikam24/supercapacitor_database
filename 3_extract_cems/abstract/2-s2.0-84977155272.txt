In this paper, conductive composite films were synthetized based on oxidized cellulosic nanofibres (CNFo), 1-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole and pyrrole. The 1-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole was reduced into N-(3-aminopropyl)pyrrole before being grafted on carboxyl groups of CNFo. Oxidative polymerization of polypyrrole (Ppy) was conducted in an iron(III) chloride (FeCl3) solution, onto the N-(3-aminopropyl)pyrrole grafted. The resulting composite films were characterized by FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), tensile strength measurement, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), wettability and electrical conductivity measurements. The grafting of 1-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole played a leading role in improving these properties by increasing potential connections between chains of conducting polymer and cellulose fibres. The outcomes show that the PPy nanoparticles coating on the grafted films increase a lot of characteristics of our composite such as wettability, mechanical properties, thermal protection and more importantly the electrical conductivity which was improved by a 10E5 factor in comparison to the uncoated films. In this condition, this nanostructure could be considered in the design of high-performance electrodes for supercapacitor, battery and sensor applications.
