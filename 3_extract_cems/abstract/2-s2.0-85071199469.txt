Different biomass components have different effects on the microstructures and physicochemical properties of biocarbons. And the properties of biocarbons still need to be further improved. Nanoscale/microscale graphene-like sheets are synthesized with KOH as micropore-forming agent, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O as mesopore-forming agent and graphite catalyst. It is systematically researched to get the effects of biomass components on them. Cane sugar can form flat graphene-like nanosheets with high conductivity. Their performance drops sharply at 100Ag-1, indicating that biocarbons need a support of carbon skeleton to operate normally at high current density. Bagasse pith contains amount of cellulose and hemicellulose, which are good for forming pores. Bagasse pith-derived graphene-like sheets possess large specific surface area (2923.58m2g-1), high specific capacitance (514.14Fg-1 at 0.3Ag-1 and 372.57Fg-1 at 100Ag-1) and high energy density. Due to homogeneous coated doping with graphene-like nanosheets, sugarcane pith-derived graphene-like sheets possess low impedance (Rs=0.02Ω), high rate capability (maintained 82.34% from 0.3 to 100Ag-1) and high cycling stability (maintained 101.51% after 5000 cycles), which is better than lots of graphene doping. Sugarcane skin contains more lignin which has hexagonal carbon rings. The graphitization extent of sugarcane skin-derived graphene-like sheets is significantly high. The results provide references to select carbon precursors, and show a novel graphene-like doping method which is suitable for different materials and various fields.
