Metal Organic Frameworks or related carbon materials are the ideal materials for supercapacitors due to their high surface area and unique porous structure. Here, we propose a new green and recyclable synthesis method of porous carbon. Aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) and trimesic acid (BTC) are employed as raw materials to obtain aluminium trimesic (denoted as Al-BTC) via their covalent reaction. Then, the porous carbon is obtained through carbonization and dissolving process to remove the aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Al(OH)3 is recovered by the Bayer method for the next batch. The SEM images show that the porous carbon has rugby-like morphology with the same of 400 nm wide and 1000 nm long which indicates the porous carbon with c/a ratio of 2.5 providing the largest specific volume surface area. The sample offers 306.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and it can retain 72.2% even at the current density of 50 A g−1. In addition, the porous carbon provides excellent durability of 50,000 cycles at 50 A g−1 with only 5.05% decline of capacitance. Moreover, the porous carbon has an ultrafast charge acceptance, and only 4.4 s is required for one single process, which is promising for application in electric vehicles.
