Abstract: Rational construction of electrode materials with exclusive structures and compositions are highly attractive for improving the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors (SCs). In the present study, we demonstrate the construction of unique core–shell Ni−Mn−Co−S@Co(OH)2 nanoarrays on nickel foam (denoted as NMCS@COH/NF) as an attractive battery-type electrode material for SCs through the hydrothermal and electrodeposition strategies, in which the Ni−Mn−Co−S nanowires are well wrapped in the Co(OH)2 shells. Benefiting from the attractive structural properties, the NMCS@COH/NF electrode exhibits considerable electrochemical properties in the aspects of reasonable rate performance (80.3 % up to 24 A g−1), long-term cyclability (retention rate of 93.3 % undergoing 10 000 cycles), and exceptional capacity (284.85 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1). Subsequently, the NMCS@COH electrode is assembled into a hybrid supercapacitor, which delivers a good energy density of 51.1 Wh kg−1 at 751.47 W kg−1 and a maximum power density of 18411.76 W kg−1 at 31.3 Wh kg−1. This work provides a straightforward route to rational construction of the electrode materials with promising structural and electrochemical properties for SC applications.
