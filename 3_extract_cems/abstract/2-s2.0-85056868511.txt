The article examines circuits of modular multilevel converters, which show promise for the creation of an active filter with the functions of compensation for a reactive load current, its balancing, filtration of the highest harmonic currents, and short-term power supply load in automatic reclosing (AR) dead time. Circuits for distributed and concentrated connection of an energy storage unit based on supercapacitors are compared. It is shown that a circuit with a concentrated storage system is preferable, due to the simpler method of increasing storage system capacitance and the lower power consumption of the storage systems.
