Simple models for electrochemical supercapacitors are developed to describe the charge-discharge behaviors in the presence of both voltage-independent parallel leakage process and electrochemical decomposition of solvent. The models are validated by experimental data collected using a symmetric two-electrode test cell with carbon powder as the electrode layer material and stainless steel as the current collector.
