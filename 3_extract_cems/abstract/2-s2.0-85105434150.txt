In the current work, we are introducing the concept of co-electrolyte in the aqueous medium. Herein, we have prepared the bio-inspired co-electrolyte of choline chloride and potassium hydroxide, which in situ produces choline hydroxide and potassium chloride by the ion-exchange mechanism. The resultant co-electrolyte (RCE) solution exhibits decent electrochemical property than its parental salts, that is, potassium hydroxide, choline chloride. The RCE further used to enhance the energy storage ability of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The material exhibits maximum specific capacitance 394 F g−1 and higher energy density 44.3 Wh kg−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 in the presence of co-electrolyte, which is higher as compared to its preceding salts as an electrolyte. Also, the material exhibits lower equivalent series resistance, that is, 0.3 Ω in RCE. This concept can be considered as future development in the field of energy storage materials.
