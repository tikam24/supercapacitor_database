Three dimensional graphene(3D-G) was prepared by hydrothermal method, in which graphene layer increased the electron transfer within the channels. Octadecylamine(ODA) functionalized graphene/polyaniline(G-ODA/PANI) was prepared by the modification of reduced graphene materials with ODA and in situ polymerization of aniline on the surface og G-ODA. Structure, electrochemical properties and the specific capacitance contribution of the materials were analyzed. The results showed that the contribution of capacitor electrode material was originated from the pseudocapacitive properties of polyaniline. The specific capacitance of G-ODA/PANI electrode reached 1080 F/g at current density of 1 A/g, 2.57 times as high as that of graphene/polyaniline(G/PANI) electrode material. It also had a great increase in cycle stability, and the capacity retention rate was 90.8% after 10000 cycle times, increased by 9.6% compared with G/PANI.
