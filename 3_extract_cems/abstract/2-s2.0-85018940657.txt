The energy density of an electric double layer capacitor, also known as supercapacitor, depends on ion distributions in the micropores of its electrodes. Herein we study ion selectivity and partitioning of symmetric, asymmetric, and mixed ionic liquids among different pores using the classical density functional theory. We find that a charged micropore in contact with mixed ions of the same valence is always selective to the smaller ions, and the ion selectivity, which is strongest when the pore size is comparable to the ion diameters, drastically falls as the pore size increases. The partitioning behavior in ionic liquids is fundamentally different from those corresponding to ion distributions in aqueous systems whereby the ion selectivity is dominated by the surface energy and entropic effects insensitive to the degree of confinement.
