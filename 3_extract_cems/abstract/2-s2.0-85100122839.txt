Co-Ni bimetallic oxides were successfully deposited on Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets by atomic layer deposition technology and used as pseudocapacitive materials for supercapacitors. The uniform distribution of metal oxide nanoparticles on MXene nanosheets endows the pseudocapacitive materials more active sites and the synergistic effect between CoOx and NiO greatly improves the electrochemical performance. Specifically, as the deposited cycle increased to 90, the sample showed the optimal electrochemical performance with specific capacitance up to 1960 F g−1 (1 A g−1), 20.3 times higher by than that of Ti3C2Tx MXene, excellent rate capability (87.3% capacitance retention, 1–18 A g−1) and 90.2% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles.
