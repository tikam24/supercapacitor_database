Supercapacitors have evolved to meet market demands as some devices require high current power pulses. After delivering the pulse current, the supercapacitor is quickly recharged by the battery between the pulse cycles. This reduces the stress on the battery, extending the overall life of the battery by a factor of three or more. Supercapacitors, also called EDLCs (electrochemical double layer capacitors) or ultracapacitors, are electrochemical devices that have high capacitance and high energy density compared to other common capacitors, such as tantalum and aluminum electrolytic types. All supercapacitors are basically constructed from two carbon-based electrodes (mostly activated carbon having very high surface area), an electrolyte (aqueous or organic) and a separator that allows the transfer of ions, while providing electronic insulation between the electrodes. By connecting supercapacitors in parallel with the battery, the supercapacitors reduce the voltage drop that would occur in the battery, which in turn increases its life.
