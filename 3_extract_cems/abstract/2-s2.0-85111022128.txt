Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrode materials have become a hot subject for supercapaitors. Herein, Ni-MOFs grown on Co nanoparticles modified carbon nanofibers (CNFs) (C-Co@MOF) are prepared via a facile process. Interestingly, the presence of Co nanoparticles in CNFs not only boosts the hybridization of CNF and MOFs, but also releases Co ions to participate in the growth of MOF, leading to a favorable electrochemical behavior. In detail, the specific capacitance of C-Co@MOF reaches 1201.6 F g−1 that exceeds those of C-M@MOFs (M = Ni, V, Mo, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) and CNF@MOF. More importantly, an asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor is assembled using C-Co@MOF and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes derived from polyaniline as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, representing a high energy density of 37.0 Wh kg−1 and outstanding durability. This work highlights the superiority of electrospun CNFs modified by metal nanoparticles for the growth of MOF, showing great potential for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.
