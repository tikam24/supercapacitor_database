Abstract We report here large scale synthesis of ZnV2O6 nanostructures via facile, template free and cost effective method. For the first time hydrogen storage and supercapacitor properties of ZnV2O6 nanostructures were measured, which were found to be 1.32wt% and 380 F/g, respectively. Electrochemical supercapacitor device was fabricated using three electrode configuration and electrochemical measurements revealed ZnV2O6 nanostructures as a promising candidate for energy storage/conversion material. PL measurements on ZnV2O6 showed a broad emission centered at 392 nm. Our investigation has shown that ZnV2O6 nanostructures has the potential to be used as an energy storage material and in blue optoelectronic devices.
