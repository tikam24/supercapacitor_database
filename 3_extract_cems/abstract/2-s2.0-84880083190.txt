Polycrystalline Co0.85Se nanotubes are successfully prepared by using Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.20(OH)1.10 nanorods as precursor through a solvothermal process. The as-prepared Co 0.85Se nanotubes show efficient catalytic performance for decomposition of hydrazine hydrate at room temperature. The catalysts can be repeatedly used and their repeatability is also excellent. The Co 0.85Se nanotubes can also be applied as supercapacitor electrode materials. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements show that the Co 0.85Se nanotube electrode has a specific capacitance of 238 F g -1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 after 100 cycles of activation, and retaining 90.3% of the capacitance after the next 1900 cycles.
