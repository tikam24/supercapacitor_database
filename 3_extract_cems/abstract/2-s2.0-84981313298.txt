The hybrid layer of homo poly (pyrrole/3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/reduced graphene hydrogel (PPy/PEDOT/rGH) was firstly successfully fabricated via cyclic voltammetry. The results reveal the highly micro-nanoporous morphology of PPy/PEDOT/rGH electrode which is the efficient pathways for supporting ion diffusion into interior surface. The combination of PPy and PEDOT, possessing the synergistic effect of electrically conductive polymer, is formed on the large surface area of rGH demonstrating the high specific capacitance of 342 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1with the density of 34.63 Wh kg−1 at specific power of 202.05 kW kg−1.
