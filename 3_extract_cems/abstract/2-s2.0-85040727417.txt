The composite NiS-NCNTs was prepared by using the nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and the C10H20N2NiS4 as the support and the precursor of NiS, respectively, through the heat treatment method. The influence of treatment temperature on the morphology, structure, texture and supercapacitor performance of the composite materials was investigated. At 400℃, the pyrolysis of C10H20N2NiS4 results into the formation of α-NiS, and thus the composite of NiS-NCNTs was formed. However, the small amount of NiS with large particle size is produced at 400℃ since the low temperature. At 500℃, the size of NiS become smaller and its amount increases. At 600℃, the α-NiS transforms to β-NiS and the new phase of Ni9S8 formed. The NiS-NCNT500 prepared at 500℃ owns the highest volume of mesopores with size of 2-5 nm, facilitating ion transport, and the largest specific surface area for charge accumulation. Therefore, as the electrode materials of supercapacitor, it exhibits a high specific capacitance and good durability of chare-discharge cycles.
