Herein, macroporous carbon sheets (MCS) was synthesized by a re-assembly engineering. In this process, surfactant is combined with oligomeric resin to form micelles, which are re-assembled on the pre-prepared hybrid sheet through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic action, resulting in the reconstruction of relatively regular macropores on the sheet. The obtained MCS maintains the morphology of nanosheet with obvious circular macropores, high specific surface area and pore volume, which improves the charge transfer efficiency and is favorable electrochemical energy storage. As the electrode material for a supercapacitor, the MCS exhibits a high specific capacitance, excellent rate performance and long-term stability, which make the MCS an ideal electrode material for electrochemical energy storage.
