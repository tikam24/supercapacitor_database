This paper report a new biodegradable epidermis of onion (Allium cepa) doped with low viscosity ionic liquid as novel electrolyte for EDLC application. The porous membrane used in present study was epidermis of onion (onion peel membrane) and low viscosity ionic liquid (IL) i.e. 1-ethyl 3-methyl imidazolium thiocynate. The electrical, structural, optical characterization was carried out in detail. The optical micro-graphs show addition in amorphosity with adding IL. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed the interaction between ionic liquid and membrane as well as composite nature of membrane electrolyte. Impedance spectroscopy revealed the twofold enhancement in conductivity value by doping IL. Electrical double layer supercapacitor (EDLC) has been fabricated using carbon nanotube (CNT). Cyclic voltammetry and low frequency impedance spectroscopy data further affirm the reasonable value of specific capacitance (Csp = 9.2F/g).
