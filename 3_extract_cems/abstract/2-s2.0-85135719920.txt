Fractional calculus is a powerful tool for describing diffusion phenomena, anomalous behaviors, and in general, systems with highly complex dynamics. However, the application of fractional operators for modeling purposes, produces a dimensional problem. In this paper, the fractional models of the RC, RL, RLC electrical circuits, a supercapacitor, a bank of supercapacitors, a LiFePO4 battery and a direct current motor are presented. A correction parameter is included in their formulation in order to preserve dimensionality in the physical equations. The optimal value of this parameter was determined via particle swarm optimization algorithm using numerical simulations and experimental data. Thus, a direct and effective approach for the construction of dimensionally corrected fractional models with power, exponential-decay and constant proportional Caputo hybrid derivative is presented. To show the effectiveness of the procedure, the time-response of the models is compared with experimental data and the modeling error is computed. The numerical solutions of the models were obtained using a numerical method based on the Adams methods.
