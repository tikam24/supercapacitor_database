Mn3O4 and Ce doped Mn3O4 were synthesized via a sol-gel route using metal nitrates as raw materials and citric acid as the chelating agent. The gel precursors were calcined at 300 °C for 12 h in a muffle furnace. Their morphology and structure were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material was investigated comparatively by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The experimental results indicated that Cedoping did not change the structure of Mn3O4 but greatly affected the morphology and considerably enhanced the electrochemical performance of Mn3O4. A specific capacitance of 477 F·g-1 was obtained when the mole ratio of Ce ion to total metal ions was 3%, which was 43.7% higher than that of the undoped material. Moreover, Ce-doping significantly improved the capacitance retention ability. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
