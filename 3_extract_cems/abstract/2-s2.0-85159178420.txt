This work constructs a 1D hollow particle-based carbon nanofibers (HCNFs) derived from Zn-based metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) particles embedded in biomass-based electrospinning nanofibers as high-performance supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. Abundant mesopores are introduced by the pyrolysis of MOFs, which generates uniformly distributed electrolyte storage pools for a fast electrolyte ions channel. Owing to its uniquely hierarchical pore structure, the derived HCNFs exhibit much enhanced supercapacitive performance. The prepared HCNF-1000 electrode has not only a high specific capacitance (229.6 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1) but also good rate performance (176.8 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, 99.1 F g−1 at 30 A g−1). The two-electrode symmetrical system HCNF-SC has an energy density of 5.1 Wh kg−1 when the power density is 0.5 kW kg−1. HCNF-1000-based solid-state supercapacitor HCNF-FSC shows good electrochemical performance even in different folded states, displaying the potential application value for the development of portable wearable devices.
