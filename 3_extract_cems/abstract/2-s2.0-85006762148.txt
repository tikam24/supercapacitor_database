The following paperwork presents a multiphase converter for charging of energy storage elements. Modular principle is implemented for the realization of the proposed circuit on the base of resonant inverter topology with reverse diodes and switching capacitor voltage limitation. The converter consists of six identical modules. Simulation examinations of are carried out verifying the circuit functionality. Results from the converter operation are presented. Main advantages of the proposed topology are higher output power capability and soft-switching (ZVS).
