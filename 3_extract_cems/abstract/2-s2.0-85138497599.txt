Structural engineering involving pore configuration tuning and specific surface area enhancement is an effective strategy to improve the electrochemical properties of carbon-based capacitors. Herein, the hierarchical porous carbons are extracted from natural waste cottons as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors via facile carbonization and citrate modification processes. The optimal PC-K (porous carbon with potassium citrate as activator) sample is equipped with remarkable mesopore configuration (1292.9 m2 g−1), considerable specific surface area (1727.9 m2 g−1) and even premier heteroatom content (17.1 at%), owing to the well-designed structural engineering. Further, it displays superb electrochemical performances including high capacity of 273.7 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1 (maintaining 203.8 F g−1 at 10 A g−1), and long cycling stability with 97.49% capacitance retention after 8000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g−1, indicating the significant application potential. Simultaneously, the maximum energy density reaches almost 9.93 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 350 W kg−1 in the two-electrode device. Extensive source, inexpensive cost, and superior electrochemical performances unambiguously suggest that the cotton-derived hierarchical porous carbon materials can be rendered great practical value and broad prospects for supercapacitors.
