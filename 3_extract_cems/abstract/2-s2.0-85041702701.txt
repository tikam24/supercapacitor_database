Improving performance of Electric Vehicles (EV) has been trends of automobile market in recent time. The key to this improvement is the design of efficient energy management scheme for Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). The HESS may be form by taking Battery and Ultracapacitor (UC) together or Fuel Cell and Ultracapacitor together or all the three together. This paper investigates the performance of different types of rechargeable batteries such as Lithium Ion, Lead Acid, Nickel Cadmium and Nickel Metal Hydride types to be connected with Ultracapacitor to form our HESS. These different combinations are connected and applied in MATLAB/SIMULINK to check the performance of each combination to find out the optimal efficiency of battery and efficient energy management scheme when battery is connected with Ultracapacitor for electric vehicle applications. The selection of best battery and scheme is based on the performance analysis of the parameters like operating temperature, reliability, current and voltage of the battery, state of charge of battery and rate of charge/discharge. This investigation will lead to easy selection of type of battery in HESS which will also improve the life of the battery when connected with Ultracapacitor otherwise battery life is short when peak loads are handled.
