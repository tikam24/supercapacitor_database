Supercapacitors have many advantages, such as high power density, fast charge discharge ability and good cycle stability. Cobalt aluminum double hydroxides (CoAl-LDHs) as electrode materials of supercapacitors have good electrochemical stability, such as good charge and mass transport properties, high specific capacitance and good cycle stability. In this paper, different preparation methods and properties of CoAl-LDHs electrode materials for supercapacitors are reviewed, including hydrothermal method, coprecipitation method, homogeneous precipitation method, sol-gel method and ion exchange method. At the same time, different modification methods of CoAl-LDHs are summarized, including carbon material modification, metal doping modification, Ni(OH)2 modification and MoS2 modification. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different preparation methods and the differences in the structure and electrochemical performance of the prepared materials, the related research of CoAl-LDHs electrode materials is systematically summarized, and the future development direction of CoAl-LDHs electrode materials for supercapacitors is prospected.
