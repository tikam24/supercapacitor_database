Here, a controlled green synthesis route involving hydrothermal pre-carbonization cum pyrolysis is reported that converts cucumber into graphene-like carbon nanosheets for supercapacitor application. Transmission electron microscopy analysis reveals the formation of ultra-thin carbon nanosheets with distributed pores. This cucumber derived carbon exhibits high specific capacitance of 143 F g−1 in aqueous electrolyte. The two-electrode symmetric cell exhibits a specific capacitance of 58 F g−1 at high current density, and high capacitance retention of 97% after 1000 cycles. This simple low-cost process involving widely available cucumber as biomass precursor is a promising, commercially viable approach for developing high-performance supercapacitors.
