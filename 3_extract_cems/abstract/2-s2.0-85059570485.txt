A novel NiO hierarchical microspheres/nanofibers (NiO HMSs/NFs) composites assembled on nickel foam was designed by annealing the well-defined organic–inorganic layered nickel hydroxide composites prepared by a simple procedure. When evaluated as electrode for supercapacitor application, the NiO HMSs/NFs exhibits a high specific capacitance of 809.1 F·g −1 at 1 A·g −1 and good cycling stability, specifically retaining 85% of the initial capacitance after 2000 charge–discharge cycles at 5 A·g −1 .
