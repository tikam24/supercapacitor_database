MoO3, with advantages of abundance, non-toxicity and multiple oxidation states, has recently been attracted increasing attention in supercapacitors field as a potential electrode material. Here, a novel composite TiO2/MoO3 had been synthesized and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectra, XPS, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. The electrochemical results showed the composite has enhanced electrochemical properties with the maximum specific capacitance of 141 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1, which is higher than pure MoO3 at the same test condition. The improved electrochemical properties could be attributed to the synergetic effect and the formation of Ti−O−Mo bonds between TiO2 nanoparticles and MoO3 nanobelts and the increment of specific surface area. This work would not only promote the study about MoO3-based electrode materials in supercapacitors, but also extended to other transition metal oxides with similar structures.
