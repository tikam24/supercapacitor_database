Activated N-doped porous carbons (a-NCs) were synthesized by pyrolysis and alkali activation of graphene incorporated melamine formaldehyde resin (MF). The moderate N doping levels, mesopores rich porous texture, and incorporation of graphene enable the applications of a-NCs in surface and conductivity dependent electrode materials for supercapacitor and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Under optimal activation temperature of 700 Â°C, the afforded sample, labeled as a-NC<inf>700</inf>, possesses a specific surface area of 1302 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, a N fraction of 4.5%, and a modest graphitization. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, a-NC<inf>700</inf> offers a high specific capacitance of 296 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>, an acceptable rate capability, and a high cycling stability in 1 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte. As a result, a-NC<inf>700</inf> supercapacitor delivers energy densities of 5.0-3.5 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> under power densities of 83-1609 W kg<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, a-NC<inf>700</inf> also demonstrates high electrocatalytic activity for I<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup> reduction. When employed as a counter electrode (CE) of DSSC, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.9% is achieved, which is comparable to that of the Pt CE based counterpart (7.1%). The excellent capacitive and photovoltaic performances highlight the potential of a-NCs in sustainable energy devices.
