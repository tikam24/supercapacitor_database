In this work, a hierarchically activated porous carbon (APC) was synthesized using fluorine-containing metal-organic framework via facile combined carbonization and KOH activation treatments. The influences of activation conditions on the surface structures and electrochemical performance of APC were systematically studied. Afterwards, the electrochemical responses of APC electrode were further assessed from the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge examinations by 6 M KOH electrolyte. The as-obtained APC electrode delivered the high specific capacitances of 540.8 and 280 F g−1 at 1 and 500 A g−1, correspondingly with superior capacitance retention of 94% after 250,000 cycles even at 100 A g−1, which is showing that its outstanding capacitance, remarkable rate capacity, and very-long cyclic life. Furthermore, the as-assembled APC-based symmetrical supercapacitor offers a superb energy density of 19 Wh kg−1 at 182 W kg−1, indicating its large-scale application. Thus, this work proposes a potential route to synthesize highly efficient porous carbon material for the future development of energy storage systems.
