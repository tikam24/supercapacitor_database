In this work, a pulsed electric current is applied to a specimen simultaneously with a quasi-static uniaxial tensile load. To do so a short-time current pulse generator, inducing supercapacitors was designed and manufactured. The experiments with low operating voltage were performed at different electric current pulse period and frequency. The electroplasticity of AZ31 magnesium alloy under a pulsed electric current is investigated experimentally. Ap-propriate control of current parameters makes it possible to change not only the stress levels in the process, but also achieved plastic strain values. The result of the present study with low operating voltage is expected to provide a basis to develop advanced metal forming processes using electroplasticity.
