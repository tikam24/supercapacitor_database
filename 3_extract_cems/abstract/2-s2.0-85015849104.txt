An interconnected needle-like structure of Bi2O3 has been directly grown on stainless steel (SS) substrate by binder-free successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The structural study confirms the formation of cubic δ-Bi2O3 phase. The coverage of interconnected needle-like network structure has been seen from surface morphological study. The electrochemical performance of Bi2O3 has been tested as an electrode material through cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in aqueous electrolyte. The electrochemical tests manifest the pseudocapacitive behavior of Bi2O3 thin-film electrode with a specific capacitance of 329.6 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate. In addition, the Bi2O3 electrode exhibits long-term cycling performance with 72% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles.
