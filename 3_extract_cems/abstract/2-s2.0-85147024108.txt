The graphitization and porous structure of carbon materials have been the focus of research on the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors. In this work, highly graphitized porous carbon (HPCS) is fabricated from biowaste sunflower shells using potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an activator. The effects of the mass ratio of KOH to raw material and activation temperature on the electrochemical properties are studied in detail. The results show that highly graphitized porous carbon after activation at 800°C for 2 h (HPCS-800–2) exhibits obvious graphitized stripes with a spacing of ca. 0.34 nm and a lower ID/IG value (0.797) than that of pristine carbon with non-activation (0.917). The HPCS-800–2 reaches a high specific capacitance of 403 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. In addition, the HPCS-800–2//HPCS-800–2 symmetric supercapacitor device displays outstanding higher energy density of 20.84 Wh kg−1 than that of the YP50//YP50 device (8.18 Wh kg−1).
