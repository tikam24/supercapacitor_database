Aiming at the large loss of regenerative braking energy, a novel metro energy feedback system was proposed and its control method and energy management strategy were studied. First, the proposed energy feedback system and the traditional system were compared. By introducing the hybrid energy storage device consisting of supercapacitor and UPS battery, the proposed solution can absorb all the regenerative braking energy, reduce the voltage fluctuation and peak power demand of traction grid, make full use of the idle UPS resources in the station and reduce the cost of energy storage device. Then, the ideal power distribution relationship between source, storage and load was analyzed. Based on droop control commonly used in microgrids, the enhanced droop control method for battery SOC reset was proposed, which can effectively control the traction bus voltage and allocate the power reasonably. The closed-loop control of the battery SOC can fully utilize the smoothing ability of the battery and ensure the emergency function of UPS. Simulation and experimental results verify feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed energy feedback system and its control method.
