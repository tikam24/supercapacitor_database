In this research, a kind of non-carbonized reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-cellulose nanofibers (CNF) film is constructed by a combination of filtration and chemical reduction. In the hybrid, RGO enhances conductivity of CNF, and CNF as an idea spacer not only prevents stacking of RGO but also gives the film good mechanical properties including mechanical strength and flexibility. The synergistic effect of both endows the film with good electrochemical storage performance and outstanding mechanical properties. The hybrid film can be directly assembled into a symmetrical supercapacitor that shows an outstanding cycle stability, excellent rate performance, good mechanical strength and flexibility. Moreover, the film presents a high specific capacitance of 120 mF cm−2, energy density of 536 μWh cm−2 (32 Wh kg−1) and power density of 193 mW cm−2 (53 kW kg−1). Additionally, the film can be used as a substrate to graft other components.
