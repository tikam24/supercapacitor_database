The evolution of the supercapacitor technology and the introduction of different types of such devices are discussed. The technology has evolved significantly with the introduction of low-voltage cylindrical devices for dc applications, such as voltage hold-up for clocks in microwave ovens and VCRs. Advancements in the technology have also led to the development and introduction of a new series of small prismatic pulse supercapacitors. The new generation of pulse supercapacitors are characterized by significantly low equivalent series resistance (ESR), enabling them to supply peak current on demand while charging from primary Li-ion or standard AA or AAA batteries. Their design enables their deployment on small CCAs where they are suited for power consuming applications, such as wireless cards and high-density data transfer in portable devices. It is being observed that supercapacitor technologies are also evolving to enable a wider range of applications.
