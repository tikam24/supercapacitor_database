In this paper, a series of partially sulfurized iron–cobalt oxide (FCOS) nanoparticles were embedded in carbon nanofibers (FCOS@CNF) via a simple electrospinning method and followed by a hydrothermal sulfurization process. The sulfurization degree of iron–cobalt oxide nanoparticles can be further controlled by tuning the hydrothermal reaction time. The self-supported FCOS@CNF samples with hierarchical nanostructure can not only effectively prevent the detaching of the FCOS nanoparticles but also provide abundant electrochemical active sites. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, the FCOS@CNF-10 electrode presents a high specific capacitance (1039 F⋅g−1 at 1 A⋅g−1), a good rate performance (over 69.4% of capacitance retention from 1 to 15 A⋅g−1), and a long cycle lifespan (88.3% of capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 10 A⋅g−1). A unique (FCOS@CNF-10//F-RGO) asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled using the FCOS@CNF-10 sample as the positive electrode and the freeze-dried reductive graphene oxide (F-RGO) as the negative electrode. The hybrid device exhibits excellent electrochemical properties, including a high specific capacity, a long cycle life (86% after 5000 cycles at 10 A⋅g−1), and a maximum energy density of 24.2 Wh⋅kg−1@725.4 W⋅kg−1.
