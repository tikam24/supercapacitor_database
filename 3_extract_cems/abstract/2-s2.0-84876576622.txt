Novel Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors were developed containing composite cathodes of a conducting polymer-either polyaniline (PANI) or polypyrrole (PPy)-with Li(Mn<inf>1/3</inf>Ni<inf>1/3</inf>Fe<inf>1/3</inf>)O<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles. Activated carbon (AC) anodes were used in the presence of an organic electrolyte. Using a PANI composite electrode resulted in a cell with outstanding supercapacitive behavior, even at high currents. It showed better cycleability than the cells using a PPy composite electrode or pristine material. The cell with a PANI composite electrode delivered high specific capacitances of 140, 93, and 56 F g<sup>-1</sup> at current densities of 0.72, 1.45 and 2.15 A g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The observed capacitances are the best yet reported for hybrid supercapacitors based on Li-intercalating materials in organic electrolytes. The hybrid supercapacitor containing PANI delivered maximum energy and power densities of 49 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> and 3 kW kg <sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential of developing polymer-encapsulated, Li-intercalating materials for high-performance, Li-ion, hybrid supercapacitors. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
