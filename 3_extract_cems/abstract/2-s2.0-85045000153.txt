Porous carbon spheres (PCS) derived from lignin have been prepared through a facile method and fabricated as electrodes for electric double-layer capacitors. Spherical shaped mixtures of lignosulfonate and crystalized KOH are formed by spray drying of a solution of lignosulfonate and KOH. Activation by KOH is performed at high temperatures along with lignosulfonate carbonization. With an appropriate pore structure, the obtained PCS have a specific surface area of 1372.87 m2 g−1 and show a capacitance of 340 F g−1 in 3 M KOH at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, a symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using the PCS as electrodes show a maximum capacitance of 68.5 F g−1, and an energy density of 9.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1. The capacity retention is more than 94.5% after 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles. The excellent characteristics seem to be ascribed to the pore structures of PCS that have a large specific surface area and a low electrical resistance.
