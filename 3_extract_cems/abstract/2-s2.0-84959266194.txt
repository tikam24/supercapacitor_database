The porous carbons have been prepared by chemical activation using commercial activated carbons as precursors and KOH as the chemical agent, and the MnO2 and MnO2-loaded porous carbons have been synthesized via the hydrothermal method using the Mn(SO4)2·H2O and (NH4)2S2O8 as the reagents. The morphology and structure of the obtained materials are characterized by the SEM, XRD and N2 sorption. The obtained MnO2 exhibits rod-like morphology, which can be indexed to a pure tetragonal phase [space group: P42/mnm] of β-MnO2. The porous carbons and MnO2-loaded porous carbons show a well-developed porosity. The electrochemical tests indicate that the samples have excellent performances for the supercapacitors.
