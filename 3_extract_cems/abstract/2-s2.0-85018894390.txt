The graphene coating was deposited on the surface of Ni foam using the chemical vapor deposition process. A large amount of flower-like ZnCo2O4 microspheres with short nanowires were formed on bare Ni foam by hydrothermal method, while large-scale ZnCo2O4 nanowires arrays homogeneously aligned and separated adequately on Ni foam coated with graphene. This ZnCo2O4 nanowire structure exhibited superior supercapacitors properties. The excellent supercapacitors were mainly attributed to the large specific surface and the porosity on the nanowires which promoted the electrons and ions transportation. In addition, graphene improved conductivity of substrate for current collecting.
