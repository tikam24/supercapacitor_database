This paper refers to an effective model using MATLAB Simulink for Regenerative Braking of a BLDC motor for an Electric Vehicle. In this method the inverter which is used to drive the motor, alone is used. The back EMF of the motor during regeneration will be less than the battery voltage even if the brake is applied while the vehicle is running at its highest speed. So the regenerated energy has to be boosted. This can be attained by controlling the switching of the lower switches of the inverter with the help of PWM switching. This boosted energy can be accumulated to the battery or supercapacitor or both. Here battery-supercapacitor energy storage is used. Thus by using electric braking a smooth braking is made possible also the driving range can be increased, since batteries are getting charged with the regenerated energy. The simulation is done by using MATLAB/Simulink.
