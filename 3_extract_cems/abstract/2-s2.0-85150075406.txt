Polyaniline (PANI) electrodes were prepared using chemical bath deposition method at various reaction bath temperatures ranging from 263 to 323 K. The specific surface area and wettability of films are significantly impacted by the polymerization temperature, which influences the electrochemical performance of electrodes. The electrode synthesized at 303 K showed a maximum specific surface area of 25 m2 g−1, specific capacitance (Cs) of 816F g−1 (0.11F cm−2) at a scan rate of 0.005 V s−1, and 89% capacitive retention after 1,000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated using PANI as a cathode and tungsten oxide (WO3) as an anode in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The fabricated PANI/H2SO4/WO3 device achieved a maximum Cs of 43 F g−1 with an energy density of 12 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.88 kW kg−1 and 72 % capacitive retention after 10,000 CV cycles.
