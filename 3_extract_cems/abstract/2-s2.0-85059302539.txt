We report a facile strategy to prepare (2D/3D) nickel self-doped NiFeOx@MnCO3 hierarchical nano heterostructured electrodes directly on Ni foam via in-situ hydrothermal method. We have demonstrated the hierarchical structures exhibit unique intercalation pseudocapacitance with surface redox contribution in overall charge storage process. The fabricated NiFeOx@MnCO3 electrode in aqueous electrolyte exhibited an enhanced specific capacity of 283 C g−1 at 1 mA when tested in KOH electrolyte. The two-electrode symmetric cell delivered a specific energy of 18 W h kg−1 at a power density of 236.1 W kg−1 with good cycling stability of 92.7% after 2000 cycles. The hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by assembling NiFeOx@MnCO3 with activated carbon delivered highest energy density of 50.38 W h kg−1 at power density of 340.3 W kg−1 with good cycling stability of 90% after 3000 cycles.
