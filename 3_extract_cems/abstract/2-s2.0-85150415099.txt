In order to stabilize the power of the microgrid tie-line，this paper adopts the combination of lithium iron phosphate batteries with super- capacitors to optimize the configuration of hybrid energy storage in the microgrid. To start with，according to the grid scheduling arrangement，the net load of microgrid is decomposed into tie-line power and total power of hybrid energy storage system. Secondly，the total power of the hybrid energy storage system is decomposed into the low- frequency component of lithium battery suppression and the high- frequency component of super- capacitor suppression through ensemble empirical modal decomposition. In addition，the equal annual cost，the flat energy contact line power and the balance target function of energy supply and demand are established via applying the adaptive particle group algorithm to solve the hybrid energy storage capacity. Depending on the charge state of energy storage，the fuzzy control algorithm was used to make secondary corrections to the charging and discharging power of lithium batteries and super capacitors to ensure the long-term operation of the energy storage system. Based on an example analysis of a grid-connected microgrid，the economy and effectiveness of the method is verified through simulation.
