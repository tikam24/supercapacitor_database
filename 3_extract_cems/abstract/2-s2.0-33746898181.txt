In this study, performances of hybrid supercapacitor with electrodes of carbon/RuO2 were investigated. Polyacrylonitrile(PAN) solution only or the solution dispersed with muti-wall carbon nanotube(MWCNT) were electrospun and followed by a steam activation and a deposition with RuO2. The performances of the electrodes were investigated in 6 M of aqueous KOH solution. The electrical conductivity of the PAN based activated carbon nanofibers(ACNFs) increased from 0.42 S/cm to 0.98 S/cm by dispersions of 3wt% of MWCNT. The capacitances of the PAN only, MWCNT/PAN, RuO2/PAN. RuO2/MWCNT/PAN based ACNFs were 140, 180, 390, 530 F/g, respectively. The capaciatnce increased by 4 times by composition with 3wt% of MWCNT and deposition of 20wt % of RuO2, though the specific surface area was reduced by deposition of RuO2 down to 1/3 of the original values.
