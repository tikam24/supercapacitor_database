Transition metal oxide manganese dioxide (MnO2) and conducting polymer polyaniline (PANI) are two types of electrode materials, which are of great interest in supercapacitor applications. In this paper, these two kinds of supercapacitor materials and their energy storage mechanism were introduced. Furthermore, the applications and disadvantages of MnO2 and PANI electrode materials and the research progress of MnO2/PANI composites were introduced in detail. In the end, the problems of electrode materials in supercapacitors and the development trend of electrode materials in the future were summarized.
