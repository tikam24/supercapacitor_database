Rare earth lanthanum doped nickel ferrite with chemical formula NiLaxFe2-xO4 having composition (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) have been synthesized using powder metallurgical route for the first time. The structural, morphological and electrochemical analysis of spinel ferrites have been studied by X-ray Powder Diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Cyclic Voltammtery (CV) and Galvanostatic Charging- Discharging (GCD) techniques. The structural analysis confirms the single–phase spinel ferrite. In order to refine the XRD data, Rietveld refinment method has been used. The Rietveld refinement specify the cubic phase of ferrite with the space group Fd3m. The surface analysis reveals the uniformally distributed spherical particles. The chemical composition of pure and La+3 doped nickel ferrites are in accordance with stoichiometric calculation. The lanthanum plays a vital role to improve the performance of electrochemical behavior for supercapactor applications. As the concentration of lanthanum increases the value of specific capacitance also increases. The highest specific capacitance is achieved at x = 0.4 which is ∼1050 F/g−1 at the low scan rate of 10 mV/s. Hence the fabricated lanthanum doped nickel ferrite electrodes may be recommended as a favorable candidate for the energy storage application like supercapacitor.
