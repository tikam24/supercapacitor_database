Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are an attractive solution in environments with a high amount of renewable energy sources, as they can improve the power quality in such places and if required, can extend the integration of more renewable sources of energy. If a large amount of power is needed, then supercapacitors are viable energy storage devices due to their specific power, allowing response times that are in the range of milliseconds to seconds. This paper details the design of an ESS that is based on a modular multilevel converter (MMC) with bidirectional power flow, which reduces the number of cascaded stages and allows the supercapacitors SCs to be con-nected to the grid to perform high‐power transfers. A traditional ESS has four main stages or sub-systems: the energy storage device, the balancing system, and the DC/DC and DC/AC converters. The proposed ESS can perform all of those functions in a single circuit by adopting an MMC topol-ogy, as each submodule (SM) can self‐balance during energy injection or grid absorption. This article analyses the structure in both power flow directions and in the control loops and presents a prototype that is used to validate the design.
