We have developed a new energy system of microporous carbon/Ag/phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) as efficient electrode hybrid material for supercapacitors, in which microporous carbon serves as carbon support (contribution of EDLCs), PMA as redox additive (contribution of pseudocapacitance), Ag as conducting agent (promotion of electrical conductivity). It reveals that the dual incorporation of Ag and PMA leads to the large decrease of surface area and pore volume but the capacitive performance such as specific capacitance, rate capability and coulombic efficiency has remarkably improved due to the synergistic effect among the hybrid materials. For example, the energy density has reached up to 5.68 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 500 W kg−1, which is almost 1.80 fold of pristine microporous carbon. Hybridizing polyoxometalate, carbon materials as well as conducting agent has provided an alternative electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
