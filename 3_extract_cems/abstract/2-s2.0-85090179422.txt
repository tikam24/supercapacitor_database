For the preparation of activated carbon papers (APCs) as supercapacitor electrodes, impurity substances were removed from rice husks, before carbonization and various activation temperature treatments, to optimize electro chemical efficiency. The porosities and electrochemical performances of the ACPs depended strongly on activation temperature: The specific surface area increased from 202.92 (500 ◦C) to 2158.48 m2 g−1 (1100 ◦C). XRD and Raman analyses revealed that ACP graphitization also increased with the activation temperature. For activation at 1100 ◦C, the maximum specific capacitance was 255 F g−1, and over 92% of its capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles.
