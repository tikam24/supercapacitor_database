The poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) rubber (FKM) is a perfect matrix of organic quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte (oQPE) due to its outstanding chemical stability, excellent elasticity, and non-flammability. However, the poor adhesion to electrodes limits its practical application. Herein, the porous FKM grafted poly(butyl acrylate) membranes (pFKM-g-PBA), prepared through a template pore-forming and γ-ray radiation grafting method, is reported. The corresponding oQPE (pFKM-g-PBA/Et4NBF4-AN) shows superior stretchability (the retention of 96.3% after 1000 stretching cycles at 100% strain), high ionic conductivity (8.1 × 10−3 S cm−1), and good flame resistance. Benefit from the considerable increase in adhesiveness, the pFKM-g-PBA/Et4NBF4-AN oQPE adhere firmly to the carboxylated multiwall carbon nanotubes-supported poly(1,5-diaminoanthraquinone) (cMWCNT@PDAA) flexible electrodes. The as-assembled flexible supercapacitor (cMWCNT@PDAA//pFKM-g-PBA/Et4NBF4-AN//cMWCNT@PDAA) delivers a high energy density of 65.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.67 kW kg−1 and retains specific capacitance of 87% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles which is better than that of the raw FKM-based device (75%).
