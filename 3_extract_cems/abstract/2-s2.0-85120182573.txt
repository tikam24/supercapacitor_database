The proceedings contain 74 papers. The topics discussed include: composite electronic materials for supercapacitor applications; laser annealing of Self-aligned As+ implants in contact windows for ultrashallow junction formation; sensitivity analysis of Pd-MOS structure for hydrogenated gases by scanning light pulse technique; optimization of e-beam systems for wafer defect inspection and for die-to-database verification; three-dimensional plasma etching simulation using advanced ray tracing and level set techniques; characterization of gold-formaldehyde baths for electrochemical deposition; electrodeposition of Au-Sn alloys for a modified non-cyanide bath; customized polynomial contact lenses via wet etching; CdS-decorated multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a material for new devices; and influence of electronegative gas on the efficiency of conventional and hollow cathode magnetron sputtering systems.
