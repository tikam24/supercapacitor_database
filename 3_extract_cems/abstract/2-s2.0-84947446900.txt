This paper discusses the control strategy of energy management in single railway vehicle with on-board supercapacitor energy storage system. First, the structure of the energy storage system and the characteristics of train operation is introduced. Second, the method of design the current loop for bi-directional DC/DC converter for energy storage is proposed. Finally, an alternating current side concatenated supercapacitor indirect vector control strategy is established to ensure an optimal power flow of single railway vehicle. Through simulation and the experiment verify the results. The simulation and the experiment result verify that the new control strategy can avoid the voltage fluctuation and regeneration failure.
