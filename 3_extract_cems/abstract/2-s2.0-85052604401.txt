Nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials have attracted increas ing research interest in energy storage and conversion due to of their electrocatalysis and pseudocapacitance characteristics, which are the potential excellent candidates as the electrode materials in lithium-O2 and zinc-O2 batteries, ultracapaci tors, and fuel cells. Among these, N-doped graphene is the most considerable carbon material. In this chapter, the nitro gen contents, species, synthesis methods, and application on nitrogen-doped graphene are summarized. The practical applications of NG were mainly focused on the ultracapaci tors for energy storage. Nitrogen atoms have been doped in pristine graphene, resulting in electron structure change and forming redox active sites. Therefore, electrochemical perfor mance of NG has been visibly improved for potential appli cations as high-energy density, ultrahigh-power density, and long cycling stability capacitors in the micro-device, vehicle, lift, and the other devices at high rates.
