Wind energy conversion system (WECS) should have low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) ability according to grid codes. To enhance LVRT performance, a supercapacitor energy storage system (SC_ESS) based coordinative LVRT control scheme is proposed. The controllers for machine-side and grid-side converters and SC_ESS work coordinately to cope with different low voltage fault conditions through the scheme. The parameters design of SC_ESS is given. According to the power deviation characteristics of each part of the WECS, the LVRT control is divided into four modes to adjust the control structure to get higher performance. Simulation results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed LVRT control.
