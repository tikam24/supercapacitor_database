In an Electric Vehicle (EV) application, hybrid sources, including battery and supercapacitor, use a low pass filter to reduce the fluctuating power absorbed by the battery. The degree of fluctuating power distribution depends on the time constant of the low pass filter. This paper proposes the method to find the time constant value depending on the rate of change of battery current. Although the time constant is known from the design method of the low pass filter, the filtering technique will not maintain the state of charge of the supercapacitor (SOCsc) within the limits. In order to resolve this issue, a rule-based adaptive filtering is proposed in this paper. This algorithm eliminates the disadvantage of the conventional filter-based method of energy management in terms of battery power loss and (SOCsc) regulation. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated through MATLAB/SIMULINK.
