Porous carbons derived from biomass are one current hotspot in exploring advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this work, based on nanoparticles from squid inks, an N-doping porous carbons with a unique “shell@pearls” structure has been fabricated through a direct carbonization/activation procedure. Remarkably, a fantastic structural evolution from core-shell, yolk-shell to the porous matrix embedded with small spheres (like pears in shell) has been observed. The as-obtained products exhibit a hierarchical porosity comprised of micro-, meso- and macropores, as well with a large surface area (1957 m2 g−1) and N-doping (2.09%). As the electrode materials for supercapacitors, the “shell@pearls”bio-carbons show the very high capacitance of 329 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 265 F g−1 at 30 A g−1 and also a superior retention of 99.5% after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1.
