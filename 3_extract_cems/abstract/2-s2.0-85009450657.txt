In the present study, we report a simple method to synthesize silver (Ag)-polypyrrole (PPy)/graphene (Gr) nanocomposite as efficient electrode materials for supercapacitor application. The probable interaction between Ag nanoparticles with both PPy and Gr were characterized by FTIR, UV–visible, and Raman spectroscopies. The morphological analysis confirmed that the Gr sheets are uniformly coated by PPy and in the coated Gr sheets there is the presence of Ag nanoparticles. The Ag-PPy/Gr nanocomposite achieved the highest specific capacitance of 472 F/g at a 0.5 A/g current density. Better energy and power density also obtained for the nanocomposite. The presence of both Ag nanoparticles and Gr is the main reason for the enhancement of the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite. Based on the superior electrochemical properties, the nanocomposite can be used for next-generation supercapacitor electrode material. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.
