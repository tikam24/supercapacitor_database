High-temperature premixed stagnation flames may provide unique advantages for carbon black production even though this is a readily available commodity which is already integrated into many technologies (e.g batteries and supercapacitors). This particular flame configuration allows for the smallest carbon particles to be synthesized in a relatively high-temperature environment and this results in high-surface area conductive particles. Cost analysis will be carried out for this process and compared to existing methods of conductive carbon production. As is the case with most flame-based production methods, stagnation flames are scalable and there is potential for this method to compete with existing industrial conductive carbon methods, especially considering the potential for economical, energy efficient production high-surface area nanoparticles. The throughput of carbon production of the flame is important especially considering that significant excess fuel is required to reach particulate formation conditions in premixed flames. The smallest nanoparticles also require extra consideration in terms of collection onto a substrate or filter due to the high diffusivity and low deposition efficiency.
