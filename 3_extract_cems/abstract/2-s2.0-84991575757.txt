MnO2/mont K10 composite was prepared by reacting KMnO4 and ethylene glycol in presence of montmorillonite K10 (mont K10) at room temperature. The composite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET specific surface area (136 m2/g), and pore-size analysis (mesopores of diameter 3.9 nm and macropores of diameter 5.7 nm), infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis for its physicochemical properties. Morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical studies of MnO2/mont K10 were carried out using cyclic voltammetry in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The MnO2/mont K10 composite showed remarkable specific capacitance of 460 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV−1.
