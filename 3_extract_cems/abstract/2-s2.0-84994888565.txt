Several attempts have been made to develop energy harvesting with a rechargeable storage device. Power generation devices that use natural energy, such as sunlight, vibration, and heat, are being used. The power storage device used needs to be capable of being fully charged, even by a low capacity source, and retaining energy for a long period without leaking it. Also, the storage device's performance needs to be maintained even after it is charged and discharged many times. The supercapacitor uses physical charge separation phenomena between charges on electrodes and ions in electrolyte at the interface. They can release energy much faster than a battery and can be cycled hundreds of thousands of times without largely affecting performance. Murata Electronics makes a small energy device called UMAC. It is a lithium-ion secondary battery that uses lithium titanate as cathode material, unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries. It is suitable for space-saving applications requiring a power supply of up to 30 mA. Also, normally, when a lithium-ion battery is charged, it is necessary to control charging current for safety reasons, and it takes a longer time to charge. UMAC does not require careful control of current during charging, can be charged at a constant current, and is suitable for applications requiring quick charging.
