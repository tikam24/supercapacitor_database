The electro active inorganic-organic nanohybrid material Polyaniline-BaMnO3 has been synthesized by the surfactant assisted chemical polymerization reaction of aniline with nanocrystalline BaMnO3. Electrochemical studies have been performed using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The enhanced electrode performance originates from the synergistic effect of PANI and BaMnO3. The hybrid delivers very high specific capacitance of 560.5 Fg-1, energy density of 32.01 whkg-1 and power density of 400 wkg-1, respectively. The hybrid also exhibits very high stability and excellent cycling performance with less than 5% capacity loss over 500 cycles.
