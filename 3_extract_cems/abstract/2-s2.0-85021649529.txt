(NH 4 ) 2 V 3 O 8 /carbon composites were successfully achieved using NH 4 VO 3 and glucose as the starting materials via a one-step hydrothermal route for the first time. The composites consisted a layer structured (NH 4 ) 2 V 3 O 8 and amorphous carbon with aromatic structures containing lots of active function groups. Then porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles were fabricated by the thermal treatment of (NH 4 ) 2 V 3 O 8 /carbon composites in air atmospheres. The BET specific surface area of (NH 4 ) 2 V 3 O 8 /carbon composites measured 1.68 m 2 g −1 , whereas BET surface area of porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles reached 10.6 m 2 g −1 and the average pore size totaled 28.9 nm. The synthetic process of (NH 4 ) 2 V 3 O 8 /carbon composites and porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles was briefly discussed. Electrochemical properties of porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles as supercapacitor electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) both in the aqueous and organic electrolytes. The influence of calcined temperature and time and the mole ratio of NH 4 VO 3 /glucose on specific capacitance, phase and morphology of samples were discussed in detail. Porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles respectively exhibited the specific capacitance of 433 and 545 F g −1 in the aqueous and organic electrolytes at the current density of 1 A g −1 . After 100 cycles, the capacitance retention was 89.6% in organic electrolyte, whereas it was only 22.9% in aqueous electrolyte. It turned out that electrochemical properties of porous V 2 O 5 nanoparticles were greatly improved by using organic electrolyte.
