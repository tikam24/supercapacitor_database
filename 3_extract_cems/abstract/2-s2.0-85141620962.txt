Graphene oxide (rGO) has become a leader in supercapacitors with a wide specific surface area (SSA) (2630 m2/g), high electrical conductivity and chemical stability, and excellent mechanical, thermal and optical properties. However, rGO itself has poor electrical conductivity, so in this paper, rGO is combined with Mo0.7Co0.3S2 to improve its performance. This paper was successfully synthesized different mass ratios of rGO and Mo0.7Co0.3S2 by a simple hydrothermal method. The microstructure was characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, EDS. The electrode is made by using foamed nickel as the substrate, polyvinylidene chlorofluoride as the binder, and N-methyl pyrrolidone as the auxiliary agent. The electrochemical performance was tested on a three-electrode electrochemical workstation with KOH as the electrolyte. The experimental results show that all samples exhibit hexagonal system structure with good crystallization, the morphologies are flower-like microsphere shape with a certain degree of agglomeration. The surface of Mo0.7Co0.3S2 nanoparticles is wrapped by a layer of rGO like yarn. rGO/Mo0.7Co0.3S2 nanocomposite exhibits pseudo-capacitance behavior and excellent electrochemical performance, especially the Mo0.7Co0.3S2 electrode (30wt% rGO content) exhibits the largest specific capacitance and smallest impedance, and the Mo0.7Co0.3S2 electrode (30wt% rGO content) electrode reduced from 1377.00 F·g−1 to 1307.87 F·g−1 after 3000 cycles at a current density of 5 A·g−1, the coulombic efficiency is 95%, which may be due to the Coupling effect between Mo0.7Co0.3S2 and rGO.
