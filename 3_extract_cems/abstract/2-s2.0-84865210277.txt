A redox intermedium p-phenylenediamine (PPD) with quick reversible faradaic processes is introduced into KOH electrolyte, referred to as pseudocapacitive effect occurring on the electrode/electrolyte surface. The KOH + PPD electrolyte as potential electrolyte for supercapacitors is investigated by UV-Vis spectroscopy and electrochemical methods. As expected, the supercapacitor with KOH + PPD electrolyte has a much higher electrode specific capacitance (605.225 F g<sup>-1</sup>) than the one with conventional KOH electrolyte (144.037 F g<sup>-1</sup>) at the same current density of 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>. Simultaneously, the supercapacitor with KOH + PPD electrolyte exhibits a much higher energy density (19.862 W h kg<sup>-1</sup>) than the supercapacitor with conventional KOH electrolyte (4.458 W h kg<sup>-1</sup>). Furthermore, the supercapacitor with KOH + PPD electrolyte shows superior charge-discharge stability. After 4000 cycles, its capacitive retention ratio is still as high as 94.530%.
