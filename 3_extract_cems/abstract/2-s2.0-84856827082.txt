Crystalline β-Bi 2O 3 was synthesized through pH-dependent chemical bath deposition process, altering the morphology and evolution from nanoparticles (∼40 nm) at pH 9 to platelets (∼40 nm width and 0.8 μm length) at pH12. In-situ aniline nucleation and growth at less basic condition on the β-Bi 2O 3 increased the surface area and specific capacitance of the device. The morphological change of β-Bi 2O 3/PANI composite from nanoparticles to platelets like nanostructure facilitated higher specific capacitance from 210 to 430 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with enhanced ionic diffusion and retention of specific capacitance up to 84% at higher scan rates.
