MoS2 nanomaterials and ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted tremendous interest as the prime electrodes and electrolytes of supercapacitors. However, the corresponding charge storage mechanisms have not yet been clearly understood. Herein, we study the molecular-level energy storage mechanisms of the MoS2 electrode in imidazolium ionic liquid ([BMI+][PF6−]) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The electric double-layer (EDL) structures of MoS2 electrodes in [BMI+][PF6−] electrolytes are comprehensively studied in terms of number density, MD snapshots, separation coefficient, and ion-electrode interaction energy. Based on this, the electric potential and electric field distributions are calculated by integrating Poisson equations. Importantly, a bell-shaped differential capacitance profile is proposed, different from the U-shaped curve from the conventional Gouy–Chapman theory. Especially, it can be well reproduced by the differential charge density curve in the Helmholtz layer. This indicates that the capacitive behaviors of the MoS2 electrode are primarily determined by the counterion population/structure in the EDL region 5.0 Å from the electrode surface. In the end, ion diffusion coefficients within different interfacial EDL regions are evaluated, revealing that dynamics are significantly suppressed by ~50% in the Helmholtz region. However, the dynamics can be recovered to a bulk state with the ion position 10 Å away from the electrode surface. The as-obtained insights reveal the charge storage mechanisms of MoS2 in ILs, which can provide useful guidance on improving the energy density of MoS2 supercapacitors.
