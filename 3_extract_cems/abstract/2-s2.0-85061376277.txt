Owing to their unique electronic properties and capability to host diverse functional groups on the surface, carbon dots (CDs) have attracted increasing attention in energy storage field. Herein, ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) decorated nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH) 2 ) nanosheets were fabricated by a facile hydrothermal approach, where NCDs play an important role as a structure-directing agent in tuning the size and thickness of the Ni(OH) 2 . With the merits of the battery-type faradaic behavior of Ni(OH) 2 and high electronic properties of NCDs, the achieved Ni(OH) 2 /NCDs ultrathin nanosheets show a specific capacitance of about 1711.2 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , which is twice more than that of pristine Ni(OH) 2 . A hybrid supercapacitor device was constructed using Ni(OH) 2 /NCDs ultrathin nanosheets as the positive electrode and three-dimensional graphene (3DGE) as the negative electrode, respectively, which presents high energy density of 23.8–34.6 Wh kg −1 at power density of 700–7000 W kg −1 . The enhanced electrochemical properties of Ni(OH) 2 /NCDs nanocomposite hold potential for future high-performance energy storage applications.
