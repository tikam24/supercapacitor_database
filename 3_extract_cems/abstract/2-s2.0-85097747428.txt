Intelligent textiles require flexible power sources that can be seemingly integrated with a variety of electronic devices to realize new smart wearable applications. However, current research mainly focuses on the design of the textile structures, often ignoring the importance of seamless configuration. This approach results in an uncomfortable experience when the device is worn and makes it difficult to smoothly connect each monofunctional device. The view of the yarn structure, a multifunctional yarn-based wearable system is fabricated through combining seamless strain sensors and energy storage devices. Yarn deposited with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) via in situ polymerization is then prepared as a highly conductive yarn sensor and a flexible yarn-shaped supercapacitor (SC). All-yarn-based SCs are incorporated with strain sensors within self-powered flexible devices designed to detect human motion. Multiple textile structures can be woven into garments including power supply to sensors, with promising application potential across wearable electronics and smart clothing.
