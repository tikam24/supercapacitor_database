Molybdenum-based supercapacitors, a fast promising area where researchers are exploring the possibilities of improving the performance of its electrode materials and their derivatives for energy storage. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) has attracted considerable interest because of its superior properties as a supercapacitor-based material. In this mini-review, the wet-chemical methods of preparing MoS2 and their electrochemical properties were summarized. The preparation methods and their composite substrates of MoS2 based supercapacitors have been highlighted to be one of the determining factors for improving the electrochemical output being reported. This review suggested that the modified methods of preparation and appropriate composite materials can enhance the supercapacitor properties of MoS2 based materials. Finally, we explore the future opportunities for advance storage potential presented by MoS2 based materials.
