The polyindole/Graphitic carbon nitride (PIn/g-C3N4) composites synthesized by the reflux method. The characterization results showed that the composites possess balanced porosity, good charge diffusion, high energy and power densities. PIn/g-C3N4 composite showed the specific capacity (QS) of 440.8 C/g at 6 A/g in 1 mol/L aqueous H2SO4 electrolyte. The asymmetric device of PIn/g-C3N4//rGO showed QS of 73.84 C/g at 3 A/g. PIn/g-C3N4//rGO device offered a moderate cyclic retention of 72% at 18 A/g after 5,000 cycles with an energy density of 23.2 Wh/Kg and power density of 2307 W/Kg at 3 A/g. The results demonstrated that PIn/g-C3N4 composite has a potential application in field of energy storage devices.
