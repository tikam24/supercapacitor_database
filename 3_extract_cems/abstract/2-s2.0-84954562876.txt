We report nanostructured TiO 2 /boron-doped diamond (BDD)/Ta multilayer films and their electrochemical performances as supercapacitor electrodes. The BDD films were grown on Ta substrates using electron-assisted hot filament chemical vapor deposition. Ti metal layers were deposited on the BDD surfaces by radio frequency magnetron sputtering, and nanostructured TiO 2 /BDD/Ta thin films were prepared by electrochemical etching and thermal annealing. The successful formation of TiO 2 and Ta layered nanostructures was demonstrated using scanning electron and transmission electron microscopies. The electrochemical responses of these electrodes were evaluated by examining their use as electrical double-layer capacitors, using cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge and impedance measurements. When the TiO 2 /BDD/Ta film was used as the working electrode with 0.1 M Na 2 SO 4 as the electrolyte, the capacitor had a specific capacitance of 5.23 mF cm -2 at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 for a B/C ratio of 0.1% w/w. Furthermore, the TiO 2 /BDD/Ta film had improved electrochemical stability, with a retention of 89.3% after 500 cycles. This electrochemical behavior is attributed to the quality of the BDD, the surface roughness and electrocatalytic activities of the TiO 2 layer and Ta nanoporous structures, and the synergies between them. These results show that TiO 2 /BDD/Ta films are promising as capacitor electrodes for special applications.
