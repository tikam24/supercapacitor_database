The electrochemical behavior of storage device prototypes with carbon electrodes and ionic liquids as electrolyte was investigated. The current-voltage dependences using different working electrodes and the dependences of specific capacitance, charge and discharge dynamics of supercapacitor cells on time were obtained. The optimal values of specific capacitance and specific energy of film-like supercapacitor samples at different voltages were obtained.
