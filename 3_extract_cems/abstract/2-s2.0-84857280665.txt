A novel symmetric RuO 2RuO 2 supercapacitor with a high operating voltage of 1.6 V is built using the nanocrystalline hydrous RuO 2. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 18.77 Wh kg -1 at a power density of 500 W kg -1 based on the total mass of active electrode material and excellent cycling stability and power capability. These results demonstrate the potentialities of using RuO 2 for symmetric supercapacitor or using RuO 2 as negative electrode for asymmetric supercapacitor with high energy density.
