In this study, we produced pre-carbonized date pits (PDP) and self-adhesive carbon grains (SACGs) from oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB) by a low temperature (200°C for DP and 280°C for SACGs, respectively) carbonization method followed by KOH treatment to obtain KOH treated PDP (T-PDP) and KOH treated SACGs (T-SACGs). Four sets of green monolith (GMs) denoted as GM-A, GM-B, GM-C and GM-D were prepared respectively from SACGs (100 wt. %), mixture of PDP and SACGs (50:50 wt. %), T-SACGs (100 wt. %), and mixture of T-SACGs and T-PDP (50:50 wt. %), respectively. From these GMs the respective activated carbon monolith (ACMs) electrodes namely ACM-A, ACM-B, ACM-C and ACM-D were prepared via carbonization (N2 carbonization) and activation (CO2 environment). These ACMs electrodes were used to fabricate the corresponding EDLC cells: Cell-A, Cell-B, Cell-C and Cell-D, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests conducted on the cells found that the Cell-D showed the maximum value of specific capacitance, Csp (∼ 135 F g-1) whereas the Cell-A showed the minimum values of ESR and characteristic response time, respectively, ∼ 2.14 Ω and ∼ 46 s. Therefore, it can be concluded that the KOH treatment can improve the capacitance but caused the increase in the ESR and response time.
