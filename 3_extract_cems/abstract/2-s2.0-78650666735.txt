Novel energy storage solutions need flexible, stretchable and transparent energy storage solutions to enable Morph and similar futuristic concepts. Nanotechnologies, like growth of carbon nanotubes (CNT) on different conductive substrates and assembly of such structures in battery-supercapacitor electrodes can yield to remarkable increase in power density and energy. Portable consumer applications need also to be low cost and have fast or scalable process for manufacturing. Futuristic concepts urge drastically enhanced power and energy density compared to evolutionary route - current Li-ion battery development has been only 6-9% yearly increase with conventional development of more conductive cathodes and enhanced conduction electrolyte solutions.
