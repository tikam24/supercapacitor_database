Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is an extremely promising electrode material for supercapacitors due to its superior electrochemical performance and conductivity. In this study, polypyrrole (PPy) modified MoS2/Ni3S2 (MNS@PPy) assemblies grown directly on the Ni foam (NF) substrate are prepared by a facile hydrothermal route and a subsequent electrodeposition process. The as-obtained products show a specific capacitance of 845 C g-1 at 1 A g-1 with outstanding cycling stability after 10000 cycles. Using the as-synthesized products as positive materials, an assembled hybrid capacitor delivers an energy density of 280.5 W h kg-1 at a power density of 2845 W kg-1, demonstrating its promising application in portable micro-/nanoscale energy storage devices.
