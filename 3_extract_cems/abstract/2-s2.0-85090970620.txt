The multilayer hybrids of pristine graphene and polyaniline nanofiber were prepared via layer-by-layer vacuum filtration for making a high-performance supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the hybrids electrode in the three-electrode system was measured as high as 565 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g, and the as-prepared supercapacitor exhibited high energy density and power density of 19.28 Wh/kg and 3.2 kW/kg, respectively. The synergistic effect of crosslinking polyaniline nanofiber network and pristine graphene intercalation not only provided larger specific areas exposed to electrolyte and improved the penetration rate of electrolyte but also improved the electrical conductivity as well as shorten the charge transmission pathways of electrons from electrode to current collector. The results demonstrate that the supercapacitor electrodes with excellent capacitive performance can be fabricated by constructing a multilayer hybrid of graphene and polyaniline nanofiber.
