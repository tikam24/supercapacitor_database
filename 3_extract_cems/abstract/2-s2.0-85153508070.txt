Converting green biomass resources into energy storage materials is an important way to address the energy challenge. The traditional process of carbonization by slow pyrolysis leads to the loss of microporous structure and impairs the electrochemical performance. Induction pyrolysis has the characteristics of rapid heating, which can rapidly achieve efficient regulation of the structure and composition of the carbon derived from biomass. Herein, the agaric-derived carbon materials are constructed via a rapid induction pyrolysis method. Depolymerization and carbonization were more intense due to the quick reaction process. Thus, the carbon skeleton was severely ablated to produce materials with a high specific surface area (2225.5 m2 g−1), a large number of micropores and an optimized heteroatomic configuration. The mechanism of modulation of the structure and composition of biomass-derived carbon materials by the rapid induction pyrolysis was investigated for the first time through the comparison strategy at different pyrolysis ways and temperatures. The as-fabricated carbon materials present excellent specific capacitance of 374 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The symmetrical supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 24 W h kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1. This work widens the synthesis of biomass-derived carbon and increases the potential for practical applications.
