In the current research a mathematical model of an electric vehicle supplied by fuel cell and supercapacitor is proposed. The model takes as input standard electric vehicle provided by the manufacturer that is needed for the power conversion system. The main purposes of this model is to be used in order the designed to be able to define the optimal energy flows between two different supplying elements in electric vehicles.
