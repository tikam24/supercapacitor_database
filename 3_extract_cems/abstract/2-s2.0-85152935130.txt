Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has acquired immense research recognition for various energy applications. The layered structure of MoS2 offers vast surface area and good exposure to active edge sites, thereby, making it a prominent candidate for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), supercapacitors (SCs), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). However, the limited conductivity, less number of active sites, and structural instability of MoS2 during continuous electrochemical cycling hinder its applications. In this regard, the formation of core-shell structures has been evolving as a prominent approach to uplift the electrochemical/electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 for energy-based applications. The unique core-shell composites of MoS2 with different electro-active materials exhibit superior electrochemical and electrocatalytic properties on account of the synergy of the core and the shell materials. These materials offer huge active area, high conductivity, an easy pathway for charge diffusion, and stable cyclic life leading to their outstanding electrochemical activity. In this review, various core-shell structures of MoS2 with carbon, metal oxides/sulfides, and conducting polymers are discussed for LIBs, SCs, and HERs. The function of core and shell materials in elevating the electrochemical activity of MoS2 based core-shell composites have been explored in detail. The effect of doping of core and shells on the performance of the composite has also been elucidated. The doped MoS2 based core-shell composites manifest tremendous electrochemical performance compared to the un-doped counterpart. Thus, these unique structured core-shell composites are regarded as futuristic candidates for energy storage and conversion systems.
