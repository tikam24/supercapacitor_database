Recent developments in power electronics and renewable energy sources have brought the risen of Direct Current (DC) Microgrids. By power converters' utilization, a DC Microgrid is able to integrate renewables, storage systems, and other devices in a simpler topology, since the major part of the modern grid's compounds have DC nature. This paper proposes a control strategy aiming to regulate the voltage in the DC bus of a Microgrid by a supercapacitor. The control law is applied to a bidirectional boost converter that connects the supercapacitor to the DC grid. The control scheme is based on dynamical feedback linearization and consists in splitting the system in different time scale dynamics, creating consequently a simplified model. Simulations on Matlab/Simulink illustrate how the control strategy is able to regulate the DC voltage with good performance.
