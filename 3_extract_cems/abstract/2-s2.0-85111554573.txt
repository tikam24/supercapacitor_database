In the present work, we have designed and synthesized nanocomposite of IrO2@Mn3O4 with two-step simple and scalable chemical routes. In this route, nanofibers of IrO2 were synthesized by a single nozzle electrospinning technique onto which Mn3O4 was overlaid by a simple SILAR route. The ratio of Mn3O4 and IrO2 was varied by varying the SILAR cycles onto electrospun IrO2 thin film as 20, 40, 60, and 80 cycles. The structural, morphological, and energy storage performance of IrO2@Mn3O4 composite electrodes were investigated. A 2 V kinetic potential with a rectangular-shaped cyclic voltammogram was observed for the IrO2@Mn3O4 electrodes. Moreover, the specific capacitance of 1027 F/g at 1 mA/cm2 was observed for the optimized electrode which is superior as compared with other electrodes. The optimized electrode showed better current and voltage than the individual compounds which might be due to the synergic effect of IrO2 and Mn3O4. Finally, a PVA-LiClO4 gel electrolyte-based solid-state IrO2@Mn3O4//IrO2@Mn3O4 symmetric device was fabricated. The symmetric device possessed an energy density of 81 Wh/kg with a power delivery of 714 W/kg which was capable to light up a green LED. Hence, the 2D transition metal oxides laminated on 1D metal oxides with high conductivity can be promising electrodes for future research.
