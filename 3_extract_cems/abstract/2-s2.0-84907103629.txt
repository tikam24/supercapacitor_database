Monodisperse resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin and carbon microspheres are obtained using ammonia solution (NH3·H2O) as catalyst, resorcinol and formaldehyde as precursor. The carbon microspheres obtained from RF resin are evaluated as the supercapacitor electrode material with several analytical tools, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement. It presents the low resistance value (R) of 0.5 Ω. The maximum specific capacitance of the electrode measured from cyclic voltammetry is up to 175.9 F·g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV·s-1. The specific capacitance only decays 5.6% after 500 cycles, which indicates that the sample possesses excellent cycle durability. Highly monodispersity carbon microspheres from RF resin can serve as supercapacitor electrode materials with the functions of reducing mass transport resistance and improving supercapacitor performance reliability.
