This work is aimed to develop a realistic design procedure for a series hybrid plug in vehicle, with a view to use it in a mathematical design optimization. The purpose of the optimization is minimizing the initial cost, as well as the running costs of the vehicle. Therefore there is a multi-objective design optimization problem in hand. Such problems are very suitable for mathematical optimization, however, accurate and not time consuming design procedure is a must, to obtain meaningful results. This paper introduces such a design procedure. The approach is illustrated on a commercial vehicle simulation model. The accuracy of the model is illustrated by comparing simulation results with vehicle test results.
