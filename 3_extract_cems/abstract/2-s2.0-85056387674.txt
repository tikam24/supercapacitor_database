Now a days, the renewable energy sources based on wind energy is one of the most accomplished system. In this paper, an operation and control of the grid side converter of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) connected to wind turbine to improve the power flow control, stator and rotor control is achieved during unbalance load conditions, the RSC and GSC that are connected back-to-back through a dc-link capacitor. The proposed system is DFIG based on wind energy system using FPGA, is synchronized to phase locked loop (PLL) to a reference frequency generated inside the system. The supercapacitor based storage system is used for balance the load at intermittent conditions to satisfy above features. The whole research work and analysis has been carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment.
