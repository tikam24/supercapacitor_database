In this study, the application of Disperse Blue 6 (D. B. 6) an efficient redox additive for natural aqueous electrolyte was reported in where defective mesoporous carbon (DMC) with the interconnected porous network was applied as electrode material. Excellent electrochemical performance is achieved at 0.2 M of D. B. 6 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The obtained data from RAMAN, SEM, TEM, XRD and Nitrogen adsorption/desorption confirmed the DMC structure. The supercapacitive performance of DMC and DMC electrodes with D. B. 6 redox additive in 1 M Na2SO4 (DMC-DB/Na2SO4) as electrolyte was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) techniques. Compared to DMC, the DMC-DB/Na2SO4 delivered the highest specific capacitance reaching to 323.33 F/g at the applied current density of 0.5 A/g. Moreover, the DMC-DB/Na2SO4 exhibited cyclic stability, in where 88.3% of specific capacitance were retained after 2000 GCD measurement at the current density of 5 A/g. Furthermore, electrode exhibited a high energy density of 28.74 Wh/kg, nearly fourfold increase over the DMC electrode with pure Na2SO4 electrolyte. These results shows that the D. B. 6 redox additive is a facile and straight direct approach to improve the performance of DMC supercapacitor.
