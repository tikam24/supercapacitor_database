Featuring pronounced controllability, versatility, and scalability, electrophoretic deposition (EPD) has been proposed as an efficient method for film assembly and electrode/solid electrolyte fabrication in various energy storage/conversion devices including rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. High-quality electrodes and solid electrolytes have been prepared through EPD and exhibit advantageous performances in comparison with those realized with traditional methods. Recent advances in the application of EPD materials in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices are summarized. In particular, the parameters that influence the efficiency of an EPD process from colloidal preparation to deposition are evaluated with the aim to provide insightful guidance for realizing high-performance electrochemical energy conversion materials and devices.
