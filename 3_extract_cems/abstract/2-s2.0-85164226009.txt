The layered structural black phosphorus (BP), as an emerging two-dimensional material, has aroused great interest due to its intriguing electrochemical properties, but its poor stability greatly limits its practical application. This work utilized a unique heteroatomic carbon microsphere (PZSC) obtained by carbonization of polyphosphazene microspheres as PZSC (-), and modified BP with PZSC using a simple ultrasound assisted liquid exfoliation technique to obtain BP/PZSC (+). The BP modified with PZSC greatly improved the cycling stability and specific capacitance, displaying a high specific capacitance of 843.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The assembled hybrid BP/PZSC (+) // PZSC (-) supercapacitor exhibits high specific capacitance, power and energy density (57.1 F g−1, 799.9 W kg−1, 20.3 Wh kg−1) with excellent cycle stability (96%, 5000r). This work effectively promotes the application of BP-based and heteroatomic carbon-based materials in the field of supercapacitors.
