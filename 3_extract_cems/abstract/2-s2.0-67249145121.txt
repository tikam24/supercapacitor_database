We have already reported about the performance of active carbon adsorbed with Cu( II )-picolinic acid complex. The capacitor showed higher capacitance than normal activated carbon. In this report, we have used another kind of AC and electrolyte. We could observe it's accurate oxidation-reduction reaction by cyclic voltammetry and constant current electrolysis. We also comfirmed Cu( II )-picolinic acid complex's disorption from the AC in the 4 M H 2SO4/H2O. The cause of disorption is form of Cu( II )-picolinic acid in the low pH. We change electrolyte into 3.5 M NaBr/H2O and the disorption is suppressed.
