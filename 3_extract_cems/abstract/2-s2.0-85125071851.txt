Herein, we reported a novel and a facile method to fabricated TiO2 nanowire arrays on Nitinol alloy substrate as electrode material for supercapacitors. The rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays on alloy substrates were developed using chemical vapor deposition technique with camphor as the source. A systematic study for the growth of nanostructure TiO2@NiTi has been carried out along with its exceptional physical and chemical properties for energy storage application. The growth of the nanostructure for different concentration at the elevated temperature has been studied through different characterization techniques like scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, which resulted in confirming the formation of rutile phase having length and diameter of 10 ± 3 mm and 80 ± 10 nm, respectively. In addition, the COMSOL simulation was carried out to determine the temperature gradient in the furnace tube at elevated temperature. The presence of nickel in the bi-metallic alloys played a vital role in the growth of TiO2 nanostructures array. The synthesized TiO2 nanowire arrays on Nitinol substrate exhibited the specific capacitance of ~ 1F/g with long term stability, making it a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
