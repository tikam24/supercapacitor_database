Electrode materials play a key role in supercapacitors, and the structural design of electrode materials is supposed to be given priority to improve capacitive performances. Herein, manganese ferrite nanorods/graphene composites are fabricated by a one-step, in situ hydrothermal method. In situ growth of manganese ferrite nanorods ensures good interfacial contact between nanorods and graphene, endowing the composites with rapid charge transfer and superior cyclic performance. The as-synthesized composites yield specific capacitances of 537.7 and 187.7 F/g at current densities of 0.5 and 10 A/g, respectively. Furthermore, their capacity retention is 87.7% after 20000 cycles at 1 A/g, indicating exceptional cyclic performance. Such excellent capacitive performances are due to fast charge transport and good structural stability, which derived from the in-situ growth of manganese ferrite nanorods on the graphene.
