Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant interest because of their heteroatom-containing architectures, high porous networks, large surface areas, and capacity to include redox-active units, which can provide good electrochemical efficiency in energy applications. In this research, we synthesized two novel hydroxy-functionalized COFs—TAPT-2,3-NA(OH)2, TAPT-2,6-NA(OH)2 COFs—through Schiff-base [3 + 2] polycondensations of 1,3,5-tris-(4-aminophenyl)triazine (TAPT-3NH2) with 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde (2,3-NADC) and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene-1,5-dicarbaldehyde (2,6-NADC), respectively. The resultant hydroxy-functionalized COFs featured high BET-specific surface areas up to 1089 m2 g–1, excellent crystallinity, and superior thermal stability up to 60.44% char yield. When used as supercapacitor electrodes, the hydroxy-functionalized COFs exhibited electrochemical redox activity due to the presence of redox-active 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene in their COF skeletons. The hydroxy-functionalized COFs showed specific capacitance of 271 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 with excellent stability after 2000 cycles of 86.5% capacitance retention. Well-known pore features and high surface areas of such COFs, together with their superior supercapacitor performance, make them suitable electrode materials for use in practical applications.
