This paper proposes a charge controller for ultracapacitor that acts as an energy storage device so that it can minimize the effect of irregular solar radiation and widely varying wind velocity. A suitable supervision for each generating unit and ultracapacitor are mandatory for a standalone system. The primary energy sources solar and wind systems are operating at maximum power point. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is utilized to foresee the voltage of panel at which extreme power is obtained for a solar system and also to ascertain the most extreme power delivered by the nonuniform and unpredictable characteristics of solar and wind energy sources. A common energy management technique is developed to manage the control flow between the distinctive power sources, loads, and ultracapacitor in the system. The results obtained by ANFIS are compared with artificial neural network. A Simulink model of the hybrid standalone system was developed and tested for various insolation, temperature, and wind velocity.
