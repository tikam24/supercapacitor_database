In order to enhance the specific capacitance and energy density of carbon-based supercapacitor, some particles of nickel oxide were loaded into activated carbon. A hybrid type electrochemical capacitor was made and tested, in which the activated-carbon loaded with nickel oxide was used as anode material and activated-carbon was used as cathode material. Results show that the BET surface area of the activated-carbon decreases due to the deposition of nickel oxide, but no obvious change is found in the pore size distribution. The specific capacitance of the capacitor is increased from 175.40 F/g to 194.01 F/g. The potential of oxygen evolution on the composite material electrode reaches 0.296 V, and it is 0.076 V higher than that on the pure activated-carbon electrode, which indicates that the hybrid capacitor has high energy density. Similar to the pure activated-carbon electrode, no obvious change appears on the specific capacitances of the composite material electrode at various discharge currents and the composite material electrode exhibits good power characteristics. The operation voltage of the hybrid capacitor is 1.2 V in the electrolyte of 6 mol/L KOH solution, which is 0.2 V higher than that of double-layer capacitor made of activated carbon. It is concluded that the specific capacitance and energy density of carbon-based supercapacitor can be enhanced by loading some nanometer-scale particles of nickel oxide into activated carbon.
