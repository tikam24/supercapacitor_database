In this article, we report an effective synthesis of a cobalt-benzimidazole metal organic framework (Co-Bim MOF), which belongs to the Zeolitic imidazolate framework-9 (ZIF-9) family, and a cobalt-benzimidazole MOF@reduced graphene oxide (Co-Bim@rGO) composite through hydrothermal treatment for supercapacitor application. The structural and morphological features of the Co-Bim MOF and Co-Bim@rGO composite were confirmed by using various physicochemical techniques such as FT-IR, Raman, XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and XPS analysis. The SEM and BET analysis of the Co-Bim@rGO composite shows a layer-like structure with abundant pores and a large surface area (543 m2 g−1). The supercapacitive performance of the prepared electrodes was investigated using CV (cyclic voltammetry), GCD (Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses in aq. 1 M KOH. The as-fabricated Co-Bim@rGO composite showed a specific capacity of 1488 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and maintained 96% of its initial capacitance after 8000 GCD cycles at 4 A g−1. The superior capacity performance of the Co-Bim@rGO composite is mainly ascribed to its mesoporous nature with an improved surface area, multiple redox sites and synergistic effect between the Co-Bim MOF and rGO moiety. The constructed Co-Bim@rGO//AC device showed an energy density of 90.55 W h kg−1 at a power density of 2396.28 W kg−1, and the device showed a cyclic stability of 88% even after 4000 GCD cycles at 3 A g−1. Further, biocompatibility analysis of the Co-Bim MOF and Co-Bim@rGO composite proved the non-toxic nature of the as-prepared electrode material. Thus, the effective energy storage ability of the Co-Bim@rGO composite confirms it as a potential candidate for supercapacitors in day-to-day applications.
