Graphene–metal frameworks have been extensively studied and developed as electrode materials for next generation energy storage materials. Their high surface area and easily transformable structure enhances its specific capacitance characteristics. In the present study, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized using Hummers method. Zinc oxide and copper oxide nanoparticles were incorporated in to the GO matrix to form mixed metal oxides. GO, GO–CuO and GO–ZnO were characterized using UV–Visible, FTIR, FT Raman spectroscopy, SEM and XRD to confirm their effective formation. The surface of the glassy carbon electrode was modified by drop casting with the samples on its surface and its electrochemical properties were studied. Cyclic Voltammetry studies were conducted at various scan rates in different electrolytes (KCl, H2SO4 and Na2SO4) and the characteristic curves were observed to be asymmetric in nature. GO–CuO exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 790 F/g at 5 mV/s in KCl. The specific capacitance of the modified electrodes was also measured using the Chronopotentiometry technique. GO–CuO nanocomposites show a maximum specific capacitance of 800 F/g at 1 A/g. The nanocomposites showed enhanced electrochemical behaviour of the nanocomposites when compared to pure GO. The nanocomposites also showed good cycling stability. The superior performance of the GO–CuO and GO–ZnO nanocomposite electrode renders it as a promising material for supercapacitors applications.
