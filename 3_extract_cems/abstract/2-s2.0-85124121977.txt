This article addresses fabrication, properties, and potential of one-dimensional nanofibers of polyaniline-derived nanocomposites. Polyaniline, a conjugated polymer, has been successfully processed into nanofibers. Polyaniline nanofibers have been reinforced with nanofillers such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and inorganic nanoparticles. The most prominent fabrication technique used for these nanofibers is electrospinning. Polyaniline nanocomposite nanofibers have exposed unique microstructure, electrical, thermal, mechanical, and other essential physical characteristics. Optimal nanofiller type/content, dispersion/modification, and fabrication technique affect nanocomposite nanofiber properties. Moreover, nanocomposite nanofiber performance depends on matrixâ€“nanofiller interactions. Numerous potential applications of polyaniline polymeric nanocomposite nanofibers include radiation shielding, supercapacitor, sensor, diode, and biomedical relevance.
