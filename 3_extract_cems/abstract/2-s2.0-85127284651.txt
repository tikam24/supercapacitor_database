Here, a photovoltaic (PV)-based multi-spots electric vehicles (EVs) charging station (CS) is presented by using maximum correntropy criteria with affine projection sub-band adaptive filter (MCC-APSAF). The presented CS also includes the features of power quality at nonlinear loads connected at the point of common coupling (PCC). This CS comprises a battery bank, multi-EV batteries, and ultra-capacitor (UC) charging spots. However, a dramatic increase of EVs and charging stations in the existing grid has raised the issues related to the harmonics, voltage fluctuations, reactive power, and burden on the grid. These issues are addressed in the presented charging station. Moreover, the ultra-capacitor can provide fast charging, which minimizes the high inrush current of the CS. Therefore, the batteries during the high EVs load at the CS are protected by the ultra-capacitor spots. To stabilize the DC bus voltage, separate cascaded controllers for ultra-capacitor and battery spots are used. The CS shows the multifunctional capabilities, which include PV array to grid (PV2G), PV array to the EV battery (S2EVB), EV battery to grid (EVB2G), and PV array to home (PV2H) when PV source is present. The various EVB2G, G2EVB, battery to home (EVB2H), and grid to home (G2H) behaviors are also presented. This CS shows good dynamic efficacy under insolation variation, EVB2G, G2EVB modes, load throw, and load reconnection operations. The grid current THD using the proposed current control is 1.44%, which is in accordance with the IEEE-519 standard. Moreover, the maximum power obtained from the PV generation is 63 kW, which is successfully distributed in the battery bank and six EV batteries (30 kW), in nonlinear load (14 kW), and the rest of the power is injected to the grid (29 kW). This CS is simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink library and test results are obtained using the experimental workbench with OPAL-RT (OP5600) in the laboratory.
