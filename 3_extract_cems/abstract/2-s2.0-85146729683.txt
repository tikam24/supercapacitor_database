In this study, we report successive chemical bath deposition (CBD) method to prepare three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical porous Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes on CuO-doped MnO2 nano-dandelions named as MnO2/CuO@Ni(OH)2 nanorod-nanoflake clusters. The as-prepared hierarchical MnO2/CuO@Ni(OH)2 nanorod-nanoflake clusters were composed of radially grown nanorods with a length of about 1.0 μm and surrounded by the interconnected nanoflakes clusters with a diameter of about 17 nm. Electrochemical evaluations revealed that the as-prepared electrode delivers a high specific capacitance of 3800 mF cm−2 at 1.0 mA cm−2 and long cycle life. The superior electrochemical performances were attributed to ideal ion transfer channels derived from radially grown 1D nanorods, which in combination with battery-type behavior of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes, afford synergistic and multipurpose effects. Especially, the existence of CuO inner layer in the hierarchical MnO2/CuO@Ni(OH)2 nanorod-nanoflake clusters can fill the Schottky barrier at the interface between MnO2 and Ni(OH)2. This work suggest a new design of metal oxide/hydroxides and indicates that the hierarchical MnO2/CuO@Ni(OH)2 nanorod-nanoflake clusters can be considered as potential electrode material in high-rate supercapacitors.
