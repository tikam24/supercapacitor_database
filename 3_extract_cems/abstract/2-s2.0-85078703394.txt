A small-scale thermoelectric generator (TEG) system produces a power of 1.43 W at a temperature differential between the thermoelectric module (TEM) surfaces of 70.00Â°C. This can cold-start a GSM locator and broadcast coordinates using an SMS message. Ultra-low power off-the-shelf electronics are combined to produce a reliable cellular signal and generate the coordinates, eliminating the need for dedicated GPS modules and reducing the total power consumption. A supercapacitor-based charging system was designed to store charge from the TEMs and discharge a constant 5.2 V to power the electronics. The system requires approximately 60 seconds from a cold start to send geographic coordinates. Designs for several cold blocks, used to generate the temperature differential for the TEMs, were investigated, including designs utilizing phase-change material (PCM) and water.
