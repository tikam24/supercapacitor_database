Here, flower-like manganese oxide with enriched oxygen vacancies were reported for high performance supercapacitors. The moderate oxygen-vacancy were achieved by controlling annealing atmosphere. Benefiting from improving the conductivity and the density of active sites, MnOx−Ar sample as an electrode material has remarkable specific capacity (339 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), extraordinary rate capability (90 % capacity retention at 1 A g−1), and good cycling property (90 % capacity retention at 1 A g−1 after 5000 cycles). Additionally, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled which used the MnOx−Ar sample as cathode and Kochen Black (KB) as anode, which displayed a remarkable energy density (16 Wh kg−1) at a large power density (7593 W kg−1). These results, on the one hand, further expand the application of MnO2-based materials, and on the other hand, offer a new perspective for the oxygen non-stoichiometry in material electrochemistry.
