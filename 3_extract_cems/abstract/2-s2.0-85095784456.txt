In this paper, we identified a synthetic method to design nickel-molybdenum carbide decorated carbonized eggshell membrane (Ni–MoC/CESM) via hydrothermal and carbonization processes and studied the electrochemical performance of the as-synthesized product for supercapacitor applications. A discarded eggshell membrane (ESM) was used as a template for the growth of NiMoO4 at its fiber network via hydrothermal treatment and subsequently carbonized under an inert atmosphere at 900 °C to prepare Ni–MoC/CESM composite. The Ni–MoC/CESM composite showed good electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 312 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, 87.4% of capacitance retention was achieved after 2000 cycles.
