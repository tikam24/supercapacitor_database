The electrode for nano-supercapacitors with silver/manganese oxides thin film were obtained by electrochemical deposition method. These thin films were potentiostaticly deposited (-0.7V v.s. open circuit) on ITO substrate with potassium permanganate and silver acetate solution for 200s. The thickness of the thin films was in the range of 100âˆ¼300nm and composed of MnOx nanoparticles. The morphology and the microstructure of the samples were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the states of the ions were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The silver acted as a reduction agent and resulted in the valence change for Mn from +4 to 3+. Such a nanostructure of the thin film with MnOx nanoparticles and Ag 2O results in much higher capacitance. It was suggested that the addition of silver oxide would promote the pseudo-capacitance by increasing the impedance of the thin films.
