Technological advances have led to higher energy demands across the world, which are largely met by fossil fuels. Many countries have resolved to bring down their carbon footprint by implementing newer, greener, and renewable sources of energy. Efforts to design materials with different physicochemical properties have led to engineering core-shell (CS) nanomaterials. The choice of shell and core is driven by the end-use for which nanoparticles are synthesized. CS nanomaterials have been successfully employed in energy conversion and storage applications like solar cells, fuel cells, rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, and so on. This chapter discusses the role of CS nanomaterials for energy conversion and energy storage, especially by fuel cells, supercapacitors, and lithium-ion batteries and their structure-property relationship.
