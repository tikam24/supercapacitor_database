With the continuous promotion of the green transportation concept, supercapacitors have gained popularity for their excellent charging and discharging characteristics. However, the unreasonable management of supercapacitor will lead to poor safety and reliability of the supercapacitor system. Aiming at this problem, a supercapacitor cloud management system based on the digital twin is proposed in this paper, which improves the computing power and data storage capacity through cloud computing for the whole life cycle state monitoring of supercapacitors. Firstly, the mathematical modeling of the supercapacitor system is carried out, and the state parameters during the charging and discharging of the supercapacitor are obtained in real-time at the physical layer and uploaded to the data interaction network. Secondly, in the network layer, all data related to the supercapacitor are measured and transmitted to the cloud through IoT, and a digital twin cloud model of the supercapacitor management system is established to evaluate the usage status of the supercapacitor by using the real-time data in the data interaction network. Finally, the supercapacitor charging and discharging control strategy is adjusted in real-time based on the state evaluation results at the control layer and given a visualization window visible to users. The application of the supercapacitor system in the digital twin is explored by developing a parameter estimation algorithm suitable for cloud computing. The experimental results verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed supercapacitor cloud management system.
