The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) composites are coated onto the polycaprolactone (PCL) substrate via spray coating technique to prepare a flexible supercapacitor. The electrochemical properties of the flexible PCL supercapacitor as a function of bending cycles and angles are evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The EIS and charge/discharge curves of the flexible PCL supercapacitor exhibit capacitive behavior even after prolonged bending cycles up to 500. The highest capacitance value of the unbent PCL supercapacitor is 52.5 F gâˆ’1 which retained 65% after 500 bending with 6000th galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles.
