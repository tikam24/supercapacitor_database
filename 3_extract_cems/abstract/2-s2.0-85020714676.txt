We describe the direct and fast growth process of molybdenum trioxide (α-MoO3) nanosheets on a Si wafer, the carbon papers and the vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a simple vapor phase transport using the MoO3 source at 700 °C. We have carefully explored the electrochemical performances of α-MoO3/CNTs hetero-nanostructures, resulting in enhancing relevant electrochemical responses as an effective electrode material for supercapacitor.
