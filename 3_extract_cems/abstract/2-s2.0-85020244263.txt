The increasing demands for clean and renewable energy, the advantages of high power density, long lasting and high efficiency have made Supercapacitor as one of the major emerging energy storage device.The 2D layered metal oxide nanocomposite with SWCNT is the promising candidate for energy storage and conversion. In this work we exfoliate the crystalline bulk MoO3 by simple liquid phase exfoliation to give multi-layer MoO3 dispersed in a suitable solvent. As the electrical conductivity of MoO3 is very low so, the dispersion was used to make hybrid material with SWCNT dispersion by vacuum filtration. The SWCNT-MoO3 composite showed an areal capacitance value of 1290 μF/cm2 at 10 mV/s in PVA-H2 SO4 solid gel electrolyte. This composite based electrode provides an energy density of 0.092 μWh/cm2 and a power density of 9.54 μW/cm2 at 0.01 mA/cm2
