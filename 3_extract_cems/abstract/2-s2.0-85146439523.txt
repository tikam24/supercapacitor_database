A methodology which assesses the potentiodynamic characteristics of individual electrodes in hybrid capacitors (HCs) is introduced, using a Li-ion capacitor (LIC) as an example. Each electrode contribution was calculated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on a cell equipped with a reference electrode by adapting the procedure for electrical double-layer capacitors. It has been confirmed that, during the potentiodynamic analysis of a hybrid capacitor, the scan rate of the electrodes ([Formula presented] and [Formula presented]) is not constant in time. Furthermore, [Formula presented] tends to 0, while [Formula presented] aims to reach the rate of the voltage sweep ([Formula presented]). By contrast, when the electrodes are analyzed separately at a constant potential scan rate, the voltammogram of the battery-type negative electrode does not provide the same current response as a hybrid capacitor, where only the voltage ramp is controlled. The proposed methodology is fundamental for revealing any imbalance in the contributions of the electrodes and providing a correct representation of their current profiles during the potentiodynamic analysis of a hybrid cell.
