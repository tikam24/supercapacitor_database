Carbon-based zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (C-ZIHCs), inheriting the merits from supercapacitors and batteries, exhibit promise in energy-storage technologies. However, unsatisfactory energy density still hinders their practical applications for most reported C-ZIHCs. We report a novel Zn(BF4)2/[EMIM]BF4 electrolyte to construct C-ZIHCs with a high energy density. The Zn(BF4)2/[EMIM]BF4 electrolyte features high reductive/oxidative stability, which guarantees no significant dendrites and side reactions to corrode the Zn anode during the charging/discharging process, and achieves ultrafast Zn plating/stripping with a high coulombic efficiency (>99 %) and unprecedented cycling stability (over 1200 h). By virtue of the excellent properties of the electrolyte, C-ZIHCs is built to exhibit a high average output voltage (1.9 V), a high energy/power density (220 Wh kg−1/9.5 KW kg−1), and a long cycle life (95 % capacity retention after 20000 cycles). Herein, we report the use of Zn salt-based ionic liquid as an electrolyte to construct C-ZIHCs, which provides a new opportunity for the development of C-ZIHCs with excellent comprehensive performance.
