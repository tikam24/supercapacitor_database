Multicomponent hybrid materials are signified as promising electrode materials for energy storage application due to synergistic effect of existing components. In this work, MnCO3/ Mn3O4 hybrid materials are synthesized by simple one-step sucrose-assisted hydrothermal method with KMnO4 as the only starting raw source. The presence of sucrose, reaction time, and temperature are found to be crucial for the final composition/ structure of the obtained products. After 12 h hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C, the synthesized hybrid material (MS-12) possesses relatively homogeneous nanooctahedron morphology and good crystallinity. Among all the tested electrode materials as pseudocapacitor, MS-12 exhibits better specific capacitance (capacity) of 191.0 Fg−1 (229.2 Cg−1) in comparison to other hybrid materials synthesized during 6 h (MS-6; 105.8/ 127.0 Fg−1/ Cg−1), 24 h (MS-24; 98.3/ 118.0 Fg−1/ Cg−1), and bare δ-MnO2 obtained without sucrose (M-24; 73.7/ 88.4 Fg−1/ Cg−1) at a specific current of 1.0 Ag−1. Moreover, MS-12 shows excellent cyclic stability with 97.8% capacitive retention from its initial value even after 3000 continuous cycles at 1.5 Ag−1. The better electrochemical performance of MS-12 hybrid material may be originated due to the relatively more bulk/ electrochemical active surface area, favorable pore size, as well as synergistic impact of both MnCO3 and mixed valance oxide (Mn3O4). Based on three-electrode configuration performances, MS-12//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is also assembled using MS-12 hybrid material as the positive and active carbon as the negative electrode. The fabricated ASC shows appreciable specific capacitance (capacity) of 73.5 Fg−1 (147.0 Cg−1) at a specific current of 1.0 Ag−1 and a specific energy of 40.8 Whkg−1 at a specific power of 1000 Wkg−1. In terms of long term cyclic stability, the device represents 81.4% capacitive retention after 2000 charging-discharging cycles at a specific current of 1.0 Ag−1.
