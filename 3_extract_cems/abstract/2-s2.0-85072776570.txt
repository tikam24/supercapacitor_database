The industry of smart energy storage system demands high energy density electrode material for supercapacitors. In this work, ZnS/rGO/PIn (ZGPIn) nanohybrid was synthesized to enhance energy density by varying potential window range. A binder free ZGPIn electrode has slit like pores, better redox activity, thermal stability and long life span which favours as sustainable electrode material for green energy applications. The structural, thermal and morphological properties were studied via FTIR, XRD, Raman, TGA and FESEM techniques. The electrochemical properties were studied in 1 M H2SO4 at room temperature. The as prepared ZGPIn electrode material delivered highest gravimetric and volumetric capacitances of 475.5 F g−1 and 165 F cm−3 with gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 42.3 W h kg−1 and 14.7 W h L−1 at 1 A g−1 respectively. The energy density reaches to 74.7 W h kg−1 for 1.4 V at 1 A g−1. The 95% capacitance retention after 5000 consecutive cycles reveals its long term cyclic stability and suggested as an efficient, cheap and reliable electrode material for supercapacitor application.
