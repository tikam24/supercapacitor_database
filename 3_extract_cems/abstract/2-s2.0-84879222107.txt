The effect of two substituent groups, ortho-methoxy (-OCR3) and methyl (-CH3) in aniline, have been studied for supercapacitor applications. The polyaniline (PANT), poly (o-anisidine) (POA) and poly (o-toluidine) (POT) have been synthesized by oxidative polymerization method, and characterized by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), UV-visible speetroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) techniques. The specific capacitance, charging/discharging and electrochemical impedance characteristics of the supercapacitor fabricated using PANT, POA, as well as POT electrodes are evaluated in 2M H2SO 4 electrolytic media. The highest specific capacitance of 400 F/g is calculated for PANI, whereas, POA and POT have exhibited 360 F/g and 325 F/g capacitance in supercapacitor studies. Â© 2012 Materials Research Society.
