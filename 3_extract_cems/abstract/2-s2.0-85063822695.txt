The Î±-MnO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized for supercapacitor electrode application by controlled co-precipitation method. The as-prepared sample was annealed at different temperature to enhance the crystallinity and it is confirmed with XRD analysis. The electro chemical behavior and conductivity of the material were investigated by cyclic voltammetry with charge-discharge techniques and AC Impedance analyzer.
