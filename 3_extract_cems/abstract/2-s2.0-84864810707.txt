Homogenous hexangular starfruit-like vanadium oxide was prepared for the first time by a one-step hydrothermal method. The assembly process of hexangular starfruit-like structure was observed from TEM images. The electrochemical performance of starfruit-like vanadium oxide was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The obtained starfruit-like vanadium oxide exhibits a high power capability (19 Wh kg -1 at the specific power of 3.4 kW kg -1) and good cycling stability for supercapacitors application.
