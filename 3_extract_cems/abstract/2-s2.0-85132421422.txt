A binder free approach was use to prepare thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) at 200 °C directly on Ni-Foam (NF) (current collector) via atmospheric pressure-chemical vapour deposition (AP-CVD) and used as a positive electrode for supercapacitor application. The TRGO/NF electrode preparation method is simpler, quicker, cheaper and more effective compared to other method. The half-cell electrochemical performances in 6 M KOH showed a maximum specific capacity of 52.64 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The device: TRGO/NF//PAC showed a specific energy and power of 18.72 Wh kg−1 and 547.52 W kg−1 respectively at 1 A g−1; and 14.10 Wh kg−1 and 2.5 kW kg−1 respectively at 5 A g−1. The high coulombic efficiency (99.9%) and capacitance retention (70%) indicate outstanding stability. These results represent a significant progress in the fabrication of binder and conductive enhancement free positive electrode for electrochemical energy storage devices.
