Herein, the material structural properties such as phase, morphology, chemical composition, and surface area for In2S3 nanoflakes, synthesized by a one-step solvothermal method, are studied [1]. The comparative electrochemical performance data of indium based electrode material is presented to establish the practical suitability of prepared In2S3 electrode material. Device demonstration of fabricated solid-state supercapacitor device on different time frames set performance level demonstration of current work and suggest a potential candidate for next-generation energy storage electrode material.
