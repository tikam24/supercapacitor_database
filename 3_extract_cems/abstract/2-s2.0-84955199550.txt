Commercial carbon paper was coated with polyaniline (PANI) using in situ polymerization of aniline. Prior to the PANI coating, acid treatment was performed to carboxylate the surface of the carbon paper for enhancing PANI adhesion by sonication of the carbon paper in a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids. The loading mass density of PANI on the acid-treated carbon paper increased more than three times compared to that on the carbon paper without acid treatment. The specific capacitance also increased from 112 to 174 F/g in a two-electrode system (calculated using a total mass of carbon paper and PANI) due to better PANI coating on the acid-treated carbon paper. The simple acid treatment provides good adhesion of PANI to the commercial carbon paper and can be applied to prepare supercapacitor electrodes.
