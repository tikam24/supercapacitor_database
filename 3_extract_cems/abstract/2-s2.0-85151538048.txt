In the present work, we have synthesised silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) using the leaf extract of Ficus religiosa. The Ag NPs were incorporated with biochar (derived from algal biomass powder) and used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The presence of different phytochemicals in the leaf extract of Ficus religiosa was confirmed using different phytochemical tests. The prepared nanocomposite (Biochar/Ag) was analysed using different analytical methods. Galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge, electrochemical impedance analysis, and cyclic voltammetry have all been used in the electrochemical investigation. The maximum specific capacitance of Biochar/Ag was calculated to be 675 F/g. The cyclic stability of Biochar/Ag was observed to be 96.1% after 5000 GCD cycles under three electrode systems. The maximum power density of Biochar/Ag has been found to be 3168 W/kg. The developed Biochar/Ag can be utilised as an effective and low-cost electrode material for supercapacitors.
