The proceedings contain 19 papers. The topics discussed include: intermodulation radar with dynamic fundamental tone cancellation for linearity improvement; fast RF-synthesizer based on direct digital synthesis for an instantaneous frequency measurement system; on-the-fly adaptation of backscatter modulator impedances using digitally-tuned capacitors; analysis of design trade-offs in ultra-low-power FSK receivers for phase-based ranging; optimization of a high frequency radio frequency identification system for tool recognition in a metal environment; support application for configuring optimal relay nodes in wireless sensor networks; wireless sensor network with mesh topology for carbon dioxide monitoring in a winery; and a supercapacitor powered radar sensor node for lamination into wind energy rotor blades.
