Dandelion-like CuCo2O4 nanoflowers (CCO NFs) with ultrathin NiMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) shells were fabricated via a two-step hydrothermal method. The prepared CuCo2O4@NiMn LDH core/shell nanoflowers (CCO@NM LDH NFs) possessed a high specific surface area (~181 m2·g−1) with an average pore size of ~256 nm. Herein, the CCO@NM LDH NFs exhibited the typical battery-type electrode material with a specific capacity of 2156.53 F·g−1 at a current density of 1 A·g−1. With the increase in current density, the rate capability retention was 68.3% at a current density of 10 A·g−1. In particular, the 94.6% capacity of CCO@NM LDH NFs remains after 2500 cycles at 5 A·g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with CCO@NM LDH NFs//activated carbon (AC) demonstrates a remarkable capacitance of 303.11 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 with excellent cycling stability. The coupling and synergistic effects of multi-valence transition metals provide a convenient channel for the electrochemical process, which is beneficial to spread widely within the realm of electrochemical energy storage.
