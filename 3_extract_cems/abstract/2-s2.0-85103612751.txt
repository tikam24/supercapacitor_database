The generation of electrical energy from renewable energy sources is rapidly increasing across the world due to its many advantages. Renewable energy source is also known as clean energy source. The energy storage devices are playing an important role in both renewable generation and distribution of power. The energy storing devices also helps to improve stability of electrical power grid. The electrode, electrolyte and separators are the main components of ultracapacitors. The performance of ultracapacitors mainly depends on the properties of electrode material, the type of separator used, properties of electrolyte used and its concentration level. Nylon as a separator material for ultracapacitors is investigated. Various parameters of nylon-based ultracapacitors are compared with conventional polyethylene-based ultracapacitors. Very less research work has been done on the processing of electrode material. Ball milling is the most commonly used material processing method in energy storage devices such as ultracapacitors, battery and fuel cells. The effect of ball milling parameters on the performance of ultracapacitors needs to be investigated. Most significant factors of ball milling parameters of electrode material for ultracapacitor are identified. Modeling of ball milling process on electrode material is done by using the statistical method- design of the experiment. The novel ball mill machine with some unique features is also presented. Pulse current density is taken as new output parameters which is more important than an internal resistance and specific capacitance. Most significant ball mill machine parameters are taken as input parameters and specific capacitance, internal resistance along with pulse current density are taken as output parameters for the modeling of nylon-based ultracapacitors.
