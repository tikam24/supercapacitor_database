A simple direct fabrication of 3-D electrodes on Ni foam was accomplished via low-temperature thermal decomposition of inks composed of manganese formate, triethylenetetramine and hexanol. Ni foams dipped in the ink were calcined at various temperatures to fabricate thin films. Calcination at 200 °C resulted in a thin film with small pores on the wire frame of Ni foam. Calcination at 300 °C produced thin films with bump pores on the wire frame and occlusion film between the frame wires. Both thin films showed high per volume capacitance of 6.7 and 7.1F cm−3 for the thin film synthesized at 200 and 300 °C, respectively. The high capacitance was due to the high specific capacitance (SC) of the thin films calcined at 200–220 °C and to the large loading mass on Ni foam of the films calcined at 270–300 °C.
