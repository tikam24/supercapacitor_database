In view of the characteristic of V/I output and dynamic response lag of fuel cell, hybrid power system project of middle size bus included Fuel cell and auxiliary electrical sources is brought forward. The system adopts three energy sources as power sources, which is composed of fuel cell, NIH battery and supercapacitor, and the whole system structure is designed. Based on the analysis of drive mode about power system, the hybrid power coordinated control system of fuel cell middle size bus is built by applying intelligent coordinated and predictive control. Non-linear predictive model of system is established by applying three forward feed neural network, and besides, power predictive control system of fuel cell engine is designed and optimized, finally, the concrete predictive control algorithm step is given. The simulation results are presented, which show the effectiveness of the control strategy, for it can reduce frequent fluctuation of fuel cell engine output power and improve dynamic performance and fuel economy of the vehicle.
