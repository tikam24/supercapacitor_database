Current rechargeable batteries generally display limited cycle life and slow electrode kinetics and contain environmentally unfriendly components. Furthermore, their operation depends on the redox reactions of metal elements.We present an original battery system that depends on the redox of I-/I3 - couple in liquid cathode and the reversible enolization in polyimide anode, accompanied by Li+ (or Na+) diffusion between cathode and anode through a Li+/Na+ exchange polymermembrane. There are no metal element-based redox reactions in this battery, and Li+ (or Na+) isonly used for charge transfer. Moreover, the components (electrolyte/electrode) of this system are environment-friendly. Both electrodes are demonstrated to have very fast kinetics, which gives the battery a supercapacitor-like highpower. It can even be cycled 50,000 timeswhen operatedwithin the electrochemicalwindow of 0 to 1.6 V. Such a systemmight shed light on the design of high-safety and low-cost batteries for grid-scale energy storage.
