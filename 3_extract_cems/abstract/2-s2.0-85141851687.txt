Supercapacitors (SCs) are recognized by high power densities and significantly higher cyclic stability compared to batteries. However, the energy density in SCs should be improved for better applications and commercialization. This could be achieved by developing materials characterized by such porous structures as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal chalcogenides in the electrodesâ€™ materials. Herein, the recent advances in MOF derived from metal sulfides and selenides as electrode materials for SCs are reviewed and discussed. Strategies such as adopting core-shell structures, carbon-coating, and doping, which are used to promote the electrochemical performances of these MOF-based materials, are presented. Additionally, the progress in developing S-doped MOF-derived catalysts for the oxidation-reduction reaction (ORR) in the cathode of fuel cells is also reviewed. In addition, the challenges and future research trends are summarized in this minireview.
