In this study, a series of one-dimensional (1D)/two-dimensional (2D) heterostructure hybrids were fabricated through the in situ growth of a Co and Ni bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoNi-ZIF) around N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). The hybrids were further exploited as effective supercapacitor materials. The N-CNTs were prepared by carbonizing a mixture of glucose and the melamine–cyanuric acid complex at a high temperature (900 °C) under N2 atmosphere and applied as the template for the in situ synthesis of CoNi-ZIF nanosheets (NSs). The 1D N-CNTs in the hybrids can act as the high-way for charge transfer to boost the faradaic reactions. Changing the usage of metal precursors not only provided abundant redox reaction sites in 2D CoNi-ZIF NSs but also modulated the microstructures and chemical components of the hybrids. The integration of the features of N-CNTs and CoNi-ZIF NSs can result in a synergistic effect between N-CNTs and CoNi-ZIF NSs. Therefore, the obtained CoNi-ZIFs and N-CNTs hybrid (CoNi-ZIF@N-CNT) exhibited superior electrochemical capacitive performance. Comparison revealed that the CoNi-ZIF@N-CNT-2 hybrid, which was prepared with a 1:1 mass ratio of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, displayed the largest specific capacitance of 1118F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which was higher than the capacitance of most reported metal–organic framework (MOF)-based supercapacitor electrodes. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on the CoNi-ZIF@N-CNT-2 electrode exhibited a high energy density of 51.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 860.1 W kg−1 and good cycle stability. This work can provide a facile and effective way for the fabrication of heterostructured 1D/2D nanostructures based on 2D MOFs for advanced energy storage.
