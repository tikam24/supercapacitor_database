Hierarchically porous structured carbon material is synthesized from Abutilon indicum steams biomass by simple physical and chemical activation method. The activation effects of KOH with different temperature of 800째C and 900째C are investigated in an inert gas atmosphere. The maximum Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume are achieved as 1064 m2g-1 and 0.788 cm3g-1 at 900째C and 986 m2g-1 and 0.658 cm3g-1 at 800째C respectively. Further, in aqueous supercapacitors applications, the porous carbon electrode material shows a highest specific capacitance of 229 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 in 1.2 V, energy density of 19.93 Wh kg-1 and power density of 2738 Wkg-1 with stable cycling performance of 98 % from the initial values to after 15,000 cycles and 99.7% columbic efficiency was obtained. The results reveal that the prepared porous carbon electrode material structure precedes the fast ion transmission, and quick charge transportation, and it would be promising candidate for supercapacitor applications.
