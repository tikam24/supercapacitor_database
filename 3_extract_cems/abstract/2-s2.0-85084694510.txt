Wearable energy storage and flexible body biomolecule detection are two key factors for real-time monitoring of human health in a practical environment. It would be rather exciting if one wearable system could be used for carrying out both energy storage and biomolecule detection. Herein, carbon fiber-based NiCoO2 nanosheets coated with nitrogen-doped carbon (CF@NiCoO2@N-C) have been prepared via a simple electrochemical deposition method. Interestingly, being a dual-functional active material, CF@NiCoO2@N-C exhibits excellent behaviors as a supercapacitor and prominent electrocatalytic properties, which can be applied for enzyme-free biosensor. It exhibits outstanding energy storage, high capacitive stability (94% capacitive retention after 10,000 cycles), and pre-eminent flexible ability (95% capacitive retention after 10,000 bending cycles), as well as high sensitivity for enzyme-free glucose detection (592 » μA mM-1). Moreover, the CF@NiCoO2@N-C-based wearable supercapacitors would be used as self-powered energy systems for enzyme-free biosensors. Integrating with bluetooth, we have successfully developed a wearable self-powered enzyme-free smartsensor, remotely controlled using a smartphone for health monitoring in a practical environment. From this prospective study, it was found that the design of wearable self-powered smartsensors, demonstrating energy storage and enzyme-free biosensing in one system, provides a promising device for detecting body biomolecules, which has the potential to be implemented in the artificial intelligent fields.
