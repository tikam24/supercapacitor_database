It is highly desired to introduce active nitrogen atoms and abundant pore structures for enhanced electrochemical performances of carbon materials for supercapacitors. Hence a facile one-step carbonization/activation method was adopted to treat different mass ratios of polyvinylpyrrolidone/melamine formaldehyde resin (PVP/MF) and ammonium carbonate in order to obtain porous N-doped carbon (PNC). Symmetric supercapacitors with PNC as electrodes were assembled using KOH aqueous electrolyte. It is clearly demonstrated that due to the introduction of ammonium carbonate the resulting PNC displays increased specific surface areas, enriched pore structures and increased active nitrogen concentration. The ratio-optimized PNC with 7 wt% ammonium carbonate exhibits the highest proportion of negatively charged N-6 and N-5 with the pseudocapacitance and the highest micropore volume with the electrical double-layer capacitance, which also lead to the decrease of charge transfer resistance and the increase of transfer rate of electrolyte ions in the pores, and these are beneficial effects for the improvement of the overall capacitive performances. The ratio-optimized PNC displays an enhanced specific capacitance, which is about 32% higher than that of the PNC prepared without ammonium carbonate. And the symmetric supercapacitor assembled with the ratio-optimized PNC shows superior cycling performance and its capacitance retention is 94.43% after 1500 cycles at 20 mA cmâˆ’2.
