Nitrogen-doped carbon double-shell nanoparticles (NC DS-HNPs) were fabricated using SiO2/TiO2 double-shell nanoparticles (ST DS-HNPs) and polydopamine-coating. The NC DS-HNPs have a high surface area of 873.52 m2 g−1 and a pore volume of 2.86 cm3 g−1, which are favorable characteristics for supercapacitors. In addition, nitrogen doping induced pseudo-capacitance via the redox activity of the surface functionalities. A specific capacitance of 202 F g−1 was achieved for supercapacitors based on NC DS-HNPs at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Consequently, the unique morphology and electrochemical properties of NC DS-HNPs show great potential for future energy-related devices.
