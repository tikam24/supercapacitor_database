Hybridization of different electrode materials to yield favorable synergistic effects and enhanced function is a focus of current research in developing advanced electrochemical energy-storage devices. This Focus Review summarizes recent progress in rational design and fabrication of advanced electrode materials with heterogeneous nanostructures and interfaces engineered on the nanometer scale. The hybridization typically involves two or more materials such as metal oxides (or sulfides, carbides, and nitrides) and various forms of nanostructured carbon materials. We focus on two devices: sodium ion batteries and supercapacitors, as well as their integration with other devices to realize multifunctional systems.
