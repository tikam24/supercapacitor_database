Supercapacitors provide remarkable eco-friendly advancement in energy conversion and storage with a huge potential to control the future economy of the entire world. Currently, industries focus on the design and engineering aspects of supercapacitors with high performance (high energy), flexibility (by the use of composite polymer based electrolytes), high voltage (ionic liquid) and low cost. The paper reviews the modelling techniques like Empirical modelling, Dissipation transmission line models, Continuum models, Atomistic models, Quantum models, Simplified analytical models etc. proposed for the theoretical study of Supercapacitors and discusses their limitations in studying all the aspects of Supercapacitors. It also reviews the various software packages available for Supercapacitor (SC) modelling and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The paper also reviews the Experimental advancements in the field of electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs), pseudo capacitors and hybrid/asymmetric supercapacitors and discusses the commercial progress of supercapacitors as well.
