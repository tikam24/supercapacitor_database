The Flexible supercapacitor electrode material was prepared by simple spray coating technique. This will provide a greener alternative for the fabrication of binder free composite electrode for supercapacitor applications. A symmetric double layer super capacitor stack was fabricated by using flexible electrodes. The investigation of the capacitance property of the fabricated super capacitor stack was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrical impedance spectroscopy studies. The flexible electrode material shows a specific capacitance of 50 Fg-1 with good cyclibility. Â© 2014 SPIE.
