NiO/AgNWs/FTO electrode material with three-dimensional structure is prepared by method of electrochemical deposition. The SEM images of NiO/AgNWs/FTO electrode nanocomposite revealed that the NiO is wrapped onto the surface of AgNWs. Furthermore, the effect of annealing time on the electrochemical properties of the electrode was studied, it shows excellent electrochemical performance and good linear relationship during the charge-discharge process. The NiO/AgNWs/FTO electrode with specific capacitance of 408 F g-1 has been achieved at a current density of 0.85 A g-1 and it has excellent cycling stability with 80% retention over 7,000 cycles at a high current density of 5.5 A g-1 when the annealing time is 60 minutes. It can be widely used in the micro-electronic devices, such as micro supercapacitors and chips of computer.
