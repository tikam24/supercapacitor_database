Intrinsically poor conductivity, sluggish ion transfer kinetics, and limited specific area are the three main obstacles that confine the electrochemical performance of manganese dioxide in supercapacitors. Herein, one-dimensional mesoporous MnO2 nanotubes were prepared using a polycarbonate film as a template and a large number of oxygen vacancies were introduced by calcination under a N2 atmosphere. The effects of calcination temperature on the crystal structure, micro-morphology and electrochemical performance of MnO2 nanotubes were studied. The presence of oxygen vacancies increases the redox capacity of ov-MnO2-300 nanotubes, and the unique one-dimensional mesoporous structure also provides an effective channel for ion transport. Therefore, the ov-MnO2-300 nanotube has an excellent specific capacitance of 459.0 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and also has outstanding rate performance and cycle performance. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with ov-MnO2-300 nanotubes as the positive electrode and graphene@MoS2 as the negative electrode delivered an energy density of 40.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 1024 W kg-1. The excellent capacitance performance is mostly attributed to the introduction of oxygen vacancies to increase the intrinsic conductivity of MnO2, and the unique one-dimensional mesoporous nanotube structure increases the active sites of redox reactions.
