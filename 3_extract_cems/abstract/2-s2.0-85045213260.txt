Functional materials based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and metal oxide nanoparticles possess superior properties arising from the synergy of the individual properties. Obtaining these materials in the form of large area films are advantageous for most applications involving sensing, photovoltaics, supercapacitors, etc. We have synthesized free standing, thin films of rGO with semiconductor nanostructures such as ZnO, CuO, SnO2, and magnetic nanoparticles such as Fe2O3 at a liquid/liquid interface employing a simple interfacial reaction of the precursors. The method can be adopted as a general route to prepare rGO-based metal oxide films. rGO-ZnO films consist of hexagonal cylinders of ZnO, and rGO-Fe2O3 films exhibit particle or rod-like morphologies of iron oxide interspersed with rGO layers. The applications of these hybrid films as renewable surface-enhanced Raman substrates (SERS) and supercapacitors are demonstrated. The higher photodegradation rates provided by the metal oxide-rGO hybrids enable regeneration of the used SERS substrate while the contribution from electric double layer capacitance of rGO and pseudocapacitance due to metal oxide enhances the charge storage in hybrids.
