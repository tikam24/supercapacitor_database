A unique nature derived three-dimensional porous biocarbon, graphene (G), and polypyrrole composite as electrode materials for supercapacitor was successfully fabricated, which utilizes the advantage of the natural porous carbon structure, G and polypyrrole to promote the electrochemical performance of this composite electrode. Firstly, natural loofah and G oxide composite was prepared by direct dip-coating process. Secondly, high-temperature carbonization strategy was used to prepare loofah-based carbons–G (LBCs-G) composite. Thirdly, polypyrrole was directly coated on LBCs–G composite by applying electrochemical deposition method. The unique three-dimensional porous structure incorporated with G and polypyrrole boost the capacitance ascribe to both the electric double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. The results also reveal that there are synergistic effects among the porous structure, G and polypyrrole.
