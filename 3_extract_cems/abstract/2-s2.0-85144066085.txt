Many emerging technologies urgently require powerful energy storage devices, and their development depends largely on advances in material performance to meet commercialization requirements. Here, the synthesis of a novel structure of a Ni–Fe layered double hydroxide (LDH) interconnected nanoweb is achieved at low temperature (100 °C) using a wet-chemistry synthesis method. The 3D porous structure consists of interconnected nanowires and produces a very high specific capacitance of 1656.0 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, which is more than double that recorded for a conventional Ni–Fe LDH nanosheet with a wrinkled structure (787.2 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1). This superior performance is primarily attributed to the 3D porous structure, which provides a large surface area and facilitates electron transport along the interconnected nanowires, thereby shortening the electrolyte diffusion path. A hybrid supercapacitor using the Ni–Fe LDH nanoweb as the cathode material has a high capacitance of 56.2 F g−1 with an energy density of 20.0 Wh kg−1. This unique structure offers significant potential for the preparation of high-performance supercapacitors and opens a new route for the structural design and development of high-efficiency electrode materials in numerous energy storage fields.
