Nanostructured CoSe2 chrysanthemum flower are synthesized via a simple hydrothermal route. The highly hierarchical and electrochemically active material is electrodeposited with PPy to produce high performance CoSe2@PPy core/shell structured electrodes. A flexible fiber asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) assembled from a CoSe2@PPy core/shell positive electrode and an electrochemically activated carbon fiber (EACF) negative electrode exhibits high volumetric energy density, superior flexibility and long lifespan. The resulting FASC has been used to power a mini-scale flexible photodetector, demonstrating great potential for the development of high performance energy storage devices.
