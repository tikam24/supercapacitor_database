Heteroatom-decorated nanoporous carbon nanofiber composites (Si-CNFCs) containing grapheneare prepared through one-step electrospinning with the help of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and a subsequent thermal treatment, and their electrochemical properties as supercapacitor electrodes are investigated. The introduction of TEOS and graphene into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution induced superior material properties, such as a high surface area, stabilized Si-related structures, and increased electrical conductivity, resulting in the enhancement of the electrochemical performances of electrodes. The supercapacitor electrode prepared with 3wt% graphene and 10 wt% TEOS shows high specific capacitance, 144.79 Fg-1, and high energy density, 16.82-8.33 Whkg-1, at power densities ranging from 400-20,000 Wkg-1 in a 6 M KOH aqueous solution. Therefore, the Si-CNFC electrodes promote desirable interactions and improve the accessibility of the ions solvated with a polar solvent, yielding a high charge capacity and improving the energy/power capabilities through the electrical double-layer and pseudo-capacitive effects.
