Supercapacitors (SCs) are promising energy sources with high power densities. In the recent years, many efforts have been made to enhance the low energy density of SCs through improvement of the electrode materials. As electrode materials, metal oxides/hydroxides (MOHs) and their composites usually offer high energy densities as a result of their high theoretical capacitances. Up to now, various synthetic methods have been developed for preparing MOHs. In this regards, cathode electrodeposition through base electrogeneration has been intensively used as a one-step simple technique for obtaining various nanostructures of MOHs composites as high-performance SC electrode materials. In this paper, the reports on the fabrication of MOHs-based nanomaterials through the CED method and their super-capacitive abilities have been reviewed.
