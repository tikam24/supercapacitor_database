In order to prepare the flexible mesoporous carbon nanofibers, which is used as free-standing supercapacitor material, a novel type of one-dimensional mesoporous carbon nanofibers has been prepared via the electrospinning technique and thermal treatment by using resol as the carbon source and triblock copolymer Pluronic F127 as the template. The mesoporous carbon nanofibers are characterized by x-ray diffraction, specific surface area and pore distribution. The results show that there are a lot of mesoporous structures in the carbon nanofibers with addition of Pluronic F127. The obtained MCNFs-2 shows a mesoporous structure with ultrahigh specific surface area of 1 444.26 m2/g, providing numerous electroactive sites to accommodate more charges. As a result, the MCNFs-2 electrode exhibites high specific capacitance (139.6 F/g at 0.05 A/g) and excellent rate of performance in a 6 mol/L KOH aqueous solution.
