Preparing carbon materials for supercapacitors with high specific capacitance via a facile approach has been a crucial issue recently. Nitrogen/phosphorus co-doped carbon materials (NPCs) have been prepared via direct carbonization of the mixture of urea formaldehyde microspheres (UFMs) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). Change of chemical structure of UFMs during carbonization in the presence of H3PO4 was investigated by use of Thermogravimetric Analysis and Fourier transform infrared. The results showed that by controlling the content of H3PO4, specific surface area, elemental composition and microstructure of as-prepared product could be tuned, along with tunable electrochemical properties. When used as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the NPCs with optimized phosphorus content exhibited a markedly enhanced specific capacitance of 245 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 with the moderate specific surface area (∼ 200 m2·g−1). Moreover, the NPCs presented high rate capability of 191 F·g−1 at 30 A·g−1 (78% capacitance retention when compared with that at 0.5 A·g−1) and excellent long-term stability with almost no capacitance loss over 7200 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles.
