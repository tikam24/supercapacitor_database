Given the exceptional specific surface area, geometry, and periodic porosity, transition-metal sulfides derived from crystalline metal-organic frameworks have spurred great interest in energy storage systems. Herein, employing a different sulfurization process, well-aligned NiCo 2 S 4 and CoS 2 nanoarrays with a hollow/porous configuration derived from pentagon-like ZIF-67 are successfully designed and constructed on Ni foam. The hollow/porous structure grown on a conductive matrix can significantly improve electroactive sites, shorten charge/ion diffusion length, and enhance mass/electron transfer. Consequently, the obtained NiCo 2 S 4 possesses an excellent specific capacitance of 939 C/g, a fast charge/discharge rate, and a favorable life span. An advanced asymmetrical supercapacitor is fabricated by engaging NiCo 2 S 4 and CoS 2 as cathode and anode materials, respectively, with a well-separated potential window. The obtained device delivers an exceptional energy density of 55.8 W h/kg at 695.2 W/kg, which is highly considerable to the recent transition metal sulfide-based devices. This facile tactic could be employed to construct other electrode materials with superior electrochemical properties.
