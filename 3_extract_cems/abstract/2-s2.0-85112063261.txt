Redox electrolytes benefit the improvement of electrochemical performance. After preparing polypyrrole nanotubes (PPyNTs) via template method and polypyrrole nanotubes/carbon nanotubes composites (PM) through mixing method, the electrochemical performances of various materials were tested in a H2SO4 electrolyte and a redox electrolyte fabricated by H2SO4 and carmine (AR18). In a three-electrode system, the specific capacitance of PPy nanoparticles is 220 F/g in the H2SO4 electrolyte; that of PPyNTs is 579.2 F/g in the redox electrolyte, which is higher than that of PPy nanoparticles (443.3 F/g). Also, that of PM composites is 674.2 F/g, which is the highest specific capacitance among these materials. A symmetric supercapacitor is assembled to prove the excellence of electrode material and the contribution of the redox electrolyte. The results show that an energy density of the supercapacitor is 15.7 Wh/kg at a power density of 300 W/kg with a current density of 0.5A/g. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate is 90%. Thus, with the help of redox electrolyte, PM composites owning both double-layer capacitance and pseudo-capacitance have much excellent electrochemical performance.
