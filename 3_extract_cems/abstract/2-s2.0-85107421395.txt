There is considerable interest in new solid-state materials for many applications, from energy storage to electronics and neuromorphic computing. This concept paper highlights how pseudocapacitive and ion-insertion materials, for their inherent capability of storing charge and modulate electron conduction, represent a bridge between energy storage, electronics and neuromorphic computing and enable the design of new device architectures.
