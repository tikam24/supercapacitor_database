Currently, two-dimensional designs were enthralled much consideration because of their good electrochemical abilities. Herein, cactus-like designs of Ni-Co/CoMn2O4 composites have been synthesized by simple hydrothermal techniques on Ni foam. The novel construction possessing Ni-Co and CoMn2O4 nanomaterials demonstrates excellent electrochemical properties. As data values, the unique design and porous structures display vitally developed electrochemical capacitance activities which include outstanding specific capacitances, reasonable life cycles, and good rate capabilities. The specific capacitance of the Ni-Co/CoMn2O4 composites exhibits 1567F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g, and it is two-fold superior to the binary Ni-Co nanoparticles and CoMn2O4 nanomaterials electrodes. Else, the proposed Ni-Co/CoMn2O4 composite exhibits excellent long cycles by 95.87% retaining of its initial capacitances after 5000 cyclings. This cactus-like Ni-Co/CoMn2O4 composite refers to the new opportunity to investigate higher-performance sample materials and has great application prospects.
