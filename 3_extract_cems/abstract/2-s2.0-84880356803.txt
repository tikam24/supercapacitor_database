This article describes electrochemical properties of layer-by-layer self-assembled multilayer films composed of magnetite nanoparticle (Fe3O4 NP) and chemically reduced graphene oxide (RGO) for supercapacitor application. The thickness of the Fe3O4/GO bilayer was determined by optical ellipsometry to be 6.53±0.17nm, which agreed well with the sum of the independently measured thickness for each Fe3O4 (5.61±0.14nm) and GO (0.91±0.1nm) layer component. Each layer was found to be deposited uniformly and regularly. Fe3O4/RGO multilayer film was obtained by reducing a Fe3O4/GO film using hydrazine. The multilayer film yielded a minimum resistance of 1.0×104Ω/sq (2.8S/cm) for a film with approximately 50 bilayers. The electrodes fabricated from 30 Fe3O4/RGO bilayers exhibited excellent capacitive performances with a maximum specific gravimetric capacitance (151F/g) at a current density of 0.9A/g. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
