Graphene as a suitable electrode has been extensively used for electrochemical double-layer capacitors based on its excellent properties, including high electrical conductivity and large specific surface area. However, one of the drawbacks is the unavoidable stacking tendency between the graphene nanosheets, resulting in limited electrochemically specific surface area. Herein, novel graphene nanosheets supported by hollow nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks derived from ZIF-8 (GPNC) were fabricated through a simple polyethyleneimine (PEI)-assisted pyrolysis strategy, to boost capacitance performance. Benefiting from the unique scaffold/support role of hollow nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks within the graphene interlayer, the GPNC with a large specific surface area, along with ample micropore/mesopore channels and high nitrogen content, is capable of facilitating electron and electrolyte ion migration kinetics and enhancing intrinsic electrochemical activity. Thus, the GPNC exhibits the highest charge storage of 218 F g−1 and superior rate capability of 74 % when the current density increased from 0.5 to 20 Ag−1 in comparison to pristine graphene and common ZIF-derived carbon/graphene electrodes. The assembled GPNC//GPNC two-electrode system further delivers a maximum power of 9080 Wkg−1 with outstanding electrochemical retention of 84 % over 10 000 cycles.
