Inspired by baking bread, our research group demonstrates a novel method for baking three-dimensional (3D) graphene layers with an open porous network, pore size in the range of dozens of nanometers to several hundred nanometers, and a pore wall thickness of about 10 nm. Such continuously cross-linking structures not only effectively overcome the restacking and agglomeration of graphene nanosheets but also possess more channels between nanosheets to lower the resistance for electron access to the inter-space. Compared with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) prepared at the same temperature, the unique 3D porous-structured graphene layers also contain 4.3 at.% nitrogen. When the 3D graphene layers are employed as an active electrode material for a supercapacitor, a high specific capacitance (SC) of 231.2 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> is displayed after electrochemical activation, approximately two times that of rGO. Only <1.0% of the capacitance degrades after 8000 cycles, exhibiting its excellent cycle stability; furthermore, it liberates a high energy density of 32.1 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 500 W kg<sup>-1</sup>. The attractive performances of 3D graphene layers make them a promising candidate as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
