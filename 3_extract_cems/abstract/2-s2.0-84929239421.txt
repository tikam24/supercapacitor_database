Pseudocapacitive materials exhibit high energy storage, but their energy release is slow. In this paper we aim at solving this problem by using diamond-nickel hydroxide composite wires as a high power supercapacitor material. Diamond nanowires serve as a 3D substrate and current collector. The morphology of the sample was monitored with SEM during the fabrication process. Measured by electrochemical techniques, the material achieved a gravitational capacitance of 1601 F/g (∼80% of the theoretical value). A high power density up to 3 × 105 W/kg was confirmed, which is more than one magnitude higher than state of the art values. The reason for the high rate performance is also determined and discussed in detail, and fast ion diffusion inside the 3D composite is confirmed.
