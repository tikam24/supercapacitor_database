Pure CoMoO4nanoplate arrays grew on nickel foam by one-step hydrothermal process, while flower-like nanoflake CoMoO4@RGO nanocomposites grew on nickel foam. Flower-like nanoflake CoMoO4@RGO nanocomposites electrode exhibited higher capacitance than pure CoMoO4nanoplate arrays electrode. Maximum specific capacitance of 856.2 F g−1was obtained at current density of 1 A g−1for CoMoO4@RGO nanocomposites electrode. In addition, after 2000 cycles of continuous galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles, only 5.5% degradation of specific capacitance was found for CoMoO4@RGO nanocomposites. CoMoO4@RGO nanocomposites exhibited lower electrochemical resistance than pure-CoMoO4. This was because that the former had larger specific surface area and average pore diameter than the latter. The flower-like nanoflake CoMoO4facilitated electrolyte movement during charge or discharge process and provided more active sites for the electrochemical reactions. In addition, the synergetic effect between RGO and CoMoO4also improved the supercapacitor performance.
