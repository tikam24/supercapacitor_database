Pursuing higher working voltage and packaged energy density, an internal tandem supercapacitor has been successfully designed and fabricated based on graphene-based porous carbon hybrid material. Compared with the packaged energy density of 27.2 Wh kgcell -1 and working voltage of 3.5 V using EMIMBF4 electrolyte for the conventional single-cell supercapacitor, the internal tandem device with the same material achieves a much higher working voltage of 7 V as well as a significantly improved energy density of 36.3 Wh kgcell -1 (increased by 33%), which is also about 7 times of that of the state-of-art commercial supercapacitors. A flexible internal tandem device is also designed and fabricated and demonstrated similar excellent performance. A high-performance symmetric internal tandem supercapacitor based on a graphene-based porous carbon material is fabricated. This shows a double-increased working voltage of 7.0 V, but also displays an improved packaged energy density of 36.3 Wh kgcell -1 by 33% increase compared to the single supercapacitor, and is also about 7 times of that of commercial supercapacitors. A flexible internal tandem device is also fabricated with similar performance, high flexibility and electrochemical stability to show the universality for application.
