Nanocomposites made of functionalized graphene with polypyrrole were synthesized in two steps by first incorporating pyridine-pyridazine functions on graphene surface through cycloaddition followed by electropolymerization of pyrrole in acetonitrile. The specific capacitance of the material was measured by galvanic charge-discharge cycles and the stability upon cycling investigated in various electrolytic media (acetonitrile, ionic liquid, acidic and neutral water)in comparison with non-functionalized graphene with or without polypyrrole. While acetonitrile reveals pure capacitive behavior for all materials investigated, acidic water is the medium where the capacitance values are the highest and surprisingly where nanocomposites with polypyrrole show a better capacitance retention upon cycling than graphene alone. A positive impact of graphene functionalization prior to electropolymerization was demonstrated in all electrolytic media (capacitance losses limited to less than 8% after 1500 cycles in all media but neutral water), highlighting the interest of interface control in this kind of nanocomposites.
