To enhance energy storage performance via modulation of crystal structure on the molecular level, two series of triethylamine (TEA)-dependent polyoxometalate (POM) based inorganic-organic hybrid compounds, [CuII(btx)2]2[SiW12O40] (SiW-1), [CuI(btx)]4[SiW12O40] (SiW-2), [CuI 4(btx)3][SiW12O40] ⋅ 2H2O (SiW-3), [{CuII 6(btx)7(H2O)12}H4⊂(W12O40)2] ⋅ 12H2O (W-1), [{CuII 7(btx)8(H2O)10}H2⊂(W12O40)2] ⋅ 2H2O (W-2) and [{CuII 10CuI 2(btx)11(H2O)16}H2⊂(W12O40)3] ⋅ 6H2O (W-3) (btx=1,4-bis(triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene) have been synthesized and explored as pseudocapacitor electrode materials. Compared to other compounds, SiW-2 shows a specific capacitance of 110.3 F g−1 at 3.0 A g−1 and only experiences a capacitance loss of 13 % after 1000 cycles at a current density of 18.0 A g−1. More importantly, the two series of compounds can be considered as a model for studying the effects of the molecular structures on the pseudocapacitor performance. The result verifies that besides the type of POM, the capacitance ability of the POM-based compounds is mainly dominated by the connecting modes of adjacent POM building blocks and the dimension of covalent networks formed by POM building blocks. Thus, this work may open a new avenue to optimize the performance of POM-based capacitors.
