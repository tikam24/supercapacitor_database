The increasing demand for high-performance supercapacitor has promoted the rapid development of separators and electrode materials. Recently, electrospun nanofibers have been widely used as separators and electrode materials of supercapacitor, which is due to the high porosity, high electrochemical activity, large specific surface area and good structural stability. In this survey, the recent research progress in separator membranes and electrode materials of supercapacitor is reviewed. The discussion focuses on obtaining electrode materials for supercapacitor by electrospinning and other post-processing methods, including carbon nanofibers, carbon-based composite nanofibers, conductive polymer-based composite and metal oxide nanofibers. These investigation demonstrate that pore structure construction, activation treatment, and heteroatom doping can improve the specific surface area, electrochemical activity, wettability, and graphitization degree of carbon nanofibers, furthermore the electrochemical properties of electrode materials are enhanced. Moreover, combining carbon nanofibers with metal oxides, conductive polymers via blending, chemical deposition, electrochemical deposition, etc., can also improve capacitance, rate performance, and cycling stabilities of electrode materials. In addition, the existing problems of the regarding studies are pointed out. Finally, the future developments of electrospun nanofiber materials in supercapacitor is prospected.
