Rational design of carbon aerogel with high specific surface area and controllable porosity is in great need for advanced energy storage systems. Herein, a hierarchical porous carbon aerogel has been successfully prepared through the polymerization of resorcinol and formaldehyde in the presence of K2CO3 and a subsequent one-step carbonization process. In this design, three functionalities of K2CO3 are involved, namely, as a catalyst effectively promoting the cross-linking of resorcinol and formaldehyde, as a shape-directing agent regulating the resulting carbon network, and as an in situ activator constructing the interconnected hierarchical porous skeleton within the carbonization process. Impressively, an ultrahigh specific surface area of 4568.9 m2 g−1 and a miraculous pore volume of 4.92 cm3 g−1 is achieved for the carbon aerogel with a mass ratio of K2CO3/resorcinol up to 3. Benefiting from its structural merits, the assembled coin-type supercapacitor with an as-obtained carbon aerogel electrode in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIMBF4) electrolyte delivers an excellent energy density of 78.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2.7 kW kg−1, as well as a favorable rate capability of 88 % after 8000 cycles. Such a design strategy opens up a new opportunity for further development of hierarchically porous carbon aerogels applied in the fields of adsorption, catalysis, and energy storage devices.
