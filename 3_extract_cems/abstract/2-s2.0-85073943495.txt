Two-dimensional (2D) SnS2/MoS2 heterojunction with a 2D/2D novel structure was used as electrode material for enhanced supercapacitor performance. Compared with the sole SnS2, the as-prepared 2D/2D SnS2/MoS2 layered heterojunction has exhibited great improvement in supercapacitor properties. This novel structure can effectively prevent agglomeration and stacking in electrochemical process, and 2D/2D structure is beneficial to intercalation and desorption of ions in electrochemical processes. The experiment result shows that MoSn5 (samples with 5% MoSn5 mole ratios) display a specific capacitance of 466.6 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g in 0.5 mol/L potassium hydroxide solution, an impressive cycling stability with 88.2% capacitance retention at current density of 4 A/g. In addition, the as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy density of 115 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 2230 Wh kg−1. This work provides a fundamental investigation of 2D/2D layered material synergistic effect on the electrochemical process.
