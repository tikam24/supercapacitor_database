The composites of polypyrrole/manganese dioxide/polypropylene fibrous films (PPy/MnO2/PPF) have been prepared in situ through chemical oxidation polymerization by using the mixture of FeCl3·6H2O and MnO2 adsorbed on PPF as oxidant in the atmosphere of pyrrole vapor at room temperature. The morphologies and structures of the composites are investigated by using scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy. The properties of the capacitor cells assembled by the composites of PPy/MnO2/PPF are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods. The results reveal that the morphologies, conductivities and capacitance performance of the composites are influenced strongly by the content of MnO2 in the solution of oxidant. The capacitors assembled by PPy/MnO2/PPF exhibit the property of quick charge/discharge, and the highest specific capacitance of about 110 F g-1 is obtained when the PPy/MnO2 content in the composite is about 17.4%. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
