An environmental crisis urges people to investigate alternative energy sources for the future. As research on energy conversion and storage increases, electrochemistry is recognized as a sustainable approach for developing renewable energy systems without any emissions. Electrochemical reactions such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), ammonia productions, battery systems, and supercapacitors strongly rely on catalysts for their efficiency. In this study, we aim to report the synthesis of nickel phosphide by applying different variables and establishing their correlations with electrochemical reaction outcomes. In contrast to the conventional techniques of analyzing results through material data, this study's essential part is to obtain higher performance for the HER and supercapacitor with fewer synthesis times through correlation analysis of variables and their outcomes. Accordingly, robust synthesis process design and optimization are expected to reduce cost and time in future research.
