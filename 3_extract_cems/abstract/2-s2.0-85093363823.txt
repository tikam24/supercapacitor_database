Herein, KH-550 was used as surface modifier to prepare modified MnO2/reduced graphene oxide (M-MnO2/rGO) composite electrode materials by utilizing electrostatic interaction at low temperature and normal pressure. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were adopted to characterize the material's phase, morphology, and valence state of elements. The electrochemical properties of the material were measured using a three-electrode system. The results indicate a decrease in the size of the modified MnO2 particles, and that they were uniformly distributed on the rGO sheets. The M-MnO2/rGO composite attained a specific capacitance of 326F·g-1 in a solution of 1mol·L-1 Na2SO4 at a current density of 0.5A·g-1. The specific capacitance of the material was 92.4% after 1000 cycles. The electrostatic self-assembly method effectively solved the problem of reducing the cycling stability while improving the specific capacitance of the composite materials, and further improved the possibility of applying MnO2/rGO in the field of supercapacitors.
