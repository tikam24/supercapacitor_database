In this paper, poly(aniline/pyrrole) (PANPY) copolymer was prepared in a mixed acid solution by electrosynthesis method. The molar ratio between the aniline and pyrrole monomer was found to great influence on the electrochemical perfprmance of PANPY copolymer. When molar concentration ratio of aniline and pyrrole to be 1: 1, the PANPY copolymer exhibited highest specific capacity of 227.88 F.g-1 at a current density of 4 mA.cm-2. This work indicates the potential application of PANPY copolymer as supercapacitor.
