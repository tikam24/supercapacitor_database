The modeling, the control and the simulation of a parallel hybrid architecture for an agricultural tractor propulsion system are performed in this paper. The systems involved in the considered architecture are: an Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), two Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs), a supercapacitor playing the role of the energy storage device, a clutch allowing to enable/disable the electrical power path, and finally the transmission system from the gearbox to the wheels of the vehicle. A control strategy aiming at minimizing the ICE specific fuel consumption is then proposed and tested by presenting some simulation results.
