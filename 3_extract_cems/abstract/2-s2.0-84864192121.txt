In recent years hybrid drive accommodates in public transportation and automobiles. Following article deals with hybrid drive technology and its impact on energy savings and performance optimization of shunting locomotives conventionally driven by diesel-generator set. Based on classic longitudinal train dynamics theory of train movement and with support of simulation results, a comparison of electrochemical accumulators and super-capacitors impact is introduced.
