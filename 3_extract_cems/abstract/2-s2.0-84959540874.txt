3D interconnected porous carbons (IPCs) as supercapacitor electrode materials were prepared from MOF-5 via microwave-assisted KOH activation. The results show that the BET surface area of as-made IPCs is tunable from 798 to 1595 m2 g-1. IPC3-M made at 3 of MOF-5/KOH mass ratio shows a high capacitance up to 212 F g-1 in 6 m KOH aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 0.05 A g-1. IPC electrodes also exhibit excellent rate capability (82.9% capacitance retention as the current density increases from 0.05 to 20 A g-1) and superior cycle stability (95.9% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles) due to short distance for ion fast transport, abundant accessible pores for ion storage and interconnected architecture for electron conduction.
