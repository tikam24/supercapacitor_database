The search for biocompatible and renewable materials for the next generation of energy devices has led to increasing interest in using biopolymers as a matrix component for the development of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). However, using biopolymers as host matrices presents limitations in performance and scalability. At the same time, ionic liquids (ILs) have shown exceptional properties as non-aqueous electrolytes. This review intends to highlight the progress in integrating ILs and biopolymers for EDLC. While ILs have been used as solvents to process biopolymers and electrolyte materials, biopolymers have been utilized to provide novel chemistries of electrolyte materials via one of the following scenarios: (1) acting as host polymeric matrices for IL-support, (2) performing as polymeric fillers, and (3) serving as backbone polymer substrates for synthetic polymer grafting. Each of these scenarios is discussed in detail and supported with several examples. The use of biopolymers as electrode materials is another topic covered in this review, where biopolymers are used as a source of carbon or as a flexible support for conductive materials. This review also highlights current challenges in materials development, including improvements in robustness and conductivity, and proper dispersion and compatibility of biopolymeric and synthetic polymeric matrices for proper interface bonding.
