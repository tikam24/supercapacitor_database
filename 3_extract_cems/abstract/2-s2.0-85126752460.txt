In the present study, mesoporous CoxOy/C nanoflakes were fabricated using facile one-pot short span hydrothermal approach to explore its potential in energy storage devices. The fabricated composite electrode delivers maximum specific capacity of 372 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with a meager charge transfer resistance (1.5 Ω). The excellent energy storage property is attributed to the presence of hierarchical arrangement of inter connected flaky structure that provides a fresh lanes for the mobilization of electrolyte ions. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by sandwiching battery-type Faradic electrode and carbonaceous electrode. The device shows excellent electrochemical capability and noble cycling stability (90.9 % capacitance retention) after 10000 cycles of charge/discharge. Such enduring prominent properties of the fabricated device will make a benchmark in real time applications.
