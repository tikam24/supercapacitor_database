Research on the hybrid power supply with the combination of battery and ultra capacitor is a hotspot in the field of electric vehicle research. Battery has high energy density, ultra capacitor with high power density. In order to reasonably control the output power of the two, so as to achieve more efficient operation of electric vehicles, we carried out a detailed analysis of the operation mode of the hybrid power supply system, and proposed a energy management strategy based on speed and logic threshold control. In the MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation environment, the hybrid power supply of electric vehicles and the proposed control strategy are simulated. The simulation results show that: the ultra capacitor current can accurately follow the reference current, and the proposed control strategy can reasonably distribute the output of the battery and the ultra capacitor to meet the energy output under different power requirements.
