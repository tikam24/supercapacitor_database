As ports play an undeniable role in people's lives, and according to energy consumption which is one of the most vital factors for port authorities, there should be some effective solution to deal with the amount of consumed energy and peak load demand. The use of energy storage with high power and energy densities and fast response time at ports with high power demand equipment such as different types of cranes ( STS, RTG, RMG) and electric trucks as well is one of the main factors for peak reduction and economic benefits. Peak shaving can balance the load demand and facilitate the participation of small power units in generation based on renewable energy resources. In this regard, many approaches are introduced such as energy management strategies, modern technologies, and installing high-tech devices such as Battery Energy Storage (BES), Ultracapacitor (UC), and Flywheel Energy Storage (FES) acting as Energy Storage System (ESS). Therefore, this paper deals with an investigation for an integrated vision and a combination of ESSs application in the ports' cranes. The statistical results show that the integration of ESSs can provide peak shaving, energy saving, cost reduction and also maximize self-consumption in the green ports.
