Conducting composite polymers consisting of Polypyrrole (PPy) and Polyaniline (Pani) were synthesized successfully using galvanostatic technique in the corresponding monomer solution. The properties of electrochemical super-capacitor assembled with conducting polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, charging-discharging cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The result has shown that the capacitor properties depend heavily on the deposit order: the composite polymers with PPy as the primer have better capacitive than that with Pani as the primer. The specific capacitance of stainless steel/PPy/Pani and stainless steel/PPy/Pani/PPy electrodes is far higher (up to 196.08 F/g and 212.53 F/g) than that of pure conducting polymers or other composite polymers.
