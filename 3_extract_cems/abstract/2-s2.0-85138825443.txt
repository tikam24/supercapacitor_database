Photovoltaic and hydrokinetic systems are increasing their penetration in electrical distribution systems. This leads to problems of power fluctuations due to the intermittence of renewable sources that could compromise the stability and quality of the power grid. To address this issue, this paper presents a feasibility study of three power smoothing methods for a photovoltaic-hydrokinetic system using laboratory equipment to optimally replicate the real behavior of this type of hybrid system. The proposed algorithms are based on a hybrid storage system with supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, several analyzes are presented based on technical and economic parameters. The results demonstrate the feasibility of power smoothing methods for real systems, the comparison between the algorithms highlights the characteristics of the Enhanced Linear Exponential Smoothing Method, reducing the energy cost and regulating the point of common coupling voltage. Moreover, the sensitivity studies show that the energy exchange with the utility grid is affected according to the variations in the capacity of the batteries and the response to power smoothing can decrease or improve depending on the size of the supercapacitors.
