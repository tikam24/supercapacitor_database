In this work, we report on a reverse micellization approach to prepare uncarbonized starch and poly(1,4-butylene succinate) hybrids with exceptional charge storage performance. Uncarbonized starch was activated through protonation, hybridized with poly (1,4-butylene succinate), configured into conductive reverse micelles, and incorporated with magnetite nanoparticles. Before magnetite incorporation, the maximum specific capacitance (Csp), energy density (Ed), power density (Pd) and retention capacity (%) of the reverse micelles were estimated to be 584 F g−1, 143 W h kg−1, 2356 W kg and 97.5%. After magnetite incorporation, we achieved a maximum supercapacitive performance of 631 F g−1, 204 W h kg−1, 4371 W kg−1and 98%. We demonstrate that the use of magnetite incorporated St-PBS reverse micelles minimizes the contact resistance between the two supercapacitor electrodes, resulting in high charge storage capacity.
