Carbon-based electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) generally exhibit high power and long life, but low energy density/capacitance. Pore/morphology optimization and pseudo-capacitive materials modification of carbon materials have been used to improve electrode capacitance, but leading to the consumption of tap density, conductivity and stability. Introducing soluble redox mediators into electrolyte is a promising alternative to improve the capacitance of electrode. However, it is difficult to find one redox mediator that can provide additional capacitance for both positive and negative electrodes simultaneously. Here, an ambipolar organic radical, 2, 2, 6, 6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl (TEMPO) is first introduced to the electrolyte, which can substantially contribute additional pseudo-capacitance by oxidation at the positive electrode and reduction at the negative electrode simultaneously. The EDLC with TEMPO mediator delivers an energy density as high as 51 Wh kgâˆ’1, 2.4 times of the capacitor without TEMPO, and a long cycle stability over 4000 cycles. The achieved results potentially point a new way to improve the energy density of EDLCs.
