In this work, perovskite-type NdFeO3 and NdCoO3 nanofibers (NFs) were synthesized, and the magnetic and electrochemical characteristics of the two samples were investigated. The NdFeO3 NFs showed ferromagnetic performance at 298 K and paramagnetic characteristics at low temperatures, whereas the NdCoO3 NFs showed paramagnetic behavior. The NdFeO3 and NdCoO3 electrodes exhibited favorable electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. Therefore, this study demonstrated the potential applications of NdFeO3 and NdCoO3 NFs in the field of condensed matter physics and energy storage devices.
