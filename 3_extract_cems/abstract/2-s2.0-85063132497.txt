A hollow graphitized carbon nanosphere/mixed-valence manganese oxide composite (HMO) was successfully synthesized via a SiO 2 template and impregnation-reduction method. The chemical valence and content of manganese species were controlled by the reaction time of impregnation-reduction process. The HMO composite obtained by impregnation-reduction for 6 h (HMO-6) shows a large specific capacitance (292.5 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ), excellent cycling stability (96.8% after 5000 cycles at 1 A g −1 ) and rate performance (155.3 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 ). The interior graphitized carbon shell, hollow porous structure, higher surface area, and appropriate percentage of Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ species are responsible for the superior electrochemical performance. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of HMO-6 and hollow graphitized carbon nanosphere (HCS) also shows a superior electrochemical performance in all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor. The design and synthesis strategy of electrode materials offers a promising approach to develop high-performance manganese oxide supercapacitors.
