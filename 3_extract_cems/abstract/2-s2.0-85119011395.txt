The unique structure and excellent performance of three-dimensional graphene make it widely applicable in various fields like electronics, catalytic electrodes and sensors. However, it remains a challenge to produce low-cost, large-size and shape-controllable three-dimensional graphene. It is thus proposed in this study to prepare three-dimensional graphene by carburizing and powder metallurgy with triethylene glycol as the carbon source and nickel nanoparticles as a template. The morphology and microstructure of three-dimensional graphene were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The three-dimensional graphene consisting of multilayer graphene nanosheets is obtained that demonstrated not only large specific surface area but also high mechanical strength, which is conducive to increasing the area of contact with electrolyte and providing a conductive path for the active materials loaded on it. As a result, the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor can be improved effectively.
