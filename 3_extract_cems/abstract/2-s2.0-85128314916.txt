It is absolutely essential to convert biomass waste into usable energy in a rational manner. This investigation proposes the economical synthesis of heteroatom (N and S)-doped carbon (ATC) from Aesculus turbinata seed as a natural precursor by carbonization at 800◦ C. The final product obtained was characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, high-resolution transmittance electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in order to investigate its structural property and chemical composition. The porous carbon achieved by this method contained oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur from Aesculus turbinata seed and had pores rich in micropores and mesopores. Crystalline ATC obtained with a high surface area (560 m2 g−1 ) and pore size (3.8 nm) were exploited as electrode material for the supercapacitor. The electrochemical studies revealed a specific capacitance of 142 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 using 1 M H2 SO4 as an electrolyte. ATC had exceptional cycling stability, and the capacitance retention was 95% even after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. The findings show that ATC derived from biomass proved to be a potential energy storage material by converting waste biomass into a high-value-added item, a supercapacitor.
