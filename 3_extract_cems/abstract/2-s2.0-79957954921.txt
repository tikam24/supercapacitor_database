Flexible electrodes for supercapacitors have been prepared by depositing polypyrrole (PPy) on to a gold-coated PVDF membrane. Specific capacitance values of the order of 380 F g-1 for PPy/Nafion and 420 F g-1 for PPy/p-toluenesulfonate were obtained. For the PPy/Nafion electrode, an energy density of 56 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 15.50 kW kg -1 were available after 5000 cycles. Using a self-contained fully flexible device comprising polypyrrole as both electrodes and a PVDF membrane as separator, a capacitance of 30 F g-1 was observed after 5000 cycles. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.
