Cobalt oxide is a very promising material for supercapacitor with high theoretical specific capacitance. However, its poor cyclability resulting from the faradaic pseudocapacitive characteristics restricts its application. In this study, we employ an efficient strategy by introducing in-situ reduced graphene oxide to establish a porous conductive network for electron and ion transporting. A series composites of cobalt oxide nanowires supported on reduced graphene oxide are successfully synthesized with the assistance of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide by a facile hydrothermal method. The as-prepared composites are investigated by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Nitrogen physisorption, Scanning electron microscopy and Transmission electron microscopy, as well as electrochemical analysis in a three-electrode system. Remarkably, the composite exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 531 F g−1 at a 0.1 A g−1 current density accompanying a 64% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1.
