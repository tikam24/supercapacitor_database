A supercapacitor based on charge storage at the interface between a high surface area carbon nanotube electrode and a Li-ClO4/PC electrolyte was assembled. The performance of the capacitor depends on not only the material used in the cell but also the construction of the cell. From a constant charge-discharge test, the capacitance of 60 F was obtained. The performance of the power capacitor for pulse power sources was described. The specific energy (0.8 W·kg-1) and the specific power (0.75 kW·kg-1) of the power supercapacitor were demonstrated with a cell of the maximum operating voltage of 2.5 V. A hybrid power source consisting of a lithium ionic battery and the 60 F supercapacitor was demonstrated to power successfully a simulated power load encountered in GSM portable communication equipment. The addition of the supercapacitor to the power train of a cellular phone results in significantly more energy from the battery being used by the load. The experiments indicate that more than 33.8% energy is utilized by load and less stored energy is dissipated within the battery for each charge-discharge cycle.
