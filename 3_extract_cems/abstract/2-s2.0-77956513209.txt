This paper deals with simulation and experimental verification of DC/DC converter with input active filter. Input filter design is presented and in analysis two different stabilization methods are studied. Offset method is based on stabilization of undesired current values on input choke and it is based on total change of converter switching (unplugging from the power network). Stabilization method with super-capacitor (additional energy buffer in DC link) is based on input power compensation. The super-capacitor is used as energy buffer for voltage and current drop compensation. For both methods the simulation results are compared with realized measurement. It is shown that method with super-capacitors offers advantages and higher efficiency. Â© 2010 IEEE.
