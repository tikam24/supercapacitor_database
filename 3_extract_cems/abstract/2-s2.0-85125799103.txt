Developing efficient energy storage system is crucial for storing energy sources especially renewable ones that are exponentially increased in the last decade. Among the different energy storage systems, supercapacitors (SCs) have shown significant attraction for the researchers due to their extraordinary characteristics such as fast charging-discharging, greater power density, and environment-friendliness. However, the energy density is less than expected. Developing efficient electrode materials can help in solving such problem. Metal chalcogenides demonstrated promising results in different applications including energy conversion/storage devices. Here we are discussing the progress done of transition metal chalcogenides (TMC) in SCs focusing on sulfides that exhibited promising results in terms of stability and energy density. The preparation methods, the progress of these TMC in SCs are thoroughly discussed.
