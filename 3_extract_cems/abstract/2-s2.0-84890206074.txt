This paper deals with the problem of power coordination on multi-source systems. Here, the objective is to regulate the provided voltage at the load bus by keeping the supercapacitor voltage around admissible values. In addition, operational constraints are also included, particularly, the power slew rate provided by the fuel cell, as well as by the supercapacitor. According to those objectives, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed for coordination of the different units. That control is intended for respecting the improved constraints and keeping the optimality of the interconnected system. In this paper, a system simulation, including a fuel cell, a supercapacitor an a wind turbine power system are considered. Here, a comparison of the MPC with respect to a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is performed in order to illustrate the behavior of the proposed approach. Â© 2013 IEEE.
