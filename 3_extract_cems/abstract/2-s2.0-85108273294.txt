In this work, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) macrostructure has been incorporated with graphene oxide nanosheet (GO) to form a hybrid composite as a modified surface for antifouling membrane and supercapacitor applications. The hybrid nanomaterial (HNM) has been synthesized successfully and characterized via various tools, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). A modified surface of Graphene oxide/ Cellulose (GO@CMC) has been studied by cyclic voltammetry technique for detecting the electrochemical properties, supercapacitor, and energy storage. Also, the optical properties of the modified antifouling surface of the HNM membrane were detected by UV-spectroscopy apparatus for water treatment applications. For proving the easily, the electron transfer of GO@CMC via the photocatalytic process for degradation of organic and inorganic pollutions, such as methylene blue (MB) dye. The cytotoxicity of fabricated HNM has been studied with two cell lines such as Breast Cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) and the other was Hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2), the following results have been obtained: - A good electron transfer has been detected with GO@CMC HNM. - Easily the photocatalytic process with organic compounds pollution. - GO@CMC HNM has effects observably on the cell lines of MDA-MB-231 and HepG2. - Results demonstrated that the fabricated HNM is promising electrode material for supercapacitors application and energy storage.
