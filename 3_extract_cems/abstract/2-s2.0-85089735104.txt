Supercapacitors based on three-dimensional porous kenaf stem-derived carbon (3D-KSC)/covalent-organic framework COF-LZU1 (COF-LZU-x series were synthesized and named by Lanzhou University, so it was named “LZU”)/polyaniline (PANI) array composites were fabricated. The spherical COF-LZU1 was formed by dehydration condensation reaction between 1,3,5-benzene tricarbaldehyde and 1,4-p-phenylenediamine and simultaneously bonded to the 3D-KSC surface, which improved the stability of composites. Then PANI array was grown on 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1 by chemical oxidation polymerization to form 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1/PANI composites. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), etc were used for characterizing 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1/PANI composites. SEM images showed that a lot of spherical COF-LZU1 with diameter of 1 µm was uniformly dispersed on the inner wall of the 3D-KSC, and PANI was arrayed on the 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1. FTIR and Raman spectroscopy proved that PANI arrays were successfully polymerized on 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1. Galvanostatic charge-discharge test of 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1/PANI composites showed a specific capacitance of 583.0 mF cm−2 at current density of 0.1 mA cm−2, and the specific capacitance was 81.5% of the original value after 2000 cycles. These results suggested the as-prepared 3D-KSC/COF-LZU1/PANI composites had excellent performance and the potential application in supercapacitors.
