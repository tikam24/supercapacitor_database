Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) with excellent flexibility and high electrochemical performance are essential for portable and miniaturized electronics. In this paper, a laser etching technology with advantages of simple process, low cost, and high machining accuracy is used to directly etch the free-standing MXene-molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) film for MSC. As adding MoS2 in MXene effectively improves the electrochemical performance, such as a higher specific capacitance (about 60% higher than pure MXene). Eventually, the maximum specific capacitance of this MSC (based on the total volume of positive and negative electrodes) is 173.6 F cm−3 (1 mV s−1), and the maximum energy density and maximum power density are 15.5 mWh cm−3 and 0.97 W cm−3, respectively. In addition, the MSC also shows the excellent cycle stability and flexibility, e.g., after 6000 charge–discharge cycles and bending up to 150°, the capacitances of the MSC still retain about 98% and 89% of its initial capacitance, respectively. The laser-etched MSC based on MXene-MoS2 offers a new idea for future high-performance micro energy storage devices.
