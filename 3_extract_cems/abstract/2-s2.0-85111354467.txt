The purpose of the work is the formation of the scientifically based methodology for calculating the parameters and choosing the electric energy storage device criteria for the designed hybrid drive with the electromechanical transmission for promising military wheeled vehicles. It will be performed the analysis of the main characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors, which are used in vehicles, their advantages and disadvantages, as well as limitations and features of the application; the calculations of the required values of the electric power for the movement of the machine in various road conditions; calculations of the electric energy storage device capacity to ensure the power reserve during the autonomous driving with electric traction in various movement conditions; calculations of the maximum electric energy of the batteries and supercapacitors charge for the recuperation of the machine kinetic energy during emergency braking of the armored personnel carrier. Criteria are determined for choosing parameters of the electric energy storage device for the hybrid drive with the electromechanical transmission for military wheeled vehicles. All calculations are made on the example of the Ukrainian wheeled armored personnel carrier BTR-4.
