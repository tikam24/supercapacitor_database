Convex optimization was proposed in order to minimize energy consumption and battery power variation for a semi-active hybrid energy storage system of an electric city bus. Rule-based optimization method and proposed power allocation strategy were compared based on an electric city bus running the Harbin city driving cycle in respect of analysis of energy efficiency and battery power variation. The simulation results show with convex optimization power allocation strategy, battery energy efficiency, super capacitor comprehensive energy efficiency and the battery power mean square error were 98.81%, 93.46% and 5.315 3 kW. Compared with rule-based power allocation strategy, comprehensive energy efficiency of batteries and super capacitors of convex optimization results were increased by 0.74% and 0.26% respectively and its battery power variance was decreased by 46.91%. The operating characteristics of electric vehicles was improved by the proposed power optimization method.
