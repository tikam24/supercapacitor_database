In order to fulfill the future crisis in the technology field modern research has been diverted towards the development of various electrochemical devices. Such devices are highly dependent on the morphology and selection of suitable electrode materials. In these circumstances, the transition metal oxides and sulfides have been extensively investigated over the years. Recently, transition metal selenides (TMSes) demonstrated promising as well as tunable properties for a variety of electrochemical applications. Basically, the chemistry of selenides and sulfides are quite analogous, which motivates the researchers to explore such materials for different applications. This review article aims to provide the most recent progress on exploring TMSes for supercapacitors (SCs) and other related electrochemical applications like lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and water splitting. The prime aim of this review is to recapitulate the recent progress, open up new opportunities, and provide future research direction on TMSes for possible next generation electrochemical as well as other devices.
