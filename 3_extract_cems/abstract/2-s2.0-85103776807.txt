Choice of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in transportation systems is becoming more prominent for optimized energy consumption. HEVs are attaining tremendous appreciation due to their eco-friendly performance and assistance in smart grid notion. The variation of energy storage systems in HEV (such as batteries, supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, fuel cells, and so on) with numerous control strategies create variation in HEV types. Therefore, choosing an appropriate control strategy for HEV applications becomes complicated. This paper reflects a comprehensive review of the imperative information of energy storage systems related to HEVs and procurable optimization topologies based on various control strategies and vehicle technologies. The research work classifies different control strategies considering four configurations: fuel cell-battery, battery-ultracapacitor, fuel cell-ultracapacitor, and battery-fuel cell- ultracapacitor. Relative analysis among different control techniques is carried out based on the control aspects and operating conditions to illustrate these techniques' pros and cons. A parametric comparison and a cross-comparison are provided for different hybrid configurations to present a comparative study based on dynamic performance, battery lifetime, energy efficiency, fuel consumption, emission, robustness, and so on. The study also analyzes the experimental platform, the amelioration of driving cycles, mathematical models of each control technique to demonstrate the reliability in practical applications. The presented recapitulation is believed to be a reliable base for the researchers, policymakers, and influencers who continuously develop HEVs with energy-efficient control strategies.
