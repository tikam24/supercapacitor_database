Vertically oriented graphenes (VGs) are promising for many emerging energy and environmental applications, while their mass production still remains a critical challenge. This note reports a multi-linear antenna microwave plasma device for fabricating VGs on a large-scale. Eight coaxial linear plasma antennas are parallelly arrayed to produce large-area plasma, depositing 6 Ã— 6 in.2 VGs on nickel foil at a high rate of 160 nm min-1. In supercapacitor applications, the potential of VGs for AC line filtering (an RC time of 0.43 ms) and decreasing the interfacial contact resistance within commercial activated carbon supercapacitors is demonstrated.
