A green approach was employed for the synthesis Graphene-NiCo2O4 nanocomposite and its electrochemical property has been studied. The formation of phase and morphology was studied by diffraction and microscopic analysis. The prepared material was studied as an electrode material for supercapacitor application in a 2 M KOH electrolyte. In order to examine the electrochemical behavior of the prepared material cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in a 3-electrode system. Electrochemical studies revealed a high specific capacitance of 242 F g-1 and 165 F g-1 were obtained at a high scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and at an applied current density of 0.5 A g-1, respectively. A high initial capacitance retention value and coulombic efficiency of about 96% and 98% was retained after a long 1000 discharge cycles. Hence, the prepared material can be a potential candidate for high performance supercapacitor applications.
