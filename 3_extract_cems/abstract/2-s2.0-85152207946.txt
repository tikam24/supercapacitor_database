The application of nontoxic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently gained ground in batteries, hybrid supercapacitors, and water splitting. Here, we prepared an unprecedented manganese-based MOF (trimesic acid used as a linker) via a hydrothermal approach to scrutinize its electrochemical properties. A three-electrode setup was developed in which the Mn-MOF exhibited a remarkable specific capacity with satisfactory capacity retention. Furthermore, a hybrid device was fabricated in such a way that the Mn-MOF and activated carbon were functionalized as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The constructed Mn-MOF//AC device achieved exceptional specific capacity, energy, and power of 248.3 C/g, 60 Wh/kg, and 2550 W/kg, respectively. After 1000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, the hybrid device resulted in an outstanding cycling stability of 98.57% and a Coulombic efficiency of 96.97%. The nature of the device was validated through power law and Dunnâ€™s model. Due to its electrochemical properties, Mn-MOF//AC is a promising choice for battery-supercapacitor devices in portable electronics.
