The purpose of this paper is to present a new solution to produce DC energy from electromagnetic radiation generated by compact fluorescent lamps and stored in the super capacitor bank. The proposed device is based on a magnetic coupling between flat wound induction coil and pollution generator represented in the compact florescent lamp. Most of the energy will be stored in the super capacitor and then in battery through DC/DC Up convertor. It is shown that more than 0.91W can be generated from a 20W compact fluorescent lamp. So the proposed electronic device can absorb pollution at home, protect our children from radiation, and recycle EM radiation for charging battery. Besides, we can use it for many other applications.
