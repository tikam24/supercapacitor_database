The proceedings contain 25 papers. The topics discussed include: in-situ preparation of metal oxide thin films by inkjet printing acetates solutions; growth and physical properties of vanadium oxide thin films with controllable phases; fabrication of flexible and conductive graphene-silver films by polymer dispersion and coating method; solution processed TiO2 nanotubular core with polypyrrole conducting polymer shell structures for supercapacitor energy storage devices; dual function polyvinyl alcohol based oxide precursors for nanoimprinting and electron beam lithography; melting gel films for low temperature seals; low temperature syntheses of transition metal bronzes with an open structure for high rate energy storage; field dependent electrical conduction in metal-insulator-metal devices using alumina-silicone nanolaminate dielectrics; and growth of silicon nanowires-based heterostructures and their plasmonic modeling.
