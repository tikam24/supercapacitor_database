Hybrid lithium-ion capacitors (HyLICs) have received considerable attention because of their ability to combine the advantages of high-energy lithium-ion batteries and high-power supercapacitors. State of charge (SOC) is the main factor affecting the practical application of HyLICs; therefore, it is essential to estimate the SOC accurately. In this paper, a partition SOC-estimation method that combines electrochemical and external characteristics is proposed. The discharge process of the HyLICs was divided into three phases based on test results of electrochemical characteristics. To improve the estimation accuracy and reduce the amount of calculation, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method was applied for SOC estimation at the interval where the capacitor energy storage characteristics dominated, and the Ampere-hour (Ah) method was used to estimate the SOC at the interval where battery energy storage characteristics dominated. The proposed method is verified under different operating conditions. The experimental results show good agreement with the estimation results, which indicates that the proposed method can estimate the SOC of the HyLICs accurately.
