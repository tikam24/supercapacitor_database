The proceedings contain 37 papers. The topics discussed include: acquisition of signals in a wind tunnel using the Dasylab software package; adaptive numerics for linear ODE systems with time-dependent data, with an application in photovoltaics; algorithm of tunning heating source thermophysical parameters in smart home; application of correlation analysis for impact assessment of air quality on the possibility of using chosen source of renewable energy; application of fractional order transfer functions in approximation of voltage divider with supercapacitor model; application of information technology engineering tools to simulate an operation of a flow machine rotor; Arduino based ambient air pollution sensing system; and assisted living system architecture based on bluetooth low energy and wearable sensors.
