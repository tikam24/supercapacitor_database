To improve the electrochemical performance and life cycle of supercapacitor electrode materials, hierarchical nanostructures are being developed. In this study, rationally designed hierarchical-structured flower-like NiMn-LDH@MnCo2S4 was grown on nickel foam via a hydrothermal synthesis scheme. The hierarchical structure showed an improved electrochemical activity. The as-prepared NiMn-LDH@MnCo2S4 Faradaic electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 341.1 mAh g-1 (1228 C g-1) at a current density of 2 A g-1 compared to the pristine MnCo precursor and MnCo2S4 37.5 mAh g-1 which showed a specific capacity of 135.2 C g-1 and 150.6 mAh g-1 (542.2 C g-1), respectively, at 2 A g-1. The as-prepared hybrid electrode exhibited an exceptional cyclic stability of 95%.
