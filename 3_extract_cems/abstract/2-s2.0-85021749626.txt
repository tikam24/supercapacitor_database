Manganese oxide is an important emerging electrode material for use in supercapacitor applications. Herein, we propose a new aqueous electrolyte, Al2(SO4)3, for use with this type of supercapacitor. We hypothesize that the trivalent aluminum ion will demonstrate higher specific capacities because of its higher charge. We show that β-MnO2, which usually demonstrates low specific capacity (∼10 F g−1), is highly active in this electrolyte. At a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, a specific capacity of 185 F g−1 is demonstrated. An asymmetric cell is constructed from a positive β-MnO2 electrode and an activated carbon (AC) negative electrode. The cell exhibits an initial specific capacity of 42 F g−1 (calculated for the total AC and MnO2 mass), and a steady coulombic efficiency (97–98%), operating for 2500 cycles, after which a 20% drop from its initial capacity is measured. The cell displays higher values of specific capacitance when compared to a sodium sulfate electrolyte.
