The drive for Ocean pollution prevention requires a significant increase in the extent and type of monitoring of subsea hydrocarbon production equipment. Sensors, instrumentation, control electronics, data logging and transmission units comprising such monitoring systems will all require to be powered. Conventionally electrical powering is supplied by standard subsea electrical cabling. The ability to visualise the assets being monitored and any changes or faults in the equipment is advantageous to an overall monitoring system. However the effective use of video cameras, particularly if the transmission of real time high resolution video is desired, requires a high data rate and low loss communication capability. This can be challenging for heavy and costly electrical cables over extended distances. For this reason optical fibre is often adopted as the communication channel. Using optical fibre cables for both communications and power delivery can also reduce the cost of cabling. In this paper we report a prototype optically remote powered subsea video monitoring system that provides an alternative approach to powering subsea video cameras. The source power is transmitted to the subsea module through optical fibre with an optical-to-electrical converter located in the module. To facilitate intelligent power management in the subsea module, a supercapacitor based intermediate energy storage is installed. Feasibility of the system will be demonstrated. This will include energy charging and camera operation times. Â© 2012 SPIE.
