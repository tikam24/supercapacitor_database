In present supercapacitors' research atomic layer deposition (ALD) has proven to be a better technique of choice since the controlled deposition and better conformal surface coating minimize the ion diffusion and charge transport path which result in a supercapacitor with optimized energy and power density, good cyclic stability, and rate capability. This progress report summarizes the recent advances in ALD toward fabrication and surface modification of advanced hybrid nanocomposite electrodes for supercapacitors using some selected examples. A particular emphasis is given to the key role of ALD parameters in influencing the electrochemical performance of hybrid nanocomposite. In addition, the authors point out the current challenges and the strategies for future fine utilization of this technique to achieve desired energy density and overall performance. The authors anticipate this report to provide some insights and motivations to design high performance next generation supercapacitors by manipulating the parameters of ALD when using various active materials.
