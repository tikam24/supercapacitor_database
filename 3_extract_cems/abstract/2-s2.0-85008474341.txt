Present work deals with a two-step synthesis and electrochemical properties of nickel oxide @copper oxide@copper (NiO@CuO@Cu) bilayered electrode. In the first step, anodization (40 V for 25 min) of Cu foil has been carried out for forming Cu-hydroxide@Cu which when annealed at 300 °C for 1 h produces CuO@Cu. In the second step, Ni-hydroxide is deposited onto CuO@Cu by applying current density of 0.03 A/cm2 for 3 min which when re-annealed at 300 °C for 1 h gives out NiO@CuO@Cu bilayered electrode. Obtained NiO@CuO@Cu bilayered electrode demonstrates separate CuO and NiO phases. The electrochemical properties have obtained using cyclic voltammetry, galvonostatic charge-discharge, and Nyquist plot measurements that reveal an importance of NiO@CuO@Cu as a potential electrode material in the electrochemical supercapacitor application with 58.14, 51.25, and 4.73 F g−1 values in 0.5 M, NaOH, KOH, and Na2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, measured at 2 mVs−1 scan rate.
