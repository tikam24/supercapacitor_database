In this work, we demonstrate a simple and effective activation-free carbonization method to prepare porous carbon from lotus seedpod shell―a kind of natural biomass. It reveals that the carbonization temperature plays a crucial role in the determination of surface areas and capacitive performances of as-obtained porous carbon samples. The pore size and specific surface area of the samples were measured to be in the ranges of 2.0–2.2 nm and 261.7–563.4 m2 g−1, respectively. The carbon sample obtained at a carbonization temperature of 600 °C (carbon-600) exhibits the maximum Barrett–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 563.4 m2 g−1 and the highest specific capacitance of 165 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. More importantly, the carbon-600 sample reveals unexceptionable capacitance retention of 95.3 % after 10,000 charge–discharge cycles, clearly indicating its excellent cycling stability. This work gives a simple and efficient approach for producing cost-effective porous carbons with high performance for supercapacitors.
