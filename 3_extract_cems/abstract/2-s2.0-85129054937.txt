A ternary composite film comprising poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) integrated with cobalt oxide (Co3O4) was fabricated through facile electrodeposition. The formation of the ternary hybrid was confirmed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) revealed a formation of a three-dimensional porous network after the integration of Co3O4 that allowed a very high degree of utilization of active sites. The specific capacitance of ternary composite was 200.7 F/g which was greater than PEDOT (42.0 F/g and PEDOT/NCC (101.1 F/g). The ternary composite also showed excellent specific capacitance retention of 84.3% after 2000 cycles. The lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) of the ternary composite compared to PEDOT/NCC and PEDOT demonstrated its good conductivity as well as its relatively low charge transfer resistance (Rct), implying its potential candidacy as electrode material for supercapacitors.
