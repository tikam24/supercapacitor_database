A gel electrolyte of sodium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (NaTFSI)-polyethylene oxide (PEO) in an organic solvent mixture has been prepared and examined for supercapacitor applications by using activated carbon electrodes. The solvent was a mixture of propylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and ethylene carbonate at equal molar ratio, and also, a propylene carbonate-based gel was used for a comparison. The polymer-salt interaction was viewed by infrared spectral study. The cells have been characterized in a two-electrode type using linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling, and impedance techniques at 22 °C. The voltammograms evidence symmetry and reversibility of the cells. The ternary gel has shown better electrochemical performances. Moreover, the cell operative potential window was found to be stable at 2.5 V with high specific capacitance and also a good efficiency at low charge rate. The typical obtained specific capacitance, real power, and energy density values are 24 F g-1, 0.52 kW kg -1, and 18.7 Wh kg-1, respectively, which may be viewable for a compact capacitor. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
