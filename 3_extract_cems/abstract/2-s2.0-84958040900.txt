Three-dimensional, vertically aligned MnO/nitrogen-doped graphene (3D MnO/N-Gr) walls were prepared through facile solution-phase synthesis followed by thermal treatment. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was strategically added to generate cross-links to simultaneously form 3D wall structures and to incorporate nitrogen atoms into the graphene network. The unique wall features of the as-prepared 3D MnO/N-Gr hybirdes provide a large surface area (91.516 m2 g-1) and allow for rapid diffusion of the ion electrolyte, resulting in a high specific capacitance of 378 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and an excellent charge/discharge stability (93.7 % capacity retention after 8000 cycles) in aqueous 1 m Na2SO4 solution as electrolyte. Moreover, the symmetric supercapacitors that were rationally designed by using 3D MnO/N-Gr hybrids exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance in an organic electrolyte with an energy density of 90.6 Wh kg-1 and a power density of 437.5 W kg-1. Doping effects: Three-dimensional, vertically aligned MnO/nitrogen-doped graphene (3D MnO/N-Gr) walls were prepared through facile solution-phase synthesis followed by thermal treatment. The 3D wall architecture with effective nitrogen doping showed an outstanding electrochemical performance in both aqueous and organic electrolytes (see figure).
