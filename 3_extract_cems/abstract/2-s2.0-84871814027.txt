Boron- and nitrogen-containing porous carbon nanofibers (BN-CNFs) were prepared through one-step electrospinning using boric acid (H3BO 3) and urea as boron and nitrogen precursors and a subsequent thermal treatment. The BN-CNFs showed higher capacitance and energy/power density values than the control sample of CNFs in aqueous electrolyte; the large surface area of 559 m2 g-1 and the NH, COOH, and [O]BN functional groups facilitated these improvements. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor was 180 F g-1 at 1 mA cm-2, and the energy density was 17.2-23.5 W h kg-1 in the power density range of 400-10,000 W kg-1 in an aqueous electrolyte.
