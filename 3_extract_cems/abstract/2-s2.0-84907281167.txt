Hollow electrode materials are of great charm due to their large surface area, low density, and superior structure permeability. The paper reported a new method for synthesis of α-Ni(OH)2hollow microspheres not using any soft- or hard template. The α-Ni(OH)2was prepared in the mixed solvent of tert-butanol (TBA) and water (H2O) by one-step hydrothermal synthesis. The structure of α-Ni(OH)2depends on the ratio of TBA/H2O. When the volume ratio of TBA/H2O is about 9:1, the α-Ni(OH)2exhibits hollow microsphere with flower-like morphology. The unique structure will greatly improve the faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer. The α-Ni(OH)2electrode displays excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Its specific capacitance is up to 2480.7 F g-1at 1 A g-1. The capacitance can remain 91.6% at 10 A g-1after 1500 cycles. The study also provides a promising approach for building on hollow nanomaterials for supercapacitor, Li-ion battery and other energy storage devices.
