Proton polymer or a double-layer supercapacitor technology is being effectively utilized in high-voltage applications due to high conductivity associated with the proton-conducting polymer separators and nanoparticle carbon powders used in these capacitors. These capacitors use environmentally friendly, solvent-free aqueous materials with multiple cells, with each cell consisting of two carbon electrodes separated by the proton-conducting solid polymer separator. Depending on rating, the proton-polymer parts have ESRs of 40 to 200 mÏ‰, making them suitable for deployment in wide range of pulse applications. Proton-pulse supercapacitors offer various battery support such as standard non-rechargeable alkalines, which can be useful for commodity electronics operated away from any recharge facility.
