To meet the pressing demands for portable and flexible equipment in contemporary society, it is strongly required to develop next-generation inexpensive, flexible, lightweight, and sustainable supercapacitor systems with large power densities, long cycle life, and good operational safety. Here, we fabricate a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor device with nitrogen-doped pyrolyzed bacterial cellulose (p-BC-N) as the electrode material via a low-cost, eco-friendly, low-temperature, and scalable fabrication hydrothermal synthesis. The pliable device can reversibly deliver a maximum power density of 390.53 kW kg-1 and exhibits a good cycling durability with ∼95.9% specific capacitance retained after 5000 cycles. Therefore, this nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber electrode material holds significant promise as a flexible, efficient electrode material. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
