Depletion of hydrocarbons and increasing environmental pollution is pushing the researchers to work on finding some alternatives. Going for pure or hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) seems a good option as it offers limitless energy option, which is environmentally friendly as well. In this paper, the contribution fuel cell is used as a primary/main source and an ultra-capacitor has been used as an auxiliary one, both connected to a dc bus through the dc-dc buck boost converter. This system harnesses energy from the sources as per the vehicle's demand. The supply of energy from both the sources has been controlled by the switches, for which integral backstepping-based nonlinear controller has been proposed. The Lyapunov theory-based analysis has been incorporated, which gives asymptotic stability of the entire system to track the reference signals. The comparison of the same HEV system of the proposed nonlinear technique has also been included in this paper using MATLAB/Simulink.
