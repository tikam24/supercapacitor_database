The ruthenium oxide has been formed by a sol-gel process. The active electrode materials was obtained by mixing aqueous solution of RuCl3·xH2O and NaHCO3. The crystalline structure and the electrochemical properties of the powder have been studied as a function of the annealing temperature. At lower annealing temperatures, the powder is in an amorphous phase with a lower active surface area and poor electrochemical capacitance. The fine hydrous ruthenium oxide powder with satisfactory electrochemical characteristic was obtained by annealing the powder at 210°C. The active surface area of the material is improved and the capacitance is calculated to be 540 F·g-1. The composite with the carbon nanotubes as support was prepared. The capacitance of composite with 20wt% CNTs is calculated to be 860 F·g-1. It is also found that the addition of carbon nanotubes in ruthenium oxide could improve the power characteristics of supercapacitors.
