Electrochemical energy technologies such as fuel cells, supercapacitors, and batteries are some of the most suitable energy storage and conversion devices to meet our needs proving the future generation's equitable opportunity to meet their own needs. For this purpose, an earth-abundant precursor such as biomass is the best candidate for the synthesis of the next generation of low-cost and green electrode materials. This review summarizes the most recent progress in biomass-derived carbons for use in fuel cells, supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, the physical-chemical properties, desired features, performances, and limitations for electrochemical energy technologies. Several thermochemical treatments such as chemical activation, template methods, doping and hydrothermal treatments have been reviewed. Finally, we provide the reader with comprehensive information of the challenges, future research efforts, advantages, limitations and opportunities which will be a fundamental insight for the future design of biomass-derived carbon electrode materials for electrochemical storage and conversion systems.
