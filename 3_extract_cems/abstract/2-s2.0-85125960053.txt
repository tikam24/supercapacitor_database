Based on the precursor of CoNi-MOF-74, ternary Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2/Mg(OH)2 with the rod-like structure was designed and synthesized via the seed method and the solvothermal method. By adjusting the amount of load, it can be found that when the mass ratio of load and template is 1:1, NCM-2 (Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2/Mg(OH)2-2) is successfully prepared and exhibits the best electrochemical characteristic. The 666.8 C g−1 specific capacity at 1 A g−1 and the 92.68% cyclic stability after 5000 cycles prove the superiority of NCM-2. In addition, when we used NCM-2 as the positive and AC (activated carbon) as the negative to make a supercapacitor, the specific capacity was 214 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and the energy density was 55.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 930.2 Wh kg−1. At the same time, it is wonderful to see that two charged NCM-2//AC hybrid supercapacitor can manage to turn on four different colours of LEDs, showing an excellent practical application value.
