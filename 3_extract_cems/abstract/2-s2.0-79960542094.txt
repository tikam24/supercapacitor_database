Development of miniaturized electronic systems has stimulated the demand for miniaturized power sources that can be integrated into such systems. Among the different micro power sources micro electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices are particularly attractive because of their high efficiency and relatively high energy density. Electrochemical micro-capacitors or micro-supercapacitors offer higher power density compared to micro-batteries and micro-fuel cells. In this paper, development of on-chip micro-supercapacitors based on interdigitated C-MEMS electrode microarrays is introduced. C-MEMS electrodes are employed both as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) or as three dimensional (3D) current collectors of EDLC or pseudo-capacitive materials. Recent advancements in fabrication methods of C-MEMS based micro-supercapacitors are discussed and electrochemical properties of C-MEMS electrodes and it composites are reviewed. Â© 2011 SPIE.
