As ordered porous materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous attention in the field of energy conversion and storage due to their high specific surface area, permanent porosity, and tunable pore sizes. Here, MOF-derived MnO/C nanocomposites with regular octahedral shape were synthesized using a Mn-based analogue of the MIL-100 framework (Mn-MIL-100, MIL: Matérial Institut Lavoisier) as the precursor. Using aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM), MnO nanocages with a diameter of approximately 20 nm were recognized in the MnO/C nanocomposites fabricated, dispersed in a microporous carbon matrix homogeneously. The nanocages are composed of MnO nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 2 nm and with a single crystal structure. The specific surface area of the as-prepared MnO/C octahedra decreases to 256 m2 g−1 from 507 m2 g−1 of the Mn-MIL-100 precursor, whereas the total pore volume increases to 0.245 cm3 g−1, which is approximately 29% higher than that of the precursor (0.190 cm3 g−1). Additionally, when utilized as an electrode for supercapacitors, the MOF-derived MnO/C nanocomposite demonstrates a towering specific capacitance of 421 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and good cycle stability (94%) after 5000 cycles. Our work reveals that the MnO nanoparticles in MOF-derived MnO/C nanocomposites exhibit nanocage structure characteristics, which might be inherited from the Mn-MIL-100 precursor with analogous supertetrahedron units.
