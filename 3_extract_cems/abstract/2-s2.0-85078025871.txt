In the present study, mesoporous Mn doped TiO2 (Mn-TiO2) was synthesised by a simple sol–gel followed by solvothermal method. Brownish white powder is further characterised to confirm the synthesis of 40–50 nm sized high surface area mesoporous Mn-TiO2 nanoparticle. The electrochemical study by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed nearly 2-fold enhancement of capacitance and the carrier density compared to the pure TiO2 nanoparticle. This enhanced electrochemical property could be mainly ascribed to larger surface area, mesoporous structure and appropriate concentration of Mn doping that altered the optoelectronic properties of wide band gap TiO2.
