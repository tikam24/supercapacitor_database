We report a successful demonstration of a Swiss roll, fiber-shaped, asymmetric supercapacitor (FSASC) fabricated with MnO2 as a positive electrode and Fe2O3 as a negative electrode, both on carbon fibers as the current collector, with a high operating voltage of 2.0 V. The suggested Swiss roll FSASC device exhibited a high gravimetric energy density of 33.1 Wh kg−1 and a volumetric energy density of 0.16 mWh cm−3, with excellent rate capability, cycling stability, and coulombic efficiency. Additionally, the Swiss roll FSASC showed great durability and flexibility under mechanical stress. The promising performance of the Swiss roll FSASC suggests its potential for applications in wearable and flexible energy storage devices.
