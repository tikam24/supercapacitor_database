Formation of three-dimensional cobalt sulfide hierarchitectures through a mechanism similar to Ostwald ripening has been investigated. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the CoS1.097 nanostructure exhibits superior supercapacitor performances with high specific capacitances (555 F g -1 at 5 mA cm-2 and 464 F g-1 at 100 mA cm -2) and excellent cycle life in 2 M KOH solution.
