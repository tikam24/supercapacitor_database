Utilisation of wind energy is related closely with power intermittency issues. For instance, in East Nusa Tenggara, there is a demand-generation mismatch as the load demand is high in the evening and low at noon whereas the wind speed tends to reach its peak at noon. A hybrid storage system is proposed to handle the mismatch by either supplying the needed power or absorbing the power surplus. The wind energy extraction in the East Nusa Tenggara will be simulated in MATLAB Simulink to show how the hybrid storage system acts. The system will include both a supercapacitor and a battery. It is evident through the simulation that the system is able to reduce the charge/discharge stress on the battery, hence, increasing its lifetime.
