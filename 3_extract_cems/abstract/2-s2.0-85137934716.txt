The characteristics of intermittent photovoltaic sources (PV) and load demand that change over time can affect reliability and power quality. Power fluctuations due to changes in PV generation and load demand can be smoothed out by an energy management system (EMS) with a hybrid energy storage system (HESS). This paper reviews the HESS control strategy with optimization of compensator factor (CF) based on dynamic programming (DP) to improve the controller's response and shallow the DOD battery. CF is the ratio of battery voltage to SC voltage. The optimization objective is to obtain the optimum CF value based on the actual voltage of each ES with a dynamic programming algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed with optimization can increase the controller's responsiveness by 24,41% and reduce the DOD of the battery.
