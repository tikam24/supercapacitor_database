In this paper, the wind power fluctuation is divided into three categories. For the purpose of balancing all kinds of wind power fluctuation to enhance the penetration levels of wind power, we propose an active-parallel hybrid energy storage system (APHESS). The APHESS is composed of a battery, a supercapacitor, and two charge-discharge controllers. By combining the battery with the supercapacitor, the APHESS obtains the enhanced energy storage performance. Therefore, the investment cost can be reduced. By the reasonable design on the operation mode of APHESS, the APHESS can interchange power precisely with the wind power system. Furthermore, the battery and supercapacitor can suppress separately different kinds of wind power fluctuation to make their own energy storage properties fully utilized. The APHESS can be widely used in wind farm for the real-time regulation on wind power. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
