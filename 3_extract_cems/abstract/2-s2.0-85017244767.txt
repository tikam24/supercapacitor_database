Every day excessive withdrawals of groundwater cause salty water infiltrates in wells and make most of the groundwater sources unusable for freshwater purposes. To address this problem graphene-based supercapacitor electrodes were integrated for efficient removal of ions from water using capacitive deionization (CDI) technology to achieve an energy efficient and cost-effective water treatment process. The porous nature of the fabricated electrodes allows the easy accessibility of the electrolyte ions to inner pores. BET and pore size distribution analysis exhibited the existence of some mesopores providing a huge space for ion deposition in the CDI process. The graphene comprised a large fraction of mesopores (2-50 nm) that is the optimum pore size for electrosorption in the CDI process. The ion sorption behavior of the electrode was analyzed at different electrical potentials and flow rates. At 20 mL/min flow rate and 2.0 V potential the electrosorptive capacity of commercially available graphene electrodes could reach 12.5 Î¼mol/g.
