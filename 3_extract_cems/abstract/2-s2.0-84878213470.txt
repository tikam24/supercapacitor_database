In this paper, we propose a novel framework for energy and workload management in multi-core embedded systems with solar energy harvesting and a periodic hard real-time task set as the workload. Compared to prior work, our energy management framework possesses several advantages, including (i) a battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage module for more efficient system energy management, (ii) a semi-dynamic scheduling heuristic that continuously adapts to run-time harvested power variations without losing the consistency of the periodic task set, and (iii) a coarse-grained core shutdown heuristic for additional energy savings. Experimental studies show that our framework results in a reduction in task miss rate by up to 61% and task miss penalty by up to 65% compared to the best known prior work. Â© 2013 ACM.
