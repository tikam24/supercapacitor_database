We have prepared the CoMoO4 nanorods (NR) electrode with a specific capacitance (89.5 F g−1) at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has been fabricated by using CoMoO4 NR as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. At a power density of 80 mW cm−3, the ASC can deliver an energy density of 0.226 mW h cm−3 in the voltage range of 0–1.6 V. In addition, the CoMoO4 NR-based ASC device still remains a high energy density (84.07%) after 5000 cycles, demonstrating that one-dimensional nanostructures could be promising to achieve the high-energy-density materials.
