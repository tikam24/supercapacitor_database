In this endeavor, the interconnected CuO nanosheets were prepared using the cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-assisted sonochemical synthetic route followed by a proper calcination process. The X-ray diffraction analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis were utilized to examine the phase and internal bonding properties of the freshly prepared CuO materials. The morphological properties were analyzed through a high-resolution scanning electron microscope which confirms the formation of interconnected CuO nanosheets. Due to the unique nanosheet structure, the CuO nanosheets provide the maximum specific capacitance of 667 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1. The galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements render the specific capacitance of 638 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 and provide 31.8 W h Kg−1 and 94 22 W Kg−1 energy and power densities, respectively. The cyclic stability studies exhibit remarkable stability such as 81% of initial capacitance withstand after 3000 cyclic voltammetric cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1. All these outcomes demonstrated that the interconnected CuO nanosheets are auspicious for probable application in supercapacitors and other fields of application.
