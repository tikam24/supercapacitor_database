CSi electronics: Recently, Simon and co-workers demonstrated silicon-wafer-supported elastic carbide-derived carbons (CDCs) films without any delamination or cracks for micro-supercapacitor application. The fabrication of these CDC films is particularly important for the practical application of micro-supercapacitors in silicon-based electronics and flexible electronics.
