An integrated Cu3N porous nanowire array directly grown on a Cu foam substrate is developed for the first time by simple nitridation reaction. When used in supercapacitors, benefiting from good conductivity to favor fast charge transport, one-dimensional (1D) porous structure for large specific surface area, and 3D framework for strong stability, this electrode has excellent capacitive performances, such as a high capacitance of 966.7 F g-1 and good stability during prolonged cycle measurements. When constructing an asymmetric supercapacitor opposite to active carbons, excellent performance is also achieved.
