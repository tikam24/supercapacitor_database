This Research Work presents the use of a hybrid power source system with the battery and supercapacitor in a powertrain electric vehicle. The efficiency and performance of these systems are important, in terms of saving energy and increasing autonomy. Therefore, the control of DC-DC converters is designed through a feedforward technique and power management, through the splitting method of power demand. This allows controlling the power sources with the battery at the lowest frequency, and the supercapacitor at the highest frequency to provide the fast dynamic of power demand. To confirm the performance of powertrain, a simulation is carried with Simulink of MATLAB software that demonstrates the robustness and flexibility under ECE-15 drive-cycle test.
