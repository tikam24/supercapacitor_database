CoAl LDHs with different molar ratio of Ni have been prepared by chemical co-precipitation method. XRD results show that these materials have layered structures. Electrochemical tests show that Co(Ni)Al LDHs as electrode material have typical capacitive properties in a wide voltage range of 0.0 to 0.6 V; Co(Ni)Al LDH(Ni: Co=4:6) as an electrode material has the highest capacitance of 960 Fâ€¢g-1 and good cycling performance. But the poor capacitive properties of NiAl LDH electrode are showed in a narrow voltage range of 0.3 to 0.55 V.
