Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a novel and valuable charging method because of its convenience. In order to further develop its superiority, the supercapacitor (SC) is used as the energy storage device in WPT which could significantly improve the charging speed. In this paper, a two-side control method is proposed to ensure the charging current stable. An inverter with disturbance observer based control (DOBC) controller is implemented on primary side to maintain constant output voltage for the variable primary side current. Then a Buck converter with proportional integral (PI) controller is implemented on the secondary side to maintain constant charging current for the variable load. Compared with conventional charging method, the charging time has been reduced by 40% via the method proposed in this paper.
