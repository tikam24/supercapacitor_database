The hydrogel electrolyte is an important part of safety and development potential in zinc-based energy storage equipment due to its inherent low mechanical strength and voltage decomposition. However, hydrogel electrolytes possess a reduced working life for zinc dendrites growth and a narrow voltage window. In this study, a hydrogel electrolyte prepares by the zwitterionic monomer [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) (MS) and sodium alginate (SA) alleviate these problems. The zwitterionic double-network hydrogel has good mechanical strength, inhibits the growth of zinc dendrites, enhances practicability, greatly increases the voltage window (0–2.4 V), and has self-healing properties to its rich functional groups. The assembled zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSs) have a high-power density of 172.33 W kg−1 and an energy density of 88.56 Wh·kg−1 at 0.5 A g−1. The assembled zinc-ion battery also has good electrochemical performance. Flexible ZHSs and batteries provide power to the timer stably under different bending angles. The zwitterionic double-network hydrogel can be applied to both zinc-based supercapacitors and batteries.
