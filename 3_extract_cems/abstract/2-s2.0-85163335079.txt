By 2050, countries around the world are expected to be gradually phasing out fossil fuels and implementing greener energy technologies. In this work, we present a system employing Energy harvesting, a self-powered technology that can recycle energy from the surrounding environment. A high-efficiency radio frequency (RF) energyâ€“harvesting chip was designed and fabricated. With an off-chip antenna and rectifier, the system scavenges ambient RF energy and converts it into usable energy, which is then stored in energy storage elements (such as a supercapacitor or a rechargeable battery). The system can further be implemented as an energy source for charging smart devices. The system-on-chip design consists of a cold start block, a boost converter with maximum power point tracking functionalities, and a charging block. The chip was fabricated using AMS 350 nm technology. Although the system was optimized for harvesting RF energy, it can be easily adapted to harvest other energy sources (i.e., mechanical and thermal energy sources). Using an optimized cold start architecture, the circuit has a cold start voltage of 380 mV. With an improved control strategy of power conversion, the system is capable of continuously charging up to 4.5 V with a broad input voltage range of 100 mV to 10 V and has a peak charging efficiency of 82%.
