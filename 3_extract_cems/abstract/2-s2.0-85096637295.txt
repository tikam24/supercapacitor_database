Mesoporous carbon fiber (MCF) has shown great application prospects in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to its large specific surface area, large draw ratio, fast electron transfer ability, and good cycle stability. Herein, the dual-mesoporous carbon fibers (DMCF) is prepared via a coassembly process with phenolic resin oligomers as carbon precursors, sodium silicate (silica precursor) as an assistant, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and pluronic F127 as templates. The silica and F127 micelles provide mesoporous sizes of 3.8 and 2.6 nm, respectively. The obtained DMCF has fibrous morphology, high specific surface area, and double mesoporous structure. Compared with carbon fibers with a single pore distribution, DMCF exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 264 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and shows good cycle stability as an electrode material in supercapacitors, demonstrating the enormous potential of DMCF in energy-storage applications.
