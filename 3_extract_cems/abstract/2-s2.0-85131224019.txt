Two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx), a distinctive member of the emerging MXenes sensing, antibacterial due to the distinct layered structure, excess surface functional groups, excellent electrical conductivity, high thermal stability, metallic conductivity, large surface area, and smaller energy bandgap. Despite the growing interest in Ti3C2Tx material, there is not a single comprehensive review paper available in the literature. Hence, there is an urgent need for an up-to-date and comprehensive review focussing on a wide range of aspects ranging from synthesis to various applications in energy and environmental fields. The present study systematically reviews the recent reports on the pristine Ti3C2Tx synthesis, Ti3C2Tx-based composite synthesis and their applications in batteries, supercapacitor, hydrogen evolution reaction, sensing and antibacterial applications. Then, a brief discussion on potential practical applications of Ti3C2Tx-based materials was included. Finally, it was concluded with a note on the current scenario and future directions of Ti3C2Tx-based materials in energy and environmental applications. The results exhibited that the Ti3C2Tx-based materials are the auspicious alternative to other conventional 2D nanomaterials such as graphene for numerous energy and environmental applications.
