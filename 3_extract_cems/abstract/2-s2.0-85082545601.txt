Online accurate estimation of supercapacitor state-of-health (SoH) and state-of-energy (SoE) is essential to achieve efficient energy management and real-time condition monitoring in electric vehicle (EV) applications. In this article, for the first time, unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is used for online parameter and state estimation of the supercapacitor. In the proposed method, a nonlinear state-space model of the supercapacitor is developed, which takes the capacitance variation and self-discharge effects into account. The observability of the considered model is analytically confirmed using a graphical approach. The SoH and SoE are then estimated based on the supercapacitor online identified model with the designed UKF. The proposed method provides better estimation accuracy over Kalman filter (KF) and extended KF algorithms since the linearization errors during the filtering process are avoided. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through several experiments on a laboratory testbed. An overall estimation error below 0.5% is achieved with the proposed method. In addition, hardware-in-the-loop experiments are conducted and real-time feasibility of the proposed method is guaranteed.
