Nanocomposite electrodes for supercapacitors in the form of sheets and fibers were prepared by i) vacuum filtration of SWNT-PPy methanol dispersion and ii) wet-spinning of SWNT-PPy aqueous dispersion, respectively. Electrochemical properties of prepared materials were investigated using cyclic voltammetry method in aqueous 1M NaCl and NaPF6 electrolytes. The capacitance of the SWNT-PPy sheet was about 5 times higher than that of pristine SWNT paper. The capacitance of SWNT-PPy fibers reached record 200 F/g value. Prospective applications of prepared materials range from supercapacitors to electrodes for batteries and electromechanical actuators.
