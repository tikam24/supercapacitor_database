Controllable synthesis of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with hierarchical porosity and high flexibility are extremely desirable for CO2 adsorption and energy storage applications. Herein, we report a nickel cobaltite/carbon nanotubes doped CNFs (NiCo2O4/CNTs CNFs) mesoporous membrane that shows well-developed flexibility, tailored pore structure, hydrophobic character, and high stability. Ascribed to these unique features, NiCo2O4/CNTs CNFs membrane shows high CO2 capture of 1.54 mmol/g at 25 Â°C and 1.0 bar, and electrochemical measurements for supercapacitors exhibit good performance with specific capacitances of 220 F/g (in 1 M KOH) at a current density of 1 A/g. The successful synthesis of such hybrid membrane provides new insight into development of various multifunctional applications.
