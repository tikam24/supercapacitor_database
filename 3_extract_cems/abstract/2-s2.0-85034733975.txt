The proceedings contain 159 papers. The topics discussed include: indirect rotor field-oriented control of a dual star induction machine; analytic and dynamic studies of a multi-star induction machine; heat source temperature for centered heat source on isotropic plate with lower surface forced cooling using neural network and three different materials; a comparative study for optimal replanning of 30KV distribution network based on economic dispatch (ED) and optimal load flow (OPF) with and without DG penetration; a comparative performances study of different indices for optimal DG placement in distribution system; management and control of the integration of supercapacitor in photovoltaic energy storage; and solar drying phosphates using flat plate collector or a cylindro-parabolic concentrator.
