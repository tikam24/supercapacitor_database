The consumption of fossil fuels on a large scale and the environmental problems resulting from the emission of polluting gases into the atmosphere, created the need for change in mobility habits in today's daily life. Responding to these new challenges, strong investments have been made by companies and governments in the automotive sector being the development of electric vehicles and the technologies associated with them an assumed priority by all the stakeholders. Fast charging of batteries is one of the technical issues that have been addressed. In addition, fast charging of electric vehicles in remote locations can be implemented taking advantage of renewable energy systems and avoiding power demand from conventional power grids. In this paper, the power can be supplied by a photovoltaic generation system and is managed taking advantage of an intermediate energy storage system based on a battery bank and supercapacitors. The operation of the proposed system is observed performing simulations conditions, which allow checking the correct operation of the system and its response to possible failures of the subsystems that constitute it.
