This paper describes fabrication and characterization of a hybrid nanostructure comprised of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) via layer by layer (LBL) assembly. This structure was prepared by vacuum filtration and heat-treated at 500 Â°C. The morphology of the sample was investigated by field emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The crystalline structure and chemical composition were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of MWCNTs/r-GO hybrid film appeared close to that of an ideal double layer capacitor, in quasi-rectangular shape. The current density gradually increased with increasing voltage scanning rate, exceeding 20 A/g at a scan rate of 500 mV/s. Accordingly, the specific capacitance decreased with the increase of the voltage scanning rate as expected. Electrochemical performance of this hybrid film indicates that it can further improve supercapacitor electrodes.
