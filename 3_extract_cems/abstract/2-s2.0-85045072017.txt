A facile one-step approach was employed to synthesize oxygen-rich porous carbon nanosheets (OPCNs) using glucose as carbon source via Mg2(OH)2CO3 simultaneously chemical blowing and activation. Besides the simple synthetic process, the OPCNs material has an ultrathin thickness about 10–20 nm, numerous heteroatoms, developed porosity and good electrical transport properties. The electrochemical tests demonstrated that OPCNs possessed high specific capacitance, good rate performance and low intrinsic resistance. Moreover, the comparison experiments indicated that the specific capacitance of OPCNs was higher than those of carbon materials prepared by the activation of KOH and ZnCl2, chemical blowing of NH4Cl and melamine, and the MgO template route under the similar synthetic conditions. The assembled symmetric OPCNs-based supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 8.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1 within a voltage range of 0–1.8 V in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, the cycle test over 10,000 runs suggested that this supercapacitor had good cyclic performance.
