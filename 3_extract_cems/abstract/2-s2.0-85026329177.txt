We report an ingenious yet efficient method to fabricate ordered vertically aligned nitrogen- and sulfur-codoped carbon nanowire (NS-CNW) arrays by direct carbonization of the finely designed copolymer. The as-prepared vertically aligned NS-CNWs with unique electronic features and very narrow diameters facilitate ion diffusion to further exhibit ideal electrochemical properties (243.0 F g-1 at the current density of 0.1 A g-1) and excellent cycle stability (10 000 cycles) when applied to a supercapacitor electrode. The controllable design and copolymerization of conducting polymers, which can provide doped carbon nanowire array electrodes having high surface area with controllable components and uniform dimensions in a neat way, provide more flexibility to tailor the carbon-based electrodes toward specific applications.
