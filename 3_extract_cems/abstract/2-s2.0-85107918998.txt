CoMoO4 microspheres were deposited on nickel (Ni) foam by simple hydrothermal method, and CuCo2O4 nanowires were uniformly grown on CoMoO4 microspheres, then CoMoO4@CuCo2O4 core shell structure composite material was successfully synthesized. The electrochemical test of CoMoO4@CuCo2O4 electrode was completed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD). These experiment results exhibit that CoMoO4@CuCo2O4 electrode has excellent capacitance characteristic, including a remarkable specific capacitance of 2639 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an outstanding cycle life with a captaincy retention of 91.6% after 2000 cycles at 30 A g−1. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on CoMoO4@CuCo2O4//activated carbon (AC) exhibited a high energy density of 51.2 W h kg−1 at 800.3 W kg−1. These performances strongly demonstrate that the CoMoO4@CuCo2O4 electrode synthesized by simple methods is an excellent electrode material in the application of supercapacitors (SCs).
