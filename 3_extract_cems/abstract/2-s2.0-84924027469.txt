A hybrid material composed of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxypyrrole) or (PEDOP) enwrapped Bi2S3 nanoflowers was synthesized for the first time for use as supercapacitor electrodes. The Bi2S3 nanoflowers were enveloped by a sheath of PEDOP, during the course of electropolymerization and uniform coatings of PEDOP/Bi2S3 hybrid were deposited on rigid and flexible current collectors. Asymmetric supercapacitors were constructed using the PEDOP/Bi2S3 hybrid and graphite (Gr) as working and counter electrodes. The electrochemical specific capacitance of the hybrid based cell (201 F g-1) was found to be 3.58 times greater than that of the pristine polymer (56 F g-1), at the same current density of 1 A g-1. The PEDOP/Bi2S3-Gr cell delivered energy and power densities of 100.5 Wh kg-1 and 0.5 kW kg-1 respectively. The Bi2S3 nanoflowers also furnish a robust support to PEDOP, which was reflected in an excellent rate capability, for the hybrid sustains high currents, without incurring a significant loss in capacitance, and good durability upon repeated switching between doped and dedoped states. A flexible supercapacitor was also fabricated with the PEDOP/Bi2S3 hybrid and it delivered a capacitance of 329 F g-1 (at 0.4 A g-1), thus indicating the promise the hybrid holds for realizing scalable, but lightweight high performance supercapacitors.
