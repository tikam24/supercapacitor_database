Composite electrodes based on cobalt hydroxide and iron oxide, respectively, with silica as an under-layer were developed with the use of sol-gel and electrochemical deposition techniques. The electrodes demonstrate similar surface morphologies of the upper pseudocapacitive layer formed by lamellas. The composite Co-based electrodes as well as Fe-based electrodes with silica reveal higher values of capacitance retention after multiple charge-discharge process than the ones without it. The influence of OH−concentration upon pseudocapacitive behavior was estimated for Co–based electrodes. The mixed electrolyte with an extremely low alkali concentration proved to increase capacitance retention of the electrodes. A model of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor was fabricated with the use of the Co and Fe–based electrodes, pre-coated with silica. The use of differential capacitance technique in a full electrochemical cell allowed balancing charges of positive and negative electrodes within their potential windows. The maximum voltage range of 1.4 V was achieved for the cell which exceeds the window of electrochemical stability of water.
