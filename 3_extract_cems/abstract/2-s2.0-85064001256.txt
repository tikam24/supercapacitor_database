Fiber supercapacitors have aroused great interest in the field of portable and wearable electronic devices. However, the restrained surface area of fibers and limited reaction kinetics of active materials are unfavorable for performance enhancement. Herein, an efficient multicomponent hierarchical structure is constructed by integrating the Cu-doped cobalt copper carbonate hydroxide@nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (CCCH@NiCo-LDH) core–shell nanowire arrays (NWAs) on Cu fibers with highly conductive Au-modified CuO nanosheets (CCCH@NiCo-LDH NWAs@Au–CuO/Cu) via a novel in situ corrosion growth method. This multicomponent hierarchical structure contributes to a large accessible surface area, which results in sufficient permeation of the electrolyte. The Cu dopant could reduce the work function and facilitate fast charge transfer kinetics. Therefore, the effective ion diffusion and electron conduction will facilitate the electrochemical reaction kinetics of the electrode. Benefiting from this unique structure, the electrode delivers a high specific capacitance (1.97 F cm−2/1237 F g−1/193.3 mAh g−1) and cycling stability (90.8% after 30 000 cycles), exhibiting superb performance compared with most oxide-based fiber electrodes. Furthermore, the hybrid fiber supercapacitor of CCCH@NiCo-LDH NWAs@Au–CuO/Cu//VN/carbon fibers is fabricated, providing a remarkable maximal energy density of 34.97 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 13.86 kW kg−1, exhibiting a great potential in high-performance fiber-shape energy-related systems.
