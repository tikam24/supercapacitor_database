Supercapacitors or ultra-capacitors are well thought-out best approach to fulfil the indispensable requirements of energy storage. Supercapacitive electrode materials have become interest of scientists. In the present study, we have reported an efficient and catalyst free method for synthesis of porous carbon by the pyrolysis of salt, prepared by reaction of organic acid with organic base for supercapacitive application. The prepared salt was characterized by single crystal analysis, 1H NMR, single crystal XRD and FT-IR. The salt derived porous carbon material was then characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The specific surface area of porous carbon was calculated by BET analysis found to be 347 m2/g. Electrode material showed good capacitive response. The specific capacitance of sample was Ca. 44.69 F/g at sweep rate 2 mV/s and retains 83.88% of its initial capacitance after 1900 cycles.
