Herein, we have presented a supercapacitor based on carbide derived carbon (CDC) electrode with natural graphite (NG) addition. The capacitor was analyzed at 22 °C by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and impedance techniques using a 0.5 mol/L of magnesium (II) bis (trifluoro methanesulfonyl) imide (MgTFSI) in ethylene carbonate-propylene carbonate (EC: PC = 1: 1, v/v) as electrolyte. The results conclude that the CDC cell enhancements have been proven by the composite electrode (5%-30% NG to CDC) especially on the cell efficiency and voltage i.e., the CDC cell around 2.5 V limit was improved. An obtainable specific capacitance, real power and energy density are 15 F·g-1, 1.2 kW·kg-1 and 15 Wh·kg-1, respectively.
