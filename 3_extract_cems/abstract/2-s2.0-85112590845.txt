Al-doped MnO2 hollow nanospheres were prepared by hydrothermal method to enhance electrochemical properties. The morphology, crystal structures, and element content of the samples were characterized by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and the rmogravimetric analysis (TG), respectively. The electrochemical performances were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) testing and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results show that the MnO2 gains the highest Al3+ doping content when adding 3 mmol Al2(SO4)3âˆ™18H2O to the precursor solution. At the same time,the MnO2 sample with the highest Al3+ doping content shows the best electrochemical performance. At a current density of 0.5 A/g, a specific capacitance of 242.47 F/g was achieved.
