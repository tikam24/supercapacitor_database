One-dimensional nanobelt with inner nanopores has been considered as an ideal electrode material for electric energy storage. Herein iron manganese trioxide (FeMnO3) nanobelts have been prepared by a facile solvothermal approach. The phase, composition, structure and morphology of the as-synthesized sample are characterized by several techniques. Benefiting from the unique structure, the as-prepared FeMnO3 nanobelts achieve a superior lithium storage capacity with 635.7 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles, excellent cyclability and good kinetic properties, as well as a high specific capacitance of 209 F g−1 after 2000 cycles for supercapacitor. These results show a great application in large-scale energy storage.
