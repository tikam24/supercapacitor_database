Sustainable development based on the value-added utilization of furfural residues (FRs) is an effective way to achieve a profitable circular economy. This comprehensive work highlights the potential of FRs as precursor to prepare porous carbons for high performance supercapacitors (SCs). To improve the electrochemical performance of FR-based carbon materials, a facile route based on methanol pretreatment coupled with pre-carbonization and followed KOH activation is proposed. More defects could be obtained after methanol treatment, which is incline to optimize textural structure. The activated methanol treated FR-based carbon materials (AFRMs) possess high specific surface area (1753.5 m2 g−1), large pore volume (0.85 cm3 g−1), interconnected micro/mesoporous structure, which endow the AFRMs with good electrochemical performance in half-cell (326.1 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, 189.4 F g−1 at 50 A g−1 in 6 mol L−1 KOH). The constructed symmetric SCs based on KOH, KOH–K3Fe(CN)6 and KOH-KI electrolyte deliver energy density up to 8.9, 9.9 and 10.6 Wh kg−1 with a capacitance retention of over 86% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the self-discharge can be restrained by the addition of K3Fe(CN)6 and KI in KOH electrolyte. This study provides an effective approach for high-valued utilization of FR waste.
