Spinels are not known for their supercapacitive nature. Here, we have explored electrochemically synthesized nanostructured NiCo2O4 spinel thin-film electrode for electrochemical supercapacitors. The nanostructured NiCo2O4 spinel thin film exhibited a high specific capacitance value of 580 F g-1 and an energy density of 32 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 4 kW kg-1, accompanying with good cyclic stability.
