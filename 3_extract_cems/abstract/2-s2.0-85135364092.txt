Universitetet i Oslo-66 (UiO-66) with high surface area and tunable pore structure is considered as one of efficient active materials of supercapacitors (SC). Carbonization is largely used to enhance electrical conductivity and energy storage ability of active material, but the parameters for carbonizing UiO-66 as active material of SC is rarely studied. It is the first time to investigate carbonization temperature effects on physical properties of UiO-66 derived carbon and electrochemical performances of SC. Applying higher temperatures for carbonizing UiO-66 leads to more serious structure shrinking, more defects and more C–O than C[dbnd]O bonds in carbon materials, but the recrystallization at 900 ​°C causes larger particle formation. The carbonized UiO-66 prepared using 800 ​°C (C800) shows the highest specific capacitance of 169.7 ​F/g at 20 ​mV/s, due to small particle size and suitable ratios of C–O to C[dbnd]O and graphene to defect. The SC composed of C800 electrodes shows maximum energy density of 2.55 ​Wh/kg at power density of 200 ​W/kg and excellent charge/discharge cycling stability with capacitance retention of 86.5% and Coulombic efficiency of 100% after 12000 times repeatedly charge/discharge process. Excellent bending ability is also achieved for this SC with capacitance retention of 74.3% after bending 500 times at 180°.
