The polymer of (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-propanediaminebis(salicylideneaminato))- nickel(II), Ni(saldMp), was deposited on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) substrate by the route of potential linear sweep. The nano structures of poly[Ni(saldMp)] have been obtained by adjusting the monomer concentration of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mmol L -1. The poly[Ni(saldMp)] prepared in acetonitrile solution with monomer concentration of 1.0 mmol L -1 shows the fastest growth rate. The effects of potential window on charge-discharge efficiency and electrodeposition scan number on capacitance performance were discussed. Poly[Ni(saldMp)] prepared with less electrodeposition scans exhibits higher capacitance, but this goes against the improvement of the whole electrode capacitance. Sample with 8 deposition scans is the best compromise with the geometric specific capacitance 3.53 times as high as that of pure MWCNTs, and 1.24 times for the gravimetric specific capacitance under the test potential window 0.0-1.0 V.
