Ni(OH) 2-Co(OH) 2 was obtained by an easy simple liquid coprecipitation method. After calcination, the Co 3O 4-NiO composite particles were gotten, then modified by ethylenediamine. And the dispersion of Co 3O 4-NiO particles improved, morphology was flake, it formed loose mesoporous structure among each particles. Meanwhile, electrochemical supercapacitors properties of Co 3O 4-NiO electrode material were tested. The consequence manifested that the Co 3O 4-NiO composite particles showed excellent electrochemical performance and its single electrode specific capacitance was up to 1202 F/g at the potential window of 0-0.4 V, which increased 171 F/g compared with the unmodified.
