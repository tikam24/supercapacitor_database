Polymer electrolyte fuel cells are considered as a promising alternative to mitigate the CO2 emission in the transport sector. To achieve an efficient and cost-effective system, hybridisation of the energy storage system with a fuel cell is important. Efficient management of energy is the key in order to achieve an efficient and cost-effective configuration for fuel cell electric vehicle. Optimum sizing of the power source and energy storage system, which is capable of meeting the load requirement of the driving cycle is the key challenge for achieving efficient and cost-effective system. In this work, an alternative methodology based on the principles of pinch analysis is proposed, for sizing the energy storage system and the fuel cell for fuel cell-based electric vehicle, and validated for the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC) class-3 driving cycle.
