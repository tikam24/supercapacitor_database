Nano-nest polyaniline electrodes were synthesized by using electrodeposition method at room temperature (27 °C) without the use of templating. The fabrication of supercapacitors -are carried out by direct electrodeposition on stainless steel and indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. The electrode with a lower contact angle shows 83% enhancement in supercapacitive property as compared to those with higher contact angle. Furthermore, the galvanostatic and potentiostatic experiments have been conducted on stainless steel substrate shown that the polyaniline material has very good stability and with maximum capacitance 757 F g-1 and minimum capacitance 412 F g-1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte within the potential windows of −200 to 800 mV vs SCE at 5 mVs−1 scan rate. The formation of elemental bonds is confirmed from FTIR studies. This unexpected rise in capacitance is discussed in terms of the electroactive material/electrolyte interface area. The polyaniline (PANI) are one of the most promising contenders for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor due to its excellent specific capacitance, large power density, high charge-discharge rate, and better columbic efficiency.
