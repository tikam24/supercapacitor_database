Ag-doped pseudocapacitive MnO2 materials are synthesized by reacting MnO4- with Mn2+ solution intentionally tuned with AgCl micelles. AgCl micelles serve as inducing template and play dual role for MnO2 growth: porosity generator and Ag-doping agent. The AgCl micelle-induced MnO2 has higher porosity, higher specific surface area, higher electrical conductivity and better ion diffusion, thus exhibiting dramatically improved pseduocapacitance and charge-discharge performance. Compared with pure MnO2, the prepared MnO2 containing 5 atomic percent of Ag exhibits almost doubled specific capacitance (488F g-1) and the existence of Ag dopant in MnO2 enhances the charge-discharge efficiency.
