This paper discusses an important research issue which is an attracting Hybrid Power System (HPS) using a Proton-Exchange-Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) and a Supercapacitor (SC). This latter is considered as a short term storage device. The PEMFC is expected to become an excellent solution for several applications, even that its slow dynamic. So, the SC is proposed to minimize power fluctuations in the HPS and to generate a necessary power. In this paper, we propose also an Energy Management Unit (EMU) according to some constraints (e.g. Load demand, state of charge (SOC) of the SC, and energy balance of the system). The considered EMU offers several scenarios based on many power flow possibilities. Each operating mode scenario contains, in its turn, several scenarios to cover all the circumstances. A regulation for the PEMFC and the SC was given. Results and discussions are given based on MATLAB-Simulink using an electrical model which developed and treated for the proposed design.
