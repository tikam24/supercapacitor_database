Polypyrrole (PPy) nanowires have been successfully grown on the surface of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets by using a facile chemical method. The GO/PPy composites exhibit a predominant specific capacitance of 633 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g by charge/discharge analysis, in comparison with 227 F/g for pure PPy. The composites also show superior electrochemical rate capability and cycle stability. The attenuation of the specific capacitance is less than 6% after 1000 charge/discharge processes. The high specific capacitance and good stability of the GO/PPy composites are very promising for applications in electrochemical supercapacitor devices. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
