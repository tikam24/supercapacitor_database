Nowadays, the development of storage systems and renewable energy sources are in high demand. One of the most prominent storage systems is supercapacitors (SCs). The greatest challenge is to develop SCs displaying extreme energy and power densities. Owing to its higher thermal stability, high conductivity, great specific capacitance, valuable reversibility, highly reversible faradic reaction, excellent pseudo-capacitive behavior, and high rate capability, ruthenium as metal oxide is extensively studied and very promising for supercapacitor applications. In addition, carbon-based materials, particularly graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (RGO), have also been utilized as effective materials in SCs because of their excellent mechanical and electrical traits. It has been established that the combination between Ru-based perovskites and RGO or GO are beneficial for SCs with the highest performances. This chapter describes advancements in high-performance SCs based on Ru-based perovskites/RGO or GO composites.
