In order to improve the reliability of grid-connected operation of photovoltaic power generation systems, this paper proposes a photovoltaic grid-connected inverter based on supercapacitor energy storage MMC. Compared with traditional battery energy storage devices, the converter has the advantages of environmental friendliness, high energy storage efficiency, and long service life. The control strategy of the system is divided into three parts: carrier phase shift modulation strategy (CPS-SPWM), voltage balance control strategy and super capacitor charging control strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed photovoltaic grid-connected inverter and its control strategy is verified in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the system can realize the photovoltaic grid-connected inverter process, realizes soft switching, and has high Energy storage efficiency.
