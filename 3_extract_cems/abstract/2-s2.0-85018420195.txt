MnOx thin films with various oxidation states (MnO, Mn2O3, MnO2 and mixed MnO/Mn3O4) were directly grown onto carbon nanotubes by pulsed laser deposition under vacuum and at different oxygen partial pressures. The microstructural features of the as-deposited thin films are characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical behavior of the CNT/MnOx nanocomposites in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte is discussed with regards to specific capacitance, and cycle-life, by means of cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance measurements. First, at slow potential scan rate of 1 mV s−1, MnOx prepared under vacuum and 10 mTorr of O2 delivered specific capacitance as high as 738 and 653 F g−1, respectively. Second, the rate capability of these two nanocomposites over a wide range of scan rates showed that at 500 mV s−1, the former retained 93 % whereas the later displayed an increase of 1.2 % with regards to their respective initial specific capacitance values at 1 mV s−1. They also maintained 90 % and 95 % of their specific capacitance after 10 000 continuous cycles with a 100 mV s−1 scan rate. The binder-free nature of the CNT/MnOx nanocomposites and remarkable electrochemical properties suggest that these materials could find application as excellent electrodes for supercapacitors.
