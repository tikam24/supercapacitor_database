In this paper, activated carbon derived from shochu waste was used as electrodes of supercapacitors. We have optimized the thickness of the flexible electrodes. Electrodes of different thicknesses were fabricated, and the optimal thickness was determined from the investigated characteristics of the supercapacitor. The characteristics of the supercapacitor were analysed via constant current charge-discharge tests. The experimental results clearly indicated the optimum thickness of the electrode to lie between 57- 120~mu m.
