In this work, we report the biosynthesis of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles (Bio-NPs) via hydrothermal method. The synthetized Bio-NPs-CuCo2S4 was studied as an active material of working electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor and non-enzymatic hydrazine sensor. The Bio.NPs-CuCo2S4/ITO electrode has a specific capacitance of 264 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Meanwhile, the electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performances, such as an energy density of 33 Wh/Kg and a power density of 900 W/Kg. The Bio.NPs-CuCo2S4/ITO electrode for non-enzymatic hydrazine sensor exhibits a very high sensitivity of 2400 μA.mM−1.cm−2, a wide linear range from 0.001 to 1.400 mM and shows an excellent selectivity.
