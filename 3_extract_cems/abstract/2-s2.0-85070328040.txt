We have generated in situ nanocomposite of Mn3O4 and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) upon employing wet-chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) by Mn(II) salt as mild-reducing agent for the first time and examined the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The half-wave potential (E1/2) of the nanocomposite catalyst (20% Mn3O4-rGO/C) was found to be around −0.153 V which is only ∼87 mV negative from the commercially available catalyst (20% Pt/C). Remarkably, after 5000 linear sweep voltammetry cycles the E1/2 shifted marginally by 20 mV; and the number of electrons transferred during ORR was estimated to be close to 4. Such an efficient electrocatalytic performance of the nanocomposite was primarily attributed to the synergistic interaction between Mn3O4 and rGO. The fabricated all-solid-state supercapacitor of rGO (extracted from the nanocomposite) in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol-sulfuric acid (PVA-H2SO4) gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) showed CS value of ∼310 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g along with long durability (10,000 charge-discharge cycles). All-solid-state flexible rGO supercapacitor exhibited high-flexibility and excellent durability (30,000 cycles with 100% retention of CS). Our results provide an enormous opportunity in designing transition metal oxides decorated semiconducting reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite platforms for various electrochemical applications.
