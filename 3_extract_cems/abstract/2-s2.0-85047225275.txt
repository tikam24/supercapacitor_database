The synergy effect between different components has attracted widespread attentions because of improved activity, selectivity and stability than single component. In this paper, we fabricated mesoporous hybrid dual-metal Co and Fe containing metallic organic framework (Co/Fe-MOF), Fe-MOF, and Co-MOF in the ionic liquid (IL)/supercritical CO2 (SC)/surfactant emulsion system, and then studied the electrochemical properties of the three MOFs systematically. Experiment results indicate that, by taking advantages of coexistence of double metal, hybrid bi-metal Co/Fe-MOF exhibits the highest specific capacitance and the best cycling stability, with specific capacitance to 319.5 F/g at 1 A/g, 1.4 and 4 times for single Co-MOF and Fe-MOF, respectively.
