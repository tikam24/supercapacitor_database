A promising electrode material for energy storage, the SnS2/g-C3N4 composite is reported, which is prepared by a simple hydrothermal route. The SnS2/g-C3N4 composite shows a good specific capacitance of 552 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 3 M KOH, and also exhibits excellent cycling stability of 95.8% capacitance retention after 15000 cycles even at a relatively high current density of 10 A g−1. The SnS2/g-C3N4 composite is proved to be a promising candidate for the electrode materials in supercapacitor applications.
