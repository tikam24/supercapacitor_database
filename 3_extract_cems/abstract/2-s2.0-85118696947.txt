Electroactive and conductive hydrogels with porous network structure, super hydrophilicity, mechanical flexibility and biocompatibility are prominent electrode materials for flexible/wearable supercapacitors. In this work, novel PPy hydrogels (m-PPy) with crystalline core–shell structure have been facilely fabricated with assistance of 2-methylimidazole via one-step oxidative polymerization. The m-PPy hydrogels exhibit significantly improved recoverable compressive strength of up to 26.7 kPa at 50% strain and remarkable maximum compressive strength of up to 265 kPa, due to effective energy dissipation by nanocrystalline shells. The m-PPy3:3 exhibits high specific capacitance of 536 F g−1 and corresponding symmetric supercapacitor possesses superior areal specific capacitance of 603 mF cm−2, good rate capability and superb areal energy density of 53.6 μWh cm−2. Particularly, m-PPy3:3 based flexible supercapacitor presents remarkable flexibility and mechanical stability, which can sustain 10,000 bending cycles without severe degradation of electrochemical performance.
