Herein, a simple aqueous-exfoliation strategy is introduced for the fabrication of a series of MoO3− x nanosheets (where x stands for oxygen vacancies) using two commercial molybdenum oxide precursors, MoO2 and MoO3. The nanosheets offer a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect which is dependent on the structure and local environment of the nanosheets. The LSPR can be efficiently tuned by changing the weight ratio between the molybdenum oxide precursor(s) and/or by solar light irradiation using a low-energy UV lamp (36 W). For the pristine MoO3− x nanosheets, the highest LSPR signal is obtained for nanosheets prepared using 80% MoO2. On the contrary, after solar light irradiation, the nanosheets prepared using pure MoO3 offer the highest LSPR response. The nanosheets also show an outstanding rate capability when used as binder-free supercapacitor electrodes in an acidified Na2SO4 electrolyte. The electrodes exhibit discharge capacities of 110 and 75 C g−1 at a scan rate of 20 and 1000 mV s−1, respectively. The MoO3− x nanosheets can likewise be used as a negative electrode material for lithium-ion batteries. The efficient eco-friendly synthesis and the ability to tune the photochemical and electrochemical properties of the nanosheets make this approach interesting to many energy-related research fields.
