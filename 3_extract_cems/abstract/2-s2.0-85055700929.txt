Inertia plays a vital role in maintaining the frequency stability of power systems. However, the increase of power electronics-based renewable generation can dramatically reduce the inertia levels of modern power systems. This issue has already challenged the control and stability of small-scale power systems. It will soon be faced by larger power systems as the trend of large-scale renewable integration continues. In view of the urgent demand for addressing the inertia concern, this paper presents a comprehensive review of inertia enhancement methods covering both proven techniques and emerging ones and also studies the effect of inertia on frequency control. Among those proven techniques, the inertia emulation by wind turbines has successfully demonstrated its effectiveness and will receive widespread adoptions. For the emerging techniques, the virtual inertia generated by the dc-link capacitors of power converters has a great potential due to its low cost. The same concept of inertia emulation can also be applied to ultracapacitors. In addition, batteries will serve as an alternative inertia supplier, and the relevant technical challenges as well as the solutions are discussed in this paper. In future power systems where most of the generators and loads are connected via power electronics, virtual synchronous machines will gradually take over the responsibility of inertia support. In general, it is concluded that advances in semiconductors and control promise to make power electronics an enabling technology for inertia control in future power systems.
