A simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize four kinds of electrode materials (NiSe2, MoS2, MoS2/NiSe2 composite, and CQDs/MoS2/NiSe2 composite). Structures and electrochemical performance were investigated. Among the four kinds of electrode materials, CQDs/MoS2/NiSe2 composite has excellent performance. The specific capacitance of the CQDs/MoS2/NiSe2 composite can be as high as 1540.7 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1, which is higher than that of NiSe2 (830.9 F g−1), MoS2 (82.2 F g−1) and MoS2/NiSe2 composite (1289.7 F g−1). After 2000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the CQDs/MoS2/NiSe2 composite can be retained by 80.6% at 20 A g−1, indicating its good cycling stability. The experiment results show that the CQDs/MoS2/NiSe2 composite has promising electrochemical energy storage application in supercapacitors.
