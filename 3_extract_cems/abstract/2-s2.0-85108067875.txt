Supercapacitors, also known as ultracapacitors or Electric Double-Layer Capacitors, are considered as new solutions for space power supplies because of their advantages such as a high power-density, a wide temperature range and a long life. Graphene supercapacitors (GSCs), with graphene structure served as the highly active material, are new types of high-performance and new-concept supercapacitors. However, there are no cases of supercapacitors, especially GSCs, being used as power system for spacecraft independently. This paper introduces the design, test and application of the power supply based on GSCs for the electromagnetic separation system in Q-SAT mission. The power supply is integrated by multiple GSCs to meet the requirements of the separation system, providing 600W power within 2 × 10−5 m3 and 1 kg. The design, packaging method, test and result is reported in the paper. The rated voltage of the selected GSCs is 2.7 V, and the power density reaches 1.1 × 103 W/kg and 2.6 × 106 W/m3. The power supply based on GSCs has passed the verification test successfully including mechanical, electrical, vacuum and thermal tests from −20–60 °C. It successfully drove the separation system and guaranteed the task of unlocking and releasing Q-SAT in the flight on Aug 6, 2020. The significance of this work lies in the following aspects: First, the feasibility of application on the satellite separation system in space of GSC is demonstrated. Second, the design and application case of supercapacitor as a driving power supply for a satellite separation system is presented. Third, a screening and integration method for GSCs packaged as a space power supply is proposed and verified. The space power supply based on GSCs will be used more widely in space according to this research.
