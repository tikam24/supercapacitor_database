The Nanostructured Origami™ process is a novel fabrication and assembly method that is ideal for creating nanostructured devices with a three-dimensional (3D) geometry. In this paper, we describe the application of this new technique to the fabrication of an electrochemical energy storage device, namely a supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is ideal for origami fabrication because the incorporation of nanostructures and 3D geometry into its design will help improve its electrochemical performance. A first-generation supercapacitor with activated carbon electrodes has been successfully fabricated and tested. A capacitance of ∼1 μF has been obtained from a device with dimensions of approximately 1 mm × 1 mm × 0.1 mm. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
