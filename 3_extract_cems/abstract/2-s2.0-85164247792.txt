The inertia response and voltage support capability of renewable power generations (RPGs) are urgently required in the construction of new-type power system, thus, for high voltage and high rating application scenarios, this paper proposed an energy-storage-type static-var-generator (ESVG) with the capability of autonomous grid support functions, which can help the wind farms achieve grid-friendly integration and operation. By integrating supercapacitors into the existent high voltage SVG of wind farms, the SVG can achieve four-quadrant active and reactive operation. Furthermore, based on the proposed converter circuit, a self-synchronous voltage source control based on the inner-electromotive-force droop with the circular current limitation strategy is proposed. The resulting control method can be adopted to not only achieve autonomous frequency response and grid voltage support, but also retain the voltage source characteristics during the current limitation control period of the device, mimicking a rather complete characteristics of the synchronous generator. In addition, the tuning method for the key control parameters oriented for grid frequency and voltage support demands is provided. Finally, an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation model of the grid-tied ESVG system is constructed in Matlab/Simulink. Simulation studies indicate that ESVG can actively output active/reactive power when the grid frequency/voltage fluctuates, reduce the frequency change due to the sudden increase of load in the grid, exhibiting rather satisfactory autonomous inertia response and voltage support capability.
