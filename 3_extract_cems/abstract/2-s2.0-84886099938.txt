Recently developed textile and paper based supercapacitors are well-suited for wearable energy storage devices due to their mechanical flexibility and stretchability. In this study, the effects of mechanical straining on carbon nanotube coated textiles are studied, and we demonstrate the pre-straining of the textile can result in an enhanced specific capacitance as well as power and energy densities. In-situ resistance measurement during mechanical straining of the textile capacitors show a decrease in resistance with tensile straining, which contributed directly to the enhancement of electrochemical performance. Two different carbon nanotube textiles based on polyester and cotton with different mechanical behaviors are examined, where the polyester textile show an increase in specific capacitance from 53.6 F g -1 to 85.7 F g-1 after the textile is pre-strained to 30% permanent elongation prior to electrochemical testing, constituting a 37% enhancement. Similarly, the cotton textile shows an enhancement in specific capacitance from 122.1 F g-1 to 142.0 F g-1 after 30% permanent elongation, which is a 22% enhancement. Specific capacitance, energy density, and power density are increased further by electroplating of MnO2 nanoparticles on the carbon nanotube coated cotton textile and then imposing a permanent elongation of 30%. Our results indicate that the simple mechanical pre-straining of the textile fibers contribute to significant enhancements in the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors.
