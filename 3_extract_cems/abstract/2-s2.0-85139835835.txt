Reasonable, high-efficiency and energy-saving methods are used as a hopeful strategies to boost the performance of supercapacitor (SCs) electrode materials. Here, NiOOH@NiFeS2 with a unique nanosheet core-shell structure wrapped by a chiffon-like ultrathin structure was fabricated by a simple, energy-saving and fast chemical bath deposition and electrochemical deposition method. Chiffon-like tulle NiFeS2 provides masses of electrochemically active sites, empowering the electrolyte osmosis interior the NiOOH 3D nanosheets. NiOOH does duty for a bottom liner leg to carry the germination of the NiFeS2, endowing the whole NiOOH@NiFeS2 with luxuriant electroconductive routes and cycling durability. As a result, the NiOOH@NiFeS2 terminal post shows distinguished electric capacity (1580.0 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1). As an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), NiOOH@NiFeS2//activated carbon (AC) displays outstanding electrochemical performance (181.4 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1) and lengthy circulation ability (65.32 % capacity conservation after 5000 cycles at 20 A·g−1). In addition, a top energy density of 64.4 Wh·kg–1 is gained in a power density of 0.8 kW·kg–1. Undoubtedly, the excellent electrochemical properties exhibited by NiOOH@NiFeS2 confirm that the novel materials and energy-saving synthesis methods adopted in this paper are effective ways to improve the performance of SCs. This approach offers the possibility for a wide range of SCs applications.
