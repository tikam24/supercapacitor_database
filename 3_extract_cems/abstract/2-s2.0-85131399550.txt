Both MXene and conducting polymers are hot research topics on electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs). The combination of these two different types of materials can solve the defects that exist when they are used as electrode materials alone. Based on theoretical capacity, specific surface area, mass load, flexibility and excellent mechanical properties, MXene/conducting polymers composites demonstrate their potential to become advanced electrode materials. In order to further illustrate the changes brought about by these composites, a large number of examples of MXene/conducting polymers as electrodes are described in details. In general, this review covers the latest developments in the study of SCs based on MXene/conducting polymers composites, including materials preparation, electrode materials, symmetrical supercapacitors (SSCs) and asymmetrical supercapacitors (ASCs). This article aims to understand the application of MXene/conducting polymers composites in the research of SCs, and provides a guideline for further research of these promising materials.
