In this article, a ternary nanocomposite comprising MnO2/PANI/MWCNTs was synthesized by a facile chemical method for application as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The morphology and microstructure of the nanocomposite were examined by using energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of the ternary nanocomposite was investigated in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge (CD) testing and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The ternary MnO2/PANI/MWCNT nanocomposite demonstrated a specific capacitance of 395.0 F·g-1 and can still maintain 72% of its capacitance after 1000 CD cycles at a current density of 1 A·g-1. The excellent electrochemical properties of the MnO2/PANI/MWCNT nanocomposite may arise from the high conductivity and the synergistic effect of the ternary structure.
