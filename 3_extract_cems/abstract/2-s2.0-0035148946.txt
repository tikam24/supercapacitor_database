This paper presents a new approach of modeling the dynamic behavior of supercapacitors using impedance spectroscopy. The new Matlab/Simulink model can be used in simulating the voltage response and energy efficiency, e.g. for automotive power systems. The model in the frequency domain, the parameter calculation as well as the inverse transformation into the time domain are discussed in detail. Furthermore, simulation results are compared with measured data obtained on a test bench.
