Recent development in portable electronics has promoted the increasing demand for high-performance energy storage systems, which are lightweight, ultrathin, flexible, wearable, and even foldable. Owing to their unique one-dimensional (1D) structure, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can act as the basic building blocks to construct two-dimensional (2D) films to serve as flexible supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. Furthermore, doping or modification of the CNT films creates new classes of CNT materials with various beneficial properties. During the past several years, some great progresses have been achieved in the preparation of flexible CNT-based SC electrodes and assembly of flexible SC based on these electrodes. In this chapter, we describe the recent development in the fabrication of flexible CNT film and the design of flexible SC based on these electrodes. The further developments and prospects of CNT film in this exciting field are also discussed.
