Binderless Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes grown on Ni foam (NF)-supported vertically oriented graphene nanosheets (V-GNs) has been fabricated as a positive electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), coupled with activated carbon (AC) as a counter electrode material. The introduction of V-GNs leads to dense growth of nanocrystalline β-Ni(OH)2 that is confirmed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopic and scanning electron microscopic analyses. The electrochemical performances of the Ni(OH)2/GNs/NF electrode are characterized by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge tests, which exhibit high specific capacitance of 2215 F g -1 at a scan current density of 2.3 A g-1, enhanced cycling stability and high rate capability. The Ni(OH)2/GNs/NF-AC- based ASC can achieve a cell voltage of 1.4 V and a specific energy density of 11.11 Wh kg-1 at 0.5 mA cm-2 with a nearly 100% coulombic efficiency at room temperature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
