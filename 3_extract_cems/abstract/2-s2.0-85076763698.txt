The constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging is a classical method to charge a single supercapacitor cell. However, it typically causes voltage imbalance among cells when charging a series of cells, which results in the overcharging of some cells and the undercharging of the others. To address this issue, we propose a consensus control method for the CC-CV charging of supercapacitors. In this approach, each cell can be seen as a node in the graph topology to communicate with their neighbors. The objective is to synchronize cell voltages in the CC charging stage and avoid overcharging and undercharging of cells. Experiments are set up to verify the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed method can synchronize cell voltages effectively in the CC-CV charging process.
