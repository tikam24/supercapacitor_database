In the present work, graphene powder was synthesized by laser scribing method. The resultant flexible light-scribed graphene is very appropriate for use in micro-supercapacitors. The effect of the laser scribing process in reducing graphene oxide (GO) was investigated. GO was synthesized using a chemical mixture of GO solution; then, it was coated onto a LightScribe DVD disk and laser scribed to reduce GO and create laser-scribed graphene (LSG). The CV curves of pristine rGO at various scan rates showed that the ultimate product possesses the ability to store energy at the supercapacitor level. Charge-discharge curves of pristine rGO at two different current densities indicated that the specific capacitance (Cm) increases due to the reduction of the discharge current density. Finally, the long-term charge-discharge stability of the LSG was plotted and indicates that the specific capacitance decreases very slightly from its primary capacitance of ~10F cm-3 and that the cyclic stability is favorable over 1000 cycles.
