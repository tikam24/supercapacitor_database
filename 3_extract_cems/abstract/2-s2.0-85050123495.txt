The majority of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are powered by on-board battery storage systems, lead- acid batteries being the most common technology. Although electrochemical capacitors store considerably less energy than batteries and are much more expensive, they can often provide lower ownership costs in AGV applications, primarily because of their very high cycle life and extremely long operational life. We examine application requirements needed to support economic use of electrochemical capacitor storage in AGVs. Performance details are reported for an AGV demonstration system that is powered by electrochemical capacitors.
