The preparations of electrodes with multi electron transport and porous and hierarchical structures are two critical strategies for the innovative development of electrochemical energy storage technology. In this study, free-standing polypyrrole/carbon nanotubes (PPY/CNTs) composite film was electrosynthesized at the interface between an HClO4 aqueous solution and a pyrrole chloroform solution through a dynamic three-phase interline electropolymerization (D3PIE) process. First, acid-oxidized carbon nanotubes were assembled at an HClO4/CHCl3 interface after mechanical agitation to form a CNTs network. Then, the CNTs network acted as "reinforcement bars" for the electropolymerization of PPY, resulting in the production of PPY/CNTs composite film at the interface. Results indicated that higher CNTs areal density could cause a faster radial growth of PPY at the CNTs network, namely a faster growth of "apparent area" of the composite film. The current-time curves of the electropolymerization demonstrated that there was an optimal areal density of CNTs network (0.082 Î¼g/mm2) to achieve the largest amount of polymerized PPY. SEM images showed that the prepared PPY/CNTs film exhibited significantly different microstructures between the side toward water and the side toward organic solvent. In addition, the prepared PPY/CNTs composite film exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with a high value of specific capacitance (350 F/g) and a good stability.
