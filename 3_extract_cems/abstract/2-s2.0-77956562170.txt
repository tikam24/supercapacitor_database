A monitoring circuit for individual photovoltaic (PV) panels in grid-connected systems is proposed, which exhibits a number of features devised to simplify and reduce cost of diagnostics and maintenance of the PV plant. In particular, the system is provided with an effective energy harvesting supply stage, which eliminates the requirement for external supply or batteries; furthermore, no cables are needed for data transfer due to the adoption of a rugged wireless connectivity.
