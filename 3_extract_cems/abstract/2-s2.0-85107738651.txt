Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are getting significant attention in the area of energy storage and conversion due to their unique physical, chemical, and electrical properties. Molybdenum dichalcogenides, particularly molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for energy storage devices. Many MoSe2-based compounds have been synthesized and studied for electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion, and sodium-ion batteries. In this review, we summarize the advances made in recent years on the MoSe2-based anode materials and highlight their outcomes in electrochemical storage applications. The electrochemical performance of different composites of MoSe2 is briefly reviewed. The relationship between different morphologies of MoSe2 and their electrochemical performance is also discussed. Also, the role of different supporting species in the MoSe2-based composites has been discussed in detail. Additionally, the positive and negative aspects of the different morphologies of MoSe2 and its composites are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and outlooks on the development of MoSe2 based anode material are proposed.
