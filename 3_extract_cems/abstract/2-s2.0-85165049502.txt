Layered double hydoxides (LDHs) as electrode materials for supercapacitors still suffer from unsatisfactory rate capability owing to their limited electrical conductivity and sluggish ion diffusion kinetics. In this work, a vacancy engineering strategy coupled with a nanocomposite method is proposed to construct oxygen vacancy (Ov)-rich CoAl-LDH nanosheets coupled with N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) using a one-step precipitation-reduction reaction. Experimental analyses and theoretical calculation results indicate that the rich Ov defects in CoAl-LDHs not only effectively enhance the electrical conductivity but also reduce the surface adsorption barrier of electrolyte ions, thereby triggering fast charge storage kinetics. In addition, Ov-rich CoAl-LDH nanosheets coupled with N-CNTs are well dispersed, which not only enrich electroactive sites but also further increase the charge transport. Consequently, the obtained N-CNT@Ov-CoAl-LDH nanocomposites demonstrate a specific capacity of 1068 C g−1 at 3 A g−1 and maintain a capacity retention of 78% even at 20 A g−1, together with a capacity retention of 91% after 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. This work provides insights for designing and engineering LDHs-based electrodes with improved charge storage performance through coupling the vacancy engineering with the nanocomposite method.
