Reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based materials have shown good performance as electrodes in flexible energy storage devices owing to their physical properties, high specific surface area, and excellent electrical conductivity. Here, a novel road is reported for fabricating high-performance supercapacitors based on 3D rGO electrodes and solid electrolyte multilayers via pressure spray printing and machine coating. These supercapacitors demonstrate high and adjustable volumetric capacitance, excellent flexibility, and stretchability. The results show that this commercial strategy has its essential merits such as low-cost, inexpensive, and simple fabrication for large area production. These properties are in the favor of fabricating high-performance supercapacitor to meet the practical energy demands in devices, especially flexible electronic devices. Furthermore, this novel 3D interdigital electrode concept can be widely applied to other energy devices for enhancing performances and to other micro devices for reducing cost.
