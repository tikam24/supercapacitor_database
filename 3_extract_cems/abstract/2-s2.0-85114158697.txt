In this work, we prepared N-doped reduced graphene oxide/Co0.85Se (N-rGO/CS) microflowers through a two-step method. Since introducing N-doped rGO, the fabricated N-rGO/CS electrode with a high mass loading (~8.83 mg/cm2) exhibits high areal specific capacity of 0.522 mAh/cm2 (4.24 F/cm2) at 1 mA/cm2, and a long-term cycling stability (85.8% of capacity retention after 6000 charge-discharge cycles). This is mainly because N-doped rGO can increase specific area and electrical conductivity, enhance the electrochemical activity and effectively facilitate the electron/ion transport between the electrode and electrolyte. Besides, the quasi-solid-state hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) assembled by the N-rGO/CS delivers a high volumetric specific capacity of 5.82 mAh/cm3 at 1 mA/cm2, excellent energy density of 4.65 mWh/cm3 under 10.5 mW/cm3 and eminement cycle stability (87.6% retention over 6000 cycles at 10 mA/cm2).
