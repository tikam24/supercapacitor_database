A new and applicable method for the synthesis of flower-like NiCo2O4 was developed based on the electrochemical method of chronoamperometry and subsequent heat treatment. This synthesis involved electrochemical deposition of nickel and cobalt hydroxide on ERGO/Ni-NiO and heat treatment for conversion of hydroxide to oxide. The crystalline structure and electrochemical performance of flower-like 3D NiCo2O4 were manipulated by varying the potential of deposition. The optimized nanocomposite at the potential of âˆ’1.0 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) had the highest surface area (85 m2/g). The smart combination of NiCo2O4 and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) on nickel-nickel oxide (Ni-NiO) foam showed a remarkable synergy effect and demonstrated a high specific capacitance and cycling stability improved performance. This new material not only exhibited a specific capacitance of over 2461 F/g, but after 4000 cycles, it maintains 94% of its specific capacitance.
