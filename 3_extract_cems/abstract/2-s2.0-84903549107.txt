We report an effective route for the preparation of layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with uniformly coated polyaniline (PANI) layers. These nanocomposites are synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of layered rGO. SEM, TEM, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy analysis results demonstrated that reduced graphene oxide-polyaniline (rGO-PANI) nanocomposites are successfully synthesized. Because of synergistic effects, rGO-PANI nanocomposites prepared by this approach exhibit excellent capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 286 F g-1 and high cycle reversibility of 94 % after 2000 cycles. Not just a flash in the PANI: An effective route for the preparation of layered reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with uniformly coated polyaniline (PANI) layers is reported. The nanocomposites are synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of layered rGO. Through synergistic effects, the rGO-PANI nanocomposites exhibit excellent capacitive performance with a high specific capacitance and high cycle reversibility. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
