With increase in demands of electronic devices there is a spike in the field of power management and efficiency. For this development of low power consuming devices with maximum efficiency is necessary. One of the major components of major electronic devices is capacitor. To enhance the charge storing capabilities we use super-capacitors instead. Though this holds a major drawback of high resistance. Researches are being carried out to increase the efficiency of super-capacitors. This paper presents the effect of various binders on the working of super-capacitors. Binders play roles of binding active material and conductive agent together and also cohering with electrode. The role of the binder should provide enough strengthen during the electrode formation and appropriate pore sizes. Hence effects of various percentages of binders on capacitance and equivalent series resistance values is studied in this paper.
