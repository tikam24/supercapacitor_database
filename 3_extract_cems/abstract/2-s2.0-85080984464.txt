The Ni3Se2 grown on nickel foam (Ni3Se2@Ni) with irregular film, nanowire arrays and microsphere morphologies were successfully synthesized using different reagents via simple one-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Ni3Se2@Ni can be used as the electrode for supercapacitor directly without further processing, and the results showed that the Ni3Se2 with the morphologies of irregular film, nanowire arrays and microsphere exhibited the specific capacitance of 1.26 F/cm2 (504 F/g), 1.48 F/cm2 (592 F/g) and 2.04 F/cm2 (816 F/g) at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 3 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. Comparing the electrochemical performance of Ni3Se2@Ni electrode with different morphologies, the Ni3Se2 microsphere displayed better electrochemical performance, which exhibited the long-term stability with 85.5% of specific capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. The results indicated that the as-prepared Ni3Se2@Ni can be used as a promising electrode for energy storage devices.
