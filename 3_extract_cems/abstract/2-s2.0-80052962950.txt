A novel electrode of nickel-doped mesoporous carbon (NMC) is prepared from furfuryl alcohol and firstly developed for use in electrochemical capacitors. The electrochemical performance of NMC/AC capacitor is systematically investigated and characterized by BET and BJH methods for determining surface area and pore size distribution, respectively. This new NMC/AC shows a high specific capacitance, high energy and power density due to its large surface area and bulk conductivity. Its electrochemical characteristics are investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge-discharge (C/D) tests. The NMC/AC has a specific capacitance of 144.3 Fg-1, higher than that of a pure activated carbon (AC)-based EDLC (ca. 105 Fg-1). It can be a promising candidate for a new energy storage material for supercapacitor. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
