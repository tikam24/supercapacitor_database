Rational design of composite electrode materials with novel nanostructures plays an important role in improving both high energy density and structure stability of flexible and wearable supercapacitors. Herein, numerous peculiar three-dimensional hierarchical core-shell CuCo2O4@Co(OH)2 nanoflakes directly grown on Ni foam are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent electrodeposition technique. Ultrathin Co(OH)2 nanosheets arrays vertically anchored on CuCo2O4 nanoflakes can not only improve the electrical conductivity, but also provide interconnected channels for ion diffusion and enrich electrochemical active sites to boost faradaic redox reaction, leading to the enhanced electrochemical behavior. Excellent electrochemical performance of CuCo2O4@Co(OH)2 electrode can be reflected on a higher specific capacitance of 1558 F/g and lower resistance compared with that of the pristine CuCo2O4 electrode. The asymmetric flexible supercapacitor assembled by the optimized CuCo2O4@Co(OH)2 electrode and activated carbon exhibits high energy density of 62.5 Wh/kg at 893 W/kg, outstanding cycle stability of 88.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles and remarkable mechanical flexibility, performing the best electrochemical behavior among various metal oxides based asymmetric supercapacitors. All above results indicate that the resulted hierarchical core-shell CuCo2O4@Co(OH)2 electrode can be a promising candidate for flexible energy storage devices.
