The current problem of the relatively low energy density and cycling stability of supercapacitors can be effectively addressed by designing an all-solid-state high performance asymmetric supercapacitor (ASSCs) using chemically deposited beta-manganese oxide (β-MnO2) as a positive active electrode and orthorhombic-tin sulfide (O-SnS) as a negative electrode material on a stainless steel (SS) substrate with a poly(vinyl alcohol)-lithium perchlorate (PVA-LiClO4) solid gel polymer electrolyte and as a separator. Time-dependent surface morphological modification and its subsequent effect on electrochemical performance of the O-SnS negative electrode has been examined. Electrodes prepared at deposition time periods of 120, 240, and 360 min provide specific surface areas (SSA) of 36.7, 78.3, and 65.6 m2 g-1, respectively. Superior nanostructures of both the β-MnO2 and O-SnS electrodes offer high specific capacitance (Cs) of 994 and 1203 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and energy and power densities (ED and PD) of 83.3, 69.2 Wh kg-1 and 10 and 1.8 kWh kg-1, respectively. A fabricated ASSCs device exhibits Cs of 122 F g-1, ED of 29.8 Wh kg-1, and PD of 1.25 kWh kg-1, with capacity retention of 95.3% up to 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Impressively, such two series assembled ASSCs can light up light-emitting diodes (LEDs) after 30 s of charge.
