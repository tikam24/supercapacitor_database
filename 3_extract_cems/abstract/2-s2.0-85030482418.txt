A novel Ni-based Coordination Supramolecular Network (CSN) combining with three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide hybrid monolith (Ni-pda@3DrGO, pda = pyridine-2, 3-dicarboxylate) is fabricated by a facile one-pot surfactant-free method for the first time, and the electrochemical performances of the composite are investigated. The Ni-pda@3DrGO exhibits excellent electrochemical performance (952.85 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) which is much higher than that of the pure Ni-pda and the composite prepared by physically mixing. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated based on the Ni-pda@3DrGO and activated carbon (AC) with an energy density of 17.70 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 1500 W kg−1. The results demonstrate the great potentials of Ni-pda@3DrGO as electrode materials for supercapacitors. As a proof of concept, two other hybrid monoliths (Ni(quin-2-c)2(H2O)2@3DrGO, Co2(μ2-H2O)(na)4·DMF@3DrGO) have also been fabricated via the same route, implying the proposed method can be further extended to fabricate other Coordination Supramolecular Networks and 3D graphene hybrid monoliths.
