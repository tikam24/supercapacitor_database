Hexapod-like two dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide nickel diselenide (NiSe2) structures was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal approach and investigated its electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode for the first time. The obtained material was characterized by XRD, XPS and TEM analysis. The results confirmed the presence of orthorhombic phase of NiSe2 in the synthesized hexapod-like NiSe2 structures. The fabricated NiSe2 electrode on graphite foil exhibited a specific capacitance of 75 F g-1 with good cyclic retention of 94% at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Our results indicate that the synthesized hexapod-like NiSe2 structures hold as a promising candidate for the supercapacitor applications.
