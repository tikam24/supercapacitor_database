Cobalt oxide (Co3O4) and magnesium cobaltite (MgCo2O4) thin films have been deposited on glass substrates using a sol–gel spin coating method. The influence of the magnesium ions incorporation into cobalt oxide on the physical properties of the samples has been investigated by various techniques. The XRD pattern reveals the successful synthesis and spinel cubic structure of synthesized thin films. The FESEM and AFM analysis showed the smooth and crack-free spherical morphology of MgCo2O4 and its roughness parameters. The optical studies of thin films revealed the presence of two direct band gap energies (1.58 and 2.25 eV for Co3O4, 1.62 and 2.45 eV for MgCo2O4) values, which increase due to Mg2+ substitution in the Co3O4 spinel structure. The wettability measurement indicates that the MgCo2O4 thin film exhibits hydrophobic behavior with water contact angle of ~109°. The electrochemical behavior of the films has been analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) methods. The MgCo2O4/FTO and Co3O4/FTO electrodes showed areal capacitance values of 136, and 57 mF cm−2 at the current density of 2 mA cm−2 and excellent capacitance retention of 93.50% after 3000 charge–discharge cycles for MgCo2O4/FTO sample owing to its high conductivity, the fast electrons and ions transportation, and the synergistic effect between Mg and Co ions. Therefore, Mg can be a suitable substitute for Co in Co3O4 spinel structure, making it possible to increase the electrochemical areal capacitance. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
