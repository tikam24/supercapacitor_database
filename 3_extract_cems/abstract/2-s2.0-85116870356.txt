Iron oxide (β-FeOOH) nanoparticles were prepared by a simple precipitation method assisted by ultrasound at room temperature. Formation of phase pure β-FeOOH material was confirmed through the Reitveld refined XRD and FTIR analysis. The β-FeOOH nanoparticles prepared was found to have a narrow size distribution range with an average particle size of 138 nm. The optical band gap of the material was found to be 2.6 eV. The electrochemical performance of β-FeOOH was studied in a three electrode system using β-FeOOH coated on graphite sheet as the working electrode. The Ag/AgCl and platinum was used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The KOH in distilled water was used as the aqueous electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the above material at a high current density of 1 A/g for 1 M, 3 M and 5 M aqueous KOH electrolyte was found to be 68.66, 138.67 and 88.17 F/g, respectively.
