MXene is new and exceptional type of two-dimensional nanomaterial. Unique MXene nanomaterial possesses high surface area, charge movement, and mechanical/thermal constancy. The state-of-the art review emphases consequences of MXene incorporation on nanocomposite characteristics. The polymer/MXene nanocomposites have been designed using various techniques such as in situ polymerization, solution method, and other techniques. The electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, and physical properties of polymer/MXene nanocomposites are found to progress. Consequently, primary focus of article is placed to give an integrated overview of polymer/MXene nanocomposites alongwith synthesis, essential properties, and applications in supercapacitor, electromagnetic defense, membrane, and biomedical sectors.
