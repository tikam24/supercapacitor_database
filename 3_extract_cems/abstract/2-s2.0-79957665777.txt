The compatibilities between LiODFB/LiPF6-based electrolyte and activated carbon (AC) electrode material in supercapacitor system were investigated. The results show that addition of LiPF6 obviously enhances conductance of electrolyte. The favorable compatibility between LiODFB/LiPF6-based electrolyte and AC electrode is exhibited. However, high concentration of LiPF6 restrains the performance of double-layer capacitance. Addition of a small quantity of LiPF6 can increase capacities effectively. When additional concentration of LiPF6 is 0.2 mol/L, the device's capacity reaches the most, and higher than that of pure LiODFB-based electrolyte, and the maintaining rate of capacity exceeds 96% after 1500 times cycles.
