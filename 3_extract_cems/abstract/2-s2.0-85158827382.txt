In this study, graphene oxide was synthesized by the Hummers method. Reduced graphene oxide was obtained by the hydrothermal method. Then, silver-doped Reduced Graphene Oxide/Polyaniline (Ag-doped rGO/PANI) composites were synthesized. Some physical analyzes of the synthesized composite materials were made. In the XRD examination, it was understood that the materials generally have polyaniline properties. Electrochemical properties were investigated with electrodes prepared from these composites. Specific capacitance, energy, and power density values were calculated from these measurements. The specific capacitance was measured in the range of 0.5–30 A/g and the highest capacitance value was found to be 379 F/g. From these results, the material containing approximately 17 mass percent silver doped reduced graphene oxide gave better results among composite materials. This composite was the most stable material with results of 286–317 F/g at all applied currents. In addition, a coin cell application was made for this example and its measurements were taken.
