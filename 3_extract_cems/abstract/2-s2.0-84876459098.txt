Interleaving techniques are widely used to reduce input/output ripples, to increase the efficiency and to increase the power capacity of the DC/DC converters. This paper proposes an interleaved multiple-input power converter (IMIPC) that interfaces the fuel cell and energy storage systems (e.g. Batteries or/and Supercapacitors) to the powertrain of the hybrid electric vehicles. The IMIPC is responsible for the power-flow management on-board vehicle for each operating mode. In this research, the IMIPC is proposed in order to reduce the input current ripples, to reduce the output voltage ripples and to reduce the size of passive components with high efficiency. In addition, low EMI and low stress in the switches are expected. Moreover, a generalized small-signal model of the IMIPC is derived in order to design the closed-loop control strategies. The proposed power electronics interface (PEI) and its controller are designed and analyzed by using Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed power electronics interface achieves a high performance for high power converter and it can be applied in the FCHEVs. Â© 2011 IEEE.
