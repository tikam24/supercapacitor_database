In the power market, the reasonable configuration of the energy storage (ES) system can improve the reliability and economy of the active distribution network system. First, the stepped multiprice and multitime demand side response (DSM) model is proposed. Second, the energy type and the power type energy storage device are used together. The supercapacitor device is used to stabilize the fluctuation of the distributed power source. The lithium iron phosphate battery is used to reduce the power shortage rate of the load. At the same time, line loss is considered in the optimization goal. The location and capacity of the hybrid energy storage device are discussed. Finally, the time-of-use tariff policy is considered, the power compensation cost of the interruptible load is calculated, the DSM policy is introduced, and the joint planning with the ES system is realized.
