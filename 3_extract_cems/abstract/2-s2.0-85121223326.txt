Performance of emergent energy storage devices like supercapacitor or batteries is based on morphology-dependent electrochemical properties of the electrode material. Hence, research interest toward spinel structure family of mixed transition metal oxides (MTMOs) is felicitous to achieve enhanced energy storage capacity. In general, transition metal oxides have unique morphologies that influence its use in various energy applications. Moreover, MTMOs show specific morphologies such as nanoplatelets, spherical nanoparticles, microspheres, nanorods, and tetragonal or hexagonal nanosheets. MTMOs are promising electrode materials because of their multiple oxidation states. Hybridization of MTMOs with graphene improves electrical conductivity and enhances the specific surface area for the faradaic redox reaction. In this chapter, MTMOs are described as active electrode materials for energy storage devices like supercapacitor and lithium-ion battery with a comprehensive study on their chemical synthesis approach.
