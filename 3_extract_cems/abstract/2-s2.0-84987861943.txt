Porous cobalt oxide materials have received great interest in recent years due to their potential application to supercapacitors. In this work, porous Co3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by the thermolysis of a Co(ii)-based [Co3(cis-chhc)(H2O)6]n (cis-H6chhc = 1,2,3,4,5,6-cyclohexane-hexacarboxylic acid) metal-organic framework. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements were carried out to characterize the electrochemical performance of Co3O4 in a 2.0 M KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrate that the as-synthesized Co3O4 can be applied as a supercapacitor electrode. The porous Co3O4 electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 148 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and displays slightly enhanced capacitance after 2500 continuous charge-discharge cycles. This remarkable electrochemical performance suggests that the as-prepared porous Co3O4 material is potentially promising for applications in energy storage.
