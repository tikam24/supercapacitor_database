MWCNT/NiCo2S4 nanocomposite is designed as core/shell hybrid nanostructure to be used as electrode material for supercapacitor application. NiCo2S4 is grown on the surface of acid functionalized MWCNT by two step hydrothermal process. The MWCNT serves as an effective support for NiCo2S4 due to their open mesoporous tubular readily accessible surface areas. Using the excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical stability of MWCNT and excellent pseudocapacitive property of NiCo2S4 the as-synthesized MWCNT/NiCo2S4 exhibits excellent supercapacitive performances in 6 M KOH, including high specific capacitance of 1423.7 F/g at 2.5 A/g, excellent rate capability of 70.9% as current density increase from 2.5 to 25 A/g and excellent cycle stability of 81.4% after 4000 cycles of charge discharge by applying a constant current density of 10 A/g. This impressive results show great promise of ternary metal sulfide and MWCNT core/shell nanohybrid in future energy storage applications.
