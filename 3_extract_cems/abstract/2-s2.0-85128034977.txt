Owing to the exceptional properties of carbon-based nanostructures, intensive studies have been carried out on the emerging two-dimensional materials that offer a palette of properties for realizing novel devices. In the past several years, an elegant exfoliation approach has been used to successfully create a new family of two-dimensional transition metal carbides. Specifically, MXenes have been added as a young star to the two-dimensional materials realm with unique layered structure and surface terminations. In the past 2 years, research on MXenes had a significant increase concerning their interesting properties and applications so that more than 90 different compositions are predicted till now. Their superior properties bring their credibility to various fields, and still, there is a huge avenue existing for developing new types of MXenes with unique features. In this chapter, we begin with short introduction of MXenes, followed by synthesis and surface modification section. The intriguing physiochemical and fascinating properties of MXenes including electronic, magnetic, optical, and biological are finely detailed in the midsection. Finally, its candidacy in notable fields of electronic and biomedical applications is discussed with concluding remarks. We hope that this chapter will be a useful guide to both theoreticians and experimentalists who are exploring MXenes in the field of electronics ranging from semiconductor devices, solar cells, supercapacitors, transistors, biomedical sensors, and therapeutic and theranostic applications of this relatively new, but quickly expanding MXenes.
