This study suggests a novel investment strategy for sizing a supercapacitor in a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) for frequency regulation. In this progress, presents hybrid operation strategy considering lifespan of the BESS. This supercapacitor-battery hybrid system can slow down the aging process of the BESS. However, the supercapacitors are relatively expensive and have a self-discharging rate of nearly 40% per day. Therefore, finding the optimal size of a supercapacitor contributes to prolonging the lifespan of the BESS at an effective cost. In the proposed operation strategy, this paper estimates the lifespan at the given supercapacitor size using an innovative variable capacity model (VCM). Because this model does not use the current and voltage characteristics to calculate the lifespan of the BESS and uses measured lifespan data sets, this method has the advantages of making quick investment decisions. It is shown through simulation that the VCM gives more realistic results than the conventional fixed capacity model estimating a battery lifespan with achievable cycle count curves. Moreover, the net benefits of the supercapacitor were measured through benefit and cost analysis and net present value analysis for the supercapacitor size in the BESS. Through this paper, frequency regulation service is considered as the application target for the proposed strategy.
