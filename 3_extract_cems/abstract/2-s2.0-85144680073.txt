In this study, a novel reduced graphene oxide, indium (III) oxide, and molybdenum disulfide (rGO/In2O3/MoS2) ternary composite for supercapacitor electrode application was developed via green hydrothermal synthesis. The topography, morphology, crystalline structure, phase identification and molecular structure of the composites were examined by applying Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD), and Raman Spectroscopy. SEM and TEM reveal the uniform dispersion of In2O3 nanoparticles on the rGO/MoS2 nanosheets. EDX and XRD analysis confirmed the coexistences of rGO, In2O3, and MoS2, and hence the composite formation. Electrochemical performance of the rGO/In2O3/MoS2 electrode was investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 1 M sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) aqueous electrolyte. The electrochemical results reveal that the rGO/In2O3/MoS2 composite electrodes exhibit enhanced specific capacitance of 77 F/g at 25 mV/s scan rate, a modest 29% enhancement over pure In2O3 and In2O3/MoS2 binary composite electrodes.
