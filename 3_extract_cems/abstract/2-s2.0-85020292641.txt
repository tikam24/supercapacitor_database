The amorphous mesoporous Ni(OH)2 hollow spheres (Ni(OH)2-HSs) with waxberry-like morphology were fabricated by using a facile hydrothermal method with poly(styrene-acrylic acid) spheres as the template, followed by extraction of the template. In the hydrothermal process, Ni(NO3)2⋅6H2O was employed as the precursor of Ni(OH)2. SEM, TEM, XPS, XRD, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm techniques were used to characterize the structure and morphology of Ni(OH)2-HSs. The obtained Ni(OH)2-HSs have a uniform morphology with an average diameter of 300 nm and shell thickness of about 25 nm. The mesoporous shells of the Ni(OH)2-HSs are composed of amorphous Ni(OH)2 particles. When used as an electrode, the as-prepared Ni(OH)2-HSs exhibit pseudocapacitive behavior with a high specific capacitance of 2559 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 and a good capacitance retention of 91.8% after 1000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. These results suggest promising applications of the waxberry-like amorphous Ni(OH)2 hollow spheres in electrode materials for supercapacitors.
