Imperative urgency to substitute outdated combustion engines with safer, faster and efficient energy storage devices and conversion systems has inspired researchers to realize new energy storage materials with high performance. In this work, a facile hydrothermal technique with subsequent calcination procedure has been adopted to prepare Cu-Ni-Co (CNCo) based trimetallic oxide nanowires over carbon cloth (CC). Hierarchical mesoporous CNCo arrays on conducting scaffold delivers excellent supercapacitive performance with specific capacitance as high as 2535 Fg-1 at current density of 1 Ag-1 and excellent rate capability of 94% at 5 Ag-1 even after 5000 cycles. To judge the figure of merit of CNCo electrode, results are compared with the synthesized one-dimensional binary and monoxides nanoform over same platform namely nickel cobalt oxide (NCo) and cobalt oxide (Co). Utility of CNCo as robust and potential electrode material is further assessed by fabricating CNCo based symmetric supercapacitor. Specific energy of 39 Wh/kg at specific power of 0.45 KW/kg and extraordinary cyclic stability (capacitance retention more than 100% after 10000 cycles) register from the fabricated device. Coordination of metal ions strengthens the synergistic effect which affects the rate of redox charge transfer and thereby improves the cyclic stability and rate capability.
