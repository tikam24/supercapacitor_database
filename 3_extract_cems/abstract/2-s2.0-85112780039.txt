Structure design and elements doping are two common ways to promote the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. Herein, we successfully prepared a new tremella-like nickel-cobalt selenide with porous and ultra-thin nanosheets through a simple two-step hydrothermal method using SiO2 template ((Ni,Co)Se2-T). Tremella-like structure can augment the electrode material's active surface area, that is propitious to the rapid transmission of ions. At the same time, selenization can reduce the resistance and elevate the conductivity. The (Ni,Co)Se2-T electrode shows a specific capacity of 636.2 C g−1 during 1 A g−1 and 420.5 C g−1 at 20 A g−1, showing magnificent capacity as well as rate performance. Furthermore, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor shows an uncommon energy density of 53.7 Wh kg−1 which exceeds most of the nickel cobalt selenide devices during the power density of 822.5 W kg−1. After 10,000 times charge and discharge processes, the capacitor retention still maintains 86.1%. Impressively, fifteen red light emitting diode (LED) bulbs could illuminate for more than 30 min, which fully proves the great potential of this capacitor material in practical application.
