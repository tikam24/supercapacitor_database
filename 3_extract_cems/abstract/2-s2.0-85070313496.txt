With the increase of new energy permeability, photovoltaic power generation is widely used, but because of its own volatility and intermittent, it will lead to uncontrollable power generation and large fluctuation of grid-connected power.Hydrogen energy is a green and efficient way of energy storage.Hybrid energy storage system combined with super-capacitor can better realize photovoltaic grid-connected.This paper established a photo-hydrogen-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system, contained electrolyzer, fuel cells and supercapacitor, and proposed a power coordination control strategy which ensure that the DC bus voltage is stable when PV is excessive or insufficient output or not worked on the rainy days or nights. Simulation proves the effectiveness of this system, and the maximum utilization of solar energy resources is realized.
