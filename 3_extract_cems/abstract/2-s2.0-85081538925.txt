Specific surface area and electrical conductivity are two decisive factors affecting materials properties. As a potential energy material, MoO3 is still limited in research and application due to its inherent defects. Ag nanoparticles with good electrical conductivity and unique small-size effect are predicted to have more hopeful prospects in energy storage. Ag@MoO3 composites with different Ag content were successfully prepared by a simple liquid-phase reduction method. The results show that the Ag@MoO3 composite has good morphology and the maximum capacitance (225 F/g) when the content of Ag is 8%. Notably, the internal resistance and Warberg resistance of the composite compared with that of MoO3 have been greatly reduced. It is mainly due to the high ion conductivity and small-size effect of Ag nanoparticles, which effectively improve the diffusion efficiency of ions between electrolyte and active materials. Practical application feasibility of Ag@MoO3 electrode was tested in the two-electrode system. Symmetrical coin cell supercapacitor using 8% Ag@MoO3 as electrodes has superior performance. Our work has potential reference value for the combination and characterization of energy storage materials.
