One of the problems with hybrid electric vehicles is the size and weight limits. Therefore, we have to reduce the size and weight of the equipment used in the hybrid electric vehicles to reach low cost, small, efficient, and reliable design. Magnetic components are one of the bulky parts in this type of vehicles. These magnetic components, in this case are inductors, are used to filter the switching ripple on each input and output of the power electronic converters. Consequently, employing coupled inductors in the structure of power electronic converters, leads to more saving in the size, weight, and cost of the magnetic. In this paper, a new magnetic structure based dc/dc converter for hybrid energy storage system covering battery, ultra-capacitor, and Photovoltaic system is designed.
