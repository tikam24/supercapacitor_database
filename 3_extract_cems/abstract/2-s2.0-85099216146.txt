In this report, we incorporate activated carbon (AC) onto aluminum substrate via doctor blade method to produce an all-solid-state supercapacitor. The electrochemical properties of the all-solid-state supercapacitor were characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests also were carried out to exhibit stability of the AC-based supercapacitor. The impedance and charge/discharge curves of the all-solid-state supercapacitor showed good capacitive behavior after functionalized AC. The highest specific capacitance obtained for the AC-based supercapacitor was 106 F gâˆ’1. About 160% of specific capacitance increased after functionalization of the AC, which indicated that modification of the AC by nitric acid was able to introduce functional groups on the AC and improve its electrochemical performances.
