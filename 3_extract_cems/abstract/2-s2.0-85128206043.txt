During the voyage of electric ships, the propulsion motor frequently stops and restarts, and causes high current discharge of the battery, thus affecting its cycle life and ship range. Focusing on this problem, the hybrid energy storage method of super capacitor and lithium iron phosphate battery is adopted, and the energy management of the hybrid energy storage system is carried out by model predictive control. Firstly, the mathematical model of lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor is established, and the capacity configuration of the hybrid energy storage system is estimated according to the ship sailing demand; Based on the demand power of typical working conditions of ship sailing, the online optimization of system power allocation is carried out by combining with the framework of model predictive control algorithm. The simulation model of the hybrid energy storage system of the ship is built in MATLAB/Simulink using the energetic macroscopic representation. The simulation results show that the energy management strategy based on model predictive control is effective in suppressing the effects of current fluctuations and high current discharge on the cycle life of Li-ion power batteries.
