A ternary electrode material, based on graphene, tin oxide (SnO 2) and polypyrrole (PPy) was obtained via one-pot synthesis. The graphene/SnO 2/PPy (GSP) nanocomposite is composed of a thin conducting film of PPy on the surface of graphene/SnO 2 (GS). An enhanced specific capacitance (616 F g -1) of GSP was obtained at 1 mV s -1 in 1 M H 2SO 4 compared with GS (80.2 F g -1) and PPy (523 F g -1). The GSP electrode shows better cycle stability and no obvious decay after 1000 galvanostatic cycles at 1 A g -1. Its specific power density and energy density can reach 9973.26 W kg -1, and 19.4 W h kg -1, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance arises from the well-designed structure advantages, the good combination of components and the synergistic effect between the three components. Well-dispersed graphene is used as a framework for sustaining the pseudocapacitive materials of SnO 2 and PPy. The PPy film restricts the aggregation and volume change of SnO 2 during charge-discharge cycling, and also enhances the surface area. The electrochemical results show that the ternary composite of GSP is a promising candidate electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.Â© 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
