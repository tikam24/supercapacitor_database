The current study focuses on an alternative strategy for producing nanoparticles (NPs) using one-step electrochemical discharge process (ECDP) in different electrolyte mediums. Current and plasma discharge effects on morphology and mass output rate were examined in detail. FE-SEM and TEM results show dimensional control materials such as rod, flower and rice shapes are produced. The XRD, EDS, UV-vis and Raman characterization techniques confirm the formation of CuO-ZnO NPs with different morphology. The use of two semiconductors (n-type ZnO and p-type CuO) in combination have two different band energies may boost electrochemical performance. From the electrochemical study, the flower-shaped structure has high specific capacity (313 F/g at 2 A/g current density), with 84.1% retention capacitance after 5000 cycles. This study allows us to study the discharge-based composite formation, which could be used in supercapacitors.
