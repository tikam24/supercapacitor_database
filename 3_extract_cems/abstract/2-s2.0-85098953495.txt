With a drastic increase in population growth, energy consumption has increased unprecedentedly. The exploitation of fossil fuels, for energy supply, has led to its uncontrolled depletion. The need for the development of renewable energy sources has turned out to be the need of the hour. Further, the menace of climate change, global warming, and environmental pollution must be tackled simultaneously. The abundance of biomass and its immense potential as a renewable source of energy makes it a suitable alternative to be used for energy production, conversion, and storage. The thermal treatment of biomass, via methods such as gasification and pyrolysis, yields biochar, bio-oil, and syngas. These are excellent sources of clean energy. Biochar is used as a catalyst for pyrolysis, syngas production, and trans-esterification. The biochar-based materials are used for technologies like fuel cells, super capacitors, and batteries. Biomass-derived materials could, therefore, help in energy production, conversion, and storage, which would help us in sustainable development and making our world energy secure.
