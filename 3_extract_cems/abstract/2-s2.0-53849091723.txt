Composite electrode consisting of carbon nanofiber (CNF) and cobalt oxide was prepared for supercapacitor electrode, and its electrochemical property was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetric results for the composite electrode showed it had specific capacitance value of 420 F/g at 5 mV/s, which was higher than capacitance value of 180 F/g for the bare CNF. It is concluded that the capacitive property of CNF can be improved by coating cobalt oxide on it to increase the surface area of cobalt oxide.
