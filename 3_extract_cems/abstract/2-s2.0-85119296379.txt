The performance of the supercapacitor is influenced by the pore distribution on the electrode surface and the conductivity, mobility, ion size properties of the electrolyte to achieve a high specific capacitance value. Carbon electrodes are synthesized from Nipah fruit coir (NFC) biomass through a pre-carbonization process, chemical activation by varying the molarity of KOH of 0.2 M, 0.3 M, and 0.4 M, and the pyrolysis process. The electrochemical properties of supercapacitor cells are analyzed using the cyclic voltammetry method with an electrolyte solution of sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide which is testing through an asymmetrical two-electrode system. The results showed that the increase in the performance of supercapacitor cells occurred in the electrolyte in an acidic environment with the highest specific capacitance value of 214.31 F/g compared to the electrolyte in an basic environment with the highest specific capacitance value of 164.54 F/g. The results of the analysis of electrochemical properties indicate that carbon electrodes made from Nipah fruit coir biomass can be a suitable material for energy storage applications.
