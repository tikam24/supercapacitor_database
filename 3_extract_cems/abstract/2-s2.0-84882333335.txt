Li1.2(Mn0.32Ni0.32Fe0.16)O 2(LMNFO) nanoparticles with and without a chelating agent (adipic acid) weresynthesized by sol-gel method. The supercapacitive behaviors of the synthesized materials as a cathodeare evaluated with activated carbon (AC) as the anode in a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) configurationutilizing a non-aqueous electrolyte. The structural, morphological and electrochemical features of theprepared materials are investigated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and cyclicvoltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge studies, respectively. The results demonstrated that the LMNFOnanoparticles prepared with the chelating agent, adipic acid (AA), delivered an enhanced specific dis-charge capacitance (86 F g-1) and better cycling stability than the native compound. The CV studies alsorevealed the same conclusions, based on the stronger current response observed during various scanrates between 0 and 3 V. Moreover, the AA-LMNFO/AC cell delivered maximum energy and power den-sities of 36 Wh kg-1and 1.67 W kg-1, respectively, with a columbic efficiency of over 99% and excellentrate performance.
