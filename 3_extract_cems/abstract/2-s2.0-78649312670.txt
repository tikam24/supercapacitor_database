A matching design for the cooperation of super-capacitor and Lithium-ion battery in electric wheel motors is proposed in this paper. This concept is originated with anticipation of grasping the power delivery through the control of switching time between the super-capacitor and lithium-ion battery, by which the excessive energy of lithium-ion battery can be dissipated to each cell such that the battery equalizer can be reached, while the super-capacitor is meanwhile served as the energy-recycling device to accomplish the energy-saving goal. This proposed approach has been realized as the laboratory prototype, by which the simulations are validated with satisfactory test results. Â© 2010 SICE.
