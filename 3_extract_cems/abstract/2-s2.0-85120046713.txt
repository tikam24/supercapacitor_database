La0.75Sr0.25Cr0.5Mn0.5O3 (LSCM)/graphene oxide (GO)-based composite electrodes are developed for energy storage applications. LSCM was synthesized by solution combustion method and GO by improved Hummers’ method. Synthesized active materials at appropriate ratios (GO and LSCM) were mixed in polyvinylidene fluoride by vacuum centrifuge mixing (VCM) to prepare a composite dispersion of GO and LSCM which was coated on porous Ni foam using the VCM. The effect of GO content on specific capacitance (Csp) of LSCM was studied by varying GO content from 1 to 7 wt%. Both as-synthesized perovskite and GO were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3 M KOH. CV measurements revealed that LSCM electrode showed maximum Csp of 751 Fg−1 at 1 mVs−1. By increasing GO content from 0 to 5 wt % in composite electrodes, Csp was increased from 751 to 1223 Fg−1, respectively. Further, evaluation of CV results revealed that predominant charge storage mechanism of electrodes was Faradic in nature which exhibited distinct redox peaks. EIS revealed that LSCM-5%GO electrode showed the lowest solution resistance, charge transfer resistance and highest double layer capacitance among other electrodes. Furthermore, the LSCM-5%GO electrode showed 93% charge retention after 3000 charge–discharge cycles.
