Although Ni-P based metal phosphides have high theoretical specific capacity, the poor rate capability and cycling stability hinder their practical application. Herein, we report bimetallic phosphosulfide Zn-Ni-P-S 2D nanosheets (ZNPS) by introduction of Zn cations and S anions into Ni-P metal phosphides, and they exhibit high rate capability and cycling stability in an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor. The as-prepared ZNPS electrode shows a high specific capacity of 1180 C g-1 at 2 A g-1 in a three-electrode system. The ZNPS utilized in a two-electrode system shows a high energy density of 29.01 W h kg-1 at a power density of 275.54 W kg-1 and outstanding cycling stability (100% capacity retention after 15000 cycles) and superior rate capability (94.99% capacity retention when the current density increases from 0.2 A g-1 up to 1 A g-1). The simple and new strategy for ZNPS synthesis opens a path to design new electrode materials for aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors with an impressive performance.
