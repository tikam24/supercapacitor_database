In the present work flower like Mn-Co mixed metal oxide electrode materials were successfully synthesized by simple, low cost electrodeposition method on stainless steel substrates. Different volume ratio of Mn-Co was used to attempt enhancement in the supercapacitive properties of electrode material. Structural, morphological and wettability properties of synthesized electrodes were carried out using XRD, RAMAN, FE-SEM and Contact Angle Measurement techniques. Electrochemical properties of electrodeposited Mn-Co mixed metal oxide at three different volume variation such as 50-50, 60-40 and 70-30 electrodes were analyzed by using cyclic voltammetry, galvonostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 1 M NaOH aqueous electrolyte. The Mn-Co:60-40 composition shows maximum specific capacitance which is 679 F/g at scan rate 5 mV/sec. Charge discharge studies gives 95% columbic efficiency. Impedance spectroscopy reveals capacitive behavior and gives series resistance ∼0.19 ohm and combined internal resistance ∼0.89 ohm. The 80% retention of specific capacitance after the 1000 cycles. The synergistic effect of Mn-Co mixed metal oxide electrode having good conductivity, large surface area and improved charge transportation than individual electrode material leads to enhancing supercapacitor performance of electrode material for its practical application.
