The electrical energy storage technologies play major roles in electric vehicles (EVs). They are key source of power to the electric motors. The available electrical energy may be stored in various domains, electrochemical, electrical, chemical, thermal and mechanical. The electrochemical storage devices are primary and secondary batteries. The electrical storage devices are ultracapacitors and chemical are fuel cells. These three methods are popularly employed in modern EVs. There are various challenges existing with each type of energy storage technologies. Out of all, the electrochemical, electrical and chemical storage technologies are mainly to be focused. In this paper, the key challenges with all these three technologies are clearly emphasised. The lithium-ion (Li-on) type of batteries has gained much popularity in modern EV market due to their light weight, high specific energy, high efficiency and high energy density. Currently, there are no other battery technologies which can compete with Li-on batteries. Their cost is also dropped to $150/kWh as of 2020. In this paper, mainly the challenges related with Li-on batteries, ultracapacitors and fuel cells are presented.
