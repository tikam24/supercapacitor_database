Biochar is the carbon-rich material produced from organic feedstock such as agricultural wastes and municipal solid waste in limited oxygen atmosphere and under certain thermal combustion. Due to its high carbon content, high cation exchange capacity, large surface and stability structure, it has been applied in different field of knowledge. In relation to environment analytical chemistry the studies about biochar majorly focus in degradation of contaminants and soil and water remediation. However, due to its excellent electrical conductivity, biochar has been also applied to the manufacture of sensitive, robust, efficient and inexpensive devices applied to supercapacitor-based energy storage and chemically modified electrodes or sensors. Therefore, this review describes about obtention, modification and characterization of biochar as well as the pertinent aspects of electrochemical devises based on biochar and a general discussion about the environmental concern of biochar, challenges and prospects.
