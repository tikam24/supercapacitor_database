This paper presents the comparison between the standalone photovoltaic (PV) system with battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (BS-HESS) and the conventional standalone PV system with battery-only storage system for a rural household. Standalone PV system with passive BS-HESS and semi-active BS-HESS are presented in this study. Two control strategies, Rule Based Controller (RBC) and Filtration Based Controller (FBC), are developed for the standalone PV system with semi-active BS-HESS with the aim to reduce the battery stress and to extend the battery lifespan. The simulation results show that the system with semi-active BS-HESS prolongs the battery lifespan by significantly reducing the battery peak current up to 8.607% and improving the average SOC of the battery up to 0.34% as compared to the system with battery-only system.
