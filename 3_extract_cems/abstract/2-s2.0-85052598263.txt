Nickel telluride nanorods (NiTe NRs) have been prepared by hydrothermal method using ascorbic acid as reducing agent and CTAB as surfactant and characterized by XRD, FE-SEM, HR-TEM and BET. EDX analysis confirms the formation of NiTe NRs. NiTe electrode material for supercapacitor is characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. A high specific capacitance of 618 F g−1 at the current density of 1 A g−1 and the cyclic stability with 75% of its specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles are achieved. During the cyclic process, the coulombic efficiency is better than 99% indicating a good reversibility of NiTe electrode. The combination of high electrical conductivity, porous structure and the synergic effects of nickel play a significant role to obtain supercapacitor electrodes with excellent performances.
