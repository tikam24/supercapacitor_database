The high-elevation wind of the troposphere illustrates an unexplored power source that is bigger than the world's present energy needs. High-elevation wind has the biggest energy per square meter contrasted with the greater part of the sustainable power source advancements. Kite energy is the energy system to harness wind energy using parafoil kite from very high-elevation. This paper introduces an analytical investigation of three phase two level full bridge inverter with supercapacitor integration for kite energy framework utilizing real-time equipment setup. The pulse is generated for inverter using TI-C2000 microcontroller through MATLAB Coder. This paper also shows the measured responses of the inverter using DSO. In a full bridge inverter there is a problem of voltage drop between high side and low side. Thus, this paper shows a high side and low side switching circuit to solve this issue utilizing IR2110 switching IC.
