In the latest PRAM/DRAM hybrid MLC NAND flash storage systems (NFSS), DRAM is used to temporarily store file system data for system response time reduction. To ensure data integrity, super-capacitors are deployed to supply the backup power for moving the data from DRAM to NAND flash during power failures. However, the capacitance degradation of super-capacitor severely impairs system robustness. In this work, we proposed a low cost power failure protection scheme to reduce the energy consumption of power failure protection and increase the robustness of the NFSS with PRAM/DRAM hybrid buffer. Our scheme enables the adoption of the more reliable regular capacitor to replace the super capacitor as the backup power. The experimental result shows that our scheme can substantially reduce the capacitance budget of power failure protection circuitry by 75.1% with very marginal performance and energy overheads.
