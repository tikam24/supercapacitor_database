In this work, double shelled ZnS-NiS 1.97 hollow spheres have been achieved via a simple self-template route, which involves the synthesis of Zn-Ni solid spheres precursors as the self-template and then transformation into double shelled ZnS-NiS 1.97 hollow spheres by sulfidation treatment. The as-prepared double shelled ZnS-NiS 1.97 hollow spheres possess a high surface area (105.26 m 2 g −1 ) and porous structures. Benefiting from the combined characteristics of novel structures, multi-component, high surface area and porous. When applied as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the double shelled ZnS-NiS 1.97 hollow spheres deliver a large specific capacitance of 696.8C g −1 at 5.0 A g −1 and a remarkable long lifespan cycling stability (less 5.5% loss after 6000 cycles). Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled by utilizing ZnS-NiS 1.97 (positive electrode) and activated carbon (negative electrode) as electrode materials. The as-assembled device possesses an energy density of 36 W h kg −1 , which can be yet retained 25.6 W h kg −1 even at a power density of 2173.8 W Kg −1 , indicating its promising applications in electrochemical energy storage. More importantly, the self-template route is a simple and versatile strategy for the preparation of metal sulfides electrode materials with desired structures, chemical compositions and electrochemical performances.
