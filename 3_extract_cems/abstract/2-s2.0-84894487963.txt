The charge storage characteristics of a composite nanoarchitecture with a highly functional 3D morphology are reported. The electrodes are formed by the electropolymerization of aniline monomers into a nanometer-thick polyaniline (PANI) film that conformally coats graphitic petals (GPs) grown by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD) on conductive carbon cloth (CC). The hybrid CC/GPs/PANI electrodes yield results near the theoretical maximum capacitance for PANI of 2000 F g-1 (based on PANI mass) and a large area-normalized specific capacitance of ≈2.6 F cm-2 (equivalent to a volumetric capacitance of ≈230 F cm-3) at a low current density of 1 A g-1 (based on PANI mass). The specific capacitances remain above 1200 F g-1 (based on PANI mass) for currents up to 100 A g -1 with correspondingly high area-normalized values. The hybrid electrodes also exhibit a high rate capability with an energy density of 110 Wh kg-1 and a maximum power density of 265 kW kg-1 at a current density of 100 A g-1. Long-term cyclic stability is good (≈7% loss of initial capacitance after 2000 cycles), with coulombic efficiencies >99%. Moreover, prototype all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors fabricated from these hybrid electrodes exhibit excellent energy storage performance. Thin graphitic petals grown from carbon cloth form the basis of a flexible, solid-state supercapacitor that employs polyaniline coating as the pseudocapacitive material. This structure exhibits very high area-, volume-, and mass-based specific capacitances and energy/power densities. The cyclic stability and Coulombic efficiencies are good, and functional devices exhibit virtually no performance degradation under highly strained bent and twisted conditions. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
