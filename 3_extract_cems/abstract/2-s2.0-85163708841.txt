Due to extraordinary power density and long lifespan supercapacitors possess top priority among all energy storage devices. In this work, we have deposited nickel oxide on the stainless steel by a well-known automatic spray pyrolysis method using different ingredients of nickel for supercapacitor application. The structural, morphological, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) study of the prepared samples was studied using XRD, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wettability, and cyclic voltammetry. The wettability study gives the contact angle (θ) of the optimized sample as 63o26’. The X-ray diffraction pattern confirms the formation of nickel oxide. The observed maximum value of specific capacitance (SC) is 31.83 Fg-1.
