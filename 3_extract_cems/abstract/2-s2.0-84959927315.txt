Activated carbon monoliths (ACMs) electrodes for supercapacitor application were prepared from the green monoliths (GMs) containing KOH treated self-adhesive carbon grains (SACGs) added with KOH treated graphene at its weight percentages of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%, respectively. The SACGs were prepared from fibres of oil palm empty fruit bunches by a low carbonization temperature method. The ACMs were produced by the carbonization and activation of the GMs. The surface area, structure and specific capacitance of the ACMs electrodes were found affected by the graphene addition. The highest surface area of the ACMs electrode was observed for the addition of 6 wt.% graphene, which corresponds to the carbon turbostratic structure of the ACMs electrodes with the values of its crystallite interlayer spacings (d002 and d100) at 0.352 nm and 0.205 nm, and its crystallites stack-width (La) and stack-height (Lc) at 43.21 nm and 10.06 nm, respectively. The specific capacitance of the cell using this electrode was 113 Fg-1.
