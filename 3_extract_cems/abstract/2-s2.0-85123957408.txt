Fast and safe electric heating is highly needed in extreme climates or thermal therapy. Herein, porous activated carbon derived from silk waste is prepared by a simple method. Various porous activated carbons are obtained using different types and concentrations of activator (KOH, KCl, and KHCO3). The effect of the microstructure on the electric heating performance of these carbons is investigated carefully. The type, activator concentration, and carbonization temperature play key roles in the regulation of electric heating properties. The porous carbon activated by 0.05 M KHCO3 at 800 °C demonstrates larger specific surface area (3077 m2 g-1), higher graphitization degree, and lower resistance (2.4 ω cm), which synergistically contribute greatly to its higher electrothermal efficiency and better electric heating performance. The equilibrium temperature could reach 73 °C in 2 min under a safe voltage of 12 V, proving the better pore-forming capacity and activating function of KHCO3. An electric heating cotton@carbon composite fabric with quite good electric heating property and stability is also prepared, which could reach 38 °C in 2 min under 12 V safe voltage and maintain a temperature 10 °C higher than the ambient temperature even when bent at an angle of 55°. This activated carbon derived from waste protein using a simple and cheap process has great potential in practical applications.
