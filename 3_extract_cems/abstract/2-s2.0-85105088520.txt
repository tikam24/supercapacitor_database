Biomass-based carbon aerogels have attracted significant research attention due to the wide range of raw material, low cost, and environmental friendliness. In this study, green and sustainable carbon aerogels have been prepared using starch as raw material. Potassium chloride and potassium carbonate have been selected as template and activator. Due to the joint action of potassium chloride and potassium carbonate, the starch-based carbon aerogels exhibit a specific surface area of 2367 m2 g-1 with ant-hole-like 3D network pore structure. The starch-based carbon aerogels have been further employed as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of the carbon aerogels is 292.3 and 245 F g-1 at current densities of 1.0 and 10 A g-1, respectively. In addition, the starch-based carbon aerogels demonstrate excellent sorption ability for oil and organics as well as insignificant sorption ability for H2O, thus, indicating their potential use as optimal oil-water separation material.
