Nitrogen-doped hollow activated carbon nanofibers (HACNFs) have been prepared by the concentric electrospinning and the following NH3 activation. The as-obtained samples were directly used as supercapacitor electrode without binders and conductive additives. Owing to the unique hollow architecture and high N-doping level (8.2%), the HACNFs exhibit a high specific capacitance of 197 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1, which is 1.33 times than that of the solid electrospun nanofibers activated in the same condition. The samples also possess a superior rate capability of 72.1% (143 F g-1) at 20 A g-1 and long-term cycling stability with a retention of 98.6% after 1000 cycles at 5 A g-1 in 6 M KOH.
