Redox active electrolyte supercapacitors differ significantly from the conventional electrolytes based storage devices but face a long term stability issue which requires a different approach while designing the systems. Here, we show the change in layered double hydroxides (LDHs) systems with rare earth elements (lanthanum) can drastically influence the stability of two dimensional LDH systems in redox electrolyte. We find that the choice of rare earth element (lanthanum) having magnetic properties and higher thermal and chemical stability has a profound effect on the stability of Laâ€“Co LDHs electrode in redox electrolyte. The fabricated hybrid device with rare earth based positive electrode and carbon as negative electrode having redox electrolyte leads to long stable high volumetric/gravimetric capacity at high discharge rate, demonstrates the importance of considering the rare earth elements while designing the LDH systems for redox active supercapacitor development.
