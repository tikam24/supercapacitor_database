Controllable design over the structure and morphology of active material is highly desirable for high performance supercapacitors. Here, coaxial binary composite MnO2/polyaniline was prepared by introducing tetraphenyl porphyrin tetrasulfonic acid interlayer (TPPS), as a crosslinking agent and dopant, to fabricate the three-dimensional hollow polyaniline (PANI) nanotube gel and then synthesizing nanoflaky MnO2 uniformly on the surface of PANI. Moreover, this coaxial structure is convenient for the ion and electrons transportation to exhibit excellent capacitive behavior with the capacitance of 575 F/g at 0.4 A/g. In addition, we assembled an asymmetric supercapacitor using MnO2/PANI as positive electrode, displaying high energy density (52.7 Wh/kg), remarkable durability and long cycling life (maintaining 90.2% initial capacitance after 2000 cycles). Using MnO2/PANI as inks for 3D-printed stamping is promising to be a novel fabricating method which can rapidly produce flexible microsupercapacitor for wearable micro devices.
