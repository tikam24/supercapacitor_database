In this work, we present a novel supercapacitor (SC) material based on 3D graphene foam-polyaniline (Pani)-Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite for supercapacitor applications. Graphenefoam was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on Ni foam using acetylene carbon source and hydrogen gas carrier at 700Â°C for 3 minutes. Next, the foam was etched in 3M HCl for an hour to remove most of Ni support. Multi-wall CNTs powder were then dispersed in 1M HCl and 0.2 M aniline monomer was then added, stirred and filtered to remove non-dispersed CNTs. Electro-polymerization in the CNTs-aniline monomer solution was then conducted at working electrode potential of 0.55 V vs. Ag/AgCl. SEM and Raman characteirzation confirmed the incorporation of CNTs in Pani/graphene foam network with a number of nanowire features appeared on graphene foam surface and dominant D and G carbon's peaks. SC performances were then tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurements in 2M H2SO4 electrolyte. CV results showed that PANI's redox peaks were broadened due to the presence of CNTs, indicating enhanced pseudocapacitance. From GCD measurements, it is found that CNTs-Pani-graphene foam exhibits a high specific capacitance of 920 Fg-1 at a specific current of 0.8 Ag-1, which is more than twice higher than that of Pani-graphene foam (430 Fg-1).
