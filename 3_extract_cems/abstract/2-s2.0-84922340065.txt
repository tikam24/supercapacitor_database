The composite of nano-iron oxide (Fe2O3)/three-dimensional graphene aerogel (Fe2O3/GA) was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological properties of Fe2O3/GA were characterized through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Fe2O3 particles with 30-60 nm in size were homogenously encapsulated in graphene aerogel(GA). In the three-electrode system, an extremely wide working potential window was observed from -0.8 to 0.8 V(vs. SCE) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution, and a specific capacitance of 81.3 F g-1 was obtained at a constant current density of 1 A g-1.
