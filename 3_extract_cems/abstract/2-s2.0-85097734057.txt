Energy storage research is focusing new cost effective and high specific capacitance electrode materials to meet the requirements of the energy demands. Herein, we studied hydrothermal derived hybrid NiO-CoO nanocomposite for supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical analysis of hybrid NiO-CoO nanocomposite of different reaction time was characterized and the obtained corresponding specific capacitance values were 168, 169 and 298 F/g respectively at 10 mV/s. Hybrid electrodes, suitable incorporation of CoO with NiO process increasingly enhanced electronic conductivity and electrochemical performance. 94.30% cyclic performance was maintained over 5000 cycles of charge discharge in galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) profile.
