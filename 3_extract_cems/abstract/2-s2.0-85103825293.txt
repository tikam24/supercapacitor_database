Activated carbon obtained from biomass wastes was presently studied in order to evaluate its applicability in an energy storage device. Biochar was obtained by the carbonization of spent malt rootlets and was further processed by mild treatment in NaOH. The final product had a specific surface of 362 m2 g−1 and carried Na, P and a few mineral sites. This material was first characterized by several techniques. Then it was used to make a supercapacitor electrode, which reached a specific capacitance of 156 F g−1 . The supercapacitor electrode was combined with a photocatalytic fuel cell, making a simple three-electrode device functioning with a single alkaline electrolyte. This device allows solar energy conversion and storage at the same time, promoting the use of biomass wastes for energy applications.
