The electrochemical capacitance properties of composite coatings, which consist in electrically conducting polypyrrole (PPy) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been investigated for supercapacitor application. A CNTs layer was grown on the Si/SiO2/Ni catalyst substrate by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and PPy was subsequently deposited on this layer by electrochemical polymerization, for obtaining (Py) CNTs electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry was performed under the following conditions: 50 cycles in the potential domain of 0.2-0.85 V/SCE, at a scan rate of 20mVs-1, using either 0.1 M pyrrol (Py) in 0.2MH2SO4 or 0.3MPy in 0.2M oxalic acid as aqueous electrolytes. The morphology of composite films was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical capacitance properties of the composite films were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique in 0.2M H2SO4 and 0.2M oxalic acid aqueous solutions, respectively.
