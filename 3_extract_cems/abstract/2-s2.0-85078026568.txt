Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is grafted through [1,2] cycloaddition reaction with 4-azidobutylferrocene (AzFc) and its nanocomposite with polyaniline (PANI) is prepared to be applied as a new battery-type supercapacitor material. The morphology and composition of 4-azidobutylferrocene/reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline nanocomposite (AzFc/rGO/PANI) are studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of nanocomposite material was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) techniques in 1 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. The charge storage capacity of 14, 70 and 95 mAh g−1 are obtained for reduced graphene oxide, 4-azidobutylferrocene/reduced graphene oxide, and 4-azidobutylferrocene/reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline nanocomposite at a current density of 14 A g−1, respectively. The 4-azidobutylferrocene/reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline nanocomposite as a promising new battery-type supercapacitor electrode material shows retention time of 89% after 2000 cycle of cyclic voltammetry.
