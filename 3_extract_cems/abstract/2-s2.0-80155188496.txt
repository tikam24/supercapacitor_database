This paper deals with the energy share between batteries and supercapacitors within hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). A library of models, known as Hybrid Electric Vehicle Library (VEHLIB), which combines the different models to form a coherent modular base, has been constructed and implemented in real time simulator. Real-time results are here discussed in order to illustrate the effectives of models used. The integration of the on-board energy source of an electrically propelled vehicle with a supercapacitor bank (SB) as a peak power unit, can lead to substantial benefits in terms of electric vehicle, battery life and energy economy. An energy management strategy is also suggested, which is based upon the DC bus voltage regulation. Â© 2011 IEEE.
