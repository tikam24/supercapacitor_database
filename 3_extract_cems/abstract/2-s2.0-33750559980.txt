Manganese dioxide was prepared by chemical Co-precipitation. The XRD patterns indicate that the main crystal structures of the sample are amorphous α-MnO2 and γ-MnO2. The sample hydrothermal treatment shows stronger crystal phases, and the phase is α-MnO 2 and γ-MnO2 mixed phase. Electrochemical measurement reveals that the specific capacitance of single electrode is 252.72 F·g-1 and reachs at 299.15 F·g-1 after hydrothermal treatment 18.37% higher than that before the treatment. Capacitance of the-latter sample shows almost no decline after 400 charge/discharge cycles.
