Conductive polymer materials have electronic properties like metal and flexibility and processability as organic materials. They have promise in military, energy and biosensor applications. However, damaged electronic component can ruin the circuit board and paralyze the entire electronic device. Such a problem can be solved by using self-healing conductive materials, which are capable of repairing the damage like biological system. In this paper, we review the research progress of self-healing conductive materials, discuss the mechanism and preparation of self-healing conductive materials, and finally introduce their applications, such as electronic sensor and supercapacitor. We believe that the research on the theories and applications of self-healing conductive materials can promote rapid development of electronic devices.
