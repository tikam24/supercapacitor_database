Supercapacitors are a key energy storage low capacity technology for supporting various emerging energy systems and their applications ranging from electric vehicles to renewable energy systems. In the development and operation of these systems the issues of supercapacitor aging and lifetime estimation are of great importance. Methods for estimating supercapacitor's lifetime are essential for system design and optimization, both from the technical and economic point of view. This paper provides a summary of the methods concerning supercapacitor health and life estimation. Aspects concerning life tests and characterization are discussed, and some future research directions are presented. Â© 2013 Australasian Committee for Power Engineering (ACPE).
