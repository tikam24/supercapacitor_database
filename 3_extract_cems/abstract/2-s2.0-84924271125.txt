Electrospun manganese oxide nanofibers were synthesized to improve the observed capacitance of MnOx based capacitor electrodes by exploiting the high surface to volume ratios and the nano voids present in the non-woven mats that would result in providing larger available electrode surface and reduced charge transfer resistance. In addition, MnOx hybrid nanofibers containing heterogeneously mixed CNTs and co-spun MnOx/ SnO2 nanofibers were also prepared by the electrospinning method to further improve the specific capacitance by reducing the overall electrode conductivity. The specific capacitance measured at 10 mV/s are 161.22 and 182.20 F/g for MnOx and MnOx/CNT hybrid nanofibers, while the specific capacitance of MnOx/SnO2 fibers was found to be 472.31 F/g. An additional MnOx nanofiber matrix was prepared by electrospinning followed by calcination at 700 Â°C which resulted in hollow nanofibers. The specific capacitance of this nanostructure was 361.23 F/g. The primary crystalline phase in these fibers was Mn2O3. EIS revealed that the ESR of the fibers were low and that the electrochemical process was primarily diffusion controlled.
