Advanced carbon-based electrode materials derived from wastes are essential to high-performance supercapacitors due to their abundance and sustainability. In this work, we fabricate novel cathodes and anodes based on discarded surgical mask-derived carbon (DSM-C). Discarded surgical masks are good candidates for carbon-based electrode materials due to their unique fibrous structure and simple composition compared to conventional biomass sources. Benefiting from the excellent electrical conductivity of DSM-C and abundant redox reactions from nickel oxide (NiO), the electrochemical performances of NiO/DSM-C composites have been greatly improved. Specifically, the DSM-C and NiO/DSM-C electrodes show high specific capacitances of 240 F g−1 and 496 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 respectively, and excellent rate capability. Moreover, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are assembled using DSM-C and NiO/DSM-C as anodes and cathodes, respectively. They deliver a high energy density of 57 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 702 W kg−1, accompanied by superior cycling stability (98.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles). This work shows prospective applications of DSM-C as an electrode material for energy storage systems.
