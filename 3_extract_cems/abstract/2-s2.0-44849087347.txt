An experimental research platform based on a dynamic testbed is developed and applied for fuel cell hybrid powertrain integration and control. A driver brake model is added to the dynamic testbed to simulate the braking process of an electric vehicle. Sub-systems of the fuel cell hybrid powertrain are tested, and characteristic parameters are obtained. A simulation platform is constructed in LabVIEW environment, and its validity is verified by dynamic test results. A real time control system is developed with an embedded PC for the function of rapid control prototyping. Using this platform, fuel cell battery hybrid and fuel cell supercapacitor hybrid configurations are investigated. This platform provides a powerful tool for fuel cell powertrain research and development. Â© 2008 The Korean Society of Automotive Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg GmbH.
