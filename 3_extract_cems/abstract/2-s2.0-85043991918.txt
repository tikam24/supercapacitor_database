Polyaniline-multiwalled carbon nanotube (PANI-MWCNT) composite synthesized through chemical polymerization is investigated as a possible electrode material for supercapacitor as well as an electro-catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic medium. UV–Vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) have been used to characterize the electrode material. The binder-free electrodes were prepared and they exhibit a specific capacitance of 540.29 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The material exhibits excellent pseudocapacitive behaviour due to the presence of PANI with long-term cyclic stability of 87.4% retention after 5000 cycles. PANI-MWCNT composite also shows good HER activity, with overpotential of −395 mV.
