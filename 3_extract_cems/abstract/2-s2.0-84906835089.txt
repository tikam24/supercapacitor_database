The proceedings contain 6 papers. The topics discussed include: graphene and N-doped graphene coated with SnO2 nanoparticles as supercapacitor electrodes; activated carbons from orange peel waste as supercapacitor electrodes; study of cycle performance of Li-ion capacitors; a low temperature inorganic molten salt supercapacitor; nanofiber-based electrodes for high power supercapacitors; and glass wool material as alternative separator for higher rating electric double layer capacitor.
