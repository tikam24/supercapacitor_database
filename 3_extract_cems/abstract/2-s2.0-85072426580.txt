A student team from Brigham Young University (BYU) set a new record for the world's fastest electric drag racecar. The team modified a production EV1 donated to the university by the General Motors Corporation and installed a bank of 160 UltraCapacitors rated at 2700 farads each. This paper describes the design of the capacitor pack, the car's drive train, the charging method and other modifications of the vehicle. Here we also discuss performance and race data from an official quarter-mile drag race sanctioned by the National Electric Drag Racing Association. A simulation model for vehicle performance was also developed and is presented here. Copyright Â© 2004 SAE International.
