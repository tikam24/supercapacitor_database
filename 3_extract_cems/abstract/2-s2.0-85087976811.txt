This paper aims at studying the electrochemical performance of carbon fibers (CF) from chemical treatment using nitric acid at different times (0–30 min) and their respective graphene oxide/carbon fiber (GO/CF) composites. The oxidative process introduced oxygenated functional groups on the CF surfaces. After the chemical treatment, CF samples showed cluster formations, which increased their surface roughness. Although the chemical treatment did not cause significant changes in CF structures, it promoted an electrochemical response enhancement. The electrochemical analyses showed a specific electrochemical surface area increased from 174.0 (CF0) to 582.1 cm2 cm−3 (CF30). The treated CF presented more capacitive profile than that of the untreated electrode. CF30 showed a capacitance increase of around 1625% compared to that of CF0. GO incorporation also provided better electrochemical responses for GO/CF composites, which presented lower equivalent series resistances than those of their respective CF during galvanostatic charge/discharge curves. GO/CF30 depicted a capacitance increase of around 8250% compared to that of GO/CF0 composite. These results pointed out the oxidative process control importance in carbon materials aiming at their application for supercapacitors.
