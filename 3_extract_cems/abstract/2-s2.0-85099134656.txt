In the present work, submicrometer CoMoO4 is successfully prepared by a facile polymer-pyrolysis method. The phase, structure, composition and morphology of the obtained sample are characterized by several techniques. The proper reaction temperature is 600 °C. As an anode material of lithium half-battery, the sample prepared at 600 °C exhibits a stable reversible capacity of 667.6 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. A 96.7% capacity retention is observed between 10 and 100 cycles, where lithium storage reaction is dominated by ionic diffusion, and the diffusion coefficient of lithium ion is about 0.12 × 10−15 cm2 s−1. As electrode of supercapacitors, a high specific capacitance of around 304.6 F g−1 is achieved at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 after 1000 cycles. Therefore, the polymer-pyrolysis method shows great promise in preparing the CoMoO4.
