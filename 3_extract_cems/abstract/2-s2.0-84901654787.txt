Two kinds of hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) with specific surface areas of 2000m2g-1 were synthesized using leonardite humic acids (LHA) or biotechnology humic acids (BHA) precursors via a KOH activation process. Humic acids have a high content of oxygen-containing groups which enabled them to dissolve in aqueous KOH and facilitated the homogeneous KOH activation. The LHA-based HPC is made up of abundant micro-, meso-, and macropores and in 6M KOH it has a specific capacitance of 178Fg-1 at 100Ag-1 and its capacitance retention on going from 0.05 to 100Ag-1 is 64%. In contrast, the BHA-based HPC exhibits a lower capacitance retention of 54% and a specific capacitance of 157Fg-1 at 100Ag-1 which is due to the excessive micropores in the BHA-HPC. Moreover, LHA-HPC is produced in a higher yield than BHA-HPC (51 vs. 17wt%). Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
