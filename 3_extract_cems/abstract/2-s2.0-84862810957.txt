Reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-NiO composites have been fabricated by a simple solvothermal route starting with graphite oxide (GO). The morphology, composition and microstructure of the as-obtained samples are systematically characterized by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Moreover, the electrochemical performances of composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. Interestingly, it was found that the electrochemical performance of the composites could be affected by the mass ratio between RGO and NiO. The composite with the mass ratio up to 79:21 (NiO:RGO) exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 576 F g -1 at 1 A g -1, which is much higher than that of pure NiO (240 F g -1) and pure RGO (98 F g -1). In addition, the cycling measurements showed that RGO-NiO composite exhibited excellent cycling stability with no decay in the available capacity over 1100 cycles. The enhancement in specific capacitance and cycling stability may be attributed to the increased electrode conductivity owing to RGO network, the increased effective interfacial area between NiO and the electrolyte, as well as the contact area between NiO and RGO.
