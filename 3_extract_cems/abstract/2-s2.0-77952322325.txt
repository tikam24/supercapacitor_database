A hybrid asymmetrical super capacitor has been fabricated based on p-doped poly(aniline-co-m-anilicacid) and activated carbon coated on SS electrodes. The characterization of material, electrode and performance of the super capacitor has been studied by FTIR, Cyclic Voltammetry, TGA/DTA, AC Impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The super capacitor showed a maximum specific capacitance of 102 F/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. The normalized active-reactive power behavior of the capacitor has been determined. The time constant calculated for the super capacitor is 6 milliseconds, indicating the suitability of the system for efficient use at low frequency range.
