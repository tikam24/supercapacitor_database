The contradiction between the large-scale promotion of electric vehicles and the lagging construction of charging stake is increasingly prominent. Emergency charging technology for electric vehicles needs to be proposed urgently. In addition, power batteries will soon usher in the first retirement peak in the country. How to effectively and environmentally handle the above issues has become a hot research topic.This paper puts forward the mixed step utilization of power batteries and super capacitors after retirement, and designs a removable energy storage and charging system. For the problems of low current and slow charging in the step utilization of existing power batteries, the mixed power supply mode of decommissioned power batteries and super capacitors is proposed to improve the charging efficiency.Engineering practice has proved that the design shown in this paper has higher charging rate and greater practicability than that of a single power battery mobile charging system.
