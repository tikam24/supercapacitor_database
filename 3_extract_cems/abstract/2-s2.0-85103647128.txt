Abstract: In this work, the graphene oxide/mesoporous silica/polyaniline (GO/mSiO2/PANI) composite was synthesized via in-situ polymerization method. PANI was introduced into the mesoporous channels of mSiO2, followed by dispersion of PANI-containing mSiO2 into the interlayers of GO sheets. The morphology, functional groups, and crystalline phases of GO/mSiO2/PANI composite were scrutinized. The characterization proved the successful incorporation of the PANI nanofibers into mSiO2 and the uniform intercalation of PANI-embedding mSiO2 between the GO sheets. Such unique structure provides the GO/mSiO2/PANI composite electrode with an excellent capacitance up to 1218.4 F gâ€“1 and 92.5% capacitive retention after 1000 cycles. GO/mSiO2/PANI composite could be an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor application.
