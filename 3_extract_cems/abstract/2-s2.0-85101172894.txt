This paper reports the synthesis of various molar concentrations of manganese (Mn)-doped Ultra-High Surface area Activated Carbon (USAC) additives and their efficient use as cathode materials for supercapacitors. We synthesized the nanoparticles via a novel and facile dip-coating process and characterized them in detail by various analytical techniques. The SEM, EDAX, and XPS results showed that the Mn ions were successfully substituted on the USAC additives’ layered structure without any structural changes. The long cyclic stability of the as-prepared Mn-doped USAC additives was tested as a cathode material for supercapacitors at different current densities. The detailed experimental results showed that the Mn dopant content crucially determines the electrochemical performances of the USAC additives. Electrochemical measurements showed that the MnCEP-S600HTT with 0.10 mol% molar concentration of Mn dopant gives the best cycling performances. It delivers a discharge capacity of 262.9 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles. Further increasing the current density to 1000 mA g−1 allowed it to still maintain 253.6 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. We confirmed that the structure of Mn-doped USAC additives is an important pole to improve the structural stability and electrochemical properties.
