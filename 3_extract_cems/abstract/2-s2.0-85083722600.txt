Supercapacitors (SCs) have broad applications in wearable electronics (e.g., e-skin, robots). Recently, graphene-based supercapacitors (G-SCs) have attracted extensive attention for their excellent flexibility and electrochemical performance. Laser fabrication of G-SCs exhibits obvious superiority because of the simple procedures and integration compatibility with future electronics. Here, we comprehensively summarize the state-of-the-art advancements in laser-assisted preparation of G-SCs, including working mechanisms, fabrication procedures, and unique characteristics. In the working mechanism section, electric double-layer capacitors and pseudo-capacitors are introduced. The latest advancements in this field are comprehensively summarized, including laser reduction of graphene oxides, laser treatment of graphene prepared from chemical vapor deposition, and laser-induced graphene. In addition, the unique characteristics of laser-enabled G-SCs, such as structured graphene, graphene hybrids, and heteroatom doping graphene-related electrodes, are presented. Subsequently, laser-enabled miniaturized, stretchable, and integrated G-SCs are also discussed. It is anticipated that laser fabrication of G-SCs holds great promise for developing future energy storage devices.
