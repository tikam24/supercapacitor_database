Fe1−xS-TiO2 nanoparticles embedded carbon nanofibers (Fe1−xS-TiO2/CNFs) composite as a supercapacitor electrode material has been reported in the present work. The Fe1−xS-TiO2/CNFs composite was fabricated by electrospinning technique followed by carbonization under argon atmosphere and characterized by the state-of-art techniques. The electrochemical studies were carried out in a 2 M KOH electrolyte solution. The synthesized material showed a specific capacitance value of 138 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Further, the capacitance retention was about 83%. The obtained results indicate that the Fe1−xS-TiO2/CNFs composite can be recognized as electrode material in supercapacitor.
