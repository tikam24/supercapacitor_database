RuO2/graphene (RuO2/G) composites were synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction and followed by an annealing process. The structure and morphology of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results show that RuO2 nanoparticles with average size of 3.6 nm are homogeneously deposited on the surface of the graphene sheets. As an electrode material, RuO2/G exhibits an excellent supercapacitive behavior. Electrochemical performance of the materials was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). With 35wt% RuO2 loading, RuO2/G shows a specific capacitance of 402.5 F/g in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte. Meanwhile, the electrode material also delivers a high energy density of 14 Wh/kg and power density of 50 W/kg in aqueous electrolyte system. Moreover, the RuO2/G material exhibits good rate performance and cycle stability. Utilizing the double-layer capacitance of graphene and the pseudocapacitance of RuO2, RuO2/G composite is an ideal electrode material for the energy storage device.
