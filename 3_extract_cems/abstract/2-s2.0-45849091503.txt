Traditional EDLC using the symmetrical double activated carbon (AC) electrodes is limited by the low energy density. We replaced the positive AC electrode by a graphitic carbon electrode in the new type of capacitor. The energy density can be remarkably enhanced. The storage mechanism of anions at the graphitic carbon cathode is ascribed to a specific interaction between the anions and graphitic carbon. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
