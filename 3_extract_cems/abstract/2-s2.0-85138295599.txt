The proceedings contain 11 papers. The topics discussed include: NiAl-Cl LDH in-situ grown on graphene oxide by a one-step hydrothermal method towards high performance cathode of supercapacitor; flexible miniaturized thin film thermocouples arrays for high temperature applications; design and fabrication of piezoelectrically driven deformable reflective micromirrors based on MEMS technology; an improved method for controllable growth of monolayer WSe2 and its optical characterization; investigation of the photoisomerization property of donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts on ester-modified glass; research on surface metallization of polyimide film; and design of cobalt nickel nitrides/carbon nitride composite catalysts for enhanced electrochemical water splitting.
