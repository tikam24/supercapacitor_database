In this work, gold (Au) films were deposited onto vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by Dc magnetron sputtering method for use as super-capacitor electrodes. By so doing, we synthesize a porous Au deposit anchored on the CNTs with a high apparent surface area. The structure and microstructure studies revealed that the Au@CNTs have a porous nanostructure morphology. The porous Au/CNTs electrodes exhibit an a good areal capacitance compared to state of art Au based electrode (25.6 mF cm-2 at 5 mV.s-1) and excellent cycling stability (90% retention after 10.000 cycles) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution. These results demonstrate the beneficial use of CNTs to fabricate a porous Au deposit with improved electrochemical energy storage. In addition, these porous structures can also be used as templates for another type of materials for electrochemical energy storage.
