Cadmium sulfide/polypyrrole decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO/CdS/PPY) nanosheets were synthesized via chemical oxidative in-situ polymerization process. The impact of CdS nanoparticle on rGO incorporated polymeric matrix (PPY) was investigated. The as prepared nanosheets were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) techniques. Their thermal stability was examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical measurements were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic stability and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) techniques. The nanocomposite containing 10 wt % CdS (GCP10) showed an enhanced specific capacitance ∼844 F g−1 at current density ∼1 A g−1. This nanocomposite displayed low equivalent series resistance (ESR), of 2.8 Ω and good cyclic stability with capacitance retention 92.8% after 2000 consecutive cycles. The investigation indicated that the as prepared nanocomposite proved as a promising candidate for electrode materials in supercapacitor application.
