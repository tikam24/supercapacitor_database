Supercapacitor gains so much interest in recent years due to its capabilities to provide high power densities with high energy density possibilities. Several transition metal sulfides (TMS) give the best capacitance results nowadays, with Copper Sulfides (CuS) promising candidates on supercapacitor electrodes materials. Several approaches have been made to increase TMS-based supercapacitor performance, such as doping, surface functionalization, and nanostructuring. Even though several dopants already reported, other dopants have not yet explored. In this study, we study the nickel effect as dopant on the binding energy of electrolyte in the surface of CuS from first-principles viewpoints. In this study, we limit our investigation of surface interaction with electrolyte only for OH- ions. We prove that the binding energy of electrolyte is increased after introducing dopant in the surface of CuS, which could explain of dopant effect and background proof of future research in this field.
