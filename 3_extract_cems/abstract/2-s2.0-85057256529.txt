Porous Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes are directly grown on the surface of nickel foam supported Ni3Se2 nanowire arrays using an in situ growth procedure to form 3D Ni3Se2@Ni(OH)2 hybrid material. Owing to good conductivity of Ni3Se2, high specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2 and its unique architecture, the obtained Ni3Se2@Ni(OH)2 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1689 µAh cm−2 (281.5 mAh g−1) at a discharge current of 3 mA cm−2 and a superior rate capability. Both the high energy density of 59.47 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 100.54 W kg−1 and remarkable cycling stability with only a 16.4% capacity loss after 10 000 cycles are demonstrated in an asymmetric supercapacitor cell comprising Ni3Se2@Ni(OH)2 as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode. Furthermore, the cell achieved a high energy density of 50.9 Wh L−1 at a power density of 83.62 W L−1 in combination with an extraordinary coulombic efficiency of 97% and an energy efficiency of 88.36% at 5 mA cm−2 when activated carbon is replaced by metal hydride from a commercial NiMH battery. Excellent electrochemical performance indicates that Ni3Se2@Ni(OH)2 composite can become a promising electrode material for energy storage applications.
