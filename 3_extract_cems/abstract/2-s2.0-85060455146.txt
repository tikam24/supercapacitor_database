Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) powered electric vehicles (EVs) are introduced, in order to diminish the drawbacks associated with conventional electric vehicles like driving range and transient power generation. The HESS is realized by integrating ultracapacitor (UC) with the battery. Here base power requirement of EV can be produced by the battery on the hand UC is utilized to meet the peak power demand. According to the vehicle necessitates transition between the battery and UC is the main obstacle associated with HESS powered an electric vehicle. The main objective of this work is to design a new control strategy for a smooth transition of energy sources in HESS. A math function based (MFB) controller is developed with four individual math functions corresponding to the speed of an electric motor. The designed MFB is combined with the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to meet the proposed control strategy. The controlled pulse signals are provided to the converters by the designed MFB controller corresponding to the vehicleâ€™s speed. Battery charging is done with a solar panel which is present within the electric vehicle. Overall circuit is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink in four modes with the proposed control strategy.
