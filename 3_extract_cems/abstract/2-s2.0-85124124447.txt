In this study, we report a fast and simple method for synthesis biochars from biomass sugarcane bagasse as a raw material. The biochars material possesses a good porous structure after one-step carbonization in a normal anaerobic furnace with an amorphous phase and a good specific surface area of 272.75 m2 g−1. The sugarcane bagasse-derived biochars show a harmonious agreement with the gel polymer electrolyte via electrochemical investigation. The electrical double layer supercapacitor cell demonstrates a good charge-discharge rate capability and also good specific capacitance. The porous biochars obtain electrode specific capacitance of 48 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and the maximum energy density is about 7.71 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1028 W kg−1. This study provides a promising route for recycling waste biomass in energy storage applications.
