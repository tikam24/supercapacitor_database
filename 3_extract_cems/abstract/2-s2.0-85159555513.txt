Nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) materials combined with transition metal nanocrystals are potential multifunctional materials for energy conversion and storage. Herein, zinc and cobalt doped zeolite imidazole frameworks (ZnCo-ZIF) were used as precursors for the synthesis of honeycomb-like NC. Due to the NaCl-assisted pyrolysis and selenylation, as-prepared honeycomb-like NC was well-distributed with ZnSe and Co nanocrystals. This unique morphology with abundant porous channels and wrinkles not only improves the dispersion and exposure of ZnSe and Co composites, but also facilitates mass and electron transfer. For oxygen reduction reaction, it exhibited a 0.976 V onset potential and a 0.923 V half-wave potential; and for supercapacitors, its specific capacitance was 915.9 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 in 2 M KOH. Thus, NaCl-assisted pyrolysis and selenylation can provide a feasible strategy for preparing high performance multifunctional materials.
