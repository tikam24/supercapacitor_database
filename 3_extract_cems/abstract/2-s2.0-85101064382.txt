Boron nitride's (BN) large band gap does not permit carrier transport at ambient conditions. We show that BN sheets can be exfoliated by functionalization with oxy-groups to introduce additional acceptor and donor energy levels appropriate for energy storage devices. Further, the incorporation of heteroatoms into transition metal sulfides enhances capacitance via Faradic redox reactions and their cyclic stability. The functionalized boron nitride (mK-BN) and Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) are intertwined with a Zn-doped Cadmium-Sulfide (Zn–CdS) nanostructure to increase the surface area-charge storage. In a supercapacitor application, Zn–CdS/mK-BN/CNT exhibits a 787 F/g specific capacitance (SC) in an aqueous (aq.) electrolyte. Further, the Zn–CdS/mK-BN/CNT was deployed as a cathode material in an asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) coupled with an ionic electrolyte (IE), (NHEt3)+(NO3)−, offered a SC of 173 F/g with an approximate 99% stability due to the enhanced charge mobility. The reported functionalization of BN induces additional energy levels making the material ideal for energy storage devices and will directly impact the next-generation of advanced supercapacitor electrode materials.
