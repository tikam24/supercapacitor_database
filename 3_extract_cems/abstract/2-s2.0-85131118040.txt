Featuring high electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity, transition metal sulfides are promising materials for the positive electrode of hybrid supercapacitors. However, considering their poor cycling life and rate performance, critical challenges remain. In this contribution, we describe hollow NiS2/CoS2@C composites obtained by stepwise etching, annealing, and sulfuration of ZIF-67. Specifically, NiS2/CoS2 particles were dispersed on N/S co-doped carbon nanocages and found to exhibit outstanding stability and rate performance. The unique nanocage structure of N/S co-doped carbon and heterogeneous interfaces of NiS2 and CoS2 can promote both ion transport and electron transfer, enriching the active site for enhanced reactivity. The resulting NiS2/CoS2@C nanocage composites in fact showed considerable electrochemical performance, with a specific capacity of 1373 C g-1 at 1 A g-1. When combined with reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based negative electrode, the assembled hybrid supercapacitor registered an energy density of 63.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 800 W kg-1, retaining exceeding 98% of the initial capacity even after 13,000 cycles.
