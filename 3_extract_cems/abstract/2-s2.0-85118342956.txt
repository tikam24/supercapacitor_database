The utilization of a supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) to store regenerative braking energy in urban rail transit system effectively improves the energy saving rate and suppresses the voltage fluctuation of the DC catenary system. Based on the double closed-loop control strategy of SCESS, the outer-loop voltage PI controller optimized by genetic algorithm may cause the output oscillation, while the conventional fuzzy controller has the problems of quantification factor, scaling factor setting difficulty, poor adaptability and slow fuzzy inference speed. In response to the above-mentioned problems, a fuzzy neural network (FNN) control strategy was proposed, which was optimized by double-population immune clonal selection algorithm (DPICSA). First, the membership functions and initial values of the quantification factor and scaling factor of the main fuzzy controller were synthetically optimized by DPICSA. Then, a parameter self-correction fuzzy controller was designed to adjust these initial values online. Eventually, two RBF neural networks were used respectively to memorize the fuzzy inference of main controller and parameter self-correction controller. The fuzzy inference speed was accelerated by the parallel and distributed computing capabilities of the neural networks. The simulations conducted in three different scenarios proved better voltage stabilization and energy-saving effects of the proposed control strategy, compared with the GA-PI control and the conventional fuzzy control.
