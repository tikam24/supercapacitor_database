Conductive hydrogels as potential soft materials have attracted tremendous attention in wearable electronic devices. Nonetheless, manufacturing intelligent materials that integrate mouldability, stretchability, responsive ability, fast self-healing ability, as well as mechanical and electrochemical properties is still a challenge. Here, multifunctional conductive hydrogels composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and polypyrrole (PPy) nanotube are prepared using borax as cross-linker. The existence of multicomplexation, entangled PVA chains, and interconnected PPy nanotubes, as well as extensive hydrogen bonding results in the fabrication of hierarchical network of PVA-PPy hydrogels. PVA-PPy hydrogels exhibit high stretchability (more than 1000%), multiresponsiveness, low density (0.95 g cmâˆ’3), high water content (96%), and 15 s self-healing features. Furthermore, the self-healing supercapacitor electrode and motion sensor based on PVA-PPy hydrogels demonstrate ideal performances. This facile strategy in this work would be promising to construct an excellent multifunctional soft material for various flexible electrode and biosensor.
