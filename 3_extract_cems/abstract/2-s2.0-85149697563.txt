One of the most prevalent elements on the planet is carbon. Properties of allotropic forms of carbon, such as graphite and diamond are already well-explored but their other derivatives like graphene-based nanomaterials and carbon nanotubes, have emerged lately. However, the production of graphene and graphene-derivatives often necessitates the use of costly and toxic chemicals which affects both environment as well as human health. Although, with time polymer composites research has progressed to the point where multidisciplinary cooperation between scientists have been growing towards sustainable direction. In recent years, biogenic or green reduced graphene-derivatives were prepared and used for supercapacitor formation, wastewater treatment, as sensors, drug delivery tool and other related fields. Even though it is still in its initial phases of research, it has shown remarkable promise as in some cases they outperformed prior carbon-based nanomaterials. Therefore, this review focuses of recent promising advancement of graphene nanoparticles in various fields, synthesized using green, cost effective and easy approaches. And in the end, we concluded by addressing the existing challenges and future directions in for commercialized use of graphene nanocomposites.
