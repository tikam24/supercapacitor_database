In this study, novel MXene/N, S doped graphene electrode composites were sucessfully prepared via the simplistic drop casting process. The successful etching of Ti3AlC2 was evidently confirmed by SEM and XRD technique. The effect of N, S doped graphene adding at various ratio on electrochemical performance was exaimed by cyclic voltammetry and galvanic static charge-discharge, revealing that the intercalating structure of MXene-N, S doped graphene exhibits the synergistic effect to enhance the electrochemical properties. Especially, at MXene/N, S doped graphene ratio of 95 to 5, the highest specific capacitance of 599.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 is obtained, which is greater than that of the pristene MXene (185.8 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) in 6M KOH.
