A simple room temperature method was used to synthesize Porous α-MnO2 nano whiskers bunch. The porous α-MnO2 /Activated carbon (AC) composites were prepared by very simple mechanical mixing method with varying amount of MnO2. A symmetric supercapacitor stack was fabricated using the prepared composite electrode material. The composite with 30% MnO2 exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of 107 Fg-1 at 1 mAcm-2 in non-aqueous electrolyte. The corresponding energy density was found to be 8.35 Whkg-1. The electrode also exhibits excellent cyclic stability. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society.
