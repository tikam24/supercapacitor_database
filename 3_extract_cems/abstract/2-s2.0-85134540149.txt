Ni-metal-organic framework (MOF)/nano carbon (NC) electrode materials were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. The prepared Ni-MOF/NC presented in the form of NC distributed uniformly on the Ni-MOF sheets, which effectively increased the specific surface area of the material and the rate of redox reaction. The Ni-MOF/NC electrode delivered 828 F/g at 1 A/g. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled by Ni-MOF/NC and active carbon retained 100% of specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, the ASC delivered energy density of 23.84 W h/kg at 849.74 W/g.
