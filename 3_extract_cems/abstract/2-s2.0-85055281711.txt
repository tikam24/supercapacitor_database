A simple, economical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method has been used for synthesizing 1, 2 and 3 at.% copper-doped strontium hydroxide over a stainless-steel (SS) substrate. X-ray diffraction reveals the orthorhombic crystal structure of polycrystalline Cu-doped Sr(OH)2. FTIR and Raman analyses explore the chemical bond analysis of the active material. The morphology of the Cu-doped Sr(OH)2 was analyzed by using SEM. This shows novel hierarchical-branched tuberose with flakes. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) also confirms the doping of Cu into Sr(OH)2. The electrochemical properties have been investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge−discharge measurements. It has been perceived that doping clearly affects the supercapacitive behavior. The specific capacity of the 3 at.% Cu-doped Sr(OH)2 film electrode exhibits a maximum specific capacity of 817 C g−1 at 0.4 mA cm−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, but has a low cycle stability. The 2 at.% Cu-doped sample shows high cycle stability by retrieving 71 % of its capacity after 5000 cycles. The relationship between the doping concentration and supercapacitive behavior has also been discussed. The good capacitive behavior and cycle stability of the Cu-doped Sr(OH)2 gives the new perspective for the flexible electrode material, which can be used in the near future as an energy storage material.
