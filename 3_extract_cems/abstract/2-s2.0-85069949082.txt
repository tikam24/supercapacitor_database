Nature employs supramolecular self-assembly to organize many molecularly complex structures. Based on this, we now report for the first time the supramolecular self-assembly of 3D lightweight nanocellulose aerogels using carboxylated ginger cellulose nanofibers and polyaniline (PANI) in a green aqueous medium. A possible supramolecular self-assembly of the 3D conductive supramolecular aerogel (SA) was provided, which also possessed mechanical flexibility, shape recovery capabilities, and a porous networked microstructure to support the conductive PANI chains. The lightweight conductive SA with hierarchically porous 3D structures (porosity of 96.90%) exhibited a high conductivity of 0.372 mS/cm and a larger area-normalized capacitance (Cs) of 59.26 mF/cm2, which is 20 times higher than other 3D chemically cross-linked nanocellulose aerogels, fast charge-discharge performance, and excellent capacitance retention. Combining the flexible SA solid electrolyte with low-cost nonwoven polypropylene and PVA/H2SO4 yielded a high normalized capacitance (Cm) of 291.01 F/g without the use of adhesive that was typically required for flexible energy storage devices. Furthermore, the supramolecular conductive aerogel could be used as a universal sensitive sensor for toxic gas, field sobriety tests, and health monitoring devices by utilizing the electrode material in lightweight supercapacitor and wearable flexible devices.
