Here, we demonstrates the fabrication of binder free and very efficient supercapacitor electrode based on tungsten nitride (W2N) thin film on stainless steel (SS) substrate using reactive sputtering technique. W2N thin film as a working electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (163 F g−1 at 0.5 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4) along with excellent cycling stability. The binder free symmetric supercapacitor (W2N||W2N) device delivers a high specific capacitance (80 Fg-1) and long life span (90.46% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles) along with high energy (12.92 Whkg−1) and power (∼674 kWkg−1 at 9.36 Whkg−1) densities. These observed excellent electrochemical performances of the present W2N thin film based supercapacitor device, recommend it as a potential candidate for energy storage applications.
