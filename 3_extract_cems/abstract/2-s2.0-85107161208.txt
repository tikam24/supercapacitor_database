In this work behavior of polyaniline/molybdenum disulfide-manganese dioxide (PANI/MoS2−MnO2) composite on Glassy Carbon electrode (GCE) for supercapacitor applications was studied. For this purpose, the bulk MoS2 was exfoliated into few layer nanosheets with specific solvent then MoS2−MnO2 composite was synthesized using hydrothermal technique and hybrid PANI/MoS2−MnO2 electrode was fabricated employing electropolymerization technique. The ternary composite serves as an electrode for supercapacitor in both three and two-electrode systems which has more superior electrochemical properties compared to the binary complex. The supercapacitor electrode consists of MoS2 nanosheets as sub-layer support, MnO2 providing electrochemical performance and polyaniline improving high electric conductivity. The supercapacitor performances of the composite were analyzed by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Chronopotentiometry (CP) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analyses. The maximum specific capacitance of PANI, MoS2−MnO2 and PANI/MoS2−MnO2 nanocomposite electrodes was calculated 333, 358 and 479 Fg−1 at the scan rate of 5 mVs−1, respectively. Likewise, the applicable two-electrode device using electrode configurations composed of PANI-MoS2−MnO2//PANI-MoS2−MnO2 showed specific capacitance of 259 Fg−1 at current density of 1 Ag−1. Also, the electrode possessed specific energy of 35.97 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 500 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability of 94.1% after 4000 cycles at 16 Ag−1.
