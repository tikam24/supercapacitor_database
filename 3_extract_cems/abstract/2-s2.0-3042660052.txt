The influence of manganese precursors on the deposition rate of hydrous manganese oxide in the amorphous form (denoted as a-MnOx· nH2O) and the effect of oxide thickness on the electrochemical properties of a-MnOx·nH2O, for application as electrochemical supercapacitors, were systematically investigated in this work. The results showed that Mn(CH3COO)2·H2O is a more promising precursor because of its high deposition rate at much lower potentials in comparison with MnSO4·5H2O, MnCl 2·4H2O, and Mn(NO3)2· 4H2O. The capacitive characteristics of a-MnOx· nH2O were found to be independent of precursors, probably due to the fact that the mean oxidation state of Mn is not significantly affected by changing the anions of manganese precursors (from the XPS results). The capacity of oxide deposits was found to be proportional to the charge density of deposition (i.e., loading) of a-MnOx·nH2O when it was equal to or less than a critical value (ca. 3.5 C cm-2), while poorer capacitive behavior with a lower capacity was clearly found beyond this critical value. The a-MnOx·nH2O deposit with 3.5 C cm-2, exhibiting an acceptable capacitive performance, showed the highest capacity of energy storage for supercapacitors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.
