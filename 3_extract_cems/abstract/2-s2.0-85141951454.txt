Some of the major challenges for electronic skin (E-skin) are to achieve accurate and continuous monitoring of human activities/health condition, eliminating wired external power sources. The ideal E-skin should be ultra-sensitive, self-powered, conformal to human skin, and optically transparent for visual or aesthetic purposes. In this paper, a self-powered all-in-one transparent E-skin is constructed by integrating a flexible transparent supercapacitor (FTSC) as an energy storage device with a stretchable transparent strain sensor. The assembled FTSC uses oxygen-deficient molybdenum oxide (MoOx) nanowires and cellulose nanofiber composite as paper electrodes, achieving an excellent combination of high transparency and outstanding energy-storage capacity (12.1 mF cm−2) to drive the operation of the sensor. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of 1D nanowires bridging 2D nanosheets in the skeleton network provides the transparent strain sensor with ultra-high sensitivity (high gauge factor up to 220 under 1% strain), high signal-to-noise ratio, fast response time (≈50 ms), and excellent stability. The E-skin being conformally attached to various parts of the human body enables real-time detection of subtle physiological signals and joint movements.
