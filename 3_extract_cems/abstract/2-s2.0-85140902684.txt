Now-a-days hybrid electric are employed with different dc-dc converters. Here in this paper, a flux additive dc-dc converter is put forward and analysed. The collation with conventional strategies we attain an enhanced output gain. The input sources like photovoltaic and fuel cell while they both are considered for power supply as primary sources and the photovoltaics are implemented for charging the BSS. The application of photovoltaic improves the efficiency of the BSS. The photovoltaic cells voltage is used to fed the converter. The implementation of Super Capacitor improves the output gain. The proposed converter supplies the demand to load side by operating to power resources simultaneously. The power supervision is analyses and then it is employed in control methodology. A simulation model is implemented for analyzation and to prove the efficiency of proposed converter.
