MXene based 2D materials with larger surface area are hydrophilic, flexible, environmentally friendly, and have high volumetric capacitance. MXenes are excellent materials for hydrogen storage, electrodes, and energy storage devices due to their remarkable characteristics. Recent investigations have been reported on MXene-based composite materials with appealing properties for photocatalysis and solar energy uses. There are about 30 different MXenes with distinguished architectures and characteristics, and many more are predicted to emerge. This paper outlines and discusses various MXenes-based materials' characteristics and production processes. Additionally, it discusses different MXenes-based material uses in the energy storage sectors, including supercapacitors, electric double-layer capacitors, pseudo capacitors, photocatalysis, electrochemical, batteries, and solar energy applications. Furthermore, the role of the synthesis process, surface structure, composites with other materials, and the potential growth of MXene as energy storage materials were thoroughly addressed. An in-depth analysis demonstrates that MXene-based materials will play an important role in technologies related to energy storage.
