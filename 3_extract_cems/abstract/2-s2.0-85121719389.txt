The binary transition metal oxides or hydroxides have received significant attention as potential materials in supercapacitor applications owing to their unique characteristics. In this study, a binary cobalt-manganese fluoride hydroxide-CoMn(OH)F is assembled successfully through the crucial assistance of an ammonium fluoride agent in an alkali source of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). At a rational design, the CoMn(OH)F with fringed carnation-like morphology obtains a specific capacitance of 541 F g−1 (at a current density of 1 A g−1) in a three-electrode system and cycling stability of 84% after 15,000 cycles. Furthermore, an asymmetric device CoMn(OH)F//activated carbon in a two-electrode system not only exhibits a remarkable specific capacitance of 135 F g−1 (at 0.4 A g−1), a high energy density of 39 Wh kg−1, and a power density of 3.65 kW kg−1 but also maintains 91% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycling tests. These electrochemical performances demonstrate the considerable potential of the fluoride hydroxide CoMn(OH)F for supercapacitor applications.
