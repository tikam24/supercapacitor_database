This paper exploits the optimal allocation and configuration of hybrid energy storage devices consisting of battery and supercapacitor in power distribution networks with distributed renewable generators. The multi-objective optimization model is firstly formulated to determine the placement of the storage devices with the aim to minimize the bus voltage fluctuation and the required energy storage capacity whilst meeting the operational constraints. The multi-objective optimization is transformed into single objective optimization through using the target value normalization, linear weighted aggregation and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and addressed using linear weighted particle swarm optimization (PSO). Further., the optimal capacity configuration problem is studied to minimize the annual cost and meet the constraints., e.g., instantaneous power balance., energy spillover ratio. The optimal capacity configuration is determined through the simulated annealing particle swarm optimization (SAPSO). Finally., the proposed optimal placement of capacity configuration solution is evaluated through case studies using the IEEE 14-bus test distribution feeder and the numerical result clearly confirms its effectiveness.
