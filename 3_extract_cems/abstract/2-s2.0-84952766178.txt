This research paper cover optimization process a converting conventional AC supply system towards DC based industrial power distribution system with supercapacitor storage based power balancing functionality. Electrical power consumption reference data is based on 4 industrial robot manufacturing area with automotive industry specific production processes and respective electrical load examples. Improvement in energy efficiency by interconnection and energy exchange process of production equipment as well as peak loading reduction on supplying AC power grid infrastructure is demonstrated.
