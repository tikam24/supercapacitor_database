Free-standing thin carbon nanotube (CNT) sheets are challenging to handle and control for device fabrication. In this paper, we report on the inverse-ordered fabrication method from thick CNT sheets to thin free-standing CNT sheets. As proof of the concept, thin CNT sheets for a supercapacitor were fabricated from 200 thick layers. The results show that the thin CNT sheet was electrochemically stable and had enhanced capacitive performance. The smaller the number of layers is, the larger the specific capacitances we have (from 10.10 F g-1 to 51.37 F g-1). Energy and power density were increased from 0.50 to 2.57 Wh kg-1 and from 0.33 to 2.31 kWkg-1, respectively. This simple and scalable inverse-ordered method is capable to fabricate CNT sheets in various forms, allowing fast trials on various applications.
