The hierarchical porous N/O co-functionalized carbon (HPNOC) was scalably prepared by using the low-cost and renewable blighted grains as the raw material coupled with mild KHCO3 activation for electrochemical capacitors (ECs). The elemental N was in situ doped in the obtained HPNOC without any N-containing additives. Remarkably, the obtained HPNOC was endowed with a large specific surface area (about 2 624 m2•g-1), high pore volume (about 1.35 cm3•g-1), as well as high-content N/O functionalization (about 1.9% (in atom) N and about 10.2% (in atom) O. Furthermore, the as-resulted HPNOC electrode with a high mass loading of 5 mg•cm-2 exhibited competitive gravimetric capacitances of about 373.6 F•g-1 at 0.5 A•g-1, and even about 260.4 F•g-1 at a high rate of 10 A•g-1; superior capacitance retention of about 98.8% at 1 A•g-1 over 10 000 consecutive cycles; and high specific energy of about 9.6 W•h•kg-1 at a power of 500 W•kg-1, when evaluated as a promising electrode in 6 mol KOH for advanced electrochemical supercapacitors. More encouragingly, the green synthetic strategy we developed holds a huge promise in generalizing for other biomass-derived carbon materials for versatile energy-related applications.
