Activated carbons prepared by conventional processes have sufficient micropores but lack medium and large pore contents, resulting in low levels of electrochemical performance when used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. To solve this problem, hydrochloric acid was used to pretreat the enteromorpha raw material before charring. The acid treatment removed most of the impurity metals from the raw material, in which calcium alginate reacted chemically with hydrochloric acid to form eggshell initial pores and acid-soluble alkali metal ions reacted with hydrochloric acid to form irregular initial pores, significantly increasing the mesoporous content of the activated carbon. The experimental results showed that the specific surface area of activated carbon increased significantly after hydrochloric acid pretreatment from 2273m2/g to 3166m2/g and the pore volume increased from 2.10cm3/g to 3.82cm3/g. The mesoporosity increased significantly, improving the connectivity of the pore structure and promoting the diffusion of electrolyte ions within the material. When the current density was 0.1A/g, the specific capacitance of the acid-washed activated carbon was as high as 359F/g, an increase of 23% over the 293F/g specific capacitance of the as-built activated carbon, and the capacitor equivalent series resistance was very small, showing excellent electrochemical performance.
