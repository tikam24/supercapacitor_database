Graphene-based supercapacitors have been attracting growing attention due to the predicted intrinsic high surface area, high electron mobility, and many other excellent properties of pristine graphene. However, experimentally, the state-of-the-art graphene electrodes face limitations such as low surface area, low electrical conductivity, and low capacitance, which greatly limit their electrochemical performances for supercapacitor applications. To tackle these issues, hybridizing graphene with other species (e.g., atom, cluster, nanostructure, etc.) to enlarge the surface area, enhance the electrical conductivity, and improve capacitance behaviors are strongly desired. In this review, different hybridization principles (spacers hybridization, conductors hybridization, heteroatoms doping, and pseudocapacitance hybridization) are discussed to provide fundamental guidance for hybridization approaches to solve these challenges. Recent progress in hybridized graphene for supercapacitors guided by the above principles are thereafter summarized, pushing the performance of hybridized graphene electrodes beyond the limitation of pure graphene materials. In addition, the current challenges of energy storage using hybridized graphene and their future directions are discussed.
