In recent years, many efforts are devoted to enhance the energy density of supercapacitors without sacrificing its intrinsic high power density. To achieve this, high energy density aqueous lithium-ion capacitors (LIC) are demonstrated by employing phosphorus-MoS2/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide hierarchical nanosheets (P–MoS2/PANI/rGO HNSs) anode electrode via a simple organic/inorganic hybridization method. With the phosphorus and PANI intercalate into the adjacent MoS2 layers and then grow on the rGO nanosheets, the P–MoS2/PANI/rGO HNSs has enlarged and disordered interlayer structure and thus obtain improved Li-ion storage capability. Accordingly, an P–MoS2/PANI/rGO HNSs based LIC delivers an energy density of 56.0 Wh kg−1, when the power density is 0.45 kW kg−1. Moreover, the capacitance retention of the P–MoS2/PANI/rGO based LIC can be up to 93.5% after 30,000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1, showing great application potential for future electric vehicle.
