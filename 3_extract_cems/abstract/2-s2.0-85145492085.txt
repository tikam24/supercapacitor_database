Carbon nanosheets with heteroatom doping and well-developed porosity exhibit broad application foreground for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), but the simple and controllable preparation is still of great challenge. In this study, by using LiCl-KCl as in-built templates, histidine as carbon and nitrogen sources, and KNO3, K2SO4, KOH or Na2S2O3 as active agent, a series of N and N[sbnd]S doped porous carbon nanosheets are developed. Results indicate that, with the activator introduction, pore structures of the carbonized products are notably boosted, showing an astounding 30–244 % increase in BET specific surface area, and meanwhile, heteroatom with a content of ca. 12 % can be doped into the resultant carbon skeletons. Specifically, the NSPCN-800 (activated by Na2S2O3) with a large specific surface area of 1297 m2/g, a hierarchically porous structure composed of abundant micropores and mesopores, and a suitable heteroatom content (N: 11.9 wt%; S: 0.6 wt%) presents an impressive energy storage behavior as cathode for ZHSCs, including a specific capacitance of 165.8F/g, a specific capacity of 95.2 mAh/g, an energy density of 59.0 Wh kg−1 and a cyclic stability with a 82.6 % capacity retention after 5000 cycles. These performance parameters surpass numerous reported ZHSCs, making NSPCN-800 a very promising cathode for practical use.
