Supercapacitors have attracted significant research interest attributable to their exceptional properties such as ultrahigh power densities, outstanding rate capabilities, and remarkable safety standards, making these devices highly desirable contender for adoption as energy storage devices to fill the gap between electrostatic capacitors and electrochemical batteries. Supercapacitor as a high energy storage device with specified properties has a potential to contribute toward rapid growth of low power electronics such as portable and wearable electronic devices, high power reliant military application such as naval warheads and guided missile technologies and wider commercial application such complementary device in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Regardless of their superior power densities, energy densities of supercapacitors remained inferior in comparison to more commercially practical electrochemical batteries which is predominantly attributed to the limited electrochemical output of conventional electrode active materials. To further commercialize this technology immense research work is required to develop new/state of the art electrode materials comprising of carbons, metal oxides, conducting polymers, and their composites. This article discusses the fundamental of charge storage mechanism in supercapacitors (electric double layer capacitance and pseudo capacitance). Recent advances and cutting-edge research on some of the fundamental electrode materials such as carbon, transition metal oxide, and conducting polymer based electrode materials and their composites has also been deliberated.
