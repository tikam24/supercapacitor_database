The three-dimensional activated carbon network with porous structure was prepared by calcining and etching the platanus fluff with the aid of Co(NO3)Â·6H2O and KOH. The biomass porous carbon (BPC) derived from platanus fluff exhibited developed meso-macroporous structure and great electrochemical performance (175 F g-1 at 1 A g-1). Herein, the NiCo2S4/BPC was synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method and utilized as the competitive materials of the supercapacitor electrode. The NiCo2S4/BPC electrode displayed a better specific capacity than that of the pure NiCo2S4 electrode in the three-electrode device. Moreover, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) of NiCo2S4/BPC||BPC displayed a high energy density of 38.5 W h kg-1 at 738.1 W kg-1 within a wide voltage range of 0-1.6 V. It is noteworthy that NiCo2S4/BPC||BPC also showed superior cycling stability to NiCo2S4||BPC. Using BPC with a developed porous structure as a conductive substrate not only improves the electrochemical performance of NiCo2S4 but also provides new thoughts for the development of high-performance HSCs.
