In this work, we present a cellulose acetate membrane flexible supercapacitor prepared through a direct writing method. A carbon nanotube (CNT) and silver (Ag) nanoparticle were prepared into ink for direct writing. The composite electrode displayed excellent electrochemical and mechanical electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the CNT-Ag displayed the highest areal capacity of 72.8 F/cm3. The assembled device delivered a high areal capacity (17.68 F/cm3) at a current density of 0.5 mA/cm2, a high areal energy (9.08-5.87 mWh/cm3) at a power density of 1.18-0.22W/cm3, and showed no significant decrease in performance with a bending angle of 180Â°. The as-fabricated CNT/Ag electrodes exhibited good long-term cycling stability after 1000 time cycles with 75.92% capacitance retention. The direct writing was a simple, cost-effective, fast, and non-contact deposition method. This method has been used in current printed electronic devices and has potential applications in energy storage.
