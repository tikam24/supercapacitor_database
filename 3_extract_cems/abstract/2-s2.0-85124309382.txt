Not only are new and novel materials sought for electrode material development, but safe and nontoxic materials are also highly being intensively investigated. Herein, we prepare ZnNiBO3(OH) (ZNBH), a modified and Be-free KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) family member as an effective electrode material. The novel ZNBH resembles the KBBF structure but with reinforced structure and bonding, in addition to well-incorporated conductive metals benefiting supercapacitor applications. The enhanced electronic properties of ZNBH are further studied by means of density functional theory calculations. The as-prepared ZNBH electrode material exhibits a specific capacity of 746 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. A hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device is fabricated and successfully illuminated multiple color LEDs. Interestingly, even after being subjected to long charge-discharge for 10-000 cycles, the ZNBH//AC HSC device retains 97.2% of its maximum capacity, indicating the practicality of ZNBH as an electrode material.
