Polypyrrole/titanium dioxide(PPy/TiO2) composites (the mass ratios of polypyrroletotitanium dioxide were 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1) were prepared by chemical in-situ polymerization. As an electrode material of electrochemical supercapacitors, the electrochemical properties of the PPy/TiO2 were studied. Results of scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction indicate that TiO2 particles were uniformly mounted in the PPy matrix. Test results show that the electrochemical performance of PPy/TiO2 was significantly better than that of pure-PPy. When the mass ratio of PPy to TiO2 was 3:1(PPy/TiO2(3:1)), the electrochemical performance of the composite was the best. At 2 A/g charging/discharging current density, the specific capacitance of PPy/TiO2(3:1) reached 255.68 F/g, which was twice higher than that of pure-PPy. At 1 A/g charging/discharging current density, the specific capacitance retention rate of PPy/TiO2(3:1) reached 87.2% after 1 000 cycles, and the retention rate of pure-PPy was only 46.9%.
