To solve the problems of low power distribution efficiency and large voltage deviation of different energy storage units in microgrid hybrid energy storage, this paper proposes a flexible control strategy of microgrid hybrid energy storage based on adaptive consistency algorithm. Firstly, based on the research of the micro grid hybrid energy storage three loop control structure, the average bus voltage of the hybrid energy storage system can be quickly converged to the actual average voltage by introducing a consistency algorithm into the voltage tracking controller. Secondly, by introducing the consistency algorithm into the super capacitor controller, the anti-interference ability of the hybrid energy storage system can be improved to achieve the stability of the bus voltage and maintain the consistency of the super capacitor terminal voltage. Finally, the consistency algorithm is introduced into the battery controller, and the controller parameters are adaptive to achieve fast frequency division distribution of power for different energy storage units. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can realize the flexible control of hybrid energy storage and effectively coordinate the normal operation of micro grid.
