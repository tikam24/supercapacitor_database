The fabrication of flexible supercapacitors comprising highly conducting energy storage electrode material catering high capacity, energy density and longer stability without cell deformation is a challenging task. Herein, we develop unique g-C3N4.7/N-doped graphene nanocomposite electrode material which shows robust charge storage characteristics via reducing the interfacial resistivity. A flexible all-solid-state symmetric device is assembled by employing g-C3N4.7/N-doped graphene composite and redox active ([EMIM][BF4]/PVDF/KOH/p-phenylenediamine) electrolyte cum separator. It delivers a high areal capacitance of 141 mF cm−2, power density of 0.70 mW cm−2 and an energy density of 0.047 mWh cm−2 at 1.11 mA cm−2 current density with 98.9% capacity retention at 2.2 V potential till 18,000 cycles and nearly 95% Coulombic efficiency till 20,000 cycles. Bending angle-based performance studies indicate the stability of capacity at any bending angles (0, 35, 60, 90, 150, 180°). The key to the significant functioning of the cell is ascribed to the advantageous synergism involved in g-C3N4.7/N-doped graphene nanocomposite, high surface area and mesoporous structure endowing high electrode-electrolyte interface interaction sites along with enhancement in the electronic conductivity as evidenced.
