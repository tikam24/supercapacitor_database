NiMoS4 with an amorphous phase was deposited on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to form a NiMoS4-rGO composite through a facile hydrothermal process. To maximize the loading of active materials, interdigitated electrodes were patterned on a three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam using direct-laser cutting. The active material (NiMoS4-rGO) was applied into the interdigitated nickel foam collector, which exhibits a high capacitance (1000 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) in an ionic liquid electrolyte and superior cycling performance (specific capacity retention of 96.05% at 8 A g-1over 5000 cycles). Owing to the synergistic effect of three-dimensional nickel foam with the amorphous structured NiMoS4-rGO, the coplanar 3D micro-supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 69.51 W h kg-1 at a power density of 849.99 W kg-1, as well as an exceptional cycle performance (94.06% retained over 7000 cycles). The comprehensive performance of the coplanar hybrid supercapacitor developed in this study is superior in comparison with most of the previously reported ones.
