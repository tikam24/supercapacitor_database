The manganese oxide (MnO 2) nanowires and cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH) 2) nanosheets are successfully electrodeposited on nickel foam (NF), respectively (referred to as MnO 2/NF and Co(OH) 2/NF electrode hereinafter). Both electrodes show higher specific capacitance (Cs) and more excellent rate performance than that of most reported corresponding materials. In addition, our previous study of Ni(OH) 2/NF electrodes also exhibited conspicuous results. Combined with the outstanding properties of NF, it is noticeable that the NF electrodes may be a promising choice for supercapacitors. Â© Springer-Verlag 2011.
