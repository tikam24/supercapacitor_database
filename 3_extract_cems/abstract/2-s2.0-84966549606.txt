Supercapacitors (SCs) have attracted much attention as energy storage devices capable of accumulating electricity from renewable sources, as well as deliver high power to smart and portable electronic devices due to their fast dynamic response, high power density, and long cycle-life [1,2]. So far, nanostructured electrodes with pseudocapacitive materials have been widely utilized to enhance the specific capacitance and energy density of supercapcitors [3,4]. However, such materials typically have low electrical conductivity (10-5~10-9 S cm-1) [5,6], degrade structurally under rigorous reaction conditions [7], and have a narrow electrochemical window (<1 V) [8,9] which can lead to high internal resistance, large irreversible capacitance loss, and poor rate capability and, consequently, result in supercapacitors with limited power density. A promising strategy to increase power density has been to extend operating cell voltage by taking advantage of an organic electrolyte, or an asymmetric cell configuration [10]. In terms of cost and safety, aqueous asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are a suitable choice for commercial SCs [11]. Aqueous ASCs usually consist of a battery-type Faradic electrode for the energy source and a capacitor-type electrode for the power source, and employ aqueous electrolytes, which can increase cell voltage (up to 2 V) and hence improve both energy and power densities [11,12].
