Pseudocapacitive properties of SnO2 and Sb-doped SnO2 were determined in 0.5 mol dm-3 KCl solution. The samples were prepared by sol-gel method and analysed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE SEM). Rietveld refinement of XRPD data showed the changes in unit cell parameters due to the incorporation of Sb3+ into the host SnO2 lattice, while FE SEM pointed out the differences in morphology caused by doping. Specific capacitance values of 3.67 and 6.89 F g-1 were obtained for SnO2 and Sb-doped SnO2, respectively. Reaction mechanism of SnO2 that corresponds to the obtained mass change was proposed. It was shown that redox reactions of SnO2 and Sb-doped SnO2 are dependent on structural changes since different mass change properties were obtained in comparison to the previous reports carried out for other metal oxides.
