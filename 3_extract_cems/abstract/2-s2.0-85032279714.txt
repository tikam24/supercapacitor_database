Herein NaOH/urea aqueous solution was assisted to dissolve bamboo cellulose fibers for the fabrication of porous nanoplatelets wrapped carbon aerogel as an economic and sustainable way in application of supercapacitor. The architecture displayed favorable features, such as a large specific surface area and a great flexibility of 86% at stress of 23 kPa. The effects of the KOH activation on the morphology and porous texture of cellulose carbon aerogel were further investigated and correlated with their electrochemical behavior. In aqueous electrolyte of 6 M KOH, activated carbon aerogel exhibited a high specific capacitance of 381 F/g which was improved by 150% compared to unactivated sample. Notably, the reasonable micropores and mesopores contributed to an excellent retention rate of 90% at high scan rate of 200 mV/s. The low equivalent series resistance and small charge transfer resistance in activated carbon aerogel also suggested an inspiring capacitor behavior.
