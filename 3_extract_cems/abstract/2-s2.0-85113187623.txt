The design and preparation of a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) paper electrode with a reinforced concrete structure is an effective strategy to improve the mechanical properties of flexible electrodes. Therefore, PEDOT:PSS is added as a binder, toughening and conductive agent. CNTs, with good mechanical properties, are added to enhance the strength. Fe2O3 nanoparticles are added to increase the energy storage. According to these assumptions, we successfully prepared a flexible hydrophilic paper electrode with rGO nanosheets, PEDOT:PSS, CNTs and Fe2O3 nanoparticles by a constant temperature vacuum drying method. In addition, the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits a high capacitance of 1924 mF cm-3 at 1 mA cm-3, an excellent energy density of 35.6 W h kg-1 (at 166 W kg-1) and a remarkable cycle stability of 98.2% retention over 10 000 cycles at 1 mA cm-2.
