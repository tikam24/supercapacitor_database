In this study, we report on the rational design and facile preparation of a cotton-reduced graphene oxide-silver nanoparticle (cotton-RGO-AgNP) hybrid fiber as an electrode for the building of a flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSSC). It was adequately characterized and found to possess a well-defined core−shell structure with cotton yarn as a core and a porous RGO-AgNP coating as a shell. Thanks to the unique morphological features and low electrical resistance (only 2.3 Ω·cm−1), it displayed attractive supercapacitive properties. When evaluated in a three-electrode setup, this FSSC electrode delivered the highest linear and volumetric specific capacitance of up to ca. 12.09 mF·cm−1 and ca. 9.67 F·cm−3 with a satisfactory rate capability as well as a decent cycling stability. On the other hand, an individual parallel symmetric FSSC cell constructed by this composite fiber fulfilled the largest linear and volumetric specific capacitance of ca. 1.67 mF·cm−1 and ca. 0.67 F·cm−3 and offered the maximum energy density, as high as ca. 93.1 µWh·cm−3, which outperformed a great number of graphene-and textile yarn-based FSSCs. Impressively, bending deformation brought about quite a limited effect on its electrochemical behaviors and almost no capacitance degradation took place during the consecutive charge/discharge test for over 10,000 cycles. Consequently, these remarkable performances suggest that the currently developed cotton-RGO-AgNP fiber has considerable application potential in flexible, portable and wearable electronics.
