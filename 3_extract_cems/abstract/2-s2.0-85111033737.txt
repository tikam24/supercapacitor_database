The booming development of carbon materials is of great value for diverse applications, owing to their superior electron conductivity, unique structures, and excellent cycle lifetime. This study presents two hierarchically structured amorphous carbon materials for asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device: i) the MOFs-derived urchin-like amorphous carbon anchored on nickel foam (UAC@NF) as positive electrode; ii) high temperature activated graphite carbon felt (GF500) as negative electrode. This ASC device achieves a higher energy density of 0.036 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 0.984 mW cm−3 and demonstrates better cycling performance with 91.4% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles, compared with the other carbon-based supercapacitor. In addition, the UAC@NF after 10,000 cycles displays much better adsorption performance for Pb (II) compared with the unused UAC@NF. We have demonstrated the relationship between carbon materials’ structure and performance by combining experiment and theoretical calculation. Predominantly, our work can provide a new direction for the common development of amorphous carbon materials in the field of energy and environment.
