Hybrid supercapacitor-battery is one of the most attractive material candidates for high energy as well as high power density rechargeable lithium (Li) as well as sodium ion (Na) batteries. Mostly two types of hybrids are being actively studied for electric vehicles and storage of renewable energies. Internal serial hybrid is an asymmetric electrochemical capacitor with one electric double-layer capacitor and another battery-type electrode. On the other hand, in internal parallel hybrids, supercapacitor and battery materials are mixed together to form bi-material-type electrode. A brief literature review provides the state of the art of various asymmetric electrochemical capacitors reported in recent times. Subsequently we have described the role of current densities and electrode potential window in designing the internal serial hybrid electrodes. Mass ratio between the two electrodes grossly influences the electrochemical performance of internal serial hybrids. Theoretical basis of the calculation of voltage, specific capacitance, energy, and power densities of internal serial hybrid has been described in detail. The theoretically estimated parameters match quite well with the experimentally obtained values for activated carbon (AC)//lithium nickel manganese oxide (LNMO) asymmetric electrochemical capacitor made in our laboratory. As compared to serial hybrid, limited reports are available on internal parallel hybrid for Li-and/or Na-ion batteries. A brief literature review on this type of hybrids is made to illustrate the outstanding research issues of this type of hybrids. We have reported excellent electrochemical performance of sodium vanadium phosphate (Na3V2(PO4)3)-activated carbon (AC) bi-material electrodes for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries.
