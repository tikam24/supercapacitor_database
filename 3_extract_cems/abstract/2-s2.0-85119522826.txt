This paper proposes a novel integrated multiport bidirectional dc-dc converter to interface the battery, the ultra-capacitor, the fuel cell, or other energy sources with the dc-link capacitor of the hybrid energy systems such as the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and fuel cell vehicle (FCV) applications. The proposed converter can be applied to the distributed generation systems which include local energy sources, storage, and loads. It can perform both buck and boost functions with fewer switches. In addition, it is extendable when more inputs and/or outputs are required. The operating principle and control strategy of the proposed converter will be analyzed in detail. For verification, simulation, and experimental results of the four utilized operating modes of an HEV/FCV are provided.
