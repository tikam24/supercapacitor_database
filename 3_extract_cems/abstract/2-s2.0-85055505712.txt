Walnut shell was used as a raw material to prepare activated carbon with low cost and high surface area at different temperatures (700, 800, 900 â„ƒ) by KOH activation. The surface morphology was observed by SEM. The graphitization degree of activated carbon was studied by XRD and Raman. The pore structure was studied by N2 adsorption/desorption. The experimental results show that the specific surface area of AC-3-800 is up to 2149 m2/g and the average pore size is 1.93 nm. Under the current density of 0.5 A/g, the specific capacitance of the supercapacitor is as high as 215 F/g. Supercapacitor shows good cycle stability, which indicates that the activated carbon is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor.
