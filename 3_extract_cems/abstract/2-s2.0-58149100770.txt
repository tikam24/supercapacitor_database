In this paper, a study has been performed for optima] design and development of dynamic voltage compensation system using supercapacitor to solve voltage sag which are considered the dominant disturbances affecting power quality. Supercapacitor is employed to compensate dynamically for the voltage sag of system with sensitive load. With the prolific use of semiconductor devices in electrical equipment, modern-day loads are becoming increasingly sensitive to the sags and the disturbances prove to be costly to industries. As a technology -driven custom power installation, the Dynamic Voltage Compensation System is recognized to be most effective equipment that can be used to counter the voltage sag problem. Hence, this paper proposes the high-performance optimal design of Dynamic Voltage compensation system which can efficiently compensate the instantaneous voltage sag and instantaneous interruption of the utility voltage source. This DVR system consists of a dynamic voltage converter in series with the supply voltage and high-efficiency controller of energy storage device using Supercapacitor. Recently, in energy storage systems, the Supercapacitor is paid attention as a new environmentally friendly energy storage element. This capacitor stores higher energy density than the conventional electrolytic capacitor. Also, this capacitor has a lot of advantages such as maintenance-free, longer life cycle and faster charge-discharge time than the conventional battery system. However, the Supercapacitor for Dynamic Voltage Compensation System must have each charge-discharge controller to control, a series-parallel switching circuit to use energy effectively with application of several compensation techniques for optimal operating. Therefore, in this paper, optimal development of On-line type Dynamic Voltage Compensation Systems is proposed. Â© 2008 IEEE.
