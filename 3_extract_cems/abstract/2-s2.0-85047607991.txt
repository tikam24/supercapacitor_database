3D N-doped carbon nanowires (NCWs) supported Fe2O3 nanocubes as anode materials in supercapacitors were successfully synthesized from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on flexible carbon fibers (CFs). Originating from the synergistic effect of Fe2O3 and NCWs, this anode exhibited high specific capacitance of 12.4 mF cm−1/39.6 mF cm−3 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 with excellent flexible property. An asymmetric supercapacitor based on our Fe2O3/NCWs/CFs anode demonstrated an extended operating voltage window of 2 V and improved linear specific capacitance of 6.1 mF cm−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. This asymmetric supercapacitor also obtained good flexibility and long-term stability with an energy density of 2.7 mWh cm−3. The high supercapacitor performance is attributed to the 3D N-doped carbon nanowires which bring higher conductivity.
