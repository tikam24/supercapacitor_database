The polyaniline/TiO 2/graphene oxide (PANI/TiO 2/GO) composite, as a novel supercapacitor material, is synthesized by in situ hydrolyzation of tetrabutyl titanate and polymerization of aniline monomer in the presence of graphene oxide. The morphology, composition and structure of the composites as-obtained are characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD and TGA. The electrochemical property and impedance of the composites are studied by cyclic voltammetry and Nyquist plot, respectively. The results show that the introduction of the GO and TiO 2 enhanced the electrode conductivity and stability, and then improved the supercapacitive behavior of PANI/TiO 2/GO composite. Significantly, the electrochemical measurement results show that the PANI/TiO 2/GO composite has a high specific capacitance (1020 F g -1 at 2 mV s -1, 430 F g -1 at 1 A g -1) and long cycle life (over 1000 times).
