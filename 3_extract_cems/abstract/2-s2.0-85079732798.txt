Solar energy is one of the most abundant renewable energy sources. For efficient utilization of solar energy, photovoltaic technology is regarded as the most important source. However, due to the intermittent and unstable characteristics of solar radiation, photoelectric conversion (PC) devices fail to meet the requirements of continuous power output. With the development of rechargeable electric energy storage systems (ESSs) (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries), the integration of a PC device and a rechargeable ESS has become a promising approach to solving this problem. The so-called integrated photorechargeable ESSs which can directly store sunlight generated electricity in daylight and reversibly release it at night time, has a huge potential for future applications. This review summarizes the development of several types of mainstream integrated photorechargeable ESSs and introduces different working mechanisms for each photorechargeable ESS in detail. Several general perspectives on challenges and future development in the field are also provided.
