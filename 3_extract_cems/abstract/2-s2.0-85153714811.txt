In the power conversion system of electric vehicles (EVs), the double-input converter serves as a crucial component. Using a combination of battery and super-capacitor as energy storage in electric vehicles can greatly improve the vehicle's efficiency and prolong the battery's lifespan. The paper presents a novel non-isolated bidirectional dual input-single output (DISO) DC-DC converter. Its primary objective is to enable the efficient interfacing of battery and supercapacitor in electric vehicle applications. The proposed converter can perform bidirectional power control in both buck and boost modes. Compared to the conventional ones, the DISO converter has a simple structure, and it employs only five semiconductor switches, one inductor and one capacitor. The paper presents a comprehensive explanation of how the converter operates, its analysis and design, and an examination of various modes of power transfer that can be utilized. The simulation of the converter has been carried out on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.
