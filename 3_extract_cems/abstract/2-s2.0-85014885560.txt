An improved method for the extraction of supercapacitor metrics from a high pass filter response is proposed. Only Magnitude measurements at three different frequencies are required in order to extract the fractional-order model parameters of a supercapacitor. Experimental results from commercial 1F supercapacitors are presented and discussed with error analysis performed on the data.
