Nanoporous carbon (NPC) for electrochemical energy storage devices has gained much interest due to its high specific area and tunable porosity. Herein, Fe and Co co-doped NPC is synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method followed by carbonization of Fe and Co doped ZIF8 at 900 ℃ (Fe-Co/NPC-900). The structural, morphological, elemental, chemical bonding, surface area, and thermal degradation of the synthesized material have been evaluated using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method, and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The high surface area of 933 m2/g and nanoporous structure of Fe-Co/NPC-900 electrode results in a high specific capacitance of 900 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g. The cycle performance of Fe-Co/NPC-900 was remarkable with 88% of the capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 30 A/g. The high electrochemical performance of Fe-Co/NPC-900 is attributed to the hybrid doping of Fe and Co in nitrogen doped carbon network which offers a synergic effect in reaction.
