Using large Ti3C2Tx nanosheets (L-Ti3C2Tx) and aramid nanofibers as the assembled units and functional additive, the L-Ti3C2Tx nanosheets/E-ANF film electrode (T/E-A-10) with high capacitive performance of 332 F g−1 in 3 M H2SO4 electrolyte and good mechanical strength of 153 MPa was prepared. Also PVA/Ti3C2Tx nanosheet flexible hydrogel electrolyte with excellent antifreezing, long-lasting moisture, high ion conductivity and wide temperature working range was developed. A wide-temperature flexible all-solid-state T/E-A-10 film symmetrical supercapacitor (T/E-A-10 FSSC) was assembled by using T/E-A-10 flexible film as electrodes, and PVA/Ti3C2Tx membrane as hydrogel electrolyte and separator. The assembled devices not only showed a specific capacitance of 83 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, 92% of the initial capacitance after 4000 cycles, and a maximum energy density of 11.8 Wh kg−1, but also maintained good flexibility in a wide temperature range of −40–60 °C, it showed a promising flexible power source in the field of portable/wearable electronic devices.
