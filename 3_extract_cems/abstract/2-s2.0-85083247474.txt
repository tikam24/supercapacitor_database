In order to better understand the state-of-the-art in developing aromatic polyamide nanofibers, this paper summarizes the preparation methods for making aromatic polyamide nanofibers, including deprotonation, electrospinning and self-assembly synthesis. Focusing on the research in aromatic polyamide nanofibers composites for supercapacitor electrode materials, lithium ion battery separator materials, filter membrane materials and fiber reinforcement materials, this paper mainly scrutinizes the preparation methods and reviews the unique properties of aromatic polyamide nanofiber composites. Relevant research in this area has provided the theoretical basis for achieving the controllable preparation and structural modulation of these nanocomposites. Finally, the challenges of aromatic polyamide nanofiber composites were spelt out, and it was concluded that aromatic polyamide nanofibers have a good development prospect as novel nanoscale "building blocks".
