In this paper, a public transportation system is presented which is sustainable for different situations (according to the load of the grid and commuters) throughout the year. A large size battery (LSB) has been utilized in this work and is placed in between the grid and the electric bus stop (EBS). LSB is responsible to charge all the supercapacitor based buses (SBs) that run through the ring road of the Guwahati city, Assam, India. These batteries are also responsible for grid support in peak load hours. During off peak hours the batteries charge and during peak hours the batteries give the excess of energy back to the grid. A fuzzy logic controller (FLC) has been designed and which take care of charging and discharging of the LSB from/to the grid. This system's sustainability is checked with real time load data and commuter's data. This system is clean in use, environment friendly and grid friendly.
