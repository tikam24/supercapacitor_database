Polypyrrole/multi-walled carbon nanotube, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/multi-walled carbon nanotube and their nanocomposites P(EDOT-co-Py)/multi-walled carbon nanotube and P(EDOT-co-Py)/copper (II) oxide, (CuO) in the initial feed ratio of [EDOT]0/[Py]0 = 1/5 were electrosynthesized on glassy carbon electrode by cyclic voltammetric method. Their characterizations were performed by cyclic voltammetric, Fourier transform infrared-attenuated total reflectance, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersion X-ray analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the first report on polypyrrole/multi-walled carbon nanotube, PEDOT/multi-walled carbon nanotube, P(EDOT-co-Py)/multi-walled carbon nanotube and P(EDOT-co-Py)/CuO nanocomposite films were comparatively examined in 0.1 M NaClO4/CH3CN and in 0.1 M sodium dodecyl sulfate solutions. The highest specific capacitance for PEDOT/multi-walled carbon nanotube and polypyrrole/multi-walled carbon nanotube composite films were obtained as Csp = 306 mF × cm−2 for 3% multi-walled carbon nanotube and Csp = 804 mF × cm−2 for 1% multi-walled carbon nanotube, respectively. The highest specific capacitances were obtained as Csp = 27.40 mF × cm−2 and Csp = 26.90 mF × cm−2 for P(EDOT-co-Py)/multi-walled carbon nanotube includes the wt percent of 1% multi-walled carbon nanotube and P(EDOT-co-Py)/CuO includes the wt percent of 3% CuO, respectively. The Csp of P(EDOT-co-Py)/CNT composite films were calculated as 9.43 and 11.49 mF × cm−2 for 3 and 5% multi-walled carbon nanotube, respectively. In addition, The EIS results were simulated with the equivalent circuit model of Rs(Cdl1(R1(QR2)))(Cdl2R3).
