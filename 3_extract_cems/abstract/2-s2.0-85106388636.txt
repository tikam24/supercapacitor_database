Three dimensional porous carbon materials(PC-1, PC-2 and PC-3) were prepared by hydrothermal carbonization with high activation temperature at different mass ratios of carbon to KOH(1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) using mushroom culture medium waste degraded wood as carbon source and KOH as activator. The samples were characterized by SEM, TEM, N2 adsorption-desorption, XPS, XRD and Raman spectroscopy, and the results showed that the material had larger specific surface area and more micropores, which was conducive to ion transport and charge accumulation. The results of galvanostatic charge discharge(GCD), cyclic voltammetry(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) tests showed that when the mass ratio of carbon to KOH was 1:1, the specific capacitance of PC-1 could reach 221 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, with rapid ion response, excellent capacitance performance, good cycle stability(after charge and discharge for 5 000 times, the coulomb efficiency was always over 99.5%) and excellent electrochemical performance.
