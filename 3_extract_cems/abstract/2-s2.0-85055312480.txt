Highly uniform and monodispersed CuCo2S4 ball-in-ball hollow nanospheres (HNSs) are successfully synthesized from CuCo-glycerate nanospheres (NSs) precursors via a facile two-step solvothermal process. The most influential parameter in anion exchange reaction between glycerate and sulfur ion is the solvothermal time, which plays a significant role in enhancing the structural and electrochemical properties. Impressively, CuCo2S4 ball-in-ball HNSs obtained through a sulfurization reaction time of 18 h show high capacitance (442 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1) and superior electrochemical stability (84.5% at 5 A g−1 after 5000 cycles), which can realize high-performance materials for supercapacitors.
