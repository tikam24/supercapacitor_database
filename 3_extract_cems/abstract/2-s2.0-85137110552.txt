Because of their rapid charging and discharging, high power densities, and excellent cycling life stabilities, supercapacitors have great potential for use in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and for grid frequency modulation. The growing need for supercapacitors that are both efficient and ecologically friendly has generated curiosity in developing sustainable biomass-based electrode materials and electrolytes. Lignin, an aromatic polymer with remarkable electroactive redox characteristics and a large number of active functional groups, is one such candidate for use in renewable supercapacitors. Because its chemical structure features an abundance of quinone groups, lignin undergoes various surface redox processes, storing and releasing both electrons and protons. Accordingly, lignin and its derivatives have been tested as electroactive materials in supercapacitors. This review discusses recent examples of supercapacitors incorporating electrode materials and electrolytes derived from lignin, focusing on the pseudocapacitance provided by the quinone moieties, with the goal of encouraging the use of lignin as a raw material for high-value applications. Employing lignin and its derivatives as active materials in supercapacitor electrodes and as a redox additive in electrolytes has the potential to minimize environmental pollution and energy scarcity while also providing economic benefits.
