Electric Double Layered Capacitors (EDLC), coinmercially known as ultracapacitors or supercapacitors, have many advantages over batteries including high power density, ability to charge and discharge significantly faster, longer hfe cycle, and lower cost. Effective implementation of an ultracapacitor bank requires the ability to sense and understand causes of failure in the forms of overvohage, overcurrent, and temperature. The purpose of developing a test system for ultracapacitors is to define optimal and safe operating conditions of the cell bank. The EDLC test system includes a SPICE model to predict the behaviour of the cells to be evaluated as well as a physical system that provides the source and load for charging and discharge as well as a data acquisition system. The configuration allows the charging source, discharging load, and the measurement sensors for the EDLCs to be changed independent of each other. This allows the system to be easily scaled for varying capacity EDLCs or multiple cells. It also supports varying charge methods by incorporating an independent charge source. Preliminary testing using a constant vohage charging method has displayed the proper operation of the measurement system and verified the predictions of the simulation model. This proves the system can provide the comprehensive EDLC characteristic set required to effectively design and implement a fiill scale system to supplement the battery power in our electric mass transit vehicle.
