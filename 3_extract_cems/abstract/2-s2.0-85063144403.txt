Self-powered charging systems in conjunction with renewable energy conversion and storage devices have attracted promising attention in recent years. In this work, a prolific approach to design a wind/solar-powered rechargeable high-energy density pouch-type hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is proposed. The pouch-type HSC is fabricated by engineering nature-inspired nanosliver (nano-Ag) decorated Ni 0.67 Co 0.33 S forest-like nanostructures on Ni foam (nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam) as a battery-type electrode and porous activated carbon as a capacitive-type electrode. Initially, the core–shell-like NCS FNs/Ni foam is prepared via a single-step wet-chemical method, followed by a light-induced growth of nano-Ag onto it for enhancing the conductivity of the composite. Utilizing the synergistic effects of forest-like nano-Ag@NCS FNs/Ni foam as a composite electrode, the fabricated device shows a maximum capacitance of 1104.14 mF cm −2 at a current density of 5 mA cm −2 and it stores superior energy and power densities of 0.36 mWh cm −2 and 27.22 mW cm −2 , respectively along with good cycling stability, which are higher than most of previous reports. The high-energy storage capability of HSCs is further connected to wind fans and solar cells to harvest renewable energy. The wind/solar charged HSCs can effectively operate various electronic devices for a long time, enlightening its potency for the development of sustainable energy systems.
