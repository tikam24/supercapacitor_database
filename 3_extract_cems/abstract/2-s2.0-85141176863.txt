As electric vehicles (EVs) are evolving, innovative technologies like “energized composite” that can store energy in the car's body helps extend its range per charge. The composite's unique ability to function as both structural body panel and charge storage medium stems from its unique pattern design between “electrochemical areas (EcA)” and “epoxy area (EpA)”. Herein, a design optimization study is presented to obtain a balanced ratio between EcA versus EpA to maximize the charge storage ability of the composite while maintaining a decent tensile and bending strength. Simulations using ANSYS software and experimental confirmation using universal testing machines and electrochemical analyzers are used to derive optimum ratios between EcA and EpA. Uniaxial tension test and 3-point bend test have been performed to optimize the tensile and bend strengths, whereas cyclic voltammetry, galvanic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to determine the electrochemical performance of various design configurations by modulating the ratios of EcA versus EpA. Overall, the highest achieved energy storage per lamina is 2531 mWh m−2 for a maximum of 81.6% EcA with a tensile strength of 417.73 MPa and bending strength of 263.13 MPa. This study is highly beneficial for EVs and aerospace applications.
