Part of this work consisted of developing the electrode fabrication and testing protocols for investigating CNT-based supercapacitor electrodes. Our initial results showed that using Al current collectors with a nitric acid electrolyte was not a viable system. While the Al current collector electrodes were stable in dilute nitric acid, the measured capacitances were low, presumably due to electrolyte resistance. At higher concentration, the electrodes were no longer stable. After switching to Ni current collectors and KOH electrolyte, our electrodes were stable and yielded useful capacitance data. A comparison of electrodes formed by airbrush deposition of various commercial CNT solutions yielded a wide range of specific capacitances. In particular, solutions that used surfactants and/or dispersants produced poor specific capacitances due to contamination of the CNTs, yielding poor porosity and conductivity. Electrodes made a solution of carboxylated CNTs and water only produced the cleanest looking electrodes and the largest specific capacitance of 53 F/g. Further experiments are underway to determine what role the fabrication process, itself, has on the specific capacitance achieved. Â© 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.
