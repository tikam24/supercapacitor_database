For most graphene electrodes, there is usually a disappointing trade-off relationship between gravimetric and volumetric capacitive characteristics, which is definitely a major stumbling block in the development of real-life supercapacitors with high energy density. Herein, we rationally designed a hierarchically porous and modestly packed diamine pillared graphene, which is achieved by a facile and straightforward reaction between commercialized bulk graphite fluoride and in situ generated diamine anions. Combined reliable characterization studies demonstrate that an advantageous reductive defluorination of the unsubstituted carbon-fluorine units (C-F x ) accompanies the foreseen substitution of C-F x by diamines, endowing the resultant products with recovered 2D π-conjugation and high conductivity. In comparison to ethylenediamine and p-phenylenediamine, pseudocapacitive 4,4′-oxydianiline (ODA) molecular pillars, having a bulky and rigid geometry, provide the ODA-G product with a greatly widened d-spacing (6.2 Å), large wettable and electrolyte-accessible specific surface area (1985 m 2 g −1 ), hierarchically porous and interconnected structuration, heavyweight nature (density of 1.08 g cm −3 ), etc. Consequently, the symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using ODA-G as both electrodes delivers an impressive gravimetric capacitance of 328.5 F g −1 and a maximized volumetric capacitance of 354.8 F cm −3 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 , whilst exhibiting a remarkable rate capability and cycling stability. Apart from an exceptional gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density of the ODA-G device is as high as 19.5 W h L −1 at a large power density of 9093 W L −1 . It is notable that this contribution deepens our insight into the chemistry of graphite fluoride, and can guide the judicious design and synthesis of versatile functionalized graphene applicable to other electrochemical energy-storage systems, or the newly-emerging photothermal water evaporation, desalination, etc.
