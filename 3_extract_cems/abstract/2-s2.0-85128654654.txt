The high theoretical specific capacitance, quick redox rate, and superior electrical conductivity of transition metal sulfide materials have pushed their future use in supercapacitor electrodes to the forefront. With diethanolamine as a chelator and solvent, NiS nanoflakes were grown on electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in a one-step hydrothermal procedure. The optimized NiS/CNFs-2 electrode has a high specific capacity (133.3 mAh g-1at 1 A g-1) and an outstanding rate performance (70.62% at 10 A g-1). Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled using a NiS/CNFs-2 cathode and an activated carbon anode delivers an energy density of 22.35 W h kg-1and a power density of 750.8 W kg-1
