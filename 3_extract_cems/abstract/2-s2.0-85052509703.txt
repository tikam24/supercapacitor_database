Bi-doped α-MnO2 nanorods were synthetized by a hydrothermal method. Their crystal structures and electrochemical performance were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results suggest that the bismuth element is doped into the crystal lattice of α-MnO2. The electrochemical performance of Bi-doped α-MnO2 is notably improved compared with that of pure α-MnO2. The specific capacitance of Bi-doped α-MnO2 nanorods can reach 265 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, which is 1.05 times higher than that of no Bi-doped α-MnO2 (129 F/g) synthesized under the same conditions. The capacity retention ratio of Bi-doped α-MnO2 nanorods can reach 95% after 2000 cycles, higher than that of the no Bi-doped α-MnO2 synthesized under the same conditions. Therefore, Bi doping is helpful to improve the performance of α-MnO2 as electrode materials for supercapacitor.
