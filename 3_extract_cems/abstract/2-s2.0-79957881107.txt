This paper focuses on energy management of a hybrid system which includes a wind generator as a primary energy source, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as energy source with slow dynamics and a supercapacitor (SC) as a fast dynamics storage system. All these devices are connected to a common DC bus and a variable load. The objective of this work is to elaborate a control algorithm of the hybrid power source in all operating modes. This control strategy ensures an energy production continuity to satisfy the needs of the supplied site. The simulation results presented in this paper show the efficiency of the applied control strategy. Â© 2011 IEEE.
