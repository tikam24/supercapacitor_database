This paper presents the establishment and operation control of a dc microgrid incorporating with electric vehicle (EV) as movable energy storage. The developed microgrid consists of a wind permanent-magnet synchronous generator ac source and a dc source, a battery/supercapacitor (SC)/flywheel hybrid energy storage system, and a grid-connected bidirectional single-phase three-wire (1P3W) load inverter. Various harvested ac and dc sources can be plugged into the microgrid via the developed interfaced power converters. In addition to good microgrid operation performance, the microgrid-togrid and grid-to-microgrid operations can be successfully conducted with good power quality. As to the developed EV interior permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive, the SC auxiliary storage is equipped to assist the main battery source in intermittent energy conversion. Satisfactory acceleration/deceleration/reversible and regenerative braking operation characteristics are obtained via the developed power stages and control schemes. Moreover, the successful microgrid-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-microgrid interconnected operations of EV and microgrid are achieved. In addition, the vehicle-to-grid/grid-to-vehicle operations can be also performed via the developed 1P3W inverter.
