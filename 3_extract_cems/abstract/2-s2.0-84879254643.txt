The Co(II)1-xCo(III)x(OH)2-y (NO3)x+y precursor was synthesized by a chemical co-precipitation method. The Co3O4 nanoparticles were obtained when the precursor was calcined. The components, structure and morphology of products were analyzed by FT-IR and X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), respectively. The electrochemical performances of the as-prepared nanoparticles were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge/discharge techniques. The results showed that Co3O4-300 has excellent electrochemical performances, and its specific capacitance as single electrode is up to 338 F/g and remains at about 93% of the initial value after 1000 cycles at current density of 1 A/g. It is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
