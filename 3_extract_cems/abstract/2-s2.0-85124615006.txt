Ultratransparent electrodes have attracted considerable attention in optoelectronics and energy technology. However, balancing energy storage capability and transparency remains challenging. Herein, an in situ strategy employing a temporally and spatially shaped femtosecond laser is reported for photochemically synthesizing of MXene quantum dots (MQDs) uniformly attached to laser reduced graphene oxide (LRGO) with exceptional electrochemical capacitance and ultrahigh transparency. The mechanism and plasma dynamics of the synthesis process are analyzed and observed at the same time. The unique MQDs loaded on LRGO greatly improve the specific surface area of the electrode due to the nanoscale size and additional edge states. The MQD/LRGO supercapacitor has high flexibility and durability, ultrahigh energy density (2.04 × 10−3 mWh cm−2), long cycle life (97.6% after 12 000 cycles), and excellent capacitance (10.42 mF cm−2) with both high transparency (transmittance over 90%) and high performance. Furthermore, this method provides a means of preparing nanostructured composite electrode materials and exploiting quantum capacitance effects for energy storage.
