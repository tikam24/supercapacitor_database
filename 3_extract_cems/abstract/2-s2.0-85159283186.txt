Due to their exceptional properties, developing a new nanostructured material inspired by biomaterials is one of the most alluring topics. With the aid of L-cysteine, we synthesized a novel type of N and S-doped mesoporous carbon (NSC3) derived from Artocarpus heterophyllus peel that has a Swiss cheese-like structure. Capacitive energy storage differs from other electrochemical energy storage, which renders less charging time and delivers more power than batteries. Importantly, low energy density is considered a pivotal limitation to this technique, so considerable interest has been inducing pseudocapacitance to EDL-Capacitive material for efficient energy storage. The BET findings determined a high surface area of 1896.32 m2g-1 for NSC3 and transformation of micro to mesopore with a pore diameter of 2.86 nm from 1.92 nm with successive addition of L-cysteine. Trastii's plot delivers 36.6% as diffusion and 63.4% as EDL-Capacitive behavior for NSC3, also met the requirements of semi-pseudocapacitive type with an improved specific capacitance of 433Fg-1 at 1Ag-1 current density. Even at a high-power density of 6875 W kg−1, the constructed NSC3//NSC3 symmetric device delivered an enhanced energy density of 7.84 Wh Kg−1 and maintained 88.53% of its original capacitance for 10,000 consecutive cycles.
