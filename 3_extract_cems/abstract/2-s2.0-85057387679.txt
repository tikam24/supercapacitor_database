In recent years, the graphene/polyaniline composites with excellent electrochemical performance have aroused extensive concern of domestic and foreign scholars. Graphene is of large specific surface area and double layer capacitance characteristics, while polyaniline is with high faradaic pseudocapacitance, the synergy of both makes the supercapacitance performance of the composites increase greatly. The preparation methods of the graphene/polyaniline composites and the influence factors of the capacitance performance were introduced, the constructing methods of three-dimentional structure of graphene/polyaniline composites were summarized, and the future research trends of the composites in supercapacitor fields were prospected as well.
