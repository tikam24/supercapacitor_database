The carbon nanotubes-manganese oxide (CNTs/MnO2) composite raw material was synthesized through chemical precipitation, and then was modified by the induction-coupled oxygen plasma source to get the improved materials. The influences of the modification effect on the morphology and constitution of the electrode material were investigated with SEM and FT-IR. An oxygen plasma exposure in the coupled plasma source for 20 min at 450 W and 30 Pa leads to a specific capacitance value of 260.2 F/g, i.e., 1.64 times larger than the initial electrode. Its ESR is 0.35 Ω, which decreases by 70.8%. The composite material modified by the oxygen plasma is an excellent electrode material for the supercapacitor that can be used in the electromagnetic launch system and other fields that require high power and energy density. © 2013 ASM International.
