Supercapacitors have been developed rapidly in recent years as a new energy storage component, and electrode materials play the most important role in the supercapacitors. Carbon materials with high specific capacitance, long cycle life and rich resources have already been the most powerful contender among supercapacitor electrode materials. Carbon electrode materials used in supercapacitors include activated carbon, carbon nano tubes and graphene, etc. The characteristics, application and development status of carbon materials are introduced. Preparing porous carbon with high specific surface area and electric conductivity is the main research field of carbon material electrodes.
