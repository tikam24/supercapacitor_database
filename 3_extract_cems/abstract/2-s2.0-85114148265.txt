A molecular complex Mo2O2(μ-S)2(Et2dtc)2(dtc = dithiocarbamate) is prepared and loaded onto carbon cloth (CC) through facile solvothermal treatment, followed by subsequent single-source pyrolysis. This results in a highly porous 2H-MoS2/CC composite with a sponge-like stacked lamellar morphology. Due to its high porosity and unique nano/microstructure, the MoS2/CC composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 550.0 F g−1at 1 A g−1, outperforming some 1T-MoS2based electrodes. The composite is further assembled into a symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor, which can be operated stably at a wide potential window and shows a specific capacitance of 127.5 F g−1at 1 A g−1. In addition, the device delivers a high energy density of 70.8 W h kg−1at 1 kW kg−1, which still remains 15.0 W h kg−1at 18.0 kW kg−1. 75% of the performance of the device can be retained after 8000 cycles. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to its novel nano/microstructures with a large surface area, convenient ion transport pathways, enhanced conductivity, and improved structural stability. Thus, this work demonstrates a highly promising dithiocarbamate-based single-precursor pyrolysis route towards the fabrication of metal sulfides/carbon composites for energy storage applications.
