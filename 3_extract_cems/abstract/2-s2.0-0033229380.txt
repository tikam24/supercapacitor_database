Potassium manganese dioxide KxMnO2+δ ·n H2O and amorphous MnO2 in a mild 2 M KCl aqueous electrolyte prove to be excellent electrodes for faradaic electrochemical capacitors. The KxMnO2+δ ·n H2]O materials were prepared by direct thermal decomposition of KMnO4 and contained a large amorphous/crystalline ratio. A sample decomposed at 550 °C gave a specific cyclic capacitance between -0.2 and +1.0 V/SCE of 240 F·g-1 , which corresponds to nearly one-third of the Mn(IV) ions participating in the faradaic reaction. Excellent cyclability at 12 mA·cm-2 was found for 100 cycles. On short-circuit, K0,31MnO2,12·0,63 H2O in 2 M KCl and pH 10.6 aqueous solution gave an initial current density of 0.58 A·cm-2 and a total released charge of 4.6 C·cm-2 compared with 0.32 A·cm-2 and 11.1 C·cm-2 for RuOOH·n H2O in 5.3 M H2SO4. Similar results obtained with amorphous MnO2 demonstrate that alkali ions can be used as the working ion in a faradaic supercapacitor, which frees the search for new materials from the constraint of working in a strong-acid aqueous medium. © 1999 Académie des sciences / Éditions scientifiques et médicales Eisevier SAS.
