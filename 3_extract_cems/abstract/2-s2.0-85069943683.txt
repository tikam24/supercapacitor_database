Supercapacitors have become the most significant energy conversion and storage system in recent renewable and sustainable nanotechnology. Due to its large energy capacity and supply with relatively short time and longer lifetime, supercapacitors breakthrough in advance energy applications. This review presents a comparative study of different materials, working principles, analysis, applications, advantages and disadvantages of various technologies available for supercapacitors. The aim of this article is to discuss the possibility of hybrid supercapacitor for the next generation of energy technology. The development of composite materials containing a wide range of active constituents (e.g., graphene, activated carbon, transition metals, metal oxides, perovskites and conducting polymers) by in-situ hybridization and ex-situ recombination is also discussed. This review consecrated largely the contribution of combining all materials (electrode and electrolyte) and their synthesis process and electrochemical performance. Enduringly, the potential issues and the perspectives for future research based on hybrid supercapacitors in energy applications are also presented.
