Pseudo-supercapacitors are electrochemical energy storage/conversion devices that show promise in various commercial applications. However, poor electronic conductivity, inferior power output, and poor cycling stability hinder development. To improve pseudo-supercapacitor performances, novel hetero-structured nanocomposites of Ni/Co/O/S materials are synthesized in this study using a hydrothermal electrochemical method consisting of hydrothermal deposition followed by hydrothermal electrochemical deposition at temperatures of 373 K, 383 K, 393 K and 403 K. Corresponding formation mechanisms of these hetero-structured platelet morphology materials are also proposed based on composition, morphology and electrochemical analysis. Among the prepared materials, excellent results were obtained in which the material prepared at 383 K (0.12·Ni 0.3 Co 2.7 S 2 /0.064·4Ni(Co) 0.25x (OH) 2 ·NiCo 6.67-x OOH) provided optimal capacitance (996 F g −1 (4.83 F cm −2 ) at 1 A g −1 (5 mA cm −2 )), good rate capability (57.9% retention even with 10-fold increases in discharge current densities), and high cycle stability(No specific capacitance decay after 12000 cycles at 1.6 A g −1 (8 mA cm −2 )). This material was also tested as the positive electrode of an asymmetric super-capacitive device with carbon as the negative electrode and provided outstanding energy densities (an energy density of 662 mWh·cm −2 (34.1 Wh·kg −1 ) was achieved at a power density of 5654 mW cm −2 (282.7 W kg −1 ) and an energy density of 330 mWh·cm −2 (16.5 Wh·kg −1 ) was maintained at a power density of 56534 mW cm −2 (2826.7 W kg −1 )) and excellent stability (device maintained full capacitive retention after 16000 cycles at 0.67 A g −1 (10 mA cm −2 )).
