Recent development in miniaturized electronic devices has increased the demand for power sources that are sufficiently compact and can potentially be integrated on a chip with other electronic components. Miniaturized electrochemical capacitors (EC) or micro-supercapacitors have great potential to complement or replace batteries and electrolytic capacitors in a variety of applications. Recently, we have developed several types of micro-supercapacitors with different structural designs and active materials. Carbon- Microelectromechanical Systems (C-MEMS) with three dimensional (3D) interdigital structures are employed both as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) or as three dimensional (3D) current collectors of pseudo-capacitive materials. More recently, we have also developed microsupercapacitor based on hybrid graphene and carbon nanotube interdigital structures. In this paper, the recent advances in design and fabrication of on-chip micro-supercapacitors are reviewed. Â© 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
