Cathode materials are important in determining the performance of a capacitive deionization cell. In this work activated carbon cloth (ACC) grafted with tungsten oxide was employed as cathode, which was first grown on ACC with a flaky morphology by a self-anodization method. The oxide was uniformly distributed over the surface of the ACC. The desalination capacity of the obtained material is deduced from electrochemical characterization, based on the preliminary stage, in the static 1 M NaCl aqueous solution over a potential range from âˆ’1 V to 0.2 V. The modified ACC attained an enhanced ion removal ability, which gives promising potential in the further application on removing heavy ions from the wastewater of industries.
