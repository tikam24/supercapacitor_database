We report on a study on the development of a self-supported membrane of carbon nanotube (CNT) mixed with MnO 2 nanowires as supercapacitors. Both single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) have been explored to serve as the electrically conductive networks to connect redox active MnO 2 nanowires. High-quality α-MnO 2 nanowires were synthesized using bulk α-MnO 2 crystals as the precursor by a facile hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of the as-prepared α-MnO 2 nanowires were characterized by X-ray and electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Supercapacitor membranes were prepared by filtration of mixture solutions of MnO 2 nanowires and CNTs at various ratios, forming entangled networks which are self-supported and directly used as supercapacitor electrodes without binders or backing metals. Cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates and charge-discharging measurements are used to characterize the supercapacitance of the CNT-MnO 2 nanowire membranes. The specific capacitance has been found to be increased by several times over that of pure CNT membranes after incorporation of MnO 2 nanowires. Copyright © 2010 American Scientific Publishers.
