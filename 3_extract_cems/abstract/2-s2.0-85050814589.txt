In this work graphene/TiCh, WO3 nanocomposites were synthesized by facile, surfactant free, in-situ microwave irradiation method, a quick but also are eco-friendly approach. The structure, morphology, composition and thermal stability of the composites were characterized by using XRD, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS analyses. The SEM and HR-TEM analyses demonstrate the spherical TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles intercalated on the graphene sheets. XPS studies confirm the binding states of the composite structure. The nanocomposites used as the supercapacitor electrode in three electrode system exhibited higher specific capacitance. The enhanced capacitive performance is due to the intercalation of TiO2 and WO3 nanoparticles on the graphene sheet. The in-situ microwave irradiation method brings a viable, low-cost and facile synthesis of different metal oxide/graphene based composites with promising properties as supercapacitors for energy storage applications.
