This research paper focuses on a prototype electric dynamic WPT operated scooter based on electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) to develop an ecological and extremely effective motorcycle that contributes to solving global warming issues such as the lack of natural energetic reserves. This paper describes a new type of ultra-capacitor electric scooter equipped with a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) future electricity system. Two transmission coils, a double-D coil (DD coil) and a spiral coil, are also discussed in comparison with each other. In addition, we are proposing the Multi Power Feed Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System to extend the travel distance. The design process of the system and the fundamental performance test results are also described and considered.
