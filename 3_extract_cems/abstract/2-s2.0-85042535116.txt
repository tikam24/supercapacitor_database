The development of integrated high-performance supercapacitors with all-in-one configuration, excellent flexibility and autonomously intrinsic self-healability, and without the extra healable film layers, is still tremendously challenging. Compared to the sandwich-like laminated structures of supercapacitors with augmented interfacial contact resistance, the flexible healable integrated supercapacitor with all-in-one structure could theoretically improve their interfacial contact resistance and energy densities, simplify the tedious device assembly process, prolong the lifetime, and avoid the displacement and delamination of multilayered configurations under deformations. Herein, a flexible healable all-in-one configured supercapacitor with excellent flexibility and reliable self-healing ability by avoiding the extra healable film substrates and the postassembled sandwich-like laminated structures is developed. The healable all-in-one configured supercapacitor is prepared from in situ polymerization and deposition of nanocomposites electrode materials onto the two-sided faces of the self-healing hydrogel electrolyte separator. The self-healing hydrogel film is obtained from the physically crosslinked hydrogel with enormous hydrogen bonds, which can endow the healable capability through dynamic hydrogen bonding. The assembled all-in-one configured supercapacitor exhibits enhanced capacitive performance, good cycling stability, reliable self-healing capability, and excellent flexibility. It holds broad prospects for obtaining various flexible healable all-in-one configured supercapacitors for working as portable energy storage devices in wearable electronics.
