Six electrodes with a varying amount (5, 10, and 15 wt.%) of conducting carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofibers (CNF) were fabricated and their performance evaluated against a control sample that was devoid of any conducting material. The goal of this work was to determine the correlation between electrode conductivity and capacitance in 1 M tetraethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) in propylene carbonate (PC) electrolyte. CNT electrodes exhibit the lowest electrical resistance, while CNF electrodes had the highest capacitance. The specific capacitance (120-140 F/g) increased monotonically up to 2.5 V. An inverse correlation between electrical resistance and capacitance was observed for various concentrations. The electrodes were characterized using CV, EIS, SEM, and BET analysis.
