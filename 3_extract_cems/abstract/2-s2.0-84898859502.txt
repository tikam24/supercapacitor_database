In this article, authors are describing possibility of supercapacitor usage for supplying emergency luminaires. Basic facts about modern supercapacitors and fundamental characteristics are provided initially. Analysis of usage such supercapacitors in emergency lighting and suitable luminaires (LED) follow. For this purpose authors made capacity calculation and simulation of discharging characteristic. Then results of capacity and consumption are described. Finally pros and cons of supercapacitor usage are summarized, with prediction of the future growth. Copyright © (2013) by VŠB.
