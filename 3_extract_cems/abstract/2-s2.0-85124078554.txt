The operation of an induction electric drive of mining in the regions of Central and Central Asia is complicated by the fact that these facilities are located in areas remote from industrial networks. Because of this, the length of power lines can exceed the permissible length and there is a significant voltage drop in the network. The work developed a model of a three-phase frequency-controlled induction electric drive in Simulink MATLAB 2019 converted into a two-phase model. It is proposed to compensate the voltage drop in the network in starting modes under load using supercapacitors as a buffer power supply connected to the output of a DC link in a frequency converter. Simulation modeling was carried out at various supply voltages and various methods of connecting the supercapacitor unit. It was found that such a principle of implementing an additional source of electrical energy allows starting of induction electric drives in areas remote from industrial networks without significantly affecting their static and dynamic characteristics.
