The increasing demand for wearable electronic devices has resulted in tremendous progress in research on energy harvesting and storage devices/technologies. Energy storage devices require a power source to charge them, whereas energy harvesting devices require a storage compartment to store the harvested energy for sustainable delivery. Recently, a piezoelectrically driven self-charging supercapacitor power cell (SCSPC) was developed to harvest and store electrical energy in a solitary system to determine the potential impact of these two types of energy devices for wearable electronic applications. This review describes the recent advances in piezoelectric-driven SCSPCs in terms of device configuration, piezoelectric separator, electrolyte types, electrode materials, current collectors, and system integration. This review focuses specifically on the principles and mechanism of the self-charging process that occurred in the SCSPCs and the use of a promising piezo electrochemical spectroscopic tool to realize the piezo electrochemical energy transfer and storage process in the SCSPCs. Further, the current challenges and new perspectives for future developments in the emerging area of SCSPCs or integrated energy devices are discussed.
