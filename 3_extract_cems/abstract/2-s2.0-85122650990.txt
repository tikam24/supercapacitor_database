Supercapacitors with outstanding power density, excellent cycle stability, extremely fast rate performance and environmental friendliness have been widely studied. The performance of supercapacitors is highly dependent on the electrode materials. In this study, Ni-Co-S system was selected and composited as electrode material. Firstly, the NiCo2O4 electrode was prepared by hydrothermal method, and it was then transformed into NiCo2S4 electrode by ion exchanging method. Then, with chemical bath deposition (CBD) method, the NiCo2S4@NiCo2O4 composite electrode with 3D network structure was obtained. Further electrochemical studies (CV/Charge-Discharge curves) and SEM images confirm the better specific capacitance and cycle stability of NiCo2S4@NiCo2O4 composite electrode than that of the single component NiCo2O4 electrode, showing great application prospect.
