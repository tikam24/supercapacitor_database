Graphene aerogel (GA) is widely used in electronic devices owing to its light weight, elasticity, and excellent thermal conductivity. GA has been prepared using various methods. However, the preparation process is complex and the thickness is hard to control, which limits its application. There is an urgent need for a new and simple method to fabricate graphene aerogel. Herein, we describe a novel strategy for fabricating GA via a vacuum filtration–ice template freeze-drying method. The stability of graphene oxide slurry (GOS) was changed by using hydrochloric acid (HCl, 0.12 mol/L), and then GA was quickly obtained by vacuum filtration–ice template freeze drying and graphitization. The obtained GA reveals a symmetrical hyperbolic structure in the vertical direction, giving it excellent thermal and electrical conductivity and good compression performance. The electrical conductivity is up to 14.87 S/cm and the thermal conductivity is 1.29 W m−1 K−1 when the density is 36 mg cm−3. The pressure only needs 0.013 MPa when the strain of GA is 50%. GA has considerable potential for the application of supercapacitors owing to the high conductivity and low density.
