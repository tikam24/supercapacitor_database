This paper describes the complete design and implementation procedures of a low-cost digital controller for a High Efficiency LED driver, using supercapacitors as the primary power sources. The main advantages of these Power LEDs are the high luminosity, high efficiency and long operating life. Due to these improved behaviour, the number of LED-based applications is continuously increasing. Nowadays, the cost of digital processors is constantly decreasing, and the trend is that still lower costs will be achieved in the future. In addition, digital processors offer extra features, e.g. communication protocols, software protections, and so on. Therefore, this study has an evident practical interest. Â© 2007 IEEE.
