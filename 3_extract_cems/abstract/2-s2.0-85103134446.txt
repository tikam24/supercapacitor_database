An efficient method that utilizes simple techniques, easy operation, and low-cost production to create flexible graphene-based materials is a worthy practical challenge. A rapid strategy for preparing flexible, functional graphene oxide (GO) is introduced using GO-ethanol dispersion filtration. The filtration process is highly efficient and drying time is significantly reduced by employing ethanol as solvent, due to the fact that ethanol is a volatile liquid. Freestanding GO papers can be harvested with ultralarge size (700 cm2), color variety, and writable characteristics. After reduction, N-doped graphene (NDG) papers still maintain good foldability with improved electric conductivity and porous structure. When used as an electrode for a supercapacitor, the flexible NDG paper device demonstrates good electrochemical performance even with size expansion and extreme double folding. Moreover, this NDG paper capacitor device shows a good electrosorption performance for capacitive deionization of sulfate and chromate in groundwater system. These flexible GO and NDG papers promise potential to facilitate the production of graphene-based materials for practical applications in energy and environmental related fields.
