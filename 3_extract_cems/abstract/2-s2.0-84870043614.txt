This paper presents the utilization of a battery supercapacitor hybrid storage (BSHS) in MicroGrid. The BSHS which is composed of batteries, supercapacitor module, BUCK/BOOST bi-directional converter (BBBC), and voltage sources converter (VSC) has the virtue of high power density and high energy density. With the control loop composed of reference current calculation block and BBBC controller block, the BSHS can compensate the fluctuating power from the renewable energy source such as wind turbine generators and photovoltaics in MicroGrid; and the BSHS can also extend batteries lifetime by optimizing its operating process. A 5kW laboratory system composes of a supercapacitor module (20F, 324V) and a battery module (124V, 10 batteries) is designed, constructed and tested. Experimental results verify the effective of the proposed control strategy and the excellent performance of the BSHS. Â©2010 IEEE.
