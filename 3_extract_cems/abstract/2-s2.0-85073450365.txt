Ultrasound irradiation is a technique that can induce acoustic cavitation in liquids, leading to a highly interactive mixture of reactants. In pursuit of high-performance and cost-effective supercapacitor electrodes, pore size distributions of carbonaceous materials should be carefully designed. Herein, fruit skins (mango, pitaya and watermelon) are employed as carbon precursors to prepare nanoporous carbons by the ultrasound-assisted method. Large BET specific surface areas of the as-prepared carbons (2700-3000 m2 g-1) are reproducible with pore diameters being concentrated at about 0.8 nm. Among a suite of the bio-derived nanoporous carbons, one reaches a maximum specific capacitance of up to 493 F g-1 (at 0.5 A g-1 in 6 M KOH) in the three-electrode system and achieves high energy densities of 27.5 W h kg-1 (at 180 W kg-1 in 1 M Na2SO4) and 10.9 W h kg-1 (at 100 W kg-1 in 6 M KOH) in the two-electrode system. After 5000 continuous charge/discharge cycles, the capacitances maintain 108% in 1 M Na2SO4 and 98% in 6 M KOH, exhibiting long working stability. Moreover, such high capacitive performance can be attributed to the optimization of surface areas and pore volumes of the effective micropores (referred to as 0.7-2 nm sized pores). Notably, specific capacitances have been found linearly correlated with surface areas and pore volumes of the effective micropores rather than those of any other sized pore (i.e., <0.7, 2-50 and 0.5-50 nm). Consequently, the fit of electrolyte ions into micropore frameworks should be an important consideration for the rational design of nanopore structures in terms of supercapacitor electrodes.
