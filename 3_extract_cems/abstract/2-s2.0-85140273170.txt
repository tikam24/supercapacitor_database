Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been playing an essential role in addressing the challenges of the flexibility in energy storage devices. However, the unsatisfactory electrochemical performance and poor electrical conductivity are often caused by insufficient physical contact points of CNFs. The design and implementation of unique electrodes are expected to overcome these issues. Here, the N-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers (NCNFs) hollow framework derived from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is fabricated, which is decorated with high conductive reduced graphene oxide rGO and single-crystal ZnO nanorod for engineering the binder-free flexible electrodes NCNF@rGO-x@ZnO. The obtained NCNF@rGO-7@ZnO electrode exhibits the desired specific capacitance of 473 F g-1. An assembled hybrid supercapacitor exhibits the high energy density of 35.16 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 747.2 W kg-1, and superior cycling life. Given these advantages, the NCNF@rGO-7@ZnO is selected as the electrode in a flexible and foldable supercapacitor. There is exceptional flexibility and no visible capacitance loss when the supercapacitor bending at different angles. Furthermore, a timer is successfully driven by two supercapacitor devices connected in series. Hence, a flexible binder-free electrode with excellent electrochemical performance can be obtained by engineering the structure into a hollow interconnected architecture and the rational design of materials.
