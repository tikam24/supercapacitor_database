Mn 3 O 4 thin films have been prepared by novel chemical successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Further these films were characterized for their structural, morphological and optical properties by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), wettability test and optical absorption studies. The XRD pattern showed that the Mn 3 O 4 films exhibit tetragonal hausmannite structure. Formation of manganese oxide compound was confirmed from FTIR studies. The optical absorption showed existence of direct optical band gap of energy 2.30 eV. Mn 3 O 4 film surface showed hydrophilic nature with water contact angle of 55°. The supercapacitive properties of Mn 3 O 4 thin film investigated in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte showed maximum supercapacitance of 314 F g -1 at scan rate 5 mV s -1 . © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
