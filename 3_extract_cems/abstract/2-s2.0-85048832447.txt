In order to improve the performances of the electric vehicle power supply, a Battery/Ultracapacitors Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) has been proposed. We have examined the HESS parameters for an EV configuration propelled by two in-wheel connected directly to the vehicle frontal wheels and a single EM coupled to a differential transmission system that drives the rear wheels. This paper presents a new energy management strategy for Battery/Ultracapacitor HESS to both parameters: Minimize the sizing of the HESS and maximize the EV drive range. To reach this purpose, it is adopted a genetic algorithm (GA) technique. Finally, the Pareto frontier including optimal HESS parameter groups has been obtained, which indicates that it is possible to reduce the HESS mass without harming the EV drive range.
