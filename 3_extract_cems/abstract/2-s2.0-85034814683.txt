Tuning porous structure of carbon nanomaterials has been found to be important for their performance enhancement in electrochemical energy storage applications. In this work we employed a natural nanomaterial kaolinite, which is abundant and cheap, as hard template to synthesis porous carbon nanomaterial. By tuning the structure of hard template kaolinite, we have achieved a template directed formation of holey carbon nanosheet/nanotube materials. This carbon nanomaterials with hierarchical in-plane and out-of-plane pores have shown electrochemical energy storage capacity of 286 F/g (equal to 314 F/cm3) at 0.1 A/g and 85 F/g (equal to 93 F/cm3) at 100 A/g, which is comparable to variety of reported carbon based electrochemical energy storage electrode materials.
