A self-adaptive supercapacitor scheme, suitable for energy harvesting applications is presented in this work. The structure is comprised of two supercapacitors, a small one and a larger one, four switches and the control unit. The critical parameters for the system's reconfiguration is the small supercapacitor's voltage level and the sufficient supply of the load. The system's design was carried out in 0.18um CMOS technology. This highly efficient architecture provides a fast supply of the load and output voltage pre-regulation.
