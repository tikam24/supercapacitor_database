This paper proposed a single-stage inductive coupled power transfer (ICPT) system with constant power (CP) outputs against load variation. Compared with conventional ICPT systems with constant current or constant voltage output characteristics, CP output characteristics can maximize the output power capability of the ICPT system, which is suitable for battery or supercapacitor charging applications. The proposed ICPT system uses an LCC compensation structure on the primary side and a switched-controlled capacitor (SCC) in series with a semi-active rectifier (SAR) on the secondary side. This paper also proposed a coordinative control method for the SCC and SAR to achieve a resonant secondary side of the ICPT system and adjustable output power by configuring the equivalent load impedance of the secondary side. Since the control scheme is based on a fixed operating frequency and real-time regulation on the secondary side, no wireless feedback communication is required. Moreover, all power switches realize soft-switching to reduce switching losses. Finally, simulation and experiment verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed model and method.
