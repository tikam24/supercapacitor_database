The relatively low operating voltage window is the main factor limiting the energy density of aqueous energy storage devices. The delicate design of heterostructured electrode materials can efficiently increase the intrinsic electrochemical performance through synergistic effects. For the first time, to broaden the voltage window of aqueous supercapacitors the synergistic effect between boroncarbonitrides (BCN) and built-in electric field existing in heterostructures is designed to utilize. Based on this design concept, MnO/MnS@BCN electrode materials are synthesized, in which the synergistic effect can effectively strengthen the storage of electrolyte ions on the electrode surface, thus inhibiting the electrolysis of H2O and eventually broadening the voltage window of aqueous supercapacitor. In MnO/MnS@BCN-based symmetrical supercapacitors, the voltage window of the device is extended from 1.2 V (single-component) to 2 V, with the energy density enhanced to 75.0 W h kgâˆ’1. The strategy blazes an efficient and convenient path to broaden the intrinsic voltage window of transition metal oxide supercapacitors.
