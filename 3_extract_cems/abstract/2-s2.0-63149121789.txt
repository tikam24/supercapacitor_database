The present study, conducted in the frame of the project SoS- PVi (Security of Supply PhotoVoltaic inverter), results in the development of a multi- functional grid- connected PV inverter adapted to a hybrid storage system combining a lead- acid and a supercapacitor. Two operation modes are aimed: the energy supply during network faults and the levelling of the PV production to reduce the impact on the network. This paper presents the different tests performed on the hybrid storage system in accordance with realistic use profiles. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
