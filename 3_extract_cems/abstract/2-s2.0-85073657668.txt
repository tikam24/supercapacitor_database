Nowadays, the needs of bendable energy storage components are growing to match with the development of wearable devices. However, it is still a great challenge to fabricate flexible electrodes to keep the balance between the mechanical property and electrochemical performance. In this Article, a two-step simple method is developed to prepare a type of free-standing paper-based electrodes assembled by polypyrrole, reduced graphene oxide, and air-laid paper. The as-obtained hybrid paper electrodes are mechanical flexible and lightweight with outstanding specific capacitance (1685 mF cm-2 at 2 mA cm-2) and cycling stability (capacitance retention of 92.8% after cycling for 5000 times). The all-solid-state supercapacitor is assembled, which has a remarkable areal capacitance of 1408 mF cm-2, and a high areal energy density of 147 Î¼Wh cm-2. These results indicate that the hybrid paper has significant potential for the future wearable energy devices.
