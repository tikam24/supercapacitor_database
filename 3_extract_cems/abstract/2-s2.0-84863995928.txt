Mesoporous carbon spheres have been fabricated from structured mesoporous silica sphere using chemical vapor deposition with ethylene as a carbon feedstock. The mesoporous carbon spheres have a high specific surface area of 666.8 m2/g and good electrochemical properties. The mechanism of formation of mesoporous carbon spheres (carbon spheres) is investigated. The important thing is a surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, which accelerates the process of carbon deposition. An additional advantage of this surfactant is an increase yield of product. These mesoporous carbon spheres, which have good electrochemical properties, are suitable for supercapacitors.
