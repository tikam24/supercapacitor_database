Increasing the efficiency of photovoltaic systems is possible by using short-term energy storage in the form of supercapacitors. In order to check the aforementioned assumption, a control system for a DC motor powered by a photovoltaic generator has been developed. The measurements showed that the proposed system improves the engine's operation, allowing it to start at a lower solar exposure and increases the energy efficiency of the ventilation system.
