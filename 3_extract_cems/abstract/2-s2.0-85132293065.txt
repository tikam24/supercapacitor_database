This paper describes an alternative solution for effective harvesting and usage of solar energy without using conventional batteries or conventional power source methods. Charging of devices at faster rates is one of the critical issues in the case of fast response in power electronics, in which conventional batteries are unable to charge the system at faster rates (charging time of batteries is very long, generally 345min). In this context, a new type of device, an Asymmetrical supercapacitor based automatic solar powered emergency lighting system, has been developed and is described in this paper. The device comprises a light sensor, an Asymmetrical supercapacitor bank, and the required electronic control circuit for making the system smart, having all control and function fully automatic. A conventional solar panel and Asymmetrical supercapacitors, fabricated in the lab, are used in this system for harvesting and storage of solar energy, respectively. The performance of the lighting system, including Asymmetrical supercapacitors, was studied and is also described in this paper. The system is build and tested with two Asymmetrical supercapacitors to provide light of 301m for 1.5 Hr on emergency. As compare to that of the battery, Supercapacitor coupled with simple LED circuits implies an interesting solution for this new type of advanced solar application.
