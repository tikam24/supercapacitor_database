MXenes, as a two-dimensional transition metal carbide or nitride based electrode material with excellent performance, shows excellent performance similar to graphene, which is considered as an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors. However, the application of two-dimensional lamellar Ti3C2Tx is limited by its low theoretical specific capacity and easy agglomeration between layers. Herein, through a simple hydrothermal synthesis strategy, we introduced three-dimensional (3D) Ni (OH)2–MnO2 nanoflowers between layered Ti3C2Tx sheets to form a unique 3D hierarchical pillared structure, which not only solves the problem of easy agglomeration between Ti3C2Tx layers, but also gives play to the advantage of Ni(OH)2 and MnO2 as the high specific capacitance of metal compounds, and this composite obtained shows the synergistic effect between components. In addition, due to its three-dimensional structure, Ni(OH)2–MnO2 nanoflowers can effectively hinder the accumulation of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets, thereby increasing their active electrochemical degree points and promoting the transport of electrolytes. Furthermore, the three-dimensional pillared Ni(OH)2–MnO2@Ti3C2Tx composite we prepared displays a large specific capacitance of 2523 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1. At the high current density of 10 A g−1, after 10,000 cycles, the electrode material finally maintained 88.1% of the initial specific capacitance, which proved its remarkable cycle stability. Moreover, the energy density and power density of the symmetrical supercapacitor (SSC) made of this composite materials are 36.3 Wh kg−1 and 421.5 W kg−1, respectively. All above results indicate that the easy preparation method, low cost, Ni(OH)2–MnO2@Ti3C2Tx composites with excellent performance will be suitable for different application scenarios of multifunctional and digital supercapacitors.
