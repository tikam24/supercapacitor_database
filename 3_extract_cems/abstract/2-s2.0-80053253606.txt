This paper aims to investigate the concept of high power density and wider voltage window supercapacitors based on graphene-conducting polymer electrodes. The high conductivity, wider tunable potential window, stability of the electrode material in the doped form, faster charge transfer rate, and short charging times in graphene (G)-polyaniline (PANI) systems, contribute to the design and fabrication of high performance supercapacitors. Novel chemistries were used to synthesize a higher electronic conducting nanocomposite material based on graphene and polyaniline. The G-PANI nanocomposites were characterized, where an interesting structure was observed using different ratios of graphene with the aniline monomer. The G-PANI nanocomposite materials has shown the specific capacitance of 300 to 500 F/g at a current density of 0.1A/g. Based on the present experimental findings, it could be conclude that the G-PANI polymer nanocomposite supercapacitor technology could be transformative, and could surpass the existing technologies when the present synthesized novel material approach will be taken.
