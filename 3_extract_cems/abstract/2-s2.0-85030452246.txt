This article proposes technical ways of reducing of the biggest disadvantages of using Li-Ion battery as traction batteries in the automotive world starting from the analysis of the battery behavior by its implementation in an electric vehicle and continuing with the case studies of hybrid systems based on battery-supercapacitor and battery-supercapacitor-fuel cell. The analysis will be done by comparing the power losses of the battery after running the FTP75 driving cycle. The influence of of the hybrid systems parts on the cost of the electric propulsion system it will also be detailed.
