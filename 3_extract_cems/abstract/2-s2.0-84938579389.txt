We present a facile yet effective two-step activation method to prepare a hierarchically porous carbon with natural shiitake mushroom as the starting materials. The first step involves the activation of shiitake mushroom with H<inf>3</inf>PO<inf>4</inf>, while the second step is to further activate the product with KOH. The resulting carbon is comprised of abundant micro-, mesopores and interconnected macropores that has a specific surface area up to 2988 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and pore volume of 1.76 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. With the unique porous nature, the carbon exhibited a specific capacitance of 306 and 149 F g<sup>-1</sup> in aqueous and organic electrolyte, respectively. Moreover, this carbon also shows a high capacitance retention of 77% at large current density of 30 A g<sup>-1</sup> and exhibited an outstanding cycling stability with 95.7% capacitance preservation after 15,000 cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The far superior performance as compared with those of the commercially most used activated carbon RP20 in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolyte demonstrates its great potential as high-performance supercapacitor electrode. The two-step method developed herein also represents a very attractive approach for scalable production of various functional carbon materials using diverse biomasses as starting materials.
