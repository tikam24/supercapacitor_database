In this study, Fe-Co-ZIF(iron and cobalt in the ZIF-67) with an earlier shape of ZIF-67 was synthesized successfully. After thermal treatment, the Fe-Co-ZIF precursor was turned into FeCo2O4 with polyhedral morphology. A comparative analysis was made with pure ZIF-67 oxide, finding its great improvement in the electrochemical performance. The FeCo2O4 showed a specific capacity of 510 F g−1 (52.42 mAh g−1) at 1 A g−1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, while it was only 273 F g−1 (28.1 mAh g−1) for pure ZIF-67 oxide Co3O4. The FeCo2O4 cycle life increased from 52.1% to 75.5%. These data suggested that this ternary oxide FeCo2O4 with polyhedral morphology could be used for supercapacitors.
