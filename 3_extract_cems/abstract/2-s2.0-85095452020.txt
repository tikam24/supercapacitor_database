Designing supercapacitor devices using different active materials is an effective approach for the emergent development of materials in the energy storage applications at the current scenario. Herein, a series of materials, Bi2O3, Ag/Bi2O3, g-C3N4 and Ag/Bi2O3/g-C3N4 have been synthesized and characterized for the examination of supercapacitor applications. The supercapacitance performances of the nanomaterials were in the order of Bi2O3 < g-C3N4 < Ag/Bi2O3/g-C3N4 < Ag/Bi2O3 and higher supercapacitance was observed for Ag/Bi2O3 nanocomposite (303 F gâ€“1) may be due to the effective play of silver doping in Bi2O3. Hence it is important to optimize the rational designing of these kinds of binary/ternary nanocomposites for the further development in the supercapacitor applications.
