Heteroatom-doped three-dimensional (3D) porous carbons possess great potential as promising electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors. Inspired by the inherent features of intumescent flame retardants (IFRs) with universal availability, rich heteroatoms and easy thermal-carbonization to form porous carbons, herein we proposed a self-assembling and template self-activation strategy to produce N/P dual-doped 3D porous carbons by nano-CaCO3 template-assistant carbonization of IFRs. The IFRs-derived carbon exhibited large specific surface area, well-balanced hierarchical porosity, high N/P contents and interconnected 3D skeleton. Benefitting from these predominant characteristics on structure and composition, the assembled supercapacitive electrodes exhibited outstanding electrochemical performances. In three-electrode 6 M KOH system, it delivered high specific capacitances of 407 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and good rate capability of 61.2% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1. In two-electrode organic EMIMBF4/PC system, its displayed high energy density of 62.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 748.4 W kg−1, meanwhile it had excellent cycling stability with 84.7% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. To our best knowledge, it is the first example to synthesize porous carbon from IFRs precursor. Thus, the current work paved a novel and low-cost way for the production of high-valued carbon material, and expanded its application for high-performance energy storage devices.
