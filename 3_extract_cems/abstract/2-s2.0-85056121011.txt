Ni 3 S 2 nanosheet (NS) arrays on Ni foam were fabricated by a simple one-step electrodeposition strategy, and used as a kind of electrode material for asymmetric supercapacitors. The Ni 3 S 2 NS arrays are interconnected, which can be regarded as bridges between these individual nanoparticle units. The electrochemical performances were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry techniques in a three-electrode system. The Ni 3 S 2 NS arrays display a specific capacitance of 773.6 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 , and excellent rate property of 84.3% at 10 A g -1 . The performance of the Ni 3 S 2 NS arrays was further investigated in an asymmetric supercapacitor for potential practical application. The asymmetric supercapacitor using the Ni 3 S 2 electrode and reduced graphene oxide electrode as positive and negative electrodes, respectively, exhibits an energy density of 41.2 W h kg -1 at 1.6 kW kg -1 . When up to 16 kW kg -1 , it holds 25.3 W h kg -1 . These excellent electrochemical performances are attributed to the improved electronic conductivity and rich redox reaction sites from Ni 3 S 2 NS arrays. Our results indicate that the Ni 3 S 2 NS arrays have great potential for supercapacitors.
