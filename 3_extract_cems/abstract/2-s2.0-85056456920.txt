Abstract: NiCo 2 O 4 nano-layer covered on surface of carbon cloth for high-performance supercapacitors is successfully fabricated by a one-step route which only involved a modified sol–gel method. The binder-free electrode only with simple layer covering on carbon cloth displays outstanding pseudocapacitive behaviors in 2 M KOH, which exhibits high specific capacitances of 944.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and 702.4 F g −1 at 20 A g −1 after activation, as well as excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance can still retain 859.5 F g −1 (91% retention) at a current density of 1 A g −1 after 3500 cycles. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
