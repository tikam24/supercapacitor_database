Abstract: N-, Ni-, and graphene oxide (GO)-doped carbon xerogel were synthesized from melamine-resorcinol-formaldehyde gels by drying followed by pyrolysis at 950 °C. The mass of nickel and GO in carbon xerogel, formed after carbonization was 5 and 1%, respectively. The obtained product was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The characteristics were completed by measurements of BET specific surface area as well as pore distribution. For graphene oxide and nickel doped carbon xerogel, a decrease in the BET surface area of about 2% compared to unmodified carbon xerogel was observed with a simultaneous increase of cumulative pore volume and average pore diameter of about 50 and 32%, respectively. Electrochemical properties of doped carbon xerogel were evaluated in 6 M KOH by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic modes. It was revealed, that the highest specific capacitance of 222 Fg−1 was reached for N-Ni-GO-doped carbon xerogel during the process of galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). Moreover, this sample also exhibited 100% stability during GCD and about 98% stability during 3000 cycling tests. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
