This work reports the nanocomposites of graphitic nanofibers (GNFs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The hybrid CNTs/GNFs was prepared via a synthesis route that involved catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The structure and morphology of CNTs/GNFs can be precisely controlled by adjusting the flow rates of reactant gases. The nest shape entanglement of CNTs and GNFs which could not only have high conductivity to facilitate ion transmission, but could also increase surface area for more electrolyte ions access. When assembled in a symmetric two-electrode system, the CNTs/GNFs-based supercapacitor showed a very good cycling stability of 96% after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles. Moreover, CNTs/GNFs-based symmetric device can deliver a maximum specific energy of 72.2 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 686.0 W kg-1. The high performance of the hybrid performance can be attributed to the wheat like GNFs which provide sufficient accessible sites for charge storage, and the CNTs skeleton which provide channels for charge transport.
