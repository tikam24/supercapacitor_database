Rationally fabricating the hybrid nanostructures with a distinctive surface and internal properties is substantial due to their multifunctional features in energy storage and catalysis applications. Generally, the battery-like supercapacitor materials experience low energy density and inferior cyclic stability issues due to their intercalation/deintercalation process. To address this problem, the dichalcogenides (WSe2and MoSe2) were hybridized with a battery-like material (NiCo2O4), which effectively changed the diffused-controlled to the surface-controlled process and enhanced the energy density and cyclic stability features. The pentagon core-hexagon ring-structured NiCo2O4nanoplate with MoSe2hybrid structures presents excellent electrochemical features with a specific capacity of 857 C g-1at 1 A g-1and retains 98% initial capacity after 5000 cycles at 30 A g-1, which is higher than that of pure NiCo2O4and NiCo2O4/WSe2materials. The asymmetric supercapacitor device (NiCo2O4/MoSe2//activated carbon) provides an energy density of 69 W h kg-1at a power density of 1280 W kg-1and withstands an excellent cyclic stability of 95% after 10,000 cycles at 30 A g-1. Moreover, a preliminary electrochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the CO2electro-reduction property of the hybrid structures using an H-type cell in a 0.5 M choline chloride electrolyte. The hybridization of MoSe2enhanced the CO2electro-reduction properties in the NiCo2O4material in terms of high current density, low overpotential, smaller equivalent series resistance, charge transfer resistance, and increased electrochemical surface area. These excellent supercapacitors and CO2electro-reduction performance provide valuable insights into the design and optimization of non-precious hybrid materials for multifunctional applications and render a viable approach to enhance the internal properties of various materials in the future.
