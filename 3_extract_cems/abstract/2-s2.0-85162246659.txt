This chapter gives an overview of the sustainable and clean energy applications of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are elongated tubular structures having diameter of 1-2 nm with the carbon atoms aligned in coaxial cylinders of graphitic sheets. On the basis of the number of graphite layers, carbon nanotubes can be classified into single-walled, double-walled, and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The electronic structure of CNT is unique so that it provides fascinating applications for a sustainable development. This chapter also deals about the electronic properties and use of CNTs for Li-ion batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and for hydrogen storage, in detail.
