In recent years, more and more research has been devoted to the development of new electrode materials with ultra-high energy density and high Faraday reaction activity, especially applying them to a new generation of supercapacitor energy storage systems. In this study, sea urchin-shaped V2O5 nanospheres and tetrakaidecahedron Fe2O3 nano boxes have been grown directly on flexible matrix carbon cloth by hydrothermal method. The hydrothermal time can control the microstructure of V2O5, and the morphology determines the performance of energy storage, the positive electrode material of sea urchin-shaped V2O5 nanosphere exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 535 F•g-1. In addition, the tetrakaidecahedron Fe2O3 nano box is used as the negative electrode, and a new structure V2O5//Fe2O3 flexible supercapacitor is assembled. When the power density is 699.49 W•kg-1, the energy density can reach 46.06 W•h•kg-1. Moreover, it also has good mechanical flexibility, and the specific capacity retention rate is still as high as 83.4% after 5000 times of 180° bending cycle tests. This work provides a general and effective strategy for developing the next generation flexible electronic devices with ultra-high energy density.
