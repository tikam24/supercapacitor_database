Today, supercapacitor usage as high durability battery is feasible. The storage capacity in milliamperes-hour is one of the main parameters of a battery, used to determine the running time of an energy independent system. While powering some simple circuits, a shorter up-time was obtained, when the capacitor was charged at high current. Further analysis with an advanced charger showed that the charging current impacts the storage capacity: a high current led to less stored milliamperes-hour. This paper describes the results obtained from charging and discharging supercapacitors with different currents using a common experimental setup.
