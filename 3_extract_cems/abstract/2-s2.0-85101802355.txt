Construction of porous nanosheet arrays of transition-metal sulfides (TMSs) holds great potential for energy storage. Herein, a one-step hydrothermal process is employed for the construction of porous Ni1.43Fe.5Co.5S.97 nanosheet arrays (NFCS-NS) on the nickel foam as a proper positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitor. Owing to the appealing structural features, the NFCS-NS depicts a high capacity of 1156 C g−1 at 2 A g−1, desirable rate capability of 81.1 %, and significant cyclability of 92.9 %. Also, a promising hybrid device (NFCS-NS//AC) based on NFCS-NS and activated carbon (AC) represents a reasonable energy density of 57.3 Wh kg−1 at 807.04 W kg−1 and a notable power density of 20000 W kg−1 at 40 Wh kg−1. Therefore, our current research can introduce an effective strategy for the fabrication of high-performance electrodes with porous architectures.
