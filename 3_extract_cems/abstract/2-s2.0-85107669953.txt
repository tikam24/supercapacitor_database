Herein, we report a composite structure by incorporating MoSe2 nanosheets in organ-like Ti3C2Tx MXene (MXene/MoSe2) as new nanohybrid anode materials for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. Benefits of the positive advantages including unique heterostructure, enhanced active area for redox reactions, and beneficial synergetic interaction, the specific capacitance of the MXene/MoSe2 composite electrode was high up to 1358.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, much higher than that of the pure Ti3C2Tx MXene and MoSe2 electrodes. In addition, when applied the synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXene/MoSe2 nanohybrid as positive electrode in asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), excellent performance is observed. For instance, a high specific energy of 55.6 Wh kg−1, high specific power of 800.3 W kg−1 with the capacitance retention of 94.1% even after 10,000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1 are obtained. These results indicate that the MXene/MoSe2 composite will be a high promising candidate for supercapacitors.
