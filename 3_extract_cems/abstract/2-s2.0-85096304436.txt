This paper focuses on the synthesis of doped and undoped CuO nanoparticles using the sol-gel method, which has been prepared and described. Supercapacitor applications of as-synthesized nanomaterials were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis. The cyclic voltammograms illustrated the quasi-rectangular shape which depicted the pseudocapacitance nature of the samples. The calculated specific capacitance of the prepared samples was 180, 253 and 303 (F/g) corresponding to CuO, Fe-CuO and Ni-CuO, respectively at the low current density and the EIS spectra show that the prepared Ni-CuO electrode exhibits low charge transfer resistance.
