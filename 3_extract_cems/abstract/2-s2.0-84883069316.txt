In this paper, a transformer for an N-port isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter is presented. This converter can be used in hybrid renewable energy systems where many of energy sources and storage devices and load are required. The final model allows simple calculation of the exchanged power between ports. The example of three-winding transformer for a three-port DC-DC converter is realized. The proposed method was verified experimentally. Finally, this transformer was used in a hybrid energy source where the main energy source was a fuel cell coupled with a storage device (a bank of supercapacitor). Â© 2013 IEEE.
