Actively study on graphene oxide nanocomposites for energy storage applications had been raised intensely in the previous dated. Novelty of synthesized materials as energy storage material has activated a rapid progress in capacitive materials. In this favor, two-dimensional (2D) graphene-based spinels of metal oxide nanocomposites display relatively significant capacitive behavior. Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite helps to fabricate electrode that improves the characteristics properties of conductive resources. For this purpose, lithium chromite spinel (LiCr2O4) and GO synthesized by Sol-gel and improved hummer's method respectively. After this, lithium chromite spinels implanted on GO hence GO/LiCr2O4 nanocomposite were synthesized through co-precipitation process which proves to be an effective energy storing material. Its crystal structure was examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) in which average crystalline size of GO/LiCr2O4 is 2–3 nm. By scanning electronic microscopic technique (SEM) physical sound structure was explained in which average grain size is 3.53 nm calculated by image J. software. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) described the component weight composition. A characteristic peak at about 1460 cm−1 in GO/LiCr2O4 spectra was reflected via Raman spectroscopy. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out to estimate the band gap value 3.27 eV. The electrochemically effective surface area (ECSA) attained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic technique (EIS) which is 0.024 cm2. The reached maximum capacity of 321 Fg−1 corresponded to a 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte was calculated via CV measurements. Peak current 102 µA was observed by varying scan rate in both acidic and basic media which is an indication of the efficient capacitive storage of the synthesized nanocomposite. Hence synthesized GO/LiCr2O4 nanocomposite could be an effective material for energy storage applications.
