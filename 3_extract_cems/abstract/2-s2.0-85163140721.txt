Road transport is shifting towards electrified vehicle solutions to achieve the Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27) carbon neutrality target. According to life cycle assessment analyses, battery production and disposal phases suffer a not-negligible environmental impact to be mitigated with new recycling processes, battery technology, and life-extending techniques. The foundation of this study consists of combining the assessment of vehicle efficiency and battery ageing by applying supercapacitor technology with different topologies to more conventional battery modules. The method employed here consists of analysing different hybrid energy storage system (HESS) topologies for light-duty vehicle applications over a wide range of operating conditions, including real driving cycles. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) has been modelled and validated for this aim, and the reference energy storage system was hybridised with a supercapacitor. Two HESSs with passive and semi-active topologies have been analysed and compared, and an empirical ageing model has been implemented. A rule-based control strategy has been used for the semi-active topology to manage the power split between the battery and supercapacitor. The results demonstrate that the HESS reduced the battery pack root mean square current by up to 45%, slightly improving the battery ageing. The semi-active topology performed sensibly better than the passive one, especially for small supercapacitor sizes, at the expense of more complex control strategies.
