Electrochemically synthesized maghemite nanoflakes arrays onto stainless steel substrate are used as supercapacitor electrode material. The synthesized thin films are characterized for their structure, surface morphology and electrochemical properties by XRD, SEM and cyclic voltammetry. The X-ray diffraction study revealed that the films are polycrystalline in nature with cubic crystal structure of maghemite (γ-Fe<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>). Scanning electron microscopy shows the formation of nanoflakes array of maghemite. Moreover, the hydrophilicity of maghemite nanoflakes arrays enhances the intimate contact at electrode/electrolyte interface. Maghemite thin film shows better capacitive performance in aqueous Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>3</inf> electrolyte. The relatively maximum specific capacitance of 524 F/g was found in Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>3</inf> than NaOH electrolyte at scan rate of 5 mV/s. Maghemite nanoflakes arrays exhibited good electrochemical stability in Na <inf>2</inf>SO<inf>3</inf> with 76.71% charge storage after 250 cycles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
