A three-dimensional cross-linked porous silver network (PSN) is fabricated by silver mirror reaction using polymer foam as the template. The N-doped porous carbon nanofibers (N-PCNFs) are further prepared on PSN by chemical vapor deposition and treated by ammonia gas subsequently. The PSN substrate serving as the inner current collector will improve the electron transport efficiency significantly. The ammonia gas can not only introduce nitrogen doping into PCNFs but also increase the specific surface area of PCNFs at the same time. Because of its large surface area (801 m2/g), high electrical conductivity (211 S/cm), and robust structure, the as-constructed N-PCNFs/PSN demonstrates a specific capacitance of 222 F/g at the current density of 100 A/g with a superior rate capability of 90.8% of its initial capacitance ranging from 1 to 100 A/g while applied as the supercapacitor electrode. The symmetric supercapacitor device based on N-PCNFs/PSN displays an energy density of 8.5 W h/kg with power density of 250 W/kg and excellent cycling stability, which attains 103% capacitance retention after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles at a high current density of 20 A/g, which indicates that N-PCNFs/PSN is a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode materials.
