The energy storage performance of fabricated solid state supercapacitor based upon the polyaniline (PANI) sample has been investigated in the present study. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies have been performed on simple chemistry based synthesized PANI to check the appropriate synthesis of sample with electrochemical analysis. The existence of required fundamental bands in the FTIR spectra of PANI confirms the facial growth of desired PANI sample in its highly conducting form. Scanning electron microscopy investigation designates the cotton-like morphology of prepared sample with particle size in the micro/nanometer range. The energy storage performance of the fabricated supercapacitor is noted using cyclic voltammetry analysis. The significantly high values of specific capacitance and energy density are 193.04 Fg-1 and 107.14 Whkg-1, respectively, for prepared supercapacitor at the scan rate 40 mV/s. The high values of these parameters may be ascribed to high conductivity and low resistance of the supercapacitor. The PANI supercapacitor exhibits the efficient capacitance retention of more than 65% of initial capacitance after 10000 charging-discharging cycles.
