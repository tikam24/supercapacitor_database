The pulse current load had many disadvantages to the cycle life of battery, so we designed a semi-active battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy source (HES) for powering the pulsed current load. The battery connected with the ultracapacitor in parallel via a DC/DC converter. The control strategy of DC/DC converter was filter power splitting, and the control objective was that battery supplied a nearly constant current, and the value was equal to the average load current, while the ultracapacitor supplied the dynamic component of the load current, so as to reduce the internal loss and prolong the cycle of battery. Comparative studied with single battery, passive structure and semi-active structure HES, the MATLAB 7 simulation results and experimental results indicate that the discharging current of battery in semi-active HES is smoother than the other two structures under pulse current load, and the discharging process of the battery pack is optimized, so the cycle life of battery is obviously prolonged.
