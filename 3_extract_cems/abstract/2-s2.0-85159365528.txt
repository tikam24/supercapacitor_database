Self-templating is a facile strategy for synthesizing porous carbons by direct pyrolysis of organic metal salts. However, the method typically suffers from low yields (<4%) and limited specific surface areas (SSA<2000 m2 g−1) originating from low activity of metal cations (e.g., K+ or Na+) in promoting construction and activation of carbon frameworks. Here we use cesium acetate as the only precursor of oxo-carbons with large SSA of the order of 3000 m2 g−1, pore volume approaching 2 cm3 g−1, tunable oxygen contents, and yields of up to 15 %. We unravel the role of Cs+ as an efficient promoter of framework formation, templating and etching agent, while acetates act as carbon/oxygen sources of carbonaceous frameworks. The oxo-carbons show record-high CO2 uptake of 8.71 mmol g−1 and an ultimate specific capacitance of 313 F g−1 in the supercapacitor. This study helps to understand and rationally tailor the materials design by a still rare organic solid-state chemistry.
