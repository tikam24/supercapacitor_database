This paper provides an overview of the battery thermal management systems (BTMSs) based on the studies carried out by different researchers across the globe. The focus is on enhancing the thermal performance of the battery with the selection and incorporation of a suitable thermal management system. In addition to this, the performance enhancement of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems using supercapacitor (SC) in parallel topological connection, have been discussed. The design options in BTMS and the desired level of sophistication are discussed in this study. For ensuring the performance and safety of Li-ion batteries, a suitable BTMS must be designed to regulate and control the thermal load of the batteries. This would not only result in safety but also ensure longer battery life. This paper presents the summary of recent developments in the direction of BTMS with direct and indirect cooling methods and provides significant insights into the use of SC for reducing the thermal load on the Li-ion batteries, which in turn can help in reducing the cost and weight of BTMS required for energy-efficient electric vehicles (EVs).
