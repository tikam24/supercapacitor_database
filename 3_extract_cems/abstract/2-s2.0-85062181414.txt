A metal-organic framework is employed for the preparation of an interconnected network porous structure of Mn 2 O 3 /carbon for supercapacitor applications. X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the crystal structure of the Mn 2 O 3 /carbon composites. Morphological studies reveal the formation of a carbon interconnected network porous structure of the prepared samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis confirm the carbon coating on the Mn 2 O 3 particles. Three-electrode measurements showed that the prepared Mn 2 O 3 /C composite is suitable for asymmetric supercapacitor device fabrication, since the negative electrode exhibits a highest specific capacitance of 776 F g -1 at a specific current of 1 A g -1 . The symmetric device yields a specific cell capacitance of 122 F g -1 at a specific current of 2.5 A g -1 . The asymmetric device yields a maximum specific energy capacity of 54.9 W h kg -1 at a power capacity of 2245 W kg -1 .
