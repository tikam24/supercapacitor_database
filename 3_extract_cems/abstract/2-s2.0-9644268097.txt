The methods of preparing the novel nanocomposite Co(OF)2/ultra- stable Y (USY) zeolite were investigated. The high concentration of precursors leads to an isolated Co(OH)2 phase and lower specific capacitance. The morphologies and microstructures of zeolite support USY and of the Co(OH)2/USY composites were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was found that the specific capacitance of the composite was increased by increasing Co(OH)2 loading at low loading densities.
