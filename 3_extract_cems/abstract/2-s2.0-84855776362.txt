An Electrical Heave Compensation System will cause large power demand fluctuations with a period time e.g. of around 8 to 12 seconds. These large power fluctuations are not desirable for the stability of the ship's electrical power grid. This paper proposes the application and control of a supercapacitor based ESS in a power electronic system with a common DC Bus to limit the effect of the power fluctuations on the ship's electrical power grid. The regenerated power from the heave compensation movements is temporarily stored in supercapacitors and used again when power is demanded. This causes a more constant power flow from the ship's electrical power grid, which will cope with the losses in the system. Two topologies are discussed, namely the direct connection of the supercapacitors to the common DC bus and the indirect connection of the supercapacitors to the common DC bus through a DCDC converter. The result of the modelling and experiments of both ESS topologies shows that the high power fluctuations caused by an electrical heave compensation system are significantly decreased.
