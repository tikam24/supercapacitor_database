Nickel molybdate (NiMoO 4 ) nanoparticles (NPs) are prepared by different synthetic techniques via hydrothermal (SHC), gel-combustion (SGC) and microwave-assisted combustion (SMC) methods. All prepared samples are subjected to calcination at 600 °C to get a pure α-NiMoO 4 with a monoclinic crystal structure and their physico-chemical properties are compared. The average crystallite size of SMC is smaller than that of other two methods. Depending on the synthetic process, NiMoO 4 NP s exhibits different morphology. Optical band gap energies for all samples are calculated. The cyclic voltammograms signify the occurrence of redox couples and besides with the electrochemical impedance spectra (Nyquist plot) confirm the supercapacitive nature. Among all, the modified SMC electrode material deliver highest specific capacitance value related with scan rate and current density. Nevertheless, SMC exhibits lowest faradic resistance and also grants well permanency with a stable profile of 98.6% retentivity after 1000 cycles results in high electric activity.
