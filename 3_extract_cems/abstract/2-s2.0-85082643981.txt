We have reported the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites that were synthesized by immobilizing nanoparticles of Ag and Ni on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The hierarchical structure derived from the combination of nanoparticles of Ni, Ag, and RGO in the (AgxNi(1-x))yRGO(100-y) nanocomposite provides a synergistic effect in the enhancement of supercapacitive performance of the synthesized nanocomposite. (Ag0.50Ni0.50)90RGO10 showed a high specific capacitance value of 897 F g-1 at a current density 1 A g-1 and an energy density of 80 Wh kg-1 at 400 W kg-1 power density. This nanocomposite also exhibited âˆ¼77% retention of the initial capacitance even after 4000 cycles. To the best of our knowledge, the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite composed of Ni and Ag nanoparticles and RGO are reported for the first time, and the nanocomposite (Ag0.50Ni0.50)90RGO10 demonstrated its excellent supercapacitive performance.
