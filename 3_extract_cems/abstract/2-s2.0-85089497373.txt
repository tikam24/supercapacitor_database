A battery and SuperCapacitor (SC) Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) provides a good trade-off between energy and power densities and has been used in stationary and transportation applications. Its control scheme should be such that the battery provides the average power and the SC the short bursts of power for 'compensation purposes'. In this way, the battery's power losses are reduced and its lifetime increased. This is usually achieved by splitting the slow and fast components of the HESS's equivalent reference current by means of a Low-Pass Filter (LPF). However, the approach for determining the cut-off frequency of the LPF is not usually discussed. This paper presents a design approach based on the time of contribution of the SC converter to step power variations. Besides, the control scheme of the HESS is modified so that the SC interface also attenuates the 2nd order voltage ripple present in the DC bus of a DC nano-grid connected to an AC utility grid through a single-phase interface. The proposed design approach and performance of the control scheme are verified by means of simulation and experimental results.
