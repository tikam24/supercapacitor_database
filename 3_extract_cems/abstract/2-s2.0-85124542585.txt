Here, we report on a facile green and scalable method for the fabrication of porous 3D graphene as a well-known carbon-based material used in many energy storage devices. Chicken red blood cells were used as sheets spacer and heteroatom sources in the construction of 3D graphene. First, the red blood cells were separated from the blood and mixed with graphene oxide. Then, the mixture was freeze-dried and carbonized at 700 °C. The resulted 3D graphene containing heteroatoms was used as a supercapacitor electrode modifier on a glassy carbon electrode and tested with various electrochemical techniques. The supercapacitor electrode showed a specific capacitance of 330 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, maximum power density of 1958 W kg−1, and maximum energy density of 85 Wh kg−1. Furthermore, the supercapacitive performances were tested in a two-electrode symmetrical system which exhibited a specific capacitance of 238 F g−1 for 1 A g−1. It also showed a power density of 2200 W kg−1 and an appreciable energy density of 160 Wh kg−1. The excellent electrochemical behavior of 3D graphene indicates the promising abilities of the composite for other applications such as biosensors, batteries, electrocatalysts, etc.
