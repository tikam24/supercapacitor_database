Nanocellulosic (crystal/fibrils) based hybrid engineering biorenewable material is worthwhile for impending green and sustainable energy technology. Various intrinsic properties of cellulose such as biocompatibility, excellent flexibility, high specific surface area and aspect ratio, high Young's modulus, remarkable strength, renewability, thermal and possible crystalline properties render them sustainable and holy materials for multidimensional field. Such materials are particularly in forefront to develop low-cost ecofriendly energy devices. For this, the surface charges of cellulose nanofibers/nanocrystals are manipulated by adopting various methods of synthesis, hybridizing the material with another conducting surface/solvent, and/or doping with organic/inorganic entities. In this direction, imidazole-based compounds play an integral role to alternate their surface charge through development of surface-charge-governed ion transport. It functionalizes the asymmetry of the hybrid composites in terms of the number density of positive and negative ions in the nanochannels nanocrystals/membrane for developing conducting battery materials/solid electrolyte. Therefore in this chapter, developmental research in designing hybrids nanomaterials/membranes composed of nanocellulosic crystal/fibrils with imidazole molecule will be enlighten in brief. The various synthesis methods and their impact on the structure and physicochemical properties will be discussed. The implication of such designed materials for battery and supercapacitor will be presented. Finally the comparative performance evaluation and interface problems during technology development will be discussed to pave the way for major breakthroughs and industrial applications in this field.
