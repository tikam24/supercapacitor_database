In the present investigation, the synthesis of zinc oxide (ZnO) and Mn-doped ZnO thin film electrodes is reported for energy storage applications through spray pyrolysis technique. As-prepared thin films are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques for the crystal structural and morphological analysis, respectively. The XRD pattern shows substitution of Mn2+ in ion might have substituted Zn site without changing the hexagonal structure. The micrograph of pure ZnO thin films shows that the grains are agglomerated. The Mn-doped ZnO thin film micrographs shows the spherical type morphology. The electrochemical study is carried for various concentrations of KOH electrolyte. The maximum specific capacitance of pristine ZnO and 5% Mn/ZnO is optimized at 3 M KOH electrolyte concentration. The pristine ZnO and M5Z electrode are exhibited 151 and 360 F gâˆ’1 maximum specific capacitance, respectively.
