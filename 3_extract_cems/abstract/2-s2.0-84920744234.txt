We successfully prepare H2Ti12O25 by soft-chemical synthesis using Na2Ti3O7 compounds, prepared by Na+/H+ ion exchange and heating. Then, a cylindrical hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by using H2Ti12O25 as anode and activated carbon as cathode. The specific capacitance of hybrid supercapacitor using H2Ti12O25 is 57 Fg-1 higher than that of hybrid supercapacitor using Li4Ti5O12 (38 Fg-1). The hybrid supercapacitor using H2Ti12O25 exhibit cycle performance with a capacitance retention of 65.3% available for battery application. The energy density is 35 W h kg-1 at a power density of 179 W kg-1 and 4 W h kg-1 at a power density of 5383 W kg-1. These results show that the H2Ti12O25 anode material is a promising electrode material for hybrid supercapacitor.
