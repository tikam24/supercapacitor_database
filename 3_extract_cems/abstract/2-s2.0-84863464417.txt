Novel Mn 3O 4 microsphere with diameter about 2μm and smooth surface has been prepared by solvothermal treating a mixture of manganese (II) acetate tetrahydrate and oleic acid in absolute ethanol at a low temperature (120°C), and its structure and morphology are systematically investigated by XRD, XPS, and SEM. The morphology of Mn 3O 4 microsphere is mainly controlled by adding oleic acid and the size and regularity of Mn 3O 4 microsphere depend on the solvothermal treatment temperature and time. The capacitance performance of novel Mn 3O 4 microsphere as electrode material is tested using cyclic voltamogramm technique at a scan rate of 10mVs -1 in 1M Na 2SO 4 solution within a potential window ranging from -0.2 to 0.8V. Mn 3O 4 microsphere electrode material can be electrochemically oxidized to layered birnessite MnO 2 with flowerlike morphology and pseudoconstant using potential cycling. A capacity improvement of Mn 3O 4 microsphere based electrode upon cycling can be observed for 400cycles, and its specific capacitance is significantly improved from 10Fg -1 (after 1cycle) to 219Fg -1 (after 400cycles). The obvious capacitance improvement is ascribed to the activation effect of the electrochemical cycling and a structural transformation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
