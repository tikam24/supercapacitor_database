Abstract The layered structure stability of bulk vanadyl phosphate dihydrate (VOPO<inf>4</inf>·2H<inf>2</inf>O) is investigated by using a deintercalation-intercalation reaction process involving short-range swelling, its basal spacing can be reversibility controlled and the layered structure can be maintained to above 400 °C. By using delaminated vanadyl phosphate (VOPO<inf>4</inf>) nanosheets in 2-propanol, VOPO<inf>4</inf>/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) hybrid electrode materials for supercapacitor with different mass ratios of VOPO<inf>4</inf> nanosheets to graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets have been prepared based on a nanosheet reassembling reaction between the exfoliated VOPO<inf>4</inf> nanosheets and GO nanosheets and followed by calcinating in a tubular furnace at 400 °C for 3 h under N<inf>2</inf> atmosphere, and their electrochemical properties are systematically investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge in 0.5 M K<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte. The VOPO<inf>4</inf>/RGO hybrid electrode with a mass ratio of VOPO<inf>4</inf>/RGO = 1 exhibits a high specific capacitance of 378 F g<sup>-1</sup> at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>-1</sup> with a good rate capability. This method broadens the application filed of VOPO<inf>4</inf> nanosheets, and also supplies promising electrode candidates for supercapacitor.
