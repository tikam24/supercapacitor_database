In this study, the facile synthesis procedure of MnxOy-rGO hybrid and the variation of its electrochemical performance on varying the KMnO4 concentration have been elucidated. The as-prepared hybrid was synthesized by adopting a one-step hydrothermal process at 180°C for 24h. The controlled growth of mixed manganese oxide (MnxOy) was achieved for 0.5 mM KMnO4, and it showed a specific capacitance of 280 Fg-1 at 1 Ag-1 current density using 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The incorporation of the MnxOy into the conductive rGO layers successfully prevented the self-agglomeration of rGO nanosheets. It was found that the appropriate incorporation of MnxOy provided the fast electrolytic ion transportation in and on between the rGO layers by reducing the solution resistance, (Rs) down to 4 ohms (Ω). Hence, it is expected that the synthesis procedure for the fabrication of MnxOy-rGO has prospects as high-performing supercapacitor electrode materials.
