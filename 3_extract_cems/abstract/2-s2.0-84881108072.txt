Flexible supercapacitors are challenged by low energy density and short discharge time. We report a new type of biomimetic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (BIMPDC) supercapacitors having the self-assembling membrane (SAM) offered a magnitude higher power, energy, and current density compared with reported flexible supercapacitors, that are based on nanobiomimetic reversible membrane potential (RPM) membrane and an asymmetric engineering design with features of flexibility and tenability under the conditions of electrolyte-free and without a metal catalyst. Two models are used for assembling the supercapacitors: Model 1 has a Au/flat "ATP Lid" bridge Membrane Electrode Assembling (MEA) and an Au/vertical "ATP Lid" nanostructure; and Model 2 has a Au/flat "Electric-Dam" MEA and an AU/nanopore "Electric-Well" nanostructure MEA. The results shown both models are turntable horizontally with three different angles from 45°, 90° to 180°. They are switchable in connection from both ends having the RPM characteristics. The current density reaches 1.25 A/cm", power density is 77.4 kW/kg, and the energy density is 13.1 kwhr/kg for the bridged structured supercapacitor 1 with the specific capacitance (Cs) 54, 112 F/g.
