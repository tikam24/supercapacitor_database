CoMn2O4 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (CoMn2O4/rGO) composites with different graphene contents were synthesized in situ by a coprecipitation method. The effect of graphene content on the morphology, microstructure and electrochemical properties of CoMn2O4/rGO materials was investigated. The results show that CoMn2O4 nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of graphene nanosheets. The distribution of CoMn2O4 nanoparticles on the surface of rGO is gradually uniform, and the particle aggregation disappears as graphene content increases. CoMn2O4/rGO exhibits a great specific surface area and an excellent electrochemistry. The optimum capacitance performance of CoMn2O4/rGO20 (20% rGO, in mass fraction) can be obtained, and the specific capacitance is 1 420 F/g at 1 A/g. CoMn2O4/rGO30 (30% rGO, in mass fraction) has the optimum cyclic stability. The specific capacitance retention rate of CoMn2O4/rGO30 is 94% at 5 A/g, while that of CoMn2O4 is 78%, after 2 000 cycles of charges and discharges.
