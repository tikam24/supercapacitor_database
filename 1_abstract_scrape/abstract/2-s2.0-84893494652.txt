Activated carbon microtubes (CMTs) have been prepared from poplar catkins by chemical activation with ZnCl2. The assynthesized porous CMTs have large inner tubes of several micrometers, large BrunauerEmmettTeller surface areas of up to 1400m2 g11, a complex porous structure with predominant micropores (280 vol%), and small amount of mesopores (-20 vol%). Two-electrode supercapacitor cells constructed with the activated CMTs yield a specific capacitance of 206 F g11 and an energy density of 7.5Wh kg11 with aqueous electrolyte, values that are much higher than those of an activated carbon (160 Fg11, 5.5Wh kg11).
