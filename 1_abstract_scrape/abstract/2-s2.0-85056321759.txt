Porous carbon materials derived from pleurotus eryngii were successfully synthesized by carbonization and activation. The specific surface area of the obtained porous carbons reached up to 3255 m2, g-1. The electrode exhibited a maximal specific capacitance of 236 Fg-1 and excellent long-term cycle stability with 94% capacitance retention after 6000 cycles at the current density of 2Ag-1. Therefore, pleurotus eryngii is demonstrated as an attractive biomass precursor of carbon materials for supercapacitor applications.
