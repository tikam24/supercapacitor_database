Among a wide range of metal oxide semiconductors, tin dioxide (SnO2) has been considered a promising material for pseudocapacitive electrodes. However, the performance of SnO2 supercapacitor is severely limited owing to their low electrical conductivities. Herein, we proposed SnO2 nanospheres (SnO2-NS) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-SnO2 superstructures (SnO2-rGOSS) for high performance supercapacitor. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) confirmed the capacitive behavior of the SnO2-rGOSS and SnO2-NS electrodes, with a specific capacitance of 320 and 44 F/g respectively, at a sweep rate of 5 mV/s. Remarkably, after cycling for 10,000 times at a sweep rate of 2 A/g, the SnO2-rGOSS electrode retained 150% more capacity than its initial value, indicating its outstanding durability.
