ZnS@MoS2 core-shell nanospheres were first prepared via a nanotemplate-assisted hydrothermal method. After the removal of ZnS with dilute hydrochloric acid, hollow MoS2 nanospheres (HNS) were successfully obtained. The as-synthesized HNS display a unique hollow structure assembled by ultrathin nanosheets with rich defects. Furthermore, the HNS exhibit an enhanced performance in the electrochemical energy storage devices, for example, in a Li-ion battery, they exhibit a discharge capacity of 750 mA h g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 even after 50 cycles, and in a supercapacitor, they exhibit a specific capacitance of 142.0 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. These values are much higher than those obtained for their solid counterparts. The present study provides an easily available method for the design and fabrication of other hollow nanomaterials with high energy storage performances.
