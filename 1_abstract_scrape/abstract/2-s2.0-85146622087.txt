Energy transition to renewables necessitate efficient energy storage systems such as super capacitors. Hence Boron carbon nitride (BCN) nanotubes were synthesized using CVD technique at 800, 900 and 1000 °C, using N-Dimethyl formamide and trimethyl borate as precursors and ferrocene as the catalyst. Increase in CVD temperature from 800 to 1000 °C increased the conductance and specific capacitance. Supercapacitor device fabricated with BCN synthesized at 1000 °C showed specific capacitance of 68.125F/g, energy density of 1.51 Wh/Kg, energy efficiency of 53.17 % and power density of 100 W/Kg. It retained 73.6 % of initial capacitance for 1000 charge/discharge cycles.
