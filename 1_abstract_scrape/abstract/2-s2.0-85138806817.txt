Mesoporous NiFe2O4 thin films have been prepared by chemical spray pyrolysis. The films are characterized by XRD, FESEM, EDAX, UV-Visible spectroscopy, DC electrical resistivity and electrochemical measurements. XRD result shows the cubic crystal structure with Fd-3 m (227) space group. Crystallite size is found in the range of 14–21 nm. FESEM showed crack free, well defined, uniform, mesoporous spherical grain-like surface morphology. EDAX study confirmed nearly stoichiometric deposition. The optical absorption studies confirmed direct allowed type transition with bandgap in the range of 2.09–2.29 eV. The films showed room temperature electrical resistivity of 2.34 × 104 Ωcm. The NiFe2O4 thin film spray deposited at 450°C exhibited a specific capacitance of 591 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV·s−1 from CV and specific capacitance of 632 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag−1 from GCD. These findings recommend a constructive route towards the preparation of NiFe2O4 electrodes for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
