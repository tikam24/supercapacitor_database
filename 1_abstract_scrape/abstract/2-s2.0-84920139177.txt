(Figure Presented). An electrochromic fibershaped super capacitor is developed by winding aligned carbon nanotube/polyaniline composite sheets on an elastic fiber. The fibershaped supercapacitors demonstrate rapid and reversible chromatic transitions under different working states, which can be directly observed by the naked eye. They are also stretchable and flexible, and are woven into textiles to display designed signals in addition to storing energy.
