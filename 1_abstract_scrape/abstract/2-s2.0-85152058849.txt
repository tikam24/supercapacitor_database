Transition metal phosphates with their tantalizing features such as low-cost, high electrochemical stability, earth abundance, environmentally benign nature, tunable functionalities, and so on have rendered them as one of the emerging families of materials for futuristic high-performance energy conversion and storage applications. Polyoxometalates (POMs), which are phosphate-based metal oxide polyanionic clusters, possessing semiconducting and acid-like natures, plentiful redox properties, and rooms for accommodating many electrons without significant structural changes have drawn much hype as supercapacitor materials. This chapter mainly discusses the promises of POM polyanionic archetype-based materials for supercapacitor applications.
