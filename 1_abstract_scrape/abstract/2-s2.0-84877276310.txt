We have developed a supercapacitor electrode composed of well-aligned CoO nanowire array grown on 3D nickel foam with polypyrrole (PPy) uniformly immobilized onto or firmly anchored to each nanowire surface to boost the pseudocapacitive performance. The electrode architecture takes advantage of the high electrochemical activity from both the CoO and PPy, the high electronic conductivity of PPy, and the short ion diffusion pathway in ordered mesoporous nanowires. These merits together with the elegant synergy between CoO and PPy lead to a high specific capacitance of 2223 F g-1 approaching the theoretical value, good rate capability, and cycling stability (99.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). An aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor device with a maximum voltage of 1.8 V fabricated by using our hybrid array as the positive electrode and activated carbon film as the negative electrode has demonstrated high energy density (∼43.5 Wh kg-1), high power density (∼5500 W kg-1 at 11.8 Wh kg-1) and outstanding cycleability (∼20 000 times). After charging for only ∼10 s, two such 4 cm2 asymmetric supercapacitors connected in series can efficiently power 5 mm diameter red, yellow, and green round LED indicators (lasting for 1 h for red LED) and drive a mini 130 rotation-motor robustly. © 2013 American Chemical Society.
