Ultra-long MnOOH nanowire was prepared by a simple hydrothermal process using KMnO4 and ammonium acetate without additional template agents. MnOOH sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, amperometry, constant current charge/discharge characterization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the length of MnOOH nanowires is more than 10 Î¼m, and the diameter is approximately 20 nm. The specific capacitance is 285 F/g at current density of 1 A/g in 1.0 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte, and it can still keep a good cycling stability after 4 000 cycles. The post-capacitance retention rate reaches 96.2%. The MnOOH nanowire as an electrode material has an excellent electron transmission channel, exhibiting a superior ultracapacitor performance, which can have broad application prospects as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
