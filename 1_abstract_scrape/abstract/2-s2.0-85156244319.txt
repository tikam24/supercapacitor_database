With the wide application of electric vehicles and the development of battery technology, pure electric construction machinery (PECM) has received more and more attention due to its high efficiency and no pollution. The working conditions of construction machinery are complex and accompanied by periodical working conditions and heavy load. For electric construction machinery, a heavy load represents an energy supply with a large current. To adapt to the working conditions of PECM, this paper proposes a robust controller to regulate the current of the hybrid energy system (HES) which include the battery and supercapacitor. The V-type operating conditions of a 5-ton pure electric loader are the research focus to analyze the working principles of the HES. The topology and energy flow patterns of the HES are proposed and analyzed. The model of the battery, supercapacitor, and DC/DC converter are depicted, and the robust control method is designed. An electric loader experiment platform is created to verify the effectiveness of the robust control method. Compared with the proportional integral control effect, the experiment results show that the proposed control method had good control performance and could better regulate the current. It can be used as a reference value for other dual energy source PECM.
