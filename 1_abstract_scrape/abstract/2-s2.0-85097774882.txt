The safety and charge/discharge performance of electrochemical devices is directly correlated to the property of electrolyte in these devices. Simultaneous improving the safety and charge/discharge performance of supercapacitor through electrolyte optimization has attracted wide research interests recently. In this work, we report a high-performance fire-retardant electrolyte. The electrolyte comprises of a mixed solvent of propylene carbonate/triethyl phosphate (PC/TEP) and high concentration lithium salts (5 M LiTFSI). Supercapacitor assembled with 5 M LiTFSI-TEP/PC shows a high capacitance of 27 F g-1 and excellent fire-retardant property. The combination of the TEP component and high concentration LiTFSI is the key to the excellent performance of the electrolyte.
