In this paper the properties of some Ni-Cu layers deposited onto a steel substrate were discussed. One has investigated the influence of the electrodeposition process on the final properties of the Ni-Cu layers, in order to see if these electrodeposited layers could be used as supercapacitor plates. The structural characterization was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and their composition by dispersive energy spectrometry. One has built a number of functional supercapacitors using Ni-Cu layer plates inserting in between them a separation membrane and their capacitance values were determined.
