Here we report electrochemical supercapacitance performance of a hybrid binary composite material composed of hierarchical bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) crystals embedded in reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. The resulting BiVO4/RGO composite material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, Raman scattering, Fourier transformed infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry charge/discharge measurements revealed that the BiVO4/RGO hybrid composite structure exhibits superior electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 484 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and 343 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 as well as excellent cycling stability sustaining about 87% of the initial capacitance after 2000 charge/discharge cycles at 10 A g−1. These results indicate that this BiVO4/RGO hybrid material could be suitable as a supercapacitor electrode material for energy storage applications.
