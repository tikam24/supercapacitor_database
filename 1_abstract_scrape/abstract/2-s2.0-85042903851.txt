A hybrid approach is beneficial to simultaneously exploit the characteristics of capacitive and transition materials to increase the energy density and power density of supercapacitors. In order to achieve optimal electrochemical performance, by means of a facile hydrothermal co-synthesis, we synthesize a three-dimensional porous aerogel consisting of MoS2 nanosheets and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with a controllable composition and morphological structure. The MoS2/rGO porous aerogel hybrids working as electrode material for supercapacitors, can efficiently enhance surface charge transport, provide more chemical reaction sites, shorten the migration path for electrons and ions, and facilitate the electrolyte diffusion. Using electrochemical feature in two-electrode configurations and symmetric cell devices, we obtain a specific capacitance of 472 F/g with excellent rate capability and cycling stability (98.9% retention after 30,000 cycles) at the current density of 1.0 A/g. Additionally, our designed supercapacitors are flexible under mechanical deformations, which are useful for the next generation wearable electronic devices.
