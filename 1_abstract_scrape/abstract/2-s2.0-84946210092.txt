The Lithium Ion Capacitor is an innovative technology which made its entry into the energy storage market more than five years ago. In the meantime, it has evolved into an ideal commercialized solution for closing the application gap between Lithium Ion Batteries and supercapacitors. Combining energy and power with long-term life characteristics, lithium ion capacitors are already used today in hybrid buses, trams, hybrid excavators, medical equipment and power quality equipment amongst other applications. Due to its compact and light design, it is expected that the technology will also be implemented in passenger cars by the end of this decade. Further technology development and high volume production will allow mass deployment of lithium ion capacitors in the energy storage market in the following years. This paper will explain how ULTIMO Lithium Ion Capacitors combine energy with power by discussing: •The concept of Lithium Ion Capacitor technology and its positioning on the Ragone plot •How Lithium Ion Capacitors can bridge the gap between Lithium Ion Batteries and supercapacitors, in particular by looking at similarities and differences in electrical performance •Commercial usage cases in different industrial applications, mobile as well as stationary •JSR Group high volume manufacturing plant •A vision on the future of Lithium Ion Capacitors.
