The facile single-step hydrothermal route was adopted to prepare Mo doped ZnS (Mo: ZnS) with honeycomb-like structure and deposited directly on the nickel foam (NF). Benefiting from the higher surface area with hierarchical pore sized distribution, binder-free electrode/substrate contact, and intrinsically improve electronic conductivity resulting from Mo doping, Mo: ZnS@NF electrode exhibited 2208 Fg−1 gravimetric capacitance (Cg) at the current density 1 Ag−1. The honeycomb-like the architecture of Mo: ZnS provides a larger surface area with more active sites and shortens the path for the charge diffusion. Moreover, asymmetric supercapacitors (Mo: ZnS@NF//AC@NF) display74.87 Fg−1 Cg at 2 Ag−1 current density and long term stability with 91.3 % capacitance retention after 5000 CCD (cyclic charge/discharge) tests. The high energy density of 26.5 Wh kg−1 is achieved at a power density of 1303 W kg−1. The obtained results demonstrate the superior capacitive activity of Mo: ZnS/NF electrode for advanced energy storage devices.
