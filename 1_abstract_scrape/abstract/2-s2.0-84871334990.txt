We demonstrate that single graphene sheets can be easily synthesized in large amounts by using zeolite Ni-MCM-22 as a catalyst and template. The graphene has a large surface area, high conductivity, and controllable two-dimensional sizes. Its use in supercapacitor electrode materials reveals excellent electrochemical double layer capacitance and galvanostatic charge/discharge properties with specific capacitances of 233 F/g in aqueous KOH.
