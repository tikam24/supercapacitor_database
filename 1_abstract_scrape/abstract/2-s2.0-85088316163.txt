Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is commonly employed as supercapacitor electrode due to its high theoretical and experimental capacitance, but limited by its easily agglomerated structure. Herein, a three-dimensional nickel cobalt-layered double hydroxide on carbon fiber cloth (NiCo-LDH/CFC) is synthesized via an in-situ hydrolysis of Co-based metal organic framework array (Co-MOF) for supercapacitors. Both the metal sites and overall morphology of Co-MOF are well maintained inner NiCo-LDH/CFC, providing sufficient active sites and rapid diffusion kinetics for charge storage. Consequently, an optimal specific capacitance of 2685 F g−1 (1074 C g−1) is achieved for NiCo-LDH/CFC electrode, higher than that of powdered NiCo-LDH (1352 F g−1 or 540.8 C g−1). Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor is assembled with NiCo-LDH/CFC as positive electrode and active carbon as negative electrode. The hybrid device exhibits a high energy density of 64.9 Wh kg−1, a maximum power density of 16.9 kW kg−1, and long cycling stability (82.7% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles). These results indicate the great potential of in-situ hydrolysis of MOFs for high performance energy storage electrode materials.
