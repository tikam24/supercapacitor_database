In order to stabilize the bus voltage of the bipolar DC microgrid under the influence of fluctuating power, a coordinated control strategy for the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in bipolar DC microgrid was proposed in this paper. The HESS composed by parallel operation of supercapacitors and batteries. The proposed control strategy coordinates the power distribution between the battery and the supercapacitor by constructing a droop relationship between the voltage of the supercapacitor and the output power of the battery. At the same time, the strategy also builds the voltage difference of the supercapacitors and the output currents of the interleaved parallel voltage balancer (IPVB) to achieve the power transfer between the double buses. Finally, simulation verification was performed in Matlab / Simulink, and the results show that the proposed control strategy can ensure the stability of the each bus voltage of the bipolar DC microgrid and improve the working life of the energy storage unit.
