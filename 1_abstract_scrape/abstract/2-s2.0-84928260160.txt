The present state of affairs in Russian hybrid transport is considered. The paper shows possible means for improvement of hybrid transmission performance through optimization of the electric traction drive, number of wheels, traction generator and supercapacitor reserve, creation of new types of accumulators, and the use of fully electrically powered buses that charge up at bus stops with an auxiliary internal combustion engine as an emergency power source. Features of optimization for typical cycles are considered, and the need is shown for studying the real power transmission performance for purposes of optimization.
