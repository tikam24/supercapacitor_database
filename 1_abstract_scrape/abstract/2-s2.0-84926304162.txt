In order to enhance the recycling efficiency of regenerative braking energy of the hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) with battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS), we proposed a barking force distributing strategy which used in the HEV with HESS. In vehicles simulation software ADVISOR 2002, the distributing strategy was based on the speed, while we introduced the vehicles body force, road environment and the structure of HEV to distribute the braking force between the regenerative braking force and friction force according to the braking regulations ECE R13. At the same time, we took the safe charging conditions of battery and ultracapacitor into consideration. Model and simulate the distributing strategy under ADVISOR 2002, meanwhile, the experimental platform had been established with the experiment study being achieved. The results indicate that the proposed strategy can distribute the braking force reasonably, and meet the requirements of energy recycling in HEV with HESS, the HEV's driving range can be extended as well.
