In this work, silver (Ag) anchored over graphene (GN) wrapped polypyrrole (PPy)@ nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) nanocomposites were synthesized through a combination of oxidative polymerization and hydrothermal processes. The synthesized Ag/GN@PPy–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposites were characterized for their morphological characteristics by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), while the structural investigations were done by X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FESEM studies showed Ni(OH)2 flakes and silver particles attached over the surface of PPy globules, along with the presence of GN sheets and spherical silver particles. The structural analysis also showed the presence of constituents, i.e., Ag, Ni(OH)2, PPy, GN, and their interaction, therefore vouching that the synthesis protocol is efficacious. The electrochemical (EC) investigations were done in potassium hydroxide (1 M KOH) using a three electrode setup. The quaternary Ag/GN@PPy–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrode showed the highest specific capacity of 237.25 C g−1. The highest electrochemical performance of the quaternary nanocomposite is associated with the synergistic/additional effect of PPy, Ni(OH)2, GN, and Ag. The assembled supercapattery with Ag/GN@PPy-Ni(OH)2 as a positive and activated carbon (AC) as a negative electrode displayed eminent energy density of 43.26 Wh kg−1 with the associated power density of 750.00 W kg−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. The cyclic stability of the supercapattery (Ag/GN@PPy–Ni(OH)2//AC), comprising a battery-type electrode, displayed a high cyclic stability of 108.37% after 5500 cycles.
