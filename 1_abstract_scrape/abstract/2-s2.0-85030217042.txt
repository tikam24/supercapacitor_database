Hybrid metal-ion capacitors (MICs) (M stands for Li or Na) are designed to deliver high energy density, rapid energy delivery, and long lifespan. The devices are composed of a battery anode and a supercapacitor cathode, and thus become a tradeoff between batteries and supercapacitors. In the past two decades, tremendous efforts have been put into the search for suitable electrode materials to overcome the kinetic imbalance between the battery-type anode and the capacitor-type cathode. Recently, some transition-metal compounds have been found to show pseudocapacitive characteristics in a nonaqueous electrolyte, which makes them interesting high-rate candidates for hybrid MIC anodes. Here, the material design strategies in Li-ion and Na-ion capacitors are summarized, with a focus on pseudocapacitive oxide anodes (Nb2O5, MoO3, etc.), which provide a new opportunity to obtain a higher power density of the hybrid devices. The application of Mxene as an anode material of MICs is also discussed. A perspective to the future research of MICs toward practical applications is proposed to close.
