In the modern era, electric vehicles play a vital role because of their eco-friendly features. In this proposed study, an EV is equipped with a supercapacitor and battery. Also, these configurations are powered by solar PV with a quasi- Z source converter. The proposed methodology delivers uninterrupted power to the EV and the braking conditions regenerative energy is stored with the bi-directional converter. The proposed converter doesn't need any additional equipment for bidirectional power flow. A Centre tapped High-Frequency Transformers (HFT) are intended for isolation purposes. The secondary side of HFT provides bi-directional power flow in different ecological conditions. The proposed methodology's performance investigation is obtained with various stages to verify its adequateness. The entire model is developed with the help of Matlab/Simulink. The converter's efficiency depends on its bi-directional power flow and transient conditions.
