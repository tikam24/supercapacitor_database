Creation of nanopores on graphene planar sheets is of great significance in promoting the kinetic diffusion of electrolyte and enhancing the utilization efficiency of graphene planar sheets. Herein, we developed a facile chemical vapor deposition strategy to prepare highly porous graphene with flake-like MgO as template and ferrocene as the carbon precursor. The graphene layers show a highly porous structure with small mesopores of 4-8 nm, large mesopores of 10-20 nm and additional macropores of 100-200 nm. These nanopores on graphene sheets provide numerous channels for fast ion transport perpendicular to the 2D basal plane, while the good powder conductivity ensures an effective electron propagation within the 2D graphene plane. As a result, a specific capacitance of 303 F g-1, an areal capacitance up to 17.3 μF cm-2 and a nearly tenfold shorter time constant were achieved when compared with those of nonporous and stacked graphene electrodes. The method demonstrated herein would open up an opportunity to prepare porous graphene for a wide applications in energy storage, biosensors, nanoelectronics and catalysis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014.
