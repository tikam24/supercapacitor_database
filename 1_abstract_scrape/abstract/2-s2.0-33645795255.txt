Efficiency of energy recuperation in a hybrid diesel-electric locomotive equipped with a super-capacitor used for energy-storage has been analysed and the analysis results have been presented. Pulse mode of the capacitor charge/discharge has been considered. It has been proved that the process efficiency is closely related to voltage levels of the motor and the supercapacitor (initial and final voltage of charge discharge) as well as to parameters of the devices: rated power of the set and capacity of the supercapacitor Example simulation tests for a supercapacitor applied to modernize a diesel locomotive SP42 have been presented. The determined supercapacitor capacities make possible to recuperate braking energy in most of the running conditions predicted for that locomotive. The accepted voltage levels of charge/discharge make possible to obtain 70 energy efficiency in the processes of energy storage or recovery and savings of ca 20 kg of diesel fuel per one duty cycle.
