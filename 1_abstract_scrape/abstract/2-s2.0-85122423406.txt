Rational design of a transitional metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is crucial for catering for high-performance supercapacitor. Although various strategies are performed, the electrochemical performance of LDHs is still impeded by their poor electronic conductivity and serious aggregation. Herein, zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) derived NiCo-LDH nanosheets are vertically anchored on the surface of 2D NiCo-MOF to form three-dimensional interconnected hybrid nanosheets, which can effectively impede the aggregation of nanosheets and expose more active sites. The as-prepared NiCo-LDH@MOF hybrid nanosheets exhibit a high specific capacity of 723 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and still maintain a capacity retention of 66 % at 30 A g−1. The prominent electrochemical performance of NiCo-LDH@MOF is attributed to the 3D interconnected sheet-like structure with high accessible specific surface area, rich electrochemical active sites and short ion/electron transfer path.
