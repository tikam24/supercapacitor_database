Graphene is a wonderful material of 2D sheet with enhanced surface area, along with its high electrical and thermal conductivity makes it a prominent place in energy storage domain. Its electrochemical energy storage activities are analyzed using Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 5M Al(NO3)3 electrolytes. We have taken graphene nanopowder, whose lattice plane is oriented in the direction (0 0 2) and observed the ratio of intensity corresponding to D & G band has 0.33 by Raman analysis. Through CV characteristics, we have estimated the specific capacitance as 15 F/g at 10 mV/s and with Nyquist plot Equivalent series resistance (ESR) is obtained around 19 Î©. It is interesting to mention that high surface area has strong impact on charge/discharge cycles, which provides high power density. This leads to perfect coulombic efficiency (100%) with no degradation even after 2000 cycles.
