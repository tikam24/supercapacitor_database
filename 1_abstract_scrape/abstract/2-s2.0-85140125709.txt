Supercapacitors are considered among the most promising electrical energy storage devices, there being a need to achieve the highest possible energy storage density. Herein small mixed Zn–Co metal oxide nanoparticles are grown on doped graphene (O-, N- and, B-doped graphenes). The electrochemical properties of the resulting mixed Zn–Co metal oxide nanoparticles (4 nm) grown on B-doped graphene exhibit an outstanding specific capacitance of 2568 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, ranking this B-doped graphene composite among the best performing electrodes. The energy storage capacity is also remarkable even at large current densities (i.e., 640 F g−1 at 40 A g−1). In contrast, larger nanoparticles are obtained using N- and O-doped graphenes as support, the resulting materials exhibiting lower performance. Besides energy storage, the Zn–Co oxide on B-doped graphene shows notable electrochemical performance and stability obtaining a maximum energy density of 77.6 W h Kg−1 at 850 W Kg−1, a power density of 8500 W Kg−1 at 28.3 W h Kg−1, and a capacitance retention higher than 85% after 5000 cycles. The smaller nanoparticle size and improved electrochemical performance on B-doped graphene-based devices are attributed to the higher defect density and nature of the dopant element on graphene.
