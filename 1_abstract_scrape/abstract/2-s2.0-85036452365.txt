A more detailed understanding of the electrode/electrolyte interface degradation during the charging cycle in supercapacitors is of great interest for exploring the voltage stability range and therefore the extractable energy. The evaluation of the gas evolution during the charging, discharging, and aging processes is a powerful tool toward determining the stability and energy capacity of supercapacitors. Here, we attempt to fit the gas analysis resolution to the time response of a low-gas-generation power device by adopting a modified pulsed electrochemical mass spectrometry (PEMS) method. The pertinence of the method is shown using a symmetric carbon/carbon supercapacitor operating in different aqueous electrolytes. The differences observed in the gas levels and compositions as a function of the cell voltage correlate to the evolution of the physicochemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes and to the electrochemical performance, giving a complete picture of the processes taking place at the electrode/electrolyte interface.
