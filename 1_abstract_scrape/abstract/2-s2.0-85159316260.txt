This article addresses the issue of bulk electrode design and the factors limiting the performance of thick electrodes. Indeed, one of the challenges for achieving improved performance in electrochemical energy storage devices (batteries or supercapacitors) is the maximization of the ratio between active and non-active components while maintaining ionic and electronic conductivity of the assembly. In this study, we developed and compared supercapacitor thick electrodes using commercially available carbons and utilising conventional, easily scalable methods such as spray coating and freeze-casting. We also compared different binders and conductive carbons to develop thick electrodes and analysed factors that determine the performance of such thick electrodes, such as porosity and tortuosity. The spray-coated electrodes showed high areal capacitances of 1428 mF cm−2 at 0.3 mm thickness and 2459 F cm−2 at 0.6 mm thickness.
