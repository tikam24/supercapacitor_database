In this study, porous one-dimensional (1D) CoO nanobelts and two-dimensional (2D) CoO nanoplates were successfully fabricated by calcining single crystalline cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate - Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O nanobelts and nanoplates obtained using a solvothermal method. Solvents applied in the reaction significantly affected the shape and size of Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O. Belt-like Co(CO3)0.5(OH)·0.11H2O crystals can be easy to turn into to plate-like by adjusting the volume ratio of ethylene glycol (EG) to water. The as-prepared porous CoO nanobelts, when used as the supercapacitor electrode materials, exhibit a higher specific capacitance of 1178 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 than porous CoO nanoplates. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on CoO nanobelts and aqueous electrolyte also show more excellent electrochemical performance, e.g., higher energy density (68.5 Wh kg−1 at 850.0 W kg−1) and long-term cycling ability.
