Flexible and lightweight fiber-shaped micro-supercapacitors have attracted tremendous attention as next-generation portable electronic devices, due to their high flexibility, tiny volume, and wearability. Herein, we successfully fabricated a ternary binder-free nanocomposite of MnO2/PEDOT:PSS-rGO on a carbon fiber substrate for application in high performance fiber-shaped micro-supercapacitors. The synergistic effects of the different components in the fiber-shaped electrode help to deliver a high specific capacitance of 2.9 F cm-2 (194 F cm-3 and 550 mF cm-1) at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 and a long cycle life with 95% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. A fiber-shaped asymmetric micro-device based on the resulting hybrid electrode was assembled. A maximum energy density of EA = 295 Î¼W h cm-2 (EV = 19 mW h cm-3) and power density of PA = 14 mW cm-2 (PV = 930 mW cm-3) were achieved in an operating voltage window of 0-2.0 V in a solid-state Na2SO4-CMC electrolyte. Moreover, a fiber-shaped asymmetric micro-device with a super-concentrated potassium acetate-based water-in-salt electrolyte (27 m KOAC) is presented. The use of the water-in-salt electrolyte enables a cell voltage of 2.8 V, and energy densities are higher than those of the micro-device operating with conventional dilute aqueous electrolytes.
