Abstract: Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals grown on graphene nanosheets (GNSs) were synthesized through a facile microwave hydrothermal method. The morphological and crystalline changes of Co 3 O 4 nanocrystals during the microwave hydrothermal treatment are characterized by FE-SEM and XRD. Different morphologies of Co 3 O 4 /GNSs are obtained by controlling the microwave hydrothermal temperatures and time. The particle-slice Co 3 O 4 /GNSs exhibits the specific capacitance of 736 F g −1 at a current density of 9 A g −1 and 659 F g −1 at a high current density of 32 A g −1 (~97% capacitance retention at 4.5 A g −1 and ~89% capacitance retention at 9 A g −1 ). Therefore, the anode material with high rate capability and excellent cycle stability could be promising for high-performance supercapacitor. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
