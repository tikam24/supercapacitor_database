Recent improvements in contemporary electronics have been starved of further revolutions to accomplish long-running, large-power, and high-energy storage devices. Compare to traditional batteries, the supercapacitor has increased substantial attention because of its rapid charging/discharging (CDg) speed, high energy and power density and long-standing cycling stability. Herein, some recently emerging carbon-based electrode materials are discussed, together with covalent organic frameworks, metalâ€“organic frameworks, metal nitrides, black phosphorus, MXenes, LaMnO3, TiO2, RbAg4I5, and others to fabricate for higher electrical conductivity electrodes flexible textile supercapacitors, and larger specific surface area. However, difficulties still remain in power density, mechanical flexibility, and cycling life. Fabricated materials can be obtained with high thermal stability, good electroconductivity, and high specific capacitance where carbon materials are employed with conducting polymers. Apart from this, several aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes have been found to overcome traditional hydrolysis concerns. Lastly, the challenges and opportunities with the future outlook of supercapacitor developments are summarized which have synergistic effect between electrolytes and electrodes.
