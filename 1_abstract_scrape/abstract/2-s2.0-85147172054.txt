Ionic liquids (ILs), often known as green designer solvents, have demonstrated immense application potential in numerous scientific and technological domains. ILs possess high boiling point and low volatility that make them suitable environmentally benign candidates for many potential applications. The more important aspect associated with ILs is that their physicochemical properties can be effectively changed for desired applications just by tuning the structure of the cationic and/or anionic part of ILs. Furthermore, these eco-friendly designer materials can function as electrolytes or solvents depending on the application. Owing to the distinctive properties such as low volatility, high thermal and electrochemical stability, and better ionic conductivity, ILs are nowadays immensely used in a variety of energy applications, particularly in the development of green and sustainable energy storage and conversion devices. Suitable ILs are designed for specific purposes to be used as electrolytes and/or solvents for fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors (SCs), and solar cells. Herein, we have highlighted the utilization of ILs as unique green designer materials in Li-batteries, fuel cells, SCs, and solar cells. This review will enlighten the promising prospects of these unique, environmentally sustainable materials for next-generation green energy conversion and storage devices. Ionic liquids have much to offer in the field of energy sciences regarding fixing some of the worldâ€™s most serious issues. However, most of the discoveries discussed in this review article are still at the laboratory research scale for further development. This review article will inspire researchers and readers about how ILs can be effectively applied in energy sectors for various applications as mentioned above.
