The following article presents the analytical basis and research results for ultracapacitors, acquired purposely built test stand for dynamic load cycle tests. Furthermore, three methods allowing for determination of ultracapacitor model parameters were presented in the work. First was the off-line identification in time domain method, involving minimization of the mean square error of model response and element response alignment for given input. Second method was off-line identification in frequency domain, involving application of least squares method with implemented model response correction procedure. Third method was on-line identification which allowed for determination of model parameters in real time with use of Kalman filter. The methods presented can be applied in research of other types of energy storage systems, i.e.: electrochemical batteries or hybrid energy storage systems.
