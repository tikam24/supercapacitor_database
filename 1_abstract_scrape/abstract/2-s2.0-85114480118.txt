A core-shell structure composite material consisting of a conductive polymer and 2D conductive metal-organic frameworks (CMOFs) was assembled by hydrothermal methods. The use of polypyrrole (PPy) as a backbone effectively prevents the aggregation of CMOFs. Its own hollow structure provides better conductivity while shortening the ion diffusion pathway. Benefiting from the rational structural design, the performance of 572.2 F g-1 is demonstrated by the core-shell PPy@NiCo-CAT electrode. In addition, we incorporated the material into the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) and verified its excellent energy density and lifetime. Furthermore, 12 light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be illuminated by two HSCs connected in series. The strategy of compounding conductive polymers with 2D CMOFs provides additional options for developing electrode materials for high-performance HSC devices.
