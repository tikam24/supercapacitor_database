An electrochemical cell representing a battery-supercapacitor hybrid is demonstrated with a Si anode and a TiO<inf>2</inf> cathode based on Lithium chemistry. Both materials are fabricated as coaxial shells with an oblique nanocolumnar structure anchored on vertical aligned carbon nanofiber arrays. The Li<sup>+</sup> ion transport and electrical connection is greatly enhanced with such nanoporous core-shell architectures, leading to optimal Li storage properties. The full theoretical capacity of the shell materials has been obtained at normal C-rates (C/1 to C/2) for Si (∼3,000 to 3500 mA h g<sup>-1</sup>) and TiO<inf>2</inf> (∼170 mA h g<sup>-1</sup>) half-cells, respectively, with excellent cycling stability. More importantly, much higher rates (up to 4.7C<inf>Si</inf> for Si and 76C<inf>TiO2</inf> for TiO<inf>2</inf>) can be applied at relatively small capacity loss, approaching the properties of supercapacitors. The charge-discharge profiles show battery-supercapacitor hybrid features, which are attributed to the short Li<sup>+</sup> diffusion path across the solid materials and the large pseudocapacitive contribution from fast surface reactions. A full cell containing similar volume of Si and TiO<inf>2</inf> shows a high specific energy (103 W h kg<sup>-1</sup>) at low current rates, comparable to a decent battery, and a remarkable specific power (56,000 W kg<sup>-1</sup>) at high current rates, matching the state-of-the-art supercapacitors.
