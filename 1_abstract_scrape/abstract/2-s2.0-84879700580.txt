Birnessite has been made in a number of morphologies through variation of reaction conditions in a simple templated hydrothermal synthesis. After processing into electrodes and testing in hybrid supercapacitor cells, good cycleability and a range of specific capacitances were observed. The most promising material, a birnessite nanotube, was extensively electrochemically tested at elevated temperatures. An increase in specific capacitance from 340 to 700 F g-1 was observed as the temperature was raised from 30 to 80°C but with an accompanying increase in current leakage. There was a drop in specific capacitance with cycling at elevated temperatures and, with the aid of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data, inferences have been drawn regarding the effects of both cycling and time spent at elevated temperatures. ©The Electrochemical Society.
