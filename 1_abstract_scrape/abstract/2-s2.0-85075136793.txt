Highly microporous and mesoporous activated carbon (AC), with a graphene nanosheet structure, was obtained from Posidonia oceanica and used as electrodes for supercapacitor devices. The structural and morphological properties of this AC was investigated. The supercapacitive properties of the AC electrode was studied in a LiClO4/acetonitrile electrolyte solution. The specific surface properties and the pore size distribution were determined. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrated that the electrodes had an excellent cyclic stability, high specific capacity and long operating lifetime. The obtained maximum supercapacitance was 172 F g−1 in a large potential window (− 1.0 to + 1.0 V). The impedance spectrum measurement method was also investigated. The modeling was used to find the most significant parameters of this device. This material might have a potential application in electric energy storage with a highly stable performance up to 10,000 cycles.
