This paper described the study and the modeling of a system powertrain for fuel cell vehicle. In fact, the paper reviews the power train of the vehicle which includes proton exchange membrane (PEM) Fuel cell, the supercapacitor(SC), DC/DC converter, inverter and the Permanent magnet synchronous. So we propose a new architecture system controlled through a proposed energy management approach which determines the power demand between the PEM fuel cell, supercapacitor and the load. The control strategy tested with the different driving cycles exhibit excellent performance in order to minimize the hydrogen consumption. A hybrid power train configuration based on a PEM fuel cell a supercapacitor (SC) is designed and simulated by using a matlab/simulink.
