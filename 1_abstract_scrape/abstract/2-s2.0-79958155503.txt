Carbon-coated SnS as electrode materials for supercapacitor were synthesized by high-energy ball milling and following co-heating with polyvinyl alcohol. The morphology and structure of prepared carbon-coated SnS were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical investigation indicated that carbon-coated SnS presented preferable electrochemical performances than pristine SnS. In comparison to pristine SnS, carbon-coated SnS had better capacitive response in cyclic voltammetry and could deliver larger specific capacitance of 28.47 F/g in galvanostatical charge-discharge process. Enhanced conductivity of carbon-coated SnS revealed by Nyquist plots was considered to be responsible for its enhanced electrochemical performances. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag.
