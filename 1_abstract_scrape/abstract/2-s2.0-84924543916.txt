A new redox-active gel electrolyte has been developed by adding 2-mercaptopyridine to poly(vinyl alcohol)-H2SO4 and exhibits reversible redox reactions for a high pseudocapacitance. Upon combination with carbon nanotube/mesoporous carbon hybrid fibers that show large surface areas to fabricate a fiber-shaped supercapacitor, an area specific capacitance of 507.02 mF cm-2 has been achieved.
