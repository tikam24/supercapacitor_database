The fabrication of energy storage devices with lowering the cost and improving the performance has always been the need for society. Therefore, supercapacitors with special features such as light-weight, easy portability and remarkable charging/discharging rate capability have widely been studied in the literature. In the present work, In-situ carbon coated manganese oxide nanorods (ISCC-MnO 2 NRs) have been studied for the supercapacitor application. ISCC-MnO 2 NRs were prepared by slip casting method followed by annealing at 1200 °C. During heat treatment, sucrose has transformed into conducting carbon and coated on the surface of MnO 2 . ISCC-MnO 2 NRs were examined by FEG-SEM, FEG-TEM, XRD, FT-IR, BET and Raman spectroscopy. The measurement of the electrochemical properties of the material was carried out in the two-electrode configuration using 1 M Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution as an electrolyte. The specific capacitance of ISCC-MnO 2 NRs was found to be 28.24 F/g at the current density of 1 A g −1 with energy density of 0.98 Wh/kg. This work suggests ISCC-MnO 2 NRs may be a promising electrode material for the supercapacitor.
