The accordion-like Ti3C2 powder sample was obtained by preliminary etching of Ti3AlC2(MAX) with HF and different intercalation agents. It is shown that the intercalation agent of Na2SO4 is beneficial to increasing the layer spacing and specific area of Ti3C2, supplying more ion diffusion channels for the electrolyte, and full contact between the electrode materials and the electrolyte. The flower-like Ti3C2/LDH composites layered were synthesized with electrostatic self-assembly of positively charged Ni-Mn LDH nanosheets and negatively charged Ti3C2. The combination of Ni-Mn LDH and Ti3C2 realizes the microstructure modification, enhances the capacitance of the Ti3C2 and the cycling performance of LDH and decreases the internal resistance of LDH material. The specific capacitance of Ti3C2/LDH composite material is 82.3 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and can maintain 34.3 mAh g−1 even at 10 A g−1. The specific capacitance remains at 84% of the first cycle after 4000 charge and discharge cycles.
