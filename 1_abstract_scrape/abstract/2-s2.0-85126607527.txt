Metal oxide composites containing nanostructured carbons have been extensively researched to overcome difficulties such as low intrinsic electronic conductivity, significant irreversible capacity loss, and poor coulombic efficiency in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). A time-efficient microwave autoclave synthesis technique was approached to fuse V2O5 to MWCNT strands. V2O5/MWCNT is a hybrid nanoparticle with crucial features for the electrode needed for a supercapacitor that has been investigated and reported. Due to X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak investigation, the nanoparticles' phase structure, space group, and strain(ε) have been determined. The particle size was calculated in Debye-Scherrer, modified Scherrer, and uniform deformation modeling (UDM) modes. The interaction between light photons and electrons is thoroughly addressed using UV–Vis technology. Optical constants like refractive index (n), absorption coefficient (α), and destructive coefficient (k) is addressed as a result of this. Nanoparticles' dielectric function (εrand εi), and direct bandgap have also been reported. Along with V2O5/MWCNT's strong Photoluminescence (PL) emission, interpretation of unique optical properties and considerable potential for practical applications have been intensively studied. V2O5/MWCNT is confirmed by data acquired by Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for vanadium, oxygen, and carbon. The formation of nanoparticles with the dimensions of V2O5/MWCNT is proven by Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) micrographic imagery. A Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) analyzer measures the material's highest specific capacity when exposed to electrochemical action, 632 Fg-1. The median power density (E) is predicted to be 146 Whkg-1, and the power density (P) is 1.52 ​kW kg-1 in the Galvanostatic Charge/Discharging (GCD) rating. These values are beneficial for describing the capabilities of supercapacitors.
