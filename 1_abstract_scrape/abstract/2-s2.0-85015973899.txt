Micro/nano hierarchical structures with uniformly patterned nanostructures shell and activated internal core are promising for boosting electrochemical performance. Here we report the fabrication of wire-shaped supercapacitive electrodes with manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanostructures shell integrated onto activated carbon fiber (ACF) core. The ACF core is doped with nitrogen heteroatom and shows good conductivity and hydrophilicity, which endow fast ion and electron transport and high accessibility of electrolyte. The MnO2 nanostructures shell integrated on the ACF core by electrodeposition method together provide significant pseudocapacitive contribution associated with fast faradaic reactions. The electrochemical performance of the fabricated electrodes was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charging/discharging and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The integrated wire-shaped electrodes, which boost the synergetic effect of MnO2 nanostructures and ACF, have excellent current collecting capabilities thus resulting high electrochemical performance (with the specific capacitance of 26.64 mF cm−1 at the current density of 0.1 mA cm−1 and 96% capacitance retention after 8000 charging/discharging cycles at the current density of 1 mA cm−1).
