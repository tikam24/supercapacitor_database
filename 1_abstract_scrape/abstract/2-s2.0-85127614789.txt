This work reports on a high-performance supercapacitor of cerium oxide/carbon nanofiber (CeO2/CNF) nanocomposites prepared by the combination of electrospinning and thermal treatment techniques. The superior capacitive performance of the CeO2/CNF nanocomposites could be attributed to the presence of Ce3+/Ce4+ and the highly porous structure determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller. The CeO2/CNF nanocomposites with various CeO2:CNF ratios (CeO2 = 10 wt%, 20 wt%, and 40 wt%) exhibited a highly porous structure with average pore size and specific surface area of 3.28 nm and 754 m2g−1, respectively. By using the XPS technique, the presence of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in all the CeO2/CNFs samples has been confirmed. The CeO2/CNF electrodes exhibit a pseudocapacitive behavior with the specific capacitance ranging from 103.47 Fg−1 to 211.84 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1. Among our samples, the CeO2/CNF 20 wt% exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 232.86 Fg−1 (equivalent to an energy density of 37.97 Whkg−1) and a very high-power density (136.88 Wkg−1 × 103 Wkg−1) with the capacitive retention of >97% after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. This work suggests that the CeO2/CNF nanocomposites could be a promising candidate to be used as the electroactive material for supercapacitor applications.
