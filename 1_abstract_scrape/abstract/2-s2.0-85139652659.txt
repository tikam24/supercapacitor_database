In this study, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was prepared at room temperature via a simple solvothermal method, followed by calcination at 150 °C and 300 °C. The present paper reports the effect of calcination temperature on electrochemical performance of as-prepared ZIF-8. The product obtained from solvothermal method shows battery-type behavior of the synthesized electrode material. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to analyze the sample’s structure and further validate the cubic phase with I-43 m space group. The elemental and morphological details of synthesized sample are provided by energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For a current density of 1 A/g, the as-prepared sample exhibits significantly improved specific capacities of 34, 40, and 58.2 C/g at ambient and 150 and 300 °C temperature, respectively. After 1500 cycles, the sample that was calcined at 300 °C showed good cyclic stability of 80% at current density of 2 A/g. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.] • ZIF-8 nanomaterials were successfully synthesized via cost effective solvothermal technique. • Effect of calcination at different temperature was thoroughly examined and then investigated their battery-type performance. • The calcined ZIF-8 at 300 ºC shows superior capacity performance of about 58.2 C/g at 1 A/g current density. • The capacitance retention after 1500 cycles at 2 A/g is 80 %.
