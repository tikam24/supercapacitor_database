For energy storage applications, flexible hybrid supercapacitors have been attracted significant attention owing to their fascinating electrochemical performance of combining advantages. In this study, novel GO-CoPc and GO-NiPc nanocomposite films were prepared and their electrochemical performance was investigated. GO-CoPc and GO-NiPc nanocomposites were synthesized via a novel and cost-effective freeze-drying method which increases the conductivity. Furthermore, the flexible and mechanically stable GO-CoPc and GO-NiPc nanocomposite were equipped with high specific surface areas, which are conducive to growing the micropores and active sites. The electrochemical measurement results indicate that nanocomposite electrodes have higher specific capacitances as they have higher redox activity than GO, CoPc, and NiPc electrodes. The highest specific capacitance obtained for the GO-NiPc nanocomposite electrode was obtained 295 Fg-1. The highest specific capacitance obtained for the GO-CoPc nanocomposite electrode was 325 Fg-1. This study reveals new high potential materials with high active surface area, low resistance and long cycle-life (aqueous media) features for pseudocapacitors.
