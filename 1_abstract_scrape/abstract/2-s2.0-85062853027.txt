This paper proposes a novel control strategy for hybrid stand-alone microgrid (MG) system under different load conditions. This control strategy is proposed considering the fast response Super-Capacitor storage element in order to improve the dynamic performance of the system. This control strategy is applied to an isolated MG consists of Photovoltaic (PV) cells and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine (WT) integrating a Super-Capacitors (SCs) energy storage. The control strategy is dedicated to control the output voltage in terms of amplitude and frequency under different conditions of operation, and to achieve a better regulation between the available generation and the overall load demand taking in consideration balanced, unbalanced and nonlinear load. The proposed control strategy helps in improving the grid power quality by controlling the PV system so as to operate as an active power filter by providing the nonlinear load with the required harmonic component of current. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified by applying it on a 450 kW PMSG WT and 100 kW PV system under various operating conditions. The simulation results are obtained using SIMULINK toolbox in MATLAB environment. The simulation results show that, the proposed control strategy operates efficiently with high steady state performance.
