Graphene is proving to be an efficient medium for the control of mm-wave/THz radiation. Its electrical and dielectric properties allows it to be incorporated into various existing device architectures. One such application is in the modulation of the amplitude of the propagating THz radiation. Due to its electrical properties this interaction is typically broadband in nature. To make this frequency selective we propose the use of metamaterials or frequency selective surfaces. Generally, these structures perform the frequency filtering by modifying the propagation of the input wave with respect to changing structural parameters of the device itself. By fabricating a frequency selective surface based on a periodic circular hole array on an aluminum sheet we show that the transmission of a narrow band of THz radiation can be modulated when the sheet is combined with a highly efficient graphene based supercapacitor device. The modulation depth of the device was 15% in the frequency region of interest. The simple structure of the device coupled with the obtained performance shows that graphene based devices have great potential for the development of THz technologies.
