We are reporting here a novel antimony doped cobalt oxide based electrode material for supercapacitor application to overcome the current scenario of energy crises by offering excellent capacitive abilities. A facile hydrothermal route was employed to produce this antimony doped cobalt oxide material by varying content value of antimony in the range of 2â€“6 at. %. The X-ray diffraction results have successfully explored the cubic crystal structure along with phase composition of these as obtained Sb doped Co3O4 materials. The development of sub-micron sized structures-based material was explored by obtaining scanning electron microscopic images. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results have shown the highly pure nature of as obtained material. Cyclic voltammogram results have exhibited that among the SbCo-0, SbCo-2, SbCo-4 and SbCo-6 materials, SbCo-4 has exhibited higher specific capacitance value i.e 894.15 F/g than remaining, which was obtained by scanning the material at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. More significantly, Galvanostatic charge-discharge profiles obtained at different scan rates ranging from 1 to 10 A/g, for SbCo-4 material has shown even good capacitance retention i.e 75.70% at higher sweep rate, equal to 10 A/g. On the basis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis, it is concluded that this material has also shown excellent conductive properties. Furthermore, after performing 3000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles, it is concluded that this material can possessed an excellent cycling stability equal to 82.02%. All these excellent capacitive properties shown by this material have suggested that it can be proved as a potential applicant in the field of energy storage devices.
