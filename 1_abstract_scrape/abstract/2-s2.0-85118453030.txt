Supercapacitor (SCs), known as outstanding electrical storage capacity, which times more than the batteries and fuel cells, recharges with a large amount of released power, fast overpassing the gap between capacitors and batteries, and widely be employed in the field of energy storage. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) attract intensive attention as electrode materials in supercapacitor application, owing to their ultrahigh porosity, adjustable distribution of pore size, convenient synthesis, great structural adaptability, etc. Composited with different materials, such as carbons family, metal oxide, can improve pristine MOFs' conductivity and chemical stability, which are all-important as electrode materials in SCs. This review comprehensively summarizes the common synthesis methods of four kinds of MOFs materials: the pristine MOFs, MOFs composites, MOFs-derived nanoporous carbons, and MOFs-derived metal oxides. Also, the applications of these four kinds of materials in SCs electrode materials are systematically introduced. Furthermore, a perspective on MOFs materials in the field of SCs is discussed.
