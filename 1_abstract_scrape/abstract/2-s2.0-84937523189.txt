A mesoporous molybdenum disulfide/carbon (MoS2/C) composite with flower-like morphology resulting from the decoration of carbon by MoS2 interlaced nanosheets was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route, and utilized for the electrode material of supercapacitor. The morphologies and structures of materials were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectrum and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. Electrochemical properties of materials were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests of two-electrode supercapacitors. The results indicate that the complex of carbon and MoS2 can increase the electrical conductivity and can get thinner MoS2 nanosheets leading to the increment of specific surface area, which result in the improvement in the electrochemical performances of material. The specific capacitance of MoS2/C composite reaches 201.4 F g-1 at a current density of 0.2 A g-1 in a two-electrode supercapacitor, which is higher than those of pure MoS2 and carbon. Additionally, the MoS2/C-based supercapacitor exhibits high rate capability and long cyclic durability.
