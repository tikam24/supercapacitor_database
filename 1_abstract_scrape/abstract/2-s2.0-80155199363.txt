The quality of the supply voltage in automotive power nets is deteriorating because of the electrification of auxiliary components with high and dynamic power demands. This electrification, on the one hand, serves the reduction of CO2-emissions and, on the other hand, it is required in vehicles with an electric drive train. For the stabilization of the supply voltage active units can be used. In this paper the construction and first simulation results of an interleaved 2-phase buck-boost converter in combination with a supercapacitor-storage for this purpose are described. Furthermore insight into the control and the operational strategy is delivered. Â© 2011 IEEE.
