This work describes the preparation and characterization of activated xerogel nanoporous-materials from resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer precursors and their use as electrodes in symmetric electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) for energy storage applications. Chemical activation by KOH pellets with varying doses was used for activation of xerogels. The intercalation of K+ ions during activation results in micro to nano size materials analysed through SEM images. Also, the porous texture was studied through nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments. Further, the electrodes were formed using binder based slurry without addition of conductive agents, and tested for electrochemical performance with KOH electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests were employed to characterize the performance of the electrodes. The specific double layer capacitance was found to be 186.15 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1A g-1, which remain at 168.57 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.
