The Ni3S4 microspheres have been synthesized via a facile solvothermal method. The crystal structure and surface morphology are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microspherical Ni3S4 exhibits good electrochemical capacitance validated by electrochemical measurements. The specific capacities of 1120.6 F路g-1 at 0.5 A路g-1 and 433.4 F路g-1 at 4 A路g-1 with the capacitance retention of 89.37 % and 84.88 % were obtained after 1000 cycles, respectively. The electrochemical reaction is expected due to the transformation of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH based on the XRD, XPS and CV analysis results.
