The proceedings contain 10 papers. The topics discussed include: model of electrorheological fluid dynamics and its applications in autonomous emergency braking system; a multi-scale block compression sensing sampling algorithm; photovoltaic charged supercapacitor power supply for on-body sensors; a phase noise measurement system with frequency drift compensation; algorithm for monitoring the operability of peltier thermoelectric modules based on the identification of transients; and research on shoreline identification method based on partition fitting evaluation strategy.
