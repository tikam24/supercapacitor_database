Vertical graphene nanosheets (VGNs) are a prominent material for supercapacitor electrode purpose, due to its well defined three dimensional architecture and remarkable properties. Although VGN has all the necessary criteria for supercapacitor electrode, enhancement in its charge storage performance is the subject of research. Herein, we report the improvement in charge storage performance of VGN by conformal like decoration with TiO2. The as-grown VGN exhibited a capacitance value of 0.15 mF cm-2 (6 F g-1) and is found to enhance up to 2.8 mF cm-2 (103.7 F g-1) with TiO2 decoration of the VGN surface. The enhancement in capacitance value is correlated with the increase in electrical conductivity, reduced series resistance and presence of pseudocapacitance of the TiO2 decorated VGN electrode in addition to electric double layer capacitance.
