The azoviolet@Mn3O4 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized using the azoviolet as a stable absorbed reagent for the supercapacitor. The prepared nanoparticles have been characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, surface area and pore size analysis. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were performed in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions in a fixed voltage window of ~(0â€“1.00) V vs. Ag/AgCl. The specific capacitance at 1 A/g is 112.0 F/g. The azoviolets can improve the reaction areas of Mn3O4 nanoparticles in Na2SO4 aqueous solution for the supercapacitor.
