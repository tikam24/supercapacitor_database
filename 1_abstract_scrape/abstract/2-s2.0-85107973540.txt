In this study, benzidine (BnZ) is used not only as a reducing agent but also as the spacer on the supercapacitive behavior of the synthesized graphene nanocomposite film. The synthesized graphene nanocomposite was examined by crystalline size, structural morphology, presence of functional groups to X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, chemical composition moieties are evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Poly ortho aminophenol as a p-type conductive polymer was introduced into the channels of Bnz-rGOAerogel. This composite structure with a high surface area and pore volume can effectively play a synergistic role between the two materials, thus improving its overall performance. In addition, the specific capacitance of the prepared spherical composite electrode is as high as 625 F/g at 1.0 A/g current density, and the retention rate of the initial capacity is 89% after 3,000 cycles in acidic solution, which has good cycle stability.
