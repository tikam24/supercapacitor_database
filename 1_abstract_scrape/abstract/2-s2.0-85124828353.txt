Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have ordered porous structure and intriguing properties for supercapacitors, however, poor conductivity and cycle stability limits their application. To solve these problems, hence, a simple strategy is proposed, by which MOFs are in-situ grown in the porous conductive p-MXene substrate. And then, along with the introduction of CuS, the grown Ni-MOF is derived to Ni3S4, which is more stable and more electrochemically active. Due to higher contact area, excellent synergistic effect and more exposed active sites, the prepared sandwiched p-MXene@Ni3S4/CuS nanostructure displays a big specific capacitance (1917 F·g−1) and superior cycling performance (91.2%@30000). What's more, the assembled p-MXene@Ni3S4/CuS//AC asymmetric device delivers a high energy density of 87.62 Wh·Kg−1 at the power density of 775.02 W·Kg−1, suggesting that this material provides a brilliant candidate for energy storage.
