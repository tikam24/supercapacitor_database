CoMn layered double hydroxides (CoMn-LDH) are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors because of their excellent cyclic stability. However, they possess relatively low capacitances. In this work, hybrid CoMn-LDH@MnO2 products grown on Ni foams were obtained through a facile hydrothermal method. The as-synthesized samples employed as electrodes deliver a specific capacitance of 2325.01 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor using these products as positive electrodes shows a maximum energy density of 59.73 W h kg−1 at 1000.09 W kg−1. The prominent electrochemical performance of the as-prepared electrodes could be attributes to hierarchical structures. These findings suggest that hybrid structures might be potential alternatives for future flexible energy storage devices.
