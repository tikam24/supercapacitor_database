In this paper, a new equivalent circuit model which can describe the hybrid supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte's working features is presented based on deeply analysis of its basic working principle. Firstly, each component of the hybrid supercapacitor with aqueous electrolyte is modeled individually. Then the integral model is built. Subsequently, the method of parameter identification is analyzed in detail and the model expression of parameter identification is also deduced. Furthermore, the parameters are identified through the recursive least squares algorithm with restricted memory. At last, the model is simulated and verified with the experimental data. The experimental and simulated results prove the veracity of the model presented in this paper.
