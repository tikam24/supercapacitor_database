Multiple renewable energy sources, such as microbial fuel cells (MFCs), can greatly improve the energy output to drive loads for prolonged operation time. However, even designed with exactly the same material, size and structure, the generated voltages at their outputs are different due to the nonlinear effects of microorganisms. Simply combining these sources degrades the overall efficiency and excludes some source contributions. A conventional energy combining platform is not suited for low-voltage energy sources and has limited overall efficiency. In this paper, a new energy combiner circuit is proposed. The proposed circuit can be either power up a load or charge an energy storage such as a rechargeable battery or a supercapacitor. Simulation results are carried out in a 0.13Î¼m CMOS process and demonstrate the efiectiveness of the proposed design.
