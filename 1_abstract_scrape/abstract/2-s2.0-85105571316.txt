In this study, the metal-assisted chemical etching of silicon with the help of metal is used to fabricate large-scale silicon nanowire arrays (SiNWs). This method was optimised by artificial neural networks (ANN) and the cuckoo optimization algorithm (COA) was used to optimize ANN. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method has been used to achieve the maximum length of silicon nanowires. As a result, the nanowires produced by the 1 M NaOH electrolyte had the properties of a capacitive cloud with a capacity of 758 mF/cm2. It has the potential to be an excellent candidate for supercapacitor applications.
