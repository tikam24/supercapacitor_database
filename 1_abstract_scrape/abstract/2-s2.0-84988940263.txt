V2O5 nanobelt-carbonized bacterial cellulose (V2O5-CBC) nanocomposite was synthesized via a hydrothermal process in a single step. The prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, and TEM. The results show that the CBC uniform covered on the surface of the V2O5 nanobelts. The specific capacitance of V2O5-CBC nanocomposite was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The results indicated that this material exhibited the capacitance of 281 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1 and 268 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1. Moreover, the capacity can retain 87 % even after 2000 cycles.
