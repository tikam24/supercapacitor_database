Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) have been gaining prominence in the research field of Electric Vehicles (EVs). The progress of Energy Management Scheme (EMS) is a decisive issue with considerable impact on the EV range and capabilities. In this paper, complementary characteristics of batteries and supercapacitors can be productively used in HESS for a PMSM driven EV application. The usage of HESS in EVs provides many merits such as better regenerative braking, improved vehicle acceleration, reduction in battery stress and improved battery safety. During regenerative braking, the PMSM functions as generator and kinetic energy of EV is utilized by the supercapacitor using proper switching pattern of the inverter. This harvested energy improves vehicle acceleration and keeps the battery from deep discharging during peak power demands where a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) provides the necessary braking force distribution. The performance of the proposed system has been analyzed through simulation using MATLAB/Simulink package for different operating conditions. In hardware, dsPIC is used to provide switching pulse control pattern. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed coupled EMS.
