The development of low-cost, high-efficiency multifunctional electrocatalysts is an ongoing concern, and it is critical for future energy-related devices. Mixed-phase NiS@SnS@Ni3Sn2S2 nanostructures are synthesized by facile microwave approach and are used as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of tri-iodide to iodide (I3−/I−) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), asymmetric supercapacitors, and overall water-splitting applications. Further, the performances have been improved by adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT). For assessing the crystalline structure, phase, size, shape, porosity, and composition, several analytical tools are employed. The electrochemical outcomes show that NiS@SnS@Ni3Sn2S2/MWCNT counter electrode assisted DSSC cell delivered the highest efficiency of 6.0 % and found to be an efficient electrode for supercapacitors, evidencing a large specific capacitance (766 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), an outstanding energy density of 85.2 W h kg−1 at an ultra-high-power density of 3600 W kg−1 and cycling stability (94 % after 10,000 cycles at 15 A g−1). Furthermore, the optimized NiS@SnS@Ni3Sn2S2/MWCNT catalyst demonstrates better oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction. The combination of different phases and shapes in the catalysts can provide a synergistic effect as well as good surface active sites along with a carrier transfer path, resulting in efficient I3− reduction, higher specific capacitance and energy density, superior cycling stability, and low over-potential, thus making NiS@SnS@Ni3Sn2S2/MWCNT hybrid as an efficient tetrafunctional electrocatalyst for energy gadgets.
