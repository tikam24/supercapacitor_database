The article discusses problem of energy flow in serial hybrid propulsion system with super-capacitor energy storage with respect to robust control and stabile behaviour of all the drive. The simulation model in MATLAB/Simulink of serial hybrid vehicle with super-capacitor is presented. Theoretical results are experimentally verified of physical model.
