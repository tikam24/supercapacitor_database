Global energy challenges, increasing environmental concern, increasing power demand have led to the wide adoption of renewable energy sources like the photovoltaic systems. Standalone operation is a difficult task due to its intermittent nature. Here comes the use of an energy storage device which acts as an energy buffer. Among the energy storage devices, batteries are often preferred. Stress on battery increases when sudden fluctuations in the load profile appears. It leads to the deep discharge of batteries which damages as well as shortens its lifetime. In order to remove the stress from the batteries, supercapacitors (SC) are incorporated to form a hybrid energy storage system. Supercapacitors respond quickly to the instantaneous power demand. Hysteresis control and fuzzy logic energy management strategy have been introduced. The overall system is developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Simulation results prove the validity of the proposed strategy.
