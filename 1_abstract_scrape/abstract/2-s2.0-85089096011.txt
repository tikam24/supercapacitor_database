The electrochemical synthesis of mesoporous ruthenium (Ru) films using sacrificial self-assembled block polymer micelles templates, and its electrochemical surface oxidation to RuOx is described. Unlike standard methods such as thermal oxidation, the electrochemical oxidation method described here retains the mesoporous structure. Ru oxide materials serve as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes due to their excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. The mesoporous architectured film shows superior specific capacitance (467 F g−1Ru) versus a nonporous Ru/RuOx electrode (28 F g−1Ru) that is prepared via the same method but omitting the pore-directing polymer. Ultrahigh surface area materials will play an essential role in increasing the capacitance of this class of energy storage devices because the pseudocapacitive redox reaction occurs on the surface of electrodes.
