A facile and green approach for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) using tobacco leaves solution was reported. The benefits of this approach were the use of green and cheap reducing agent as compared to the commercially available toxic and hazardous chemicals. Moreover, the purification of reduced GO (rGO) sheets can be avoided by using naturally occurring reducing agents. The obtained rGO sheets were characterised by Ultra violet visible, Fourier transform infrared, Raman and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy analysis. The morphologies were recorded by transmission electron and field emission scanning electron microscopy analysis and these showed the formation of a few layer rGO sheets. The electrical conductivity of rGO was found to be ∼410 S m-1 at room temperature. Electrochemical performances were characterised by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. A two electrode symmetric supercapacitor device was designed using nickel foam as current collector. The specific capacitance of the two-electrode device reached to 206 F g-1 at a current density of 0.16 A g-1. The retention in specific capacitance was found to be ∼112% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
