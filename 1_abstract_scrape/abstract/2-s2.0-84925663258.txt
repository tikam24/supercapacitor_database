In order to improve the stability of the DC-bus voltage in the permanent magnet wind power integrated system based on the solid-state transformer, the super capacitor is utilized through the bi-directional converter at the low voltage DC side. This paper models the hybrid system of the Boost circuit with the sliding mode control, and the stability of the DC voltage is improved by the quickly charge-discharge characteristics of the super capacitor. The simulations demonstrate that voltage fluctuation in the DC side and the charge-discharge voltage and current of the super capacitor become smaller under the conditions of both wind speed change and grid voltage drop. This scheme rapidly and accurately suppresses the fluctuation of the DC-bus voltage and improves the power quality and stability of the grid wind turbines.
