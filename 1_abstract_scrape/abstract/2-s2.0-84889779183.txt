Ordered one dimensional polypyrrole conducting polymer structure as a shell over TiO2 nanotube arrays at the core were formed by pulsed current electropolymerization. TiO2 nanotubes with rippled wall structure are designed by action of water in the anodizing medium. This provides open tube structure supporting short diffusion length and increased accessibility of ions involved in redox transition for energy storage. Electrochemical properties evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show specific capacitance of 34-44 mF.cm-2 and extremely low bulk and charge transfer resistances.
