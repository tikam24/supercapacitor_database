A new type of scrolled structure of Co3O4/reduced graphene oxide (r-GO) is facilely prepared through a two-step surfactant-assisted method. This assembly enables almost every single Co 3O4 scroll to connect with the r-GO platelets, thus leading to remarkable electrochemical performances in terms of high specific capacitance and good rate capability.
