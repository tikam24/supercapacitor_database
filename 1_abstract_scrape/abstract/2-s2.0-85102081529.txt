Herein, the 3D honeycomb-like carbons constructed by interconnected carbon nanosheets (3DHCs) were prepared by salt template strategy. The 3DHCs present high specific surface area, honeycomb-like structures and 3D interconnected sheet-like network. As a result, the 3DHC displays high gravimetric capacitance of 326.5F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1, excellent rate capability of 246.3F g−1 at 50 A g−1 and high energy density of 11.3 Wh kg−1 when used as electrode for supercapacitor. Impressively, the capacitance of 3DHC850-based supercapacitor only decays 0.2% after 15,000 cycles. This work offers a low-cost, environmental-friendly method for the design of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
