Supercapacitors are becoming more popular in the field of energy storage day by day. Thanks to their superior features such as fast chargeâ€“discharge, high capacities, and stable structures. Especially, supercapacitors designed using biomass as the electrode material are more preferred in this field because they are cheap, abundant, environmentally friendly, high capacity, and have a long cycle life. In this study, two supercapacitor cells were developed using freshwater algae biomass. In the first stage, supercapacitor electrodes were prepared by Co-doped Chlorella vulgaris (Chl-Co), and in the second stage, electrodes were prepared by Co-doped to H3PO4-washed Chlorella vulgaris (Chl-Co-H3PO4). 6 M KOH solution was used as the electrolyte. Electrochemical characterization results of the electrodes were obtained very close to the ideal supercapacitor characteristic. The capacitance values of the Chl-Co electrode were measured as 80 F/g for 1 A/g, but after the activation by H3PO4, the capacitance rose to 169.7 F/g for 1 A/g. The produced electrodes are promising for energy storage in terms of environmental pollution, cost, stability, and capacity.
