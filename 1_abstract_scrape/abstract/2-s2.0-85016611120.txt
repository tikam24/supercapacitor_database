Biomass materials are promising precursors for the production of carbonaceous materials due to their abundance, low cost and renewability. Here, a freestanding wrinkled carbon membrane (WCM) electrode material for flexible supercapacitors (SCs) was obtained from flower petal. The carbon membrane was fabricated by a simple thermal pyrolysis process and further activated by heating the sample in air. As a binder and current collector-free electrode, the activated wrinkled carbon membrane (AWCM) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 332.7 F/g and excellent cycling performance with 92.3% capacitance retention over 10000 cycles. Moreover, a flexible all-solid supercapacitor with AWCM electrode was fabricated and showed a maximum specific capacitance of 154 F/g and great bending stability. The development of this flower petal based carbon membrane provides a promising cost-effective and environmental benign electrode material for flexible energy storage.
