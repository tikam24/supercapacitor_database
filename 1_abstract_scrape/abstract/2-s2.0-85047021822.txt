We present an extremely stretchable micro-supercapacitor patch (reversible stretchability >282.5%, with <2% change in capacitance retention) with high areal-coverage of functional electronic components (76.2%). Our device is 2.4-9.4 times more stretchable than the state-of-the-art stretchable supercapacitors using the Accordion construct, and enjoys 4 times higher areal-coverage than the previously reported stretchable supercapacitors with the Island-Bridge construct. The Kirigami-inspired design is the key to both high stretchability and high areal-coverage. We envision our stretchable micro-supercapacitor patch (and other power-supply microdevices with a similar design) to be highly desirable in future flexible, stretchable, and wearable systems.
