This paper considers an application scenario in which Peukert's law is utilized to predict the supercapacitor discharge time during a constant current discharge process. Originally developed for lead-acid batteries, Peukert's law states that the delivered charge increases when the discharge current decreases. Recent studies reveal that Peukert's law applies to supercapacitors when the discharge current is above a certain threshold. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Peukert's law in predicting the supercapacitor discharge time, this paper examines an application scenario in which the initial voltages of the constant current discharge experiments in the testing set are different from those in the training set. Experiments are conducted using three supercapacitor samples with different rated capacitances from different manufacturers. Results show that the discharge time prediction error is reduced when the nominal charge and Peukert constant are properly estimated.
