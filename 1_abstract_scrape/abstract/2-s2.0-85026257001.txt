This paper reports the synthesis of a new hybrid core (silver nanowires (AgNWs))/shell (copper sulfide (Cu2S)) nanostructure using simple and inexpensive drop casting and successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) methods. The effects of the thickness of the Cu2S shell on the Ag NW core on the electrochemical properties of the nanocomposite were studied by varying the number of SILAR cycles from one to four. The structure and microstructure of the prepared composite nanostructure electrode materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The AgNW/Cu2S exhibited a high specific capacitance of 603 Fg−1 (stainless steel substrate) and 707 Fg−1 (Ni foam substrate) at a scan rate of 10 mVs−1 with an energy density of 10.01 Whkg−1 and 25.33 Whkg−1 at an applied current of 0.2 mA. This study provides a simple and cost-effective strategy for the fabrication of nanostructured electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
