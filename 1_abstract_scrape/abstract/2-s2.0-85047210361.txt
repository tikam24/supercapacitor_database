Electrochemical supercapacitors based on transition metal oxides nanostructures have aroused much attention for energy storage and conversion owing to their ability to intercalate ions in a wide range of sites. In this work, we have reported electrochemical properties of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) nanobelts synthesized via facile low temperature hydrothermal method and used it as an electrode material for the supercapacitor applications. The morphology and crystal structure of the MoO3 nanobelts have been characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) respectively. The BET surface area was found to be 59.285 m2 g-1. The supercapacitor performances of the nanobelts electrodes have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The MoO3 based supercapacitor shows a specific capacitance as high as 256.83 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solution. Moreover, the low series resistance (1.20 Ω) and charge transfer resistance (3.85 Ω) values at high frequency range obtained from MoO3 electrode indicate that it is a promising supercapacitor electrode material and suitable for other electrochemical applications. In addition, MoO3 supercapacitor electrode shows high electrochemical stability and can withstand over 200 cycles with no obvious change in the CV curves.
