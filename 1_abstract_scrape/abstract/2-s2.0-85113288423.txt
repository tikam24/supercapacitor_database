Biochar produced from the thermochemical conversion of biomass, provides a green and sustainable platform for the preparation of various functional carbon materials (porous carbon, heteroatom doped biochar, carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon quantum dots, etc.) towards advanced application. Their preparation involves the physical as well as chemical activation of biochar or directly from the biomass. The inherent versatile physicochemical properties of these versatile materials have been explored for the construction of the electrochemical energy storage devices like supercapacitors. In the present review, the various methodologies for the preparation of various biomass-derived carbon materials are summarized. Further utilization of these materials in supercapacitor electrodes and the properties associated with their charge storage ability, along with associated challenges and perspectives are also discussed.
