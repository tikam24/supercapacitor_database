In this work, nickel foam supported Co9S8 nanostructures are fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal process. The Co9S8 nanostructures have a hierarchical structure in which the Co9S8 nanotubes are wrapped by Co9S8 nanosheets. The Co9S8 nanostructures are in situ grown on nickel foam by the hydrothermal process and can be directly used as electrodes for supercapacitors without any further treatment. The Co9S8 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance up to 2166 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacitance retention of 74% at 20 A g−1. Furthermore, the Co9S8 electrode shows a good cycling stability with 75.8% capacitance retention after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled by using Co9S8 and porous carbon as the positive and negative electrode materials, respectively. The device displays an excellent electrochemical capability. This work demonstrates that the hierarchical Co9S8 nanostructures are desirable for application as advanced supercapacitor electrode materials.
