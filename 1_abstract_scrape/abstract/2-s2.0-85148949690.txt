In order to reduce the impact of electrified railways on the negative sequence of three-phase power grid, and consider energy-saving and economic operation of traction substations, an energy management strategy and capacity allocation scheme is proposed for the co-phase traction power supply and energy storage system in electrified railways. Firstly, with the constraint of the three-phase voltage unbalance limit, the starting threshold of the energy storage device is determined in the cases of the negative sequence exceeding standard. Then the negative-sequence compensation model of the power supply and energy storage system is established to calculate its charging and discharging current. The measured data of traction substations are used to develop the capacity allocation scheme of the energy storage device, which are then validated by the calculation. The results show that the co-phase traction power supply and energy storage system can control the charge and discharge of the energy storage device in real time to realize negative-sequence satisfaction compensation, load peak shaving and valley filling, and regenerative energy utilization. The degree of negative sequence compensation is determined by the discharge power of the energy storage device. The peak-shaving and valley-filling effect and regenerative energy utilization rate are determined by the starting threshold and the capacity of the energy storage device. When the energy storage capacity is constant, the smaller the threshold, the higher the utilization rate of regenerative braking energy.
