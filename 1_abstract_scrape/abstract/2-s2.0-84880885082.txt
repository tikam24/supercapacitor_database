The paper suggests an energy management control strategy of wayside Li-ion capacitor (LiC) based energy storage for light railway vehicles (LRV). The installation of wayside supercapacitor (SC) storage devices, as widely recognized, allows the recovery of the braking energy for increasing the system efficiency as well as a better pantograph voltage profile. A new type of SC, LiC, interfaced with dc-interleaved converter has been presented. This technology has an energy density comparable to batteries and power density much higher than the batteries. The authors propose a control strategy based on the maximum kinetic energy recovery throughout braking operations of the running vehicles. The stored energy comes back to the vehicles during the accelerations. The strategy stays on the knowledge of the state of charge of LiC device and the actual vehicle speeds. In particular, the control algorithm evaluates, in real time, the actual value of LiC voltage and current references on the basis of the vehicles inertial forces and acceleration estimations, taking into account the power losses of the system. Experimental tests made on electromechanical simulator, equipped with a 136-V, 30.5-F LiC module, fully confirm the validity of the suggested control. Finally, experimental characterization of LiC module has been achieved. Â© 2013 IEEE.
