The following paperwork presents a model of a multiphase converter for charging of energy storage elements. Modeling of the converter operation is carried out in the software environments of MATLAB Simulink and LTspice. The developed models allow model based design of the considered converters. The authenticity of the models is verified by comparison between the simulation results and results obtained from the operation of an experimental stand. Basic dependencies aiding the design process are also presented. The examined converter is based on the circuit of a resonant inverter with reverse and limitation diodes. Experimental examinations are carried out for the charging processes of a supercapacitor and a rechargeable battery. The advantages and disadvantages of these converters are pointed out.
