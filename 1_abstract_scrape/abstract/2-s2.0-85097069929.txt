Electrochemical energy devices including batteries, supercapacitors and fuel cells are reliable and practical technologies in which carbon-based electrode materials play critical roles in enhancing performance. Because of this, the source and synthesis of these carbon-based materials have been extensively explored and developed. And of the various carbon-based materials, biomass-derived carbon materials and corresponding composites have been recognized to be capable of delivering high capacities, enhanced rate performances and prolonged cycling stabilities in both lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors as partially induced through a combination of favorable pore structures and heteroatom-doping. In addition, biomass-derived carbon materials can provide significantly enhanced activity and stability for cathode oxygen reduction reactions if used as catalyst support materials in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells. Based on this, this review will provide a comprehensive assessment as well as critical analysis and systematic comparison of biomass-derived carbon materials and corresponding composites as electrode materials in various electrochemical energy devices based on recent progresses in research and development. In addition, related technical challenges are analyzed and possible research directions are proposed to further development for practical application.
