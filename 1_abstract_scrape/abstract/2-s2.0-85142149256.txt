It is extremely urgent to develop novel electrode materials with large capacity, high charge-discharge speed, and cycle stability for the particular application of supercapacitors in electric vehicles. Cobalt-based phosphate materials have attracted increasing attention due to their outstanding properties. Herein, cobalt phosphate with a braced-frame nanocube morphology consisting of amorphous nanoparticles is synthesized through a one-step ion-exchange method using Prussian Blue Analog Co3[Co(CN)6]2 nanocubes as precursors. Benefiting from the special nanostructure, this material shows a specific capacitance of up to 539.2 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, a capacitance retention of 92% even at 8 A g-1, and remarkable cycle stability characteristics, with a capacity preservation of 89.1% after 3000 charge-discharge cycles at 2 A g-1. The kinetic mechanism demonstrates that the diffusion-controlled procedure has made a great contribution to the large capacitance. This study will be helpful for the development of new electrode materials for supercapacitors.
