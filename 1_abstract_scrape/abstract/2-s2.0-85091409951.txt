For energy storage applications, graphene oxide as a unique material was EMPLOYED to significantly reduce the cost and enhance the yield of manufacturing high performance electrodes. Among the known strategies in improving the material performance as energy storage device, heteroatom functionalization proved to be efficient. Upon any boost in the capacitance of graphene oxide electrodes by the introduction of pseudocapacitive behavior, a functional hybrid system was provided due to the presence of covalent functionalized graphene oxide with boosted capacitance and redox active thiazole derivatives. An efficient nanomaterial, as the electrode for supercapacitors based on 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiol (TDDT) molecules decorated on graphene oxide nanosheets (GO), was prepared with cost effective, non-complicated and scalable method. 1,3,4-Thiadiazole-2,5-dithiol was covalently grafted onto the graphene oxide nanosheets via 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine (TCT) as cross linker (GO–TCT–TDDT). Glassy carbon modified with GO–TCT–TDDT in comparison with GO benefited from high charge storage performance for supercapacitor which was marked by a high specific capacitance of 140 F/ with superior rate capability of 55.7% if the current density increased from 0.1 to 5 A/g. Also, the evaluation of electrode stability demonstrated an approximate fixedness even after 1000 charge–discharge cycles capacitance. Also, 95% of initial capacitance at 0.5 A/g was observed.
