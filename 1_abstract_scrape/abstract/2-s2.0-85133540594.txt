Boron carbonitrides (BCN) have been widely concerned in the field of energy storage and conversion. However, the energy storage mechanism of electrical double-layer behavior and their stacked-layer structure severely limit the improvement of capacitance, thereby hindering their further development in energy storage. Therefore, an ultrasonic-ball milling method was first chosen to obtain BCN nanosheets, together with a feasible way of polyaniline (PANI) modification performed to boost the capacitive reaction of BCN nanosheets. For the first time, a BCN-PANI-based symmetric supercapacitor device can reach a high voltage window of 3.0 V when 1 M Et4N·BF4 was chosen as the electrolyte. The working voltage of 3.0 V is three times that of a device with pure PANI with the ultrahigh energy density of 67.1 W h kg−1, superior to most of the reported PANI-based devices. The eminent electrochemical performance provides a promising strategy to pave the way for configuring carbon-based multiple composite electrodes for other energy storage devices.
