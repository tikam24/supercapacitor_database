Graphene, conducting polymers and their hybrids have more superiority and potential as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Neverthless, graphene encountered challenges to guarantee adequate interactions with conducting polymers while maintaining a high level of naked surface for the permeability with electrolytes. To tackle this challenge, developing functionalized or new structured graphene hybrids and their controllable preparation novel strategy is urgent and a focus strategy. Here, SiO2/graphene/polyaniline (SGP) is fabricated through the cross-dimensional assembling of two-dimensional graphene with zero-dimensional SiO2 and polyaniline successively. SiO2 is chosen as a functional connection layer between electrodes and electrolytes, and between hydrophobic graphene and polyaniline for aqueous supercapacitors. Hydrophilic SiO2 not only enhanced the interfacial interactions and ion exchanges at the electrolyte/electrode interface, but also suppressed the stacking between graphene and polyaniline, and among graphene layers. As a result, both the electric double layer capacitance of graphene and pseudocapacitance of polyaniline are better utilized with the aid of SiO2. SGP shows a capacitance retention of 90% after 3500 cycles and improved electrochemical performances, higher than graphene/polyaniline based on both three-electrode and two-electrode cell configurations. These findings demonstrate that SiO2 embeded graphene hybrids is an effective strategy to promote the overall electrochemical properties for supercapacitors.
