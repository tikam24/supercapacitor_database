Supercapacitors have attracted worldwide attentions due to their high power density, rapid charge/discharge rates, good safety, and long cycle life compared to batteries. The electrochemical property of electrode materials is a key factor defining the performance of supercapacitors. Electrospinning technology is a simple and effective method to prepare nanofibers with large specific surface area, good electrical conductivity and excellent flexibility. Therefore, electrospun nanofibers were considerably investigated as electrode material for supercapacitors. This review summarized the research progress of electrospun carbon nanofibers, conductive polymers, transition metal compounds and their composite materials in the field of supercapacitors in recent years, and discussed the relationship between material preparation methods, structure, composition and supercapacitor performance. The prospects of electrospun carbon nanofiber-based electrode materials were discussed.
