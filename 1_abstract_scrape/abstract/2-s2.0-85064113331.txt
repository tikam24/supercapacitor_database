Hierarchical materials are preferred as promising electrodes due to their amply different-leveled pore channels. As one of the green, cost-effective and easy-to-synthesize materials, NiCo 2 O 4 has fallen in the window of interest as a supercapacitor electrode material. Nevertheless, the common morphology of it, i.e. nanosheet-like architecture, is prone to be aggregated and thus leading to blocked electrochemical active sites. Herein, a glamorous structure of nickel cobalt oxide nanosheets distributed on N-doped graphene framework (NCO/NGF) has been designed. Benefiting from its unique architecture, the hybrid material delivered a specific capacitance of 1198 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 with an admirable long-term cycling stability. In addition, an assembled NCO/NGF\\AC device delivers much higher energy density and stability than its counterpart (NCO\\AC). The alluring performance of this composite verifies its broad application prospects as a supercapacitor electrode material.
