Australian travellers are purchasing electric bicycles for their daily commute. However, statistics show that riders are seeking to use their bicycle for longer commutes but are held back by the limited battery life. This paper explores an effective design to apply and control a regenerative braking system to an electric bicycle to significantly increase its travel distance and battery life. In this paper, an important foundation is laid for developing a high-performance regenerative braking system which could be added to any commonly available electric bicycle conversion kit.
