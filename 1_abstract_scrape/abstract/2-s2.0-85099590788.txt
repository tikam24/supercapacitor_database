High frequency supercapacitors (HFSCs) are promising in alternating current line filtering and adaptable storage of high-frequency pulse electrical energy. Herein, we report a facile yet integrated-circuit-compatible fabrication of HFSC electrodes by combining chemical roughening of the sputtered metal (Au) films and in situ trace loading of a pseudocapacitive material (MnOx ). The developed electrode fabrication route is versatile for different substrates, and is described with the application paradigms of both on-chip (with Si/SiO2 substrate) and off-chip (without Si/SiO2 sub-strate, with Ti substrate as an example in this study) HFSCs. With Au/MnOx films on Si/SiO2 substrates as the working electrodes, the derived on-chip HFSC displayed satisfactory performance in high frequency applications (i.e., an areal capacitance of 131.7 µF cm−2, a phase angle of −78◦, and a RC time constant of 0.27 ms, at 120 Hz).
