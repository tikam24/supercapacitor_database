A simple one-step solvothermal approach has been adopted for the synthesis of SnS2. SEM shows hierarchically SnS2 with petal-like 3-dimensional layer structures because of this process. In this investigation, the as-prepared electrode material have an excellent specific capacitance of 721F g−1 at 1 mVs−1, indicating extraordinary performance. The improved electrochemical performance is because to unique ultrathin petal discrete structure, which provides increased electrolyte/electrode interface, high active sites, rapid ion/electron transfer, and short diffusion distances. A manufactured symmetric solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) device also has a large capacity to operate commercial LEDs, which allows for the assessment of its practical applicability in device-level application. According to the findings of this work, suitably layered 3D SnS2 electrode materials could be a promising route for the development of environmentally friendly energy storage applications.
