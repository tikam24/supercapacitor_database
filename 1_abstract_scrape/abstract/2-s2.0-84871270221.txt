Large surface area nanostructural IrOx films were deposited on stainless steel substrates by reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering using Ir metal target. The structural and spectroscopic properties of the nanostructural IrOx were characterized. The micrographs of field emission scanning electron microscopy showed the formation of folded leaves with chiffon-like structure for the as-deposited samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis provided the information of the oxidation states and the stoichiometry of IrOxNL. Raman spectra revealed the amorphous-like phase of the as-deposited nanostructural IrOx. The chiffon-like structure provides ultra-high surface area for electrical charge storage which makes the IrOxNL as an attractive candidate for the supercapacitor application.
