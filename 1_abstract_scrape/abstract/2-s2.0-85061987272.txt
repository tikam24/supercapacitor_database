A novel and unique MoS 2 nanosheets-coated Bi 2 S 3 nanorods composite was successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The crystal structure and morphology of MoS 2 /Bi 2 S 3 nanocomposite were confirmed by X-ray diffraction photoelectron spectroscopy, laser Raman mapping, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. Bi 2 S 3 nanorods are uniform with an average length of about 200 nm, and MoS 2 nanosheets are closely attached to Bi 2 S 3 nanorods. The electrochemical performance of MoS 2 /Bi 2 S 3 nanocomposite was characterized by a conventional three-electrode test in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. The as-prepared MoS 2 /Bi 2 S 3 electrode exhibits rapid electron transfer, long-time cycle stability, high specific capacitance of about 120.2 F g −1 (at a current density of 1 A g −1 ) and long-term cycling stability with nearly 87.7% capacity retention after 2000 cycles. The improved electrochemical performance should be attributed to the synergistic effect of Bi 2 S 3 nanorods and MoS 2 nanosheets. The MoS 2 /Bi 2 S 3 nanocomposite with excellent electrochemical performance will have promising application in supercapacitor electrode materials.
