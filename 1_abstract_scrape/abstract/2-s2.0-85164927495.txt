In this study, a cobalt oxide (Co3O4) supercapacitor electrode is prepared using ultrafast annealing to enhance its supercapacitive performance. The Co3O4 active materials, synthesized through hydrothermal synthesis, are heat-treated using a conventional muffle furnace (constant heat annealing (CHA)) and ultrafast intensive pulsed light (IPL) flash annealing (instant heat annealing (IHA)). Structural and morphological analysis reveals that CHA Co3O4 has a nano-rope structure with micro-sheets. In contrast, IHA Co3O4 exhibits a coral reef-like morphology with a high surface area and a melted ice-like structure. Despite this change in morphology, the crystal structure of the Co3O4 remains unchanged after ultrafast IPL treatment. The resulting electrochemical properties show that the pseudocapacitive nature of IHA Co3O4 leads to a twofold increase in areal capacitance (955.73 mF/cm2) compared to CHA Co3O4, as well as excellent cyclic stability (90.81% in average over 10,000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles). The mechanisms behind the improved performance of IHA Co3O4, which include the unique coral reef morphology, are thought to increase the facile intercalation of ions and reduce the diffusion path for faster charge transfer reactions. Assembled hybrid asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) show a specific capacitance of 128.13 F/g at 3 mA/cm2 with 98.67% excellent retention capability of its initial capacitance over the 5000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles. This study presents a simple, low-cost, and ultrafast approach for fabricating high-performance and stable electrode materials for energy storage applications.
