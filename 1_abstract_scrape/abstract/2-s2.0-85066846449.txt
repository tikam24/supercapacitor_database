One dimensional orderly polyaniline(PANI) nanowires array were prepared on conducting substrate by using a galvanostatic current method. The effects of preparation factors, including concentration of aniline(0.01-0.3 mol/L), working current density(0.01-0.13 mA/cm2) and kinds of protonic acid(1 mol/L H2SO4, HCl, HNO3 and p-TSA), on the morphology of the as-prepared PANI nanowires were investigated. It was found that the best morphology of PANI nanowires array could be obtained when the concentration of aniline was 0.1 mol/L and the working current density was 0.03 mA/cm2. Also, the PANI with uniform nanowires array structure could not be formed when HCl, HNO3 and p-TSA acted as supporting liquid. The as-prepared PANI nanowire arrays had narrow diameters and were oriented perpendicularly to the FTO, which was beneficial to the ion diffusion when being used as the supercapacitor electrode. The highest specific capacitance of PANI nanowire arrays was measured as 560 F/g at a charge-discharge current density of 1 A/g, and the PANI nanowire arrays also exhibited good capability and cycling stability with capacitance retentions of 89% after 1000 cycles, which is superior or close to some individual PANI nanostructures and PANI composite materials.
