This review focuses on an inimitable multilayer fullerene material commonly referred as carbon nano onion (CNO). Among carbon nanomaterials, CNO is the least studied form. CNO has unique 0-D structure, small diameter of <10 nm, high electrical conductivity, fine dispersibility, and other superior structural and physical features. Different preparation and functionalization routes have been used for this unique nanocarbon structure. The article summarizes essential available categories of polymer/CNO composite such as polyaniline/CNO, polypyrrole/CNO, polythiophene/CNO, poly(Îµ-caprolactone)/CNO, polystyrene/ CNO, poly(diallyldimethyl-ammonium chloride)/CNO, and polyenediyne/CNO. Moreover, significant technical application of CNO-based materials has been discussed in supercapacitor, solar cell, Li-ion battery, dielectric, and biomedical materials.
