Flexible and wearable electronic devices are finding applications in products for sports and healthcare, military technology, as well as safety and construction supplies [1-2]. Some notable examples include the Nike Fit, Adidas MiCoach, and UnderArmour heart monitor. These devices still use conventional pouch cell or hard batteries and electrochemical capacitors. Our previous work focused on screen printing [3-4] carbon materials into cotton, polyester and carbon fiber textiles. However, those designs suffered from some delamination of carbon from the fiber surface during use. In this work we describe a knitted, all-solid supercapacitor based on carbon materials (e.g., activated carbon and graphene), which have been embedded into natural cellulose based yarns.
