In the present work, we report a new activating agent (NaCl:KCl) (1:1) for the synthesis of nanoporous carbon from Java Kapok tree shell (1:1) with different controlled temperature under inert atmosphere. Additionally, surface morphology, physico-chemical and electrochemical properties of the nanoporous carbon are characterized. The obtained Kapok shell derived nanoporous carbon possessed a large surface area of 1260 m2 g−1, pore volume of 0.439 cm3 g−1, pore size of 1.241 nm, and microspore volume of 0.314 cm3 g−1. The nanoporous carbon-based electrode material exhibited higher capacitance of 169 F g−1 with 97% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 A g−1. We believe that this new activation agent can be significant contribution in the new carbon technology for energy storage materials.
