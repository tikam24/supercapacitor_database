Electrochemical energy storage: The performance of MnO2 as a pseudo-capacitive material was enhanced by doping electrodeposited MnO 2 with physically deposited gold atoms (see picture). The resulting MnO2 electrodes showed an enhanced electronic conductivity and a remarkable stability under voltammetric cycling. Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
