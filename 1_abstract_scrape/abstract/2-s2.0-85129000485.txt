Transition metal carbide or nitride (MXenes), as a novel family of two-dimensional materials, exhibit huge potential for electrochemical energy storage thanks to their excellent electrical conductivity, fast ion diffusion rate, high electrochemical activity and good hydrophilicity. However, the electrochemical properties of MXenes tend to be deteriorated due to the self-restacking phenomenon. Herein, by self-assembly, a unique three-dimensional (3D) Ti3C2Tx-PANI@CNTs (TPCs) nanoarchitecture was constructed. Through optimizing structures, the surface capacitance of TPCs can be tailored to tune energy storage. The optimal specific capacitance up to 431.9 F/g was achieved under 1 A/g. Further, the TPCs nanoarchitectures were prepared into self-standing films with excellent mechanical properties and micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) in various shapes were manufactured based on the film. The MSCs demonstrate competitive energy storage capacities, obtaining an areal capacitance of 78.2 mF/cm2 and energy density of up to 2.72 Î¼Wh/cm2, still maintain excellent performance under harsh bending. The strategy for constructing 3D nanoarchitectures and further manufacturing MSCs can inspire the design of novel electrode materials and devices to advance the development in the field of energy storage.
