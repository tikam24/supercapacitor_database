Hierarchical micro-/nano-structures assembled by two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials are promising electrode materials for energy storage devices, owing to their unique structures and synergetic effects. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are versatile templates for various hierarchically structured nanomaterials with high-performance in energy storage applications. However, it is still a great challenge to achieve precise control of the structure and composition of MOF-derived nanomaterials, especially for those composites with two or more components. In this work, a facile strategy for the preparation of MOF-derived 2D assembled Ni-Mn-C ternary composites, which are composed of Ni(OH)2 and MnO2 nanosheets decorated on a carbon matrix (Ni(OH)2-MnO2/C), is developed. Due to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity and the synergistic effect among components, the Ni(OH)2-MnO2/C composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, especially high-rate performance (574.0 F g-1 at 40 A g-1) and cycling stability (capacitance retention of âˆ¼87% at 2 A g-1 over 10000 cycles). In addition, the Ni(OH)2-MnO2/C composite-based all-solid-state supercapacitor delivers high power density, good cycling stability and excellent flexibility.
