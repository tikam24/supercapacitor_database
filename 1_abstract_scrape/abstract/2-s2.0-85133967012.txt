A facile resilient bismuthine-anchored graphene architecture is reported as multifunctional all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors and ionic-type capacitive sensor. Meanwhile, an electrons/ions dual transport channels design is achieved by inserting elaborately conductive bismuthene flakes into hierarchical porous aerogel framework. This strategy concurrently realizes the expansion of interlayer space for favoring electrolyte infiltration, and boost of interlayer conductivity to ensure interlayer electrons transport, endowing the device with attractive electrochemical energy storage and pressure sensing performance. As a result, the fabricated flexible symmetric supercapacitor device using bismuthene-graphene architecture as both negative and positive electrode delivers an excellent energy density of 45.55 Wh/kg at 400 W/kg along with cycling stability of 89.24% even after 3600 charge/discharge cycles. The bismuthene-graphene aerogel-based capacitive sensor with the hierarchical porous architecture demonstrates a high sensitivity of 0.326 kPaâˆ’1. Furthermore, the sensing mechanisms of ionic-type pressure sensor is explored. This work clearly demonstrates that the novel 3D hierarchical bismuthene-graphene architecture can be widely used in multifunctional devices of supercapacitors and tactile sensors.
