Activated mesophase pitch-based foam carbons (AMPFCs) were prepared by foaming method and KOH activation with mesophase pitch as a precursor, and used as electrode materials for supercapacitor. Morphology and microstructure of AMPFCs were investigated by scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K. The results show that AMPFC has high specific surface area of 2700 m 2/g and high total pore volume value of 1.487 cm 3/g. The electrochemical properties of AMPFCs as electrode materials for supercapacitor were investigated by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. the specific capacitance of the AMPFC electrode could be as high as 240.48 F/g under a specific current of 0.02 A/g by constant current charge/discharge technique, and the energy density of the AMPFC electrode was 33.4 Wh/kg; The specific capacitance of the AMPFC electrode was 166.68 F/g under a specific current of 5 A/g, indicating that AMPFC as electrode material for supercapacitor presents good electrochemical characteristics.
