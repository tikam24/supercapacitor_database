In this work, we developed lab waste tissue paper derived activated carbon and bare Mn2P2O7/NF and polypyrrole (PPy) incorporated Mn2P2O7/NF@PPy materials by using hydrothermal and chemical polymerization methods. The phase confirmation, structural morphology, surface area information and chemical compositions of prepared materials were characterized by using XRD, FESEM, BET and XPS analysis. In electrochemical results of activated carbon, Mn2P2O7/NF and Mn2P2O7/NF@PPy electrodes capacitive and diffusive behaviours are discussed in this article. In effect of polypyrrole incorporated Mn2P2O7/NF@PPy electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 658 Fg−1 at a current density of 1 Ag−1 compared with a bare electrode. The fabricated asymmetric device by using activated carbon as anode and Mn2P2O7/NF@PPy material as cathode material and delivers a high energy density of 27.4 Whkg−1 compared with recent developed activated carbon and polypyrrole based devices.
