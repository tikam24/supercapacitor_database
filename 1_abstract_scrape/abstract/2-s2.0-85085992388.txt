Supercapacitors are attractive due to their high power density and durability relative to batteries. Printing technology has been rapidly emerging as manufacturing friendly, with a quick turn around and low-cost approach to produce a variety of devices. Herein, we show an end-to-end printing of supercapacitors including the substrate, current collector and active layers, and a gel polymer electrolyte, all simply printed. Two types of supercapacitors, electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor (PC), were developed with activated carbon and graphene-Mn3O4 nanocomposite-based active layers, respectively. The all-printed supercapacitors show specific power and specific energy of 800.3 W/kg and 1.17 Wh/kg (at 0.5 A/g) for the EDLC and 1601 W/kg and 10.6 Wh/kg (at 1 A/g) for the PC. Extended durability tests reveal that the EDLC exhibits negligible performance deviation after 100â»000 charge/discharge cycles while the PC shows less than 10% capacitance degradation after 25â»000 cycles.
