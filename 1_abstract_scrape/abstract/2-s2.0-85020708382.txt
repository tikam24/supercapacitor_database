Vanadyl hydroxide (VOOH) may bear scientific importance and novel chemical and physical properties but they are uncommonly reported comparing with vanadium oxides. In the present study, lepidocrocite VOOH hollow spheres with low crystallinity were synthesized through a template-free hydrothermal route. Diameter of VOOH hollow spheres ranged from 300 nm to 500 nm, and VOOH shell thickness reached 20 nm on average. Electrochemical properties of VOOH hollow spheres as supercapacitor electrodes in aqueous electrolyte were developed and studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). Results revealed that VOOH hollow spheres featured capacitive behavior based on pseudocapacitance. Specific capacitance of 102 F·g−1 at current density of 0.2 A·g−1 was achieved. At current densities of 0.5, 1, 2.5 and 10 A·g−1, specific capacitances measured 87, 68, 56 and 29 F·g−1, respectively. Findings in present study proved that VOOH hollow spheres could be promising candidate as ideal material for supercapacitor electrodes.
