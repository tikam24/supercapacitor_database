A three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure comprised of ternary rGO/CNTs/MnO2 nanocomposites was successfully developed and prepared for high-rate supercapacitors. The optimized nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance (SC) of 319 F g-1 with enhanced rate capability (222 F g-1 even at 60 A g-1) and cycling stability (85.4% retention of original capacity after cycling for 3000 times) in a 1 M Na 2SO4 aqueous solution. Such outstanding capacitive behaviors are mainly attributed to smart nanostructures, which possess several advantages as supercapacitor electrodes, such as easy access pseudoactive species with high utilization and fast ion/electron transfer and also a strong interaction between the 3D rGO/CNTs carbon matrix and pseudoactive MnO 2 nanoflakes. It is concluded that the present 3D rGO/CNTs/MnO 2 nanocomposites can serve as promising electrode materials for advanced supercapacitors. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
