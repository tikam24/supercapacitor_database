Synthesis and applications of novel nanomaterials in energy storage are of great importance. In this study, nanoparticles of zinc substituted manganese ferrite (Zn 0.5 Mn 0.5 Fe 2 O 4 ) were synthesized by a simple coprecipitation method. The synthesized nanoparticles were then characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The nanoparticles had a spherical morphology with a diameter of ~ 30 nm. The nanoparticles were electrochemically evaluated as a supercapacitor electrode material by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and charge/discharge cycling. The nanoparticles represented both double layer and pseudocapacitive behaviors with a specific capacitance of 77.9 F g − 1 at a charge/discharge current of 1.0 A g − 1 . The specific energy and power of the nanoparticles were 13.2 Wh g − 1 and 563 W g − 1 , respectively. The nanoparticles retained more than 87% of the initial capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles.
