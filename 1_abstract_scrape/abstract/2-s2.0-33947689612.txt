The proposed energy storage on board of a Railway vehicle leads to a big step in the reduction of consumed energy. Up to 30% energy saving are measured in a prototype light rail vehicle, at the same time reducing the peak power demand drastically. Additionally, operation without catenary for several hundred meters was successfully demonstrated with the prototype light rail vehicle driving with switched off pantograph. This prototype vehicle is in passenger operation since September 2003, the implemented software is optimized on energy savings. About two years experience is available and the results are convincing. Applying the energy storage to Diesel-Electrical Multiple Units leads to fuel savings and provides a "booster" effect on the acceleration performance. The stored energy is adding additional power on top of the diesel engine power during acceleration. Compared to original Diesel power, this additional power can be provided with a relatively low additional weight. Finally, the energy savings of up to 30% and the corresponding emission reduction will already fulfill the targets of various local and global energy saving programs set up by e.g. European Union and big railway operators.
