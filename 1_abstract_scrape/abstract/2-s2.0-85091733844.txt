Nonmetal mesoporous carbon exhibits environment friendliness and low cost, which attract much attention in energy storage and conversion. In this work, a N, P-doped mesoporous carbon (NPMC-T) was synthesized by the SiO2 hard template. The mesoporous structure and high N, P content for NPMC-T are beneficial to expose more active sites and accelerate electron transfer, and contribute to exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity for supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction application. NPMC-800 is applied as electrode material for supercapacitors and exhibits high specific capacitance (219 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). Meanwhile, the NPMC-T is used as electrocatalyst for HER and shows the good electrocatalytic performance with small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1, low overpotential of 298 mV (10 mA cm−2) than that of most other reported analogous catalysts, and excellent stability (after 2000 cycles). This effective capability of N, P-doped multifunctional mesoporous carbon materials is expected to promote the application in supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction widely. Graphic abstract: A multifunctional non-metal mesoporous carbon electrocatalysis catalyst NPMC-800 was synthesized by the SiO2 hard template method (BET surface area is 593.1 m2g−1). The mesoporous structure and N, P doping of NPMC-800 exhibited the high specific capacitance of 219 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 for supercapacitors, meanwhile, offered glorious electrocatalytic performance for HER with a low overpotential of 298 mV at 10 mA cm-2 , a small Tafel slope 52 mV dec−1 and the surpassing stability after 2000 cycles under acidic conditions.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].
