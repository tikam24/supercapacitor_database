In order to reduce the complexity and shorten the solution time of the tram supercapacitor electrothermal coupling model when solving the heat conduction problem, according to the relationship between charge and discharge current and supercapacitor heat generation, a simplified method based on Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for tram supercapacitor electrochemical–thermal coupling model was proposed. Firstly, aiming at the tram operating parameters, the supercapacitor electrochemical–thermal coupling model was constructed based on the high temperature and high current operating conditions. Secondly, in order to solve the high complexity of the multiphysics finite element software calculating the heat conduction problem, by correlating COMSOL and MATLAB, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was used to solve the inverse heat conduction problem, and the electrochemical–thermal coupling model was simplified and simulated to verify its effectiveness. The results showed that under the same condition, the simplified model can predigest the electrochemical–thermal multiphysics heat conduction problem to a single physics problem, and the calculation result error was less than 0.65% and the solution speed increased 97.5%.
