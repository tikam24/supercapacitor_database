A new Ni metal organic framework based on 2,2′-Biphenyldicarboxylic, 4,4′-bipyridine as linker is prepared by hydrothermal reaction and directly used as an electrode material for su-percapacitor and the detection of sarcosine. [Ni3(BIPY)3(BPDA)2(HCOO)2(H2O)2]n (Ni-1; BIPY = 4,4′-bipyridine; BPDA = 2,2′-Biphenyldicarboxylate) displays the specific capacitance of the Ni-1 are 667 F/gat 1 A/g and retention is 82% of initial capacitance at 1 A/g. The excellent electrochemical property is ascribed to the intrinsic nature of Ni-1. Furthermore, the sarcosine sensing performance of the Ni-1 electrode is evaluated in 0.1 M of NaOH solution and the electrode showed a wider range of linear response 1 × 10−4M to 1 × 10−3 M. Thus, the results show that the Ni-1 is a potential candidate for not only sensing of sarcosine but also supercapacitor application.
