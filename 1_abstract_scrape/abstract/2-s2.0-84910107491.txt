Three-dimensional ultrathin graphitic foams are grown via chemical vapor deposition on templated Ni scaffolds, which are electrodeposited on a close-packed array of polystyrene microspheres. After removal of the Ni, free-standing foams composed of conjoined hollow ultrathin graphite spheres are obtained. Control over the pore size and foam thickness is demonstrated. The graphitic foam is tested as a supercapacitor electrode, exhibiting electrochemical double-layer capacitance values that compare well to those obtained with the state-of-the-art 3D graphene materials.
