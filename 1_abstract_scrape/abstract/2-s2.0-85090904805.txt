With the continuous development of today's flexible electronic products, fiber-shaped supercapacitors (fiber-shaped supercapacitors, FSCs) have attracted continuous attention. That's due to their advantages such as light weight, controllable volume, good bending and tensile properties, and weavable. Fiber-shaped supercapacitors, with their unique one-dimensional fiber structure, can be combined with various other electrical or power generation devices into multifunctional integrated fiber-shaped electronic devices, which have huge application prospects in the field of wearable electronic textiles. This article describes the latest developments in fiber-shaped supercapacitor devices. Firstly, different fiber substrates are introduced and their advantages and disadvantages are analyzed as well. It also summarizes the electrode materials such as carbon materials, metal oxides and sulfides, conductive polymers, and hybrid nanocomposites of fiber-shaped supercapacitors. By analyzing the differences and characteristics of different electrode materials, it is shown that different electrode materials are suitable for different uses in fiber-shaped supercapacitors. Then we also summarize the application of fiber-shaped supercapacitors in cooperation with other devices to form integrated devices, including integration with general power devices, sensors, other photoelectric conversion devices and other power generation devices into hybrid devices and applied to practice. Finally, by summarizing the recent development results of fiber-shaped supercapacitors and the current challenges in the field, some current bottlenecks and problems of fiber-shaped supercapacitors are proposed, and some suggestions and ideas for the future development direction are put forward.
