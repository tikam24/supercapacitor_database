Sustainable, cost-effective, and clean energy storage systems are key ingredients to meet the growing global energy demand and over-reliance on fossil fuels. Most of the existing supercapacitor materials used to store energy are limited either by possessing low energy density or electrolyte leakage. This may be rectified by the design of high-performance electrode materials that can balance energy density and power delivery while maintaining superb storage performance. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising electrode materials for energy storage applications because they possess regular patterns of well-ordered pores that can store energy by creating redox sites that enhance faster iondiffusion. However, the major bottlenecks for using pristine MOFs as electrode materials for supercapacitors include poor cycle stability and low electrical conductivity. This can be remediated by the design of MOF composites that possess excellent electrical conductivity and good cycle stability. Thus, this chapter focuses on the recent advances in improving the electrochemical energy storage applications of MOFs by exploiting the combined benefits of the components constituting composites of transition metal-based compounds. Specifically, attention was paid to the smart design of composite electrode materials from MOFs containing zinc and nickel-based electrodes and their electrochemical performance. Additionally, the main obstacles of using transition metal-based MOFs as SCs, and critical steps to further improve their applications are highlighted. We hope that this chapter will provide insights into the rational design of high performing electrode materials using Zn and Ni-MOF-based electrodes for enhanced electrochemical energy storage applications.
