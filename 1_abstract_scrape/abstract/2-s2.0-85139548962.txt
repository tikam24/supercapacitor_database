Metal sulfide-based electrodes played a vital in energy storage applications due to novel characteristics, i.e., facile synthesis, relatively higher electronic conductivity and fast switching between redox states. This study presents the synthesis of chromium sulfide and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based electrodes in parallel to structural, morphological and electrochemical characterizations performed for supercapacitor applications. Individual chromium sulfide and reduced graphene oxide reveal the pseudocapacitive behavior in cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves with the maximum specific capacitance of 522.84 and 3.77 F/g, respectively, at the scan rate of 5 mV/s. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements showed that Individual chromium sulfide exhibited a good specific capacitance of 710.90 F/g and energy density of 24.68 Wh/Kg at the applied current density of 3 mA/cm2, while the power density of 1028.81 W/Kg at 6 mA/cm2. CV curves of the asymmetric system consisting of chromium sulfide with reduced graphene oxide also revealed the pseudocapacitive behavior. The specific capacitance through CV curves has been found as 24.53 F/g at 10 mV/s, while a specific capacitance from GCD profile has been measured as 26.41 F/g at a current density of 4 μA/cm2. Moreover, the power density of the asymmetric system has been found as 780.35 W/Kg and indicated a suitable electrode structure for supercapacitor applications. This study is a first attempt to present the development of asymmetric cell of rGO and chromium sulfide-based electrodes which is highly feasible for high power density in parallel to reasonable energy density as per the demand of modern energy storage devices.
