A complex fractional order transfer function of the voltage divider on the basis of the supercapacitor has been approximated by a particle swarm optimization method using a number of simple fractional order transfer functions proposed, and such approximation accuracy has been estimated through comparison of transition and frequency characteristics. The advantages of approximating a complex transfer function of the voltage divider based on the supercapacitor using the fractional order transfer functions have been shown. A comparative analysis of the results obtained for the different transfer functions has enabled drawing the conclusion about high degree of their coincidence and the possibility of their application for further studies.
