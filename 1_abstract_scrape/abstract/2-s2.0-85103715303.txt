Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) have a regular porous structure and high porosity, which make them ideal electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, their capacitance performance is greatly limited by their poor conductivity. In this study, a multi-component hierarchical structure was obtained by growing NiCoFeLDH on the surface of ZIF-67, which increased the electron transfer between the MOF particles and greatly improved the capacitance of ZIF-67. The formation mechanism of the multi-component layered hollow structure indicated that the hydrolysis acidity of metal ions and the coordination ability with ligands were the key factors for forming nanosheets and hollow structures. By controlling the type and valence state of the doped metals and the reaction time, the morphology transformation of MOF composites can be effectively controlled. Electrochemical studies showed that the specific capacitance of hollow NiCoFeLDH@ZIF-67 composite is 1202.08 F/g (0.5 A/g). In addition, aqueous devices were assembled and carefully tested. This scheme is crucial for the design of MOF-based materials used in supercapacitor devices and serves as a guide for the design of MOF-based composites.
