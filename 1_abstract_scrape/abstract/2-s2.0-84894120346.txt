We have developed a supercapacitor electrode composed of CuS microspheres with polypyrrole (PPy) uniformly inserted into the sheet-like subunit structure and coated onto the CuS surface to enhance the pseudocapacitive performance. Novel sphere-like CuS particles with intertwined sheet-like subunit structure are fabricated by a solvothermal approach without any surfactant or template. A CuS@PPy composite electrode is prepared by in situ oxidation polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of the CuS suspension. The CuS@PPy composite (CuS content is 16.7 wt%) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 427 F g -1 (at 1 A g-1) and its capacitance can still retain 88% after 1000 cycles.
