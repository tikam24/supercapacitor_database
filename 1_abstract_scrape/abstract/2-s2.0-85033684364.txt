The selection of electrode materials and the optimization of electrode configurations are two effective approaches to achieve high-performance energy storage. As a representative ternary metal oxide, CoMoO4 has been directly grown on the carbon cloth via a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent calcination, forming a binder-free electrode. Further measurements reveal that this electrode is composed of CoMoO4 nanosheets assembled 3D-framworks (NAFs) and thereby shows a superb electrochemical property in KOH solution. It is worth mentioning that the specific capacitance reaches as high as 1234 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, which exceeds most of CoMoO4 and CoMoO4-based composites reported so far. Meanwhile, when the current density increases to 10 A/g, a considerable specific capacitance of 446 F/g is still obtained and can maintain nearly unchanged after 5000 cycles.
