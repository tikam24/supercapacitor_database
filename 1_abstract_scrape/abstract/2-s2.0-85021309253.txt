This paper presents energy management strategy for electric vehicle (EV) applications. The proposed method is used to share the requested energy of the EV between the ultracapacitors (UCs) and lithium-batteries. The traction motor is a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM) controlled by a Voltage-Source-Inverter (VSI) and fed by the UCs and the batteries. The energy storage system (ESS) is connected to DC-bus through two DC-DC converters. The aim of this paper is focused on requested EV power sharing between UCs pack and the batteries pack according to the dynamic response of these sources using anti-windup PI controller. This study is based on a real example of EV, in addition only the traction mode is considered. The performances of the proposed method are evaluated through some simulations using MATALB/Simulink software.
