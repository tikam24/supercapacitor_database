A hydrothermal technique was used to make tin oxide (SnO2) hetero-atom doped porous carbon (HPC) composite electrode material for an asymmetric supercapacitor and N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) acetamide (4-HPA) sensor. As regards the electrochemical capacitor, the SnO2 @HPC composite exhibited a capacity of 268 C g−1 in an aqueous electrolyte (1.0 M H2SO4) at a current density of 2.0 A g−1 in a three-electrode setup. Over 5,000 consecutive cycles at 6.0 A g−1, the electrode maintained 92.3% of its original capacity, suggesting good cyclic stability. In addition, we constructed a 10 V asymmetric supercapacitor (SnO2 @HPC (10%)/AC) and used it to operate light emitting diodes for 10 min and run a computer central processing unit fan for 40 s after being charged for 68 s at 10 V. The SnO2 @HPC composite electrode detected (4-HPA) linearly from 0.5 to 1000 µM with a LOD of 0.005 µM and exhibited significant stability, reproducibility, and selectivity for (4-HPA). Thus, the synthesized electrode material demonstrated outstanding capacity and excellent sensing for (4-HPA).
