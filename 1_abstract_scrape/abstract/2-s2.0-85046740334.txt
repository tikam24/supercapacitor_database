Transition metal oxides/sulfides as novel electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors have gained much attention, but an effective fabrication method has become a bottleneck in advancing large-scale synthesis. Herein, hierarchical nickel cobalt oxides (NiCoxOy) and flaky nickel cobalt sulÔ¨Ådes (NiCoxSy) have been successfully synthesized by a time-consuming chemical bath deposition method. Owing to the hierarchical architecture and high specific surface area (128.1 m2/g), the NiCoxOy displays a specific capacitance of 507.3 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g and excellent long-term cycling stability. Meanwhile, benefiting from the flaky mesoporous structure and high conductivity, the as-fabricated NiCoxSy can deliver high specific capacitance (1196.1 F/g at 1 A/g), acceptable cycling stability, and superior rate performance (61.7% retention from 1 to 20 A/g). All these results reveal that chemical bath deposition method is a promising route for the large-scale preparation of supercapacitors electrode materials.
