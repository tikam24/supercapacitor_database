Here, we report a novel type of nitrogen-doped porous interconnected carbon nanosheets derived from an easily gained and green plant-waste (pomelo mesocarps) by simultaneous activation, carbonization and nitrogen-doped processes using CaCl2 as activating agent and urea as nitrogen source. The nitrogen-doped pomelo mesocarps-based nanosheet carbon (N-PMNC) displays an interconnected sheet-like morphology, a high specific surface area (974.6 m2 g-1), a porous architecture and a high nitrogen doping content (9.12 wt%). The N-PMNC based supercapacitor exhibited superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of 245 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and excellent rate capability (72% capacitance retention ratio even at 20 A g-1) in 2 mol L-1 KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, N-PMNC based symmetric supercapacitor possesses high specific energy of 14.7 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 90 W kg-1 operated in the wide voltage range of 1.8 V in aqueous neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte, and shows outstanding cyclic stability.
