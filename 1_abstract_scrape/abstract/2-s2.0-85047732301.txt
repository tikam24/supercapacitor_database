We report the facile preparation of nitrogen-doped mesoporous hollow carbon nanospheres (N-MHCNS) by directly carbonizing hollow polypyrrole nanospheres that are derived from in situ polymerization. Here, we use a novel soft template (PMMA-PBMA-PMAA) as the core. At 700 °C, the obtained N-MHCNSs (denoted N-MHCNS700) show superior electrochemical performance. In 1 M HCl electrolyte, N-MHCNS700 exhibits a capacitance as high as 275.5 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a high rate capability, retaining 54.4 % of the initial capacitance at the current density of 20 A g−1. In addition, the specific capacitance of N-MHCNS700 is approximately 100 % retained at a current density of 10 A g−1 after 5000 cycles, indicating amazing stable cycling performance. The excellent electrochemical performance can be derived from the amorphous graphitic carbon, hollow nanosphere structure, mesoporous properties, and nitrogen doping effect.
