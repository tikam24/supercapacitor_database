Pseudocapacitive asymmetric supercapacitors are promising candidates for achieving high energy density in flexible energy storage devices. However, seeking suitable positive electrode materials that are compatible with negative electrode materials remains a considerable challenge. In the current study, a pseudocapacitive Ti3C2Tx MXene used as negative electrodes is rationally compatible with redox-type V2O5 as positive electrodes, resulting in the assembly of an all-pseudocapacitive Ti3C2Tx MXene//V2O5 asymmetric flexible energy storage device. The solid-state asymmetric device can deliver an energy density of 8.33 mW h cm-3 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1. Moreover, it can operate in an expanded voltage window of 1.5 V, with dominant surface-capacitive charge-storage mechanisms. Additionally, the device can power a yellow light-emitting diode for up to 7 s, indicating the potential of the device for use in practical applications. This study demonstrates the possibility of using other two-dimensional transition-metal carbide nanosheets for high-energy density flexible energy storage devices.
