Despite appealing supercapacitive properties, the acidic aqueous supercapacitors (SCs) are still suffering from low operating voltage (<1 V) leading to unsatisfactory energy densities. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that the oxygen defect modulated Ti2Nb10O29− x (TNOx) on interlinked graphene array (denoted as TNOxG) can achieve a wide potential window up to 1.8 V in 1 m H2SO4 electrolyte and deliver an extremely high capacitance up to 368.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Accompanying the improved charge transfer efficiency and preferable H ion diffusion, the oxygen defects in TNOxG are capable of stimulating more pseudocapacitive behavior and simultaneously suppressing oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, a 1.4 V high voltage quasi-solid-state TNOxG-based symmetric supercapacitor is demonstrated, yielding a maximum energy density of 0.58 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 0.57 W cm−3 and exceptionally excellent cycling durability. It is believed that this strategy of oxygen defect modulation to optimize reaction kinetics will lead to further improvements in the performance of high-voltage aqueous SCs.
