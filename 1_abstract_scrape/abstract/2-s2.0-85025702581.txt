The provoking energy crises attracted and stimulated higher attention towards energy storage devices. Solid state supercapacitors proved to be one of the promising power devices for the storage and utilization of electrical energy. There are number of strategies have been adopted to develop and modify electrode material for supercapacitors application. Herein, we have synthesized highly active and durable hybrid electrode material for supercapacitors by decoration of low-content Pt nanoparticles on the surface of carbon nitride embedded MnO2 nanospheres. The morphology and crystallite structure of as-developed hybrid electrode material was confirmed by physical characterization tools. The conductive behavior of as-developed material was characterized by field emission and electrical properties. The practical capacitive performance was analyzed by detailed electrochemical measurements. The enhanced capacitive properties of as-developed Pt/MnO2/C3N4 nanocomposite can be mainly attributed to the increase of the conductivity of high surface area resulting in better diffusion channel for electrolyte ions and electrons in MnO2 nanospheres due to the presence of Pt nanoparticles. Durable and stable cycling performance was ascribed favourable interaction of the components in nanocomposite.
