A supercapacitor is a type of electrochemical energy storage device that holds charge both electrostatically and electrochemically. High power density, high energy density, long cycle life, and wide operating temperature range properties make supercapacitor different form other energy storage devices. The supercapacitor has four essential components: electrode, electrolyte, current collector, and separator. In which electrode material selection is the most important factor for the charge storage mechanism. Different types of electrode materials like carbon-based electrode material, transition metal oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, and conducting polymers are used in supercapacitor applications. Electrode material should have high electrical conductivity, high surface area, lightweight, and low cost for high performance. This article will discuss different electrode materials with their electrochemical performances in supercapacitors.
