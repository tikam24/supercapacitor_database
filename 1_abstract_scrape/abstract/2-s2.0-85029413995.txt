A simple chemical route for the synthesis of amorphous carbon nanotube (a-CNT) manganese di oxide (MnO2) nanoflaky hybrid has been reported. The as prepared samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Raman spectrometer. The electrochemical behaviour of the pure a-CNTs and hybrid samples has been tested for different scan rates. The XRD spectra confirm the amorphousness of the system. FESEM and TEM study confirms the morphology of the hybrid structure. It has been shown that for the hybrid structure the electrochemical performance has been improved greatly compared to pure a-CNTs. The obtained capacitive value becomes as high as 106.2 F/g which is even better compared to pure MnO2 and pure a-CNTs. This study can well speculate the existence of another supercapacitor material for the use in environment friendly storage device thus resulting pollution free nature.
