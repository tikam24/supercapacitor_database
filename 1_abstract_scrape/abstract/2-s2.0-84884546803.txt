A facile solvothermal technique is developed to prepare a nickel oxide precursor which is subse-quently calcined in air at 300°C for 4 h to convert it to NiO nanospheres. These nanospheres areassembled from ultrathin mesoporous nanosheets that possess high surface areas. The final productis characterized by various techniques: thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron spectroscopy, and nitrogenadsorption-desorption method. Such a highly desired structure with a great surface area of 213 m2/g isbelieved to be formed through the Ostwald ripening mechanism. Electrochemical measurements showthat our electrode can exhibit a high specific capacitance of 803 F g -1at a discharge current densityof 2 A g-1. The electrode also possesses excellent long-term stability in an alkaline electrolyte. Theseinteresting properties promote it to be a potential supercapacitor electrode material. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
