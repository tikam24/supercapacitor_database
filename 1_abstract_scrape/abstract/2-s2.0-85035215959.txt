This study is aimed to synthesis the activated carbon from para-wood residue via two different thermochemical methods. The process was carried out using 40%wt. H3PO4 under different carbonizing temperatures. The activated carbon was composited with TiO2 using sol/gel method. The specific surface are and element composition of char, activated carbon and composite materials were evaluated by BET, SEM/EDX and XRD. Electrochemical measurement of electrode was detected using potentiostat in 30%wt. KOH under various potential scan rate, the specific capacitances of each electrode were calculated. The activated carbon with maximum specific surface area of 197.168 m2/g was obtained by using the B method in which para-wood residue was carbonized at 600°C for 3 h before acid activation for 2 h followed by calcination at 600°C for 2 h. The electrochemical charge/discharge of capacitor depended on the scan rate of applied potential. B2/TiO2 composite electrode contains Ti and O element of 10.16%wt. and 53.53%wt., respectively. Its capacitance was up to 173.69 F/g at the scan rate of 1 mV/s.
