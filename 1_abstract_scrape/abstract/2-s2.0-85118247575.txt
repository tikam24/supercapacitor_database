A green and economically viable route without any additional activation agents and templates has been developed to synthesize biomass-derived nanoporous carbon for superior electric double-layer capacitors via direct pyrolysis of dried black liquor powders, which is the main waste in pulping and paper-making industry. The resulting carbon materials present hierarchical porosity and moderate specific surface area of 1134 m2 g−1, as well as multi-heteroatoms co-doping such as N, S, Na and K, which exist originally in black liquor. When evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitors in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte, the-prepared carbon samples deliver a significantly high gravimetric capacitance of 331 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. Moreover, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor also possesses a gravimetric capacitance of 211 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, with an impressive long-term cycling stability of 92 % capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. This work explores a suitable and scalable approach for mass production of high-performance electrode materials with industrial wastes on the base of cost-efficiency and environment-friendship.
