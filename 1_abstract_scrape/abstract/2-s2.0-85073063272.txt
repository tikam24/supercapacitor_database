With the development of renewable energy such as hydrogen energy, renewable energy supplies have been an important part of DC microgrid. Related control and power management has become the focus of current research. The Photovoltaic /fuel cell/hybrid energy storage DC microgrid in this paper consists of Photovoltaic (PV), fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors, along with associated DC/DC and DC/AC converters. To guarantee the stability of the PV/fuel cell/hybrid energy storage DC microgrid, in this paper, a comprehensive control and energy management system is proposed. The proposed control and power management system stably regulate the bus voltage and well balance the power, mainly through automatic control of each module's voltage and power. Under the control and Power management system, when the load changes suddenly, the bus voltage remain stable and power remain balanced. The simulation is carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method.
