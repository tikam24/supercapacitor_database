Early transition-metal nitrides, especially vanadium nitride (VN), have shown promise for use in high energy density supercapacitors due to their high electronic conductivity, areal specific capacitance, and ability to be synthesized in high surface area form. Their further development would benefit from an understanding of their pseudocapacitive charge storage mechanism. In this paper, the extent of pseudocapacitance exhibited by vanadium nitride in aqueous electrolytes was investigated using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The pseudocapacitance contribution to the total capacitance in the nitride material was much higher than the double-layer capacitance and ranged from 85 % in basic electrolyte to 87 % in acidic electrolyte. The mole of electrons transferred per VN material during pseudocapacitive charge storage was also evaluated. This pseudocapacitive charge-storage is the key component in the full utilization of the properties of early-transition metal nitrides for high-energy density supercapacitors.
