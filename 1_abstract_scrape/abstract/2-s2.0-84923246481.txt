The nanostructure design of porous carbon-based electrode materials is key to improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In this study, hierarchically porous carbon nanosheets (HP-CNSs) were fabricated using waste coffee grounds by in situ carbonization and activation processes using KOH. Despite the simple synthesis process, the HP-CNSs had a high aspect ratio nanostructure (âˆ¼20 nm thickness to several micrometers in lateral size), a high specific surface area of 1945.7 m2 g-1, numerous heteroatoms, and good electrical transport properties, as well as hierarchically porous characteristics (0.5-10 nm in size). HP-CNS-based supercapacitors showed a specific energy of 35.4 Wh kg-1 at 11250 W kg-1 and of 23 Wh kg-1 for a 3 s charge/discharge current rate corresponding to a specific power of 30000 W kg-1. Additionally, the HP-CNS supercapacitors demonstrated good cyclic performance over 5000 cycles.
