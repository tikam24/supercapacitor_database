Considering power allocation problem of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle(FCHEV), in order to reduce hydrogen energy consumption and prolong battery life, an energy management strategy based on equivalent hydrogen consumption minimization strategy is proposed in this paper. According to the state of charge (SOC) of battery and supercapacitor, the variable equivalent factor of SOC consistency is designed. The optimal output power of fuel cell is obtained by using Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). According to the characteristics of high power density of supercapacitor, the output power of battery is smoothed, achieve the power distribution between battery and supercapacitor. Finally, based on ADVISOR and Simulink simulation, compared with RULE, the proposed strategy reduces hydrogen consumption by 0.87%, improves fuel economy and prolongs battery life.
