A series of NiO/C nanocomposites with NiO concentrations ranging from 10 to 90 wt% was synthesized using a simple and efficient two-step method based on non-isothermal decomposition of Nickel(II) bis(acetylacetonate). X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of these NiO/C nanocomposites demonstrate the presence of β-NiO. NiO/C nanocomposites are composed of spherical particles distributed over the carbon support surface. The average diameter of nickel oxide spheres increases with the NiO content and are estimated as 36, 50 and 205 nm for nanocomposites with 10, 50 and 80 wt% NiO concentrations, respectively. In turn, each NiO sphere contains several nickel oxide nanoparticles, whose average sizes are 7–8 nm. According to the tests performed using a three-electrode cell, specific capacitance (SC) of NiO/C nanocomposites increases from 200 to 400 F/g as the NiO content achieves a maximum of 60 wt% concentration, after which the SC decreases. The study of the NiO/C composite showing the highest SC in three-and two-electrode cells reveals that its SC remains almost unchanged while increasing the current density, and the sample demonstrates excellent cycling stability properties. Finally, NiO/C (60% NiO) composites are shown to be promising materials for charging quartz clocks with a power rating of 1.5 V (30 min).
