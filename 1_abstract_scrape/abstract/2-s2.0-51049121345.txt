Paper describes development of a three-phase bidirectional Z-source inverter (ZSI) interfacing an energy storage and supply network. Idea of bidirectional operation of ZSI is presented and simply solution of the capacitor voltage overboost problem is proposed. Issue of correct selection of voltage levels and minimum storage voltage for grid-connected inverter is discussed. Selection of the suitable PWM method and design process with special attention on Z-network passive elements is done in reference to comparable system of VSI supported by DC/DC converter. Finally, considerations are illustrated by laboratory test results of grid-connected three phase bidirectional Z-source inverter.
