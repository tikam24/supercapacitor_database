The tremelliform Co3O4@CeO2 nanocomposite with network structure directly grown on Ni foam have been synthesized by hydrothermal process for the first time and further employed as the electrode material for supercapacitors. The tremelliform Co3O4@CeO2 hybrid electrode delivers ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2260.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The porous network structure with large specific surface area facilitates electron transfer and electrolyte diffusion. In addition, highly activity CeO2 can accelerate faradaic reaction and increase the oxidation degree of Co3O4, which results in excellent cyclic stability. The results provide a feasible strategy to prepare Co3O4@CeO2 with facile architectural design and excellent electrochemical properties as a promising candidate for supercapacitor.
