Ultrathin nanoporous Fe3O4-carbon nanosheets (NNSs) with a high surface area of 229 m2 g-1 were synthesized by using a two-step method. The high capacitance of 163.4 F g-1 was achieved by utilizing such NNSs electrodes due to their unique feature, which is much higher than those of previously reported Fe3O4 hybrid products. The interconnected porous framework surface greatly enhanced charge transfer due to larger interfaces, and carbon nanopillars between nanosheet layers brought high conductivity.
