Today, the use of electric vehicles in transportation has become a more attractive alternative in terms of increase in oil prices, air pollution and exergy analysis. An additional energy source is needed because of the travel distance that can only be reached with the electric battery. In electric vehicles, especially in a vehicle with more than one power source, the energy management strategy is very important in energy saving. With the use of ultra-capacitors today, the charge state (SOC) of the batteries helps to extend the operating range and battery life. In this article, a shuttle driven by DC electric engine with battery which is used for transporting the luggage and persons in the touristic and airport area, which is produced in Turkey, is selected. The current and voltage values of the battery group were recorded by conducting road tests on a certain route, including idle and load (300kg) of this vehicle. According to the experimental results, high current is drawn from the battery group in vehicle acceleration. This high current value causes the battery group to be deeply discharged. This deep discharge value has a negative impact on the life-cycle and health of the battery. In this study, in order to prevent the deep discharge current of the battery group above 100 Ah, the connection of the ultra-capacitor group connected to the battery group is proposed by calculating.
