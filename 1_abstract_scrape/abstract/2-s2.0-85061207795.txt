The main bottleneck of supercapacitor is its low energy density, mainly arising from the low capacity of the electrode materials. Although some pseudocapacitive metal oxide/hydroxides have been selected to improve the energy density of supercapacitor, their low conductivity and inferior reversibility still need to be considered. In this work, we prepared a free-standing composite comprised of NiAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflakes decorated on a cotton derived carbon microfiber (CMF@NiAl-LDH) via a facile hydrothermal method. The large-scale and compressible cotton derived carbon fiber with connected three-dimensional pores served as conductive backbones for the growth of the NiAl-LDH nanoflakes. It can not only improve the conductivity of NiAl-LDH, but also amend the distribution of NiAl-LDH nanosheets, leading to both rapid electron and electrolyte ions transport kinetics. The abundant space among NiAl-LDH nanoflakes as well as developed 3D pores of CMF can accommodate the volume expansion of NiAl-LDH during long lifespan cycling. Benefited from these rational design, the as-prepared CMF@NiAl-LDH electrode exhibited significantly improved capacitive performance in terms of high specific capacitance (1667 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent rate performance (68.7% retained at 15 A g−1) and remarkable cyclic stability (105.4% maintained after 2000 cycles) in aqueous electrolytes. The assembled CMF@NiAl-LDH//porous carbon asymmetric supercapacitor can deliver a large energy density of 45.2 Wh Kg−1. This investigation suggests that the prepared CMF@NiAl-LDH electrode offers a great potential in large-scale energy storage device applications.
