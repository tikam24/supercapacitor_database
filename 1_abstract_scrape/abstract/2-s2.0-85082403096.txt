Nanocrystalline coating electrodes, also named thin-film electrodes, have received more and more research interest in electrical energy storage devices because the thin-film electrode enhanced its conductivity leading to facilitate electron transfer, and avoid the use of polymer binders and conductive agent. Here, we review the progress and challenge of synthesizing thin-film electrodes as well as their specific electroactivities for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. Nanostructured metal oxide thin film with targeted physical properties directly grown on a metal substrate is also summarized. To fully exploit thin-film electrodes, the optimization of crystallization processes and electrochemical properties of coating or film are important for the development of highly active thin-film energy storage devices.
