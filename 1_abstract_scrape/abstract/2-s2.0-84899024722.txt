We have successfully demonstrated, for the first time, the fabrication of vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT)-polypyrrole (PPY) nanocomposites as a 'hybrid supercapacitor' material directly integrated on silicon-based electrodes. In contrast to previous works, three distinctive achievements have been accomplished: (1) a 'hybrid supercapacitor' using VACNT forest with electroplated PPY and dodecylbenzenesulfonate (DBS) as a dopant in acetonitrile, (2) realizing 500% higher capacitance as compared to the capacitance of electrodes made of VACNT or DBS-doped PPY alone, and (3) highly reversible cycling between-1 V and +1 V with improved knee frequency at 797 Hz. As such this hybrid nanocomposite could become a new class of material for future supercapacitors. Â© 2014 IEEE.
