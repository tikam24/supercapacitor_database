In this work, we used combination of two materials as a hybrid electrode material for supercapacitor. Ni(OH)2 was coated on carbon fabric via electrochemical synthesis, and polyaniline salt was coated on Ni(OH)2-coated carbon fabric via in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in aqueous acidic medium (PNCF). For comparison, polyaniline salt was coated on bare carbon fabric (PCF) by same procedure. These fabrics were characterized by Raman, FE-SEM, and EDAX and also were used as electrodes in symmetric supercapacitor cell. These cells were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge and impedance spectral measurements. PNCF showed high energy density of 100 W h kg−1 at a power density of 175 W kg−1 and even at a high power density (875 W kg−1), it showed high energy density (74 W h kg−1). PNCF also showed 71% retention capacitance after 25 000 cycles at 1 A g−1. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2019, 136, 48042.
