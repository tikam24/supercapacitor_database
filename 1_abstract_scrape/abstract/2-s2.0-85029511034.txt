Covalent linking of 2D structures such as graphene, MoS2 and C3N4 by employing coupling reactions provides a strategy to generate a variety of materials with new or improved properties. These materials in a way provide the counter point based on covalent bonds to the van der Waals heterostructures. In this article, we describe materials obtained by linking graphene, MoS2 and BN with other layered structures and also with one-dimensional nanotubes and zero-dimensional MOFs and MOPs. Novel properties of the materials relate not only to porosity, surface area and gas adsorption, but also to supercapacitor characterstics, mechanical properties and the hydrogen evolution reaction. It should be possible to discover many more interesting structures and materials by employing the cross-linking strategy described here.
