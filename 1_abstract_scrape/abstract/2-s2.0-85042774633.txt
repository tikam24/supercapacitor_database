We have synthesized book-like Co3O4 microstructures on copper form by hydrothermal and annealing process, which can be directly used as binder-free, excellent rate capability and long-life supercapacitor electrode. The random slant book-like Co3O4 microstructures were uniformly grown on the Cu substrate, and the electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 736.25 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, good coulombic efficiency of 82.6%, excellent rate capability and 78.13% capacity retaining after 5000 cycles of charge and discharge, demonstrating a great potential in high power storage devices application.
