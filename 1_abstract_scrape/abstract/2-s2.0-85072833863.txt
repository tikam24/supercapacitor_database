Solving the problem of the energy management of a hybrid electric vehicle consists on finding the best distribution of the power to be supplied by the different energy sources. In this paper, a frequency separation based energy management is applied to distribute the missions of the energy sources while respecting their energy and dynamic limits. In our case, the system consists of three sources of energy. These three sources have different dynamic power / energy characteristics. Thus, a fuel cell is used as a main source and a hybrid storage system, consisting of a battery and a supercapacitor, is used as a secondary source allowing to support the primary one. The fuel cell provides the majority of the demand and the battery supports the FC during its start up and during high load demand (acceleration, high road slope). As the supercapacitor, it guarantees the response to pulse load requirements which is ensured by its fast dynamic. The proposed energy management strategy is evaluated for the New European driving cycle (NEDC). Simulation and experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness of this strategy.
