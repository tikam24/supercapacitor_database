Complex composite nanomaterials have recently received attention because of their enhanced electrochemical performance compared to single-structured materials. In this study, we synthesized calcium molybdate (CaMoO4) particles with a spherical shape and conducted surface modification to fabricate composite heterostructures on the CaMoO4 backbone using a simple two-step hydrothermal technique. To test their electrochemical characteristics, the produced hierarchical heterostructures were used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, exhibiting a cycling efficiency of 94% after 5000 cycles, a specific capacitance of 586 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, and good reversibility. These results demonstrate that the development of hierarchical heterostructures can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of materials by creating well-defined interfaces, increasing the surface area, and promoting efficient charge transfer, making them highly attractive for various applications in the field of energy storage and conversion.
