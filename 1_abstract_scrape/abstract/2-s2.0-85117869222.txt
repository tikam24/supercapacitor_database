Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's research team has nano-engineered a combined battery and supercapacitor that consists of 90% cellulose. They have created a battery that looks and feels like paper, and are even printed like paper, to create a lightweight, ultra-thin, and flexible power supply. This device can function as batteries and supercapacitors, which are separate devices in an electrical system. The device can withstand temperature extremes because it contains no liquids to freeze or evaporate. The research team hopes to eventually mass produce the sheet batteries using the roll-to-roll system presently used for printing newspapers.
