A common approach to research supercapacitors is to choose a special structure of nanomaterials combined with noble metal oxides to increase capacity. However, using precious metals as electrodes with special nanostructures is both expensive from a commercial point of view and detrimental to the commercialization of supercapacitors. Therefore, we report a system of electrochemical polymerization to prepare a porous polymer nanolayer coated nanomaterial Co(CO3)0.5(OH) (CoCHH)/PEDOT electrode with interwoven porous network structure. The PEDOT nanolayer has the advantages of controllable thickness, good electrical conductivity, porous and continuous. In addition, each unit of the special structure can be uniformly coated by nanolayer, and prevent the internal nanostructure from collapsing of the structure as electrolyte ions move in and out, and the conductivity and porosity of the composite electrode can be improved. As a result, the positive electrode of the composite nanolayer system showed excellent stability, with capacitance retention of 92.7% after 2000 cycles.
