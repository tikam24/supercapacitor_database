We report for the first time that zinc oxide (ZnO) can not only effectively catalyze the conversion of acetylene into graphene, but also greatly lower the growth temperature to only 400 Â°C. With this method, super thin and defect rich graphene shell (TD-GS) is successfully prepared for the first time using ZnO nanoparticles as both the catalyst and template. The growth of TD-GS is tracked and monitored and its growth mechanism is illustrated. The as-prepared TD-GS exhibits remarkable performance as electrode material for applications in supercapacitors or novel catalyst support for oxygen reduction reaction. We also demonstrate that by simply adjusting the growth conditions or process, new carbon structures, like opened TD-GS, TD-GS aerogel and even graphene tube can be facilely realized.
