Wearable electronic devices, such as electrical sensors, flexible displays, and health monitors have gained considerable attention and experienced rapid progress. Recently, the progress of flexible and wearable supercapacitors (SCs) have received considerable attention due to their ease of fabrication, low cost, flexible integration into textiles, long cycle life, fast charging/discharging, high efficiency, and capability to bridge the energy/power gap between conventional capacitors and batteries/fuel cells. In this context, the recent progress and achievements of flexible and wearable supercapacitors are presented, especially, the rational design and synthesis of novel nanostructured electrode materials on various flexible-based substrates, such as, carbon cloth, graphene coated fabric, silver coated fabric, nickel coated fabric, copper/nickel coated polyester fabric (CNF), etc. are summarized. The latest representative techniques and active materials of recently developed wearable supercapacitors with superior performance are summarized. Lastly, the current challenges, and future research directions and perspective in optimizing and developing the energy storage performance and function of flexible and wearable supercapacitors for their practical applications are addressed.
