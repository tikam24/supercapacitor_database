In this work a hybrid storage system, composed by a battery and supercapacitors, is evaluated in order to improve the voltage output signal of a Photovoltaic Energy System. First, it is presented a strategy to load the storage system, followed by a discussion of the strategy to take the energy from the storage system. Finally, the results of applying the former strategy to improve the output signal of an AC/AC converter are showed.
