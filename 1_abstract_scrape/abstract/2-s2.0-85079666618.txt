In this paper, we report a novel pore enriched carbon derived from polymeric organic framework (POF) of phloroglucinol and terephthaldehyde by solvothermal method followed by pyrolysis under an inert atmosphere at 800 °C (POF-800) for symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) applications. The as-prepared POF and POF-800 were characterized by the following techniques. To identify the functional groups, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used. The surface morphology was analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Thermal stability and the oxidation state of the element was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), respectively. POF-800 electrode shows a maximum surface area of 352 m2 g−1. In a three-electrode system, POF-800 electrode showed 50.1 F g−1 of specific capacitance at 0.25 A g−1 current density. Also, the SSC electrode exhibited specific capacitance of 46.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with exceptional long term stability (5000 cycles) and moderate energy density of 14.48 Wh kg−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The present finding opens a new avenue for well-developed porous carbon materials to encourage advanced supercapacitor device for superior electrochemical energy storage.
