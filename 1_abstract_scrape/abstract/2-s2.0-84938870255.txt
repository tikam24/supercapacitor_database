In this work, three kinds of ultrathin tremella-like MnO2 have been simply synthesized by decomposing KMnO4 under mild hydrothermal conditions. When applied as electrode materials, they all exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The asprepared MnO2 samples were characterized by means of XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. Additionally, the relationship of the crystalline nature with the electrochemical performance was investigated. Among the three samples, the product with the poorest crystallinity had the highest capacitance of 220 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g. It is thought that the ultrathin MnO2 nanostructures can serve as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
