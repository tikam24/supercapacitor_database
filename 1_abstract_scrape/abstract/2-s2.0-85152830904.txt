The immerging need of manufacturing highly efficient electrochemical energy storage (EES) in a scalable fashion has been growing every day. 3D printing process promises huge possibility in printing functional materials with a precise control of 3D shape and the material characteristic of the device. Therefore, utilization of 3D printing technology to automate the manufacturing process of efficient EES device has become a research focus. The growing need of high energy density, high specific capacitance, long life cycle, portability shifts the energy source from limited fossil fuel towards renewable and sustainable energy source materials. Printable carbon-based active materials individually or together with polymer composites significantly improve the EES device performances as sustainable and renewable materials since these materials have high intrinsic electrical conductivity, high surface area and porosity and tunable microstructures. This article discusses the feasibility of processing active energy storage materials by different 3D printing process to print EES devices.
