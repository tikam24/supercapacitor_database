Supercapacitors have presented promising results in energy storage until now, making them a possible candidate for becoming a mainstream rechargeable power source, which could be easily integrated in portable devices. Si itself, due to its prominence, would be a suitable candidate as a material for electrodes. Despite their performances, they still present shortcomings when put against batteries; hence, a lot of focus is put on increasing the performance of supercapacitors. Starting with its capacitance, we have opted for an increase in the active surface obtained through the porosification of the aforementioned Si electrodes to obtain a higher capacitance and better performances, as well as coating the presented electrodes for a pseudocapacitive contribution in addition. This article presents a study done on the effects the porosification of Si electrodes has on their electrical performance.
