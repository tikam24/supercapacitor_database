Development of efficient electrochemical energy storage systems with high energy and power densities coupled with minimal carbon footprint is an important technological challenge. One vital aspect in this regard is the correct choice of electrode material, as its properties (chemical, electrical) and assorted aspects (availability, processability) strongly influence the performance of the electrochemical system. Significant research has gone into developing novel electrode materials for the various electrochemical systems (Li-ion and other metal-ion rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, etc); however, in most cases, it is hard to identify a single electrode material that works suitably well across all systems. Molecular precursor or polymer derived ceramics (PDCs), because of their amorphous nanodomain structure, processing flexibility, easy availability of precursors, and tunable electrochemical properties, are promising candidates as electrode materials for a range of electrochemical energy storage devices. With progressive research, as more information is garnered about the relationship between PDC molecular structure and electrochemical behavior, it is expected that PDC-based materials will make a significant impact on the development of the next generation of high capacity, energy efficient batteries and supercapacitors. This article therefore looks to provide a detailed discussion of the properties of PDCs and their status as energy storage materials, along with the challenges that lie ahead.
