Well defined crystallographic and one dimensional morphological structure of molybdenum oxide were successfully synthesized by adjusting the duration of hydrothermal treatment. The prepared molybdenum oxide was examined through XRD, SEM, FTIR, TEM, BET and electrochemical studies. The XRD patterns illustrate that MoO x prepared by variying the hydrothermal reaction time are in different crystallographic structure of Mo y O x (Mo 8 O 23 and MoO 3 ). SEM studies reveal the different morphological structures ranging from flake like morphology to nanorods. TEM images confirm the excellent nanorod structure. The nanorod structure ensures good cyclic behaviour with maximum capacitance of 1080 F g −1 at a current density of 2 A g −1 . This large capacity of the MoO 3 nanostructures enabled fabrication of symmetric and asymmertic supercapacitor devices. The asymmertic device exhibits a maximum specific capacitance of 145 F g −1 at 2 mV s −1 with highest energy density of 38.6 W h kg −1 at 374.7 W kg −1 power density.
