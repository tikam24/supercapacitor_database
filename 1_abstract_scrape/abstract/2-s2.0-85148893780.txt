Translating the material merits of graphene to practical supercapacitor devices is critical for promoting capacitive energy storage, but is challenging due to the limited scalability in fabricating high-performance graphene electrode films. Here, we demonstrate a method for fabricating graphene microsphere films, formed by the bubble-induced destruction and agglomeration of the self-assembled toplayer of mixed graphene oxide and exfoliated graphene over an adequately heated solution. The microspheres have compact, randomly distributed graphene flakes, endowing the films with a high bulk density (0.92 g cm−3) and ion conductivity to allow ultrahigh charge/discharge current densities of up to 1,000 A g−1 in an ionic liquid. The stack cell with an areal mass loading of 10 mg cm−2 exhibits an excellent energy density of 83.4 Wh L−1, superior to the state-of-the-art carbon-based supercapacitors, and approaching that of lead-acid batteries. More importantly, a meter-scale film is fabricated within half a minute by a developed roll-to-roll process, demonstrating the enormous potential of these films in the industrial manufacturing of supercapacitors. Furthermore, the film electrode is infilled with an ionogel electrolyte and assembled into an all-solid-state, flexible device with durable flexibility and multiple optional outputs, demonstrating the potential of these supercapacitors for powering flexible electronic devices.
