Activated commercial carbon cloth (ACC) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal process using a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide as the solvent. Microcracks, mesopores, and oxygen-containing functional groups were formed on the surface of ACC, which significantly enhanced the electrochemical properties for ACC. The ACC showed the high areal-specific capacitance, good rate capability, and excellent cycling stability in the three-electrode system. And the ACC exhibited satisfactory chargingâ€“discharging. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor based on the ACC exhibited an areal-specific capacitance of 549.3 mF/cm2 and achieved an energy density of 1.29 mWh/cm3 at a power density of 533.02 mW/cm3 and a high power density of 618.16 mW/cm3 at an energy density of 0.61 mWh/cm3, respectively. Moreover, the outstanding capacitive performance reveals that ACC could be considered as a competitive potential candidate as an electrode for supercapacitor.
