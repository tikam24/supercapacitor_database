In this paper we present the multi-channel measurement system based on potentiostatic, galvanostatic and potentiodynamic methods or combinations of the given measurement methods. The multi-channel measurement system is controlled with the special developed software. This system enables to perform the electrochemical supercapacitor time domain analysis more completely and with high accuracy.
