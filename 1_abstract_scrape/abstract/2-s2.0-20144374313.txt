Ni(OH)2 ultrafine powders were synthesized by precipitation transformation method. And nanosized NiO was prepared by calcining the as prepared Ni(OH)2 ultrafine powders. The samples were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal gravity (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results show that particle size of the NiO is about lOnm. In an electrolyte of 0.5 mol·L-1 KOH, the nanosized NiO has typical capacitive characterization in the potential region of-0.05-0.35 V(vs SCE). At a current density of 2mA·cm-2, the NiO has a specific capacitance of 243F·g-1.
