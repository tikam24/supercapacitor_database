In this paper, the rapid prototyping station (RPS) for a hybrid energy storage system based on batteries and supercapacitors is presented. Main requirements to the functional capabilities and control features of experimental installation have been formulated with respect to state-of-the-art trends and, according to them, the RPS structure is designed. The concept of experimental testing and designed prototyping system can be used for implementation of different control algorithms and power management strategies for electric vehicles, renewable energy and smart grids applications.
