The exploration of future energy storage devices with lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient energy management strategy has attracted increased interest in recent years. The design and implementation of unique supercapacitor electrodes are expected to overcome these challenges. Herein, we report a facile electrochemical polymerization method to prepare sandpaper-based conductive polymer flexible supercapacitors. The prepared electrodes present hollow barnacle-like structure, and the maximum specific capacitance of the assembled supercapacitor is 303.3 mF cm−2. After 10,000 charge–discharge cycles, the capacitance retention maintains 92.7%. Moreover, the device has good flexibility, and the capacitance retention is as high as 92.5% after 2000 bending cycles, which is of great significance to applications.
