Mesoporous metal oxides consisting of fully interconnected network structures with small pores (20–50 nm) have high surface areas and decreased ion intercalation distances, making them ideal for use in high-performance electrochromic supercapacitors (ECSs). Evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), which combines sol–gel chemistry and molecular self-assembly, is a powerful method for the fabrication of mesoporous metal oxides through a solution phase synthesis. Herein, we introduce ultrafast sub-1 s ECSs based on an amorphous mesoporous tungsten trioxide (WO3) that is prepared by EISA. Compared to that of a compact-WO3 film-based device, the performances of an ECS with mesoporous WO3 exhibits a large optical modulation (76% at 700 nm), ultrafast switching speeds (0.8 s for coloration and 0.4 s for bleaching), and a high areal capacitance (2.57 mF/cm2), even at a high current density (1.0 mA/cm2). In addition, the excellent device stability during the coloration/bleaching and charging/discharging cycles is observed under fast response conditions. Moreover, we fabricated a patterned mesoporous WO3 for ECS displays (ECSDs) via printing-assisted EISA (PEISA). The resulting ECSDs can be used as portable energy-storage devices, and their electrochromic reflective displays change color according to their stored energy level. The ECSDs in this work have enormous potential for use in next-generation smart windows for buildings and as portable energy storage displays.
