Doped polyaniline (PANI) mesoporous electrodes with high surface and good conductivity can be regarded as the most promising pseudocapacitive material for developing high performance supercapacitor. However, its low-cost doped preparation and related fundamental and application studies are still limited in this field. In this study, doped PANI-based nanofibers as supercapacitor electrodes were successfully developed by a simple, low cost and environmental friendly process. The doped PANI-H2SO4-3 based electrodes not only exhibit good capacitance (616 F/g) and long-term cycling stability but also 90.3% of the capacitance can be retained by GCD test when the current density is increased from 1 A/g to 5 A/g. The as-prepared full capacitors can be further demonstrated that the doped PANI electrodes can have promising performances with rate capability (89% of original capacitance) and long cycle life (68% retention after 5000 charging/discharging cycles). The supercapacitor performances demonstrated that doped PANI mesoporous are very promising for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitor application.
