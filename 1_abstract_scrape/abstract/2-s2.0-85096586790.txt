Nowaday, developing sustainable energy storage and conversion techniques is of great desire to alleviate energy demands and environmental pollution, in which the core issue is to develop cost-efficient, high-performance and sustained electrode materials. Herein, we proposed a cost-efficient strategy by integrating solvothermal technique, calcination and up-stream gas method to fabricate bifunctional phosphorus-doped CoO core@shell microspheres, which perform great in both energy conversion (hydrogen evolution reaction) and energy storage (supercapacitor). Due to core@shell structure and phosphorus doping, the resulted P–CoO core@shell structures possess high specific surface area, enhanced conductivity and additional active sites. As a result, the P–CoO exhibits excellent electrocatalytic HER performances in alkaline media with a low overpotential (143 mV at 10 mA/cm2) and long-term stability (more than 24 h). Meanwhile, the prepared material presents greatly improved supercapacitive properties with ultrahigh capacitance (1845 F/g at 1 A/g) and excellent cycling stability. Therefore, this strategy provides a new contribution to develop multifunctional electrochemical-active materials for energy conversion and storage.
