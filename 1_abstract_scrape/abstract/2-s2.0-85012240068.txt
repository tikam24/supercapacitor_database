The two catalyst precursors of LaNiO3 of hexagonal structure and La2NiO4 of tetragonal structure were fabricated by citrate method,the two patterns of carbon nanotubes(CNT)were made by chemical vapour deposition technique. XRD method was emploied to analyse the crystal structure of the catalysts and the catalyst precur-sors,TEM, pore surface area analyzer were used to analyse the morphology and pore structure of CNT,the two forms of CNT were respectively assembled to supercapacitors,then tested the electrochemical energy storage performance. The results showed that the LaNiO3 and La2NiO4 were reduced to two Ni metal nanoparticle catalysts with different (111) crystal face parameter at high temperature. And the two Ni metal nanoparticle catalysts could grow CNT. But the obtained CNTs had different yield, morphology and structure, pore structure parameters and electrochemical energy storage performances at the same preparation conditions. The research results could be obtained as the following: there was a direct relationship between the CNT catalyst and CNT yield, morphology structure, pore structure parameters. There was a direct relationship between the CNT electrochemical energy storage performances and CNT morphology, pore structure parameters.
