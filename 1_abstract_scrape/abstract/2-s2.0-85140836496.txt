In this paper, wet-chemically synthesized hierarchical NiO microspheres and their exfoliated (ExC)-based nanocomposites (NiO/ExC) as electrodes for supercapacitor applications have been reported. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) techniques were used to characterize the as-synthesized products. The study of PXRD revealed that NiO exhibits a cubic phase. Morphological analysis showed a hierarchical micro-spherical structure of mesoporous NiO particles. The as-synthesized hierarchically porous NiO manifested a specific capacitance of 331 F/g with 50% capacitance retention. But, exfoliated carbon (ExC)-based nanocomposite (0.07 g NiO/0.003 g ExC) showed a particular capacitance of 815 F/g at the scan rate of 5 mV/s, with 79% retention in capacitance. High electrical conductivity and larger surface area arising from synergistic effects between NiO and exfoliated carbon resulted in a tremendous electrochemical response of NiO/ExC nanocomposites. The inclusion of the ExC further improves electrical impedance spectroscopic results by facilitating the charge transfer.
