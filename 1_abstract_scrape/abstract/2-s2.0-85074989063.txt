In this paper hybrid energy source support for electric vehicle is brought out which will lower the burden on one source supply fully to the vehicle. Conventionally in electric vehicle only battery supplies fully during all successive operations. During sudden acceleration/deceleration and braking conditions the motor draws high current. If the SOC of the battery is low, it will lead to thermal stresses and heat thereby battery life will reduce. Therefore, to prolong the life of the battery, ultra-capacitor is proposed in this work to drive the vehicle. The battery supports the vehicle with high energy and high power is supplied by immediate operation of ultracapacitor during the motor sudden acceleration/deceleration and braking periods. This would help to reduce the burden on one source and as such this hybrid source would help the life of the sources to prolong in a long run. A Lithium-ion (Li)battery and ultra-capacitor as hybrid sources are connected to DC-DC boost converter for balancing power among the sources and on requirement, sources could be connected to the Brushless DC motor (BLDC) used in electric vehicle. The system is developed using MATLAB/Simulink.
