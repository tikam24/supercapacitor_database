Supercapacitors will generate heat effects in the process of charging and discharging, which will make temperature rise sharply in a short time, thus will affect the electrical performances. There are three main factors affecting supercapacitors' heat generation rate, including structure, material and operating condition. In terms of structural characteristics, the influence of the package units' structure on its thermal behavior was studied in the paper. An electrochemical model of supercapacitors was established and controlled by ohm's law, charge conservation, mass conservation and the joule heat generation rate. Then a thermal model was established, and the coupling of thermology and electrochemistry was achieved. For the convenience of research, the concept of limited cycle numbers was defined, which is the number of cycles when the supercapacitor reaches the limited temperature (allowable maximum temperature) 343.15K during charge and discharge processes in circulation. By using the finite element method, the thermal behavior of supercapacitors with different structures (including: the number of package units and the size of a cell) under cyclic charge and discharge was simulated to study the limited cycle numbers they can bear, which provides a new idea for a supercapacitor's optimization design. The simulation results show that the number of package units and the size of cells have little effects on the temperature field under high currents, even considering the ambient temperature. However, they have a great effect when the current is small: as the ambient temperature increases, the effect gets greater.
