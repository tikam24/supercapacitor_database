In the renewable energy area, the lack of power stability aspects seen from the response to changes when there is an intermittency of the input. Fuel cell is proven to be able to dampen the response. But, by using the modified standalone with hybrid energy storage system, the fuel cell penetration effect has to be evaluated before the system goes through in the field. The purpose of this paper is to provide the fuel cell, using PEMFC model, penetration characteristics on standalone photovoltaic with hybrid energy storage system. From the results, the characteristics obtained that fuel cell penetration give the better result in power quality aspect, and got its power stability during the injection to the system. The supercapacitor in the hybrid storage system the contribution to dampen the injection effect, but give the less contribution to power distribution, and the load had sustained at nearly zero or safe injection effect during fuel cell power injection.
