Solvothermal reduction of graphene oxide and Schiff-base condensation between anthraquinone and dialdehydes were simultaneously performed to produce well-dispersed composites as metal-free supercapacitor electrodes, which rationally combine conductive graphene and pseudocapacitive polyquinones that allow for fast electron/ion transport and efficient redox reactions, affording great rate capability and high power/energy densities.
