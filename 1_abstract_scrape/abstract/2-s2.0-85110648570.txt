Herein, we propose a three-dimensional hierarchical porous carbon (THPC) derived from interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) of resorcinol formaldehyde-zinc tartrate and poly(styrene-maleic anhydride) (RF-Zn/PSMA), which was prepared via a gel swelling method. The three-dimensional hierarchical and interconnected pore structure involving micro-, meso- and macropores benefits from the synergistic pore-forming effect of PSMA pyrolysis and zinc tartrate decomposition during carbonization process. A high specific surface area of 742 m2 g−1 together with a cheese-like morphology was found for obtained THPC, exhibiting a high specific capacitance of 235 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in 6 M KOH. THPC assembled symmetrical supercapacitor using 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolytes deliver energy outputs of 6.47 and 15.3 Wh kg−1 at 100 and 180 W kg−1, respectively. More attractively, the assembled supercapacitor based on the THPC achieves a high energy outputs of 50.45 Wh kg−1 at 350 W kg−1 in EMIMBF4 under wide potential window of 3.5 V, indicating its practical application prospect. Our findings open up new playgrounds for the design and electrochemical application of hierarchical porous carbon using IPNs as precursor.
