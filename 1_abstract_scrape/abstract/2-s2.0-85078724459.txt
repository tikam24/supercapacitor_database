Lithium-ion batteries have double the energy density of traditional batteries, as nickel-metal hydrid batteries, half the size and weight, and a good lifetime. This technology is widely used as the energy storage system in many industrial applications, such as small electronic devices and electric vehicles. The work proposed in this paper deals with the lithium-ion battery charger based on forward power converter. The objective is to design and simulate the charging system of a hybrid energy storage source integrating lithium-ion battery and supercapacitor used in a small electric cart application. The development of the circuit of the battery charger makes possible to test constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging pattern. The sizing and simulation of both battery charger and battery/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage source are carried out by using a developed algorithm. The obtained results confirm the high capability of the proposed system and show that the model is able to simulate the charging behavior of a lithium-ion battery.
