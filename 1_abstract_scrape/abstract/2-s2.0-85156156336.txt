Photovoltaic (PV) power penetration into the distribution grid has increased. PV power fluctuations, abrupt load changes, nonlinear loading, growing usage of portable electronic devices, electric cars low average power and comparatively high pulse power needs, and other factors translate into severe grid instability. As a result, in these circumstances, power exchange between PV and the utility grid becomes a difficult task. Therefore, this article proposes a hydrogen/bromine (H2/Br2) redox flow battery and supercapacitor composite energy storage for a three phase grid tied PV system with multifunctional active power filter support to ensure grid codes. Further, the system is equipped with an unprecedented control technique that encompasses: an adaptive frequency tuned complex coefficient filter-phase locked loop that provides grid frequency and phase angle information under adverse grid conditions, a modified sparrow search algorithm tuned tilt integral derivative with filter plus double integral controllers are employed to regulate the control errors under various system dynamic and disturbance conditions, fractional order incremental conductance maximum power point tracking is incorporated to efficiently track the PV peak power irrespective of atmospheric variations, a holistic fast-acting power based energy management control employed for efficient regulation of load power and smooth out the PV power variation, and PV feedforward control dynamics to enhances system dynamics by reducing oscillations under various atmospheric conditions. The aim is to attain a smooth power transition with the grid at the unit power factor under normal and nonideal grid conditions. With reactive power injection, the control also maintains the voltage profile. During all these operations, no trade-off occurs with the system power quality. Matlab simulations and the real time simulation test bench results under unfavorable grid circumstances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and system harmonics are well within bounds in all the scenarios undertaken.
