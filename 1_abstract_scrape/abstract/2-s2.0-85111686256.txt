Electrochemical supercapacitors are prominent power sources of today, which store and release energy by reversible adsorption and desorption of ions at the interfaces between electrode materials and electrolytes. Spinel-based nano-structured materials are assumed to be promising candidates of electrode materials for supercapacitors, because of electrical conductivity, electroactive sites, thermal stability, flexibility, specific capacitance, and cycling stability. Spinel binary transition metal oxides, such as, NiFe2O4, ZnCo2O4, MgCo2O4, CuCo2O4, NiCo2O4, ZnMn2O4, and CoMn2O4 give a wide extend of choices for supercapacitor. In this work, we explained different spinel structured electrode materials such as Mn-, Fe-, Co-based ones and their energy storage performances for designing supercapacitors.
