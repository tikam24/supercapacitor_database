A new method of using dynamic equalization technology to realize the maximum energy storage utilization was presented to overcome the influence of the disaccord among units of series super capacitor (SC) bank and ensure that the units could work safely. By considering in combination with the high specific power, low working voltage, wide voltage working range and nonlinear external characteristics, we present constant duty ratio pulse frequency modulation mode and fuzzy control method based on state prediction in the active equalization circuit and accomplish the software and hardware design for the equalization system. The simulation analysis and experiment results of constant current multi-cycle and variable current multi-cycle charge-discharge process verify the validity of the design.
