Controlled pyrolysis of biomass is introduced to recover substantial mesopores and relevant surface functional groups of carbon flakes needed for high energy storage of supercapacitors. The novel controlled pyrolysis of sugarcane bagasse with ice water effectively explored the ephemeral bonds reformation in the conventional pyrolysis of biomass to produce debilitated carbon precursor used for hydrothermal separation. Consequently, the prepared porous carbon exhibits optimized mesopores and oxygen-rich mesoporous flakes with large packing density and high specific surface area (791.20 m2g-1) at optimal temperature of 300Â°C. Thus, the quenching effect derived from the frost improves the interaction between the debilitated carbon precursor and superheated water, which is responsible for the separated carbon layers via hydrothermal separation. The hydrothermal process doped oxygen on mesoporous carbon surfaces contributes to the increase in the charge transfer and to the decrease in the mass transfer resistance of the supercapacitor electrode. Consequently, the desired densely packed mesoporous carbon (BGCQH300) demonstrates a better electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (Cs) of 314 Fg-1 at 9 Ag-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, which is 22% superior Cs compared with the untreated pyro-based bagasse carbon (BGCQ). The charge/discharge cycling behavior represents high capacitance retention of the electrode after 20,000 cycles at 9 Ag-1. Hence, the strategy of synthesizing mesoporous carbon materials via ice water controlled pyrolysis is promising approach for preparation of low-cost electrode materials.
