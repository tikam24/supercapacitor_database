CeO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized via hydrothermal method using CTAB as the capping agent. The as prepared cerium oxide was annealed in air at different temperatures (300, 400 and 500˚C). X-ray diffraction patterns indicate the formation of CeO2 nanoparticles in the cubic fluorite structure. FTIR spectra further confirm the formation of Ce-O bonds. Electrochemical investigation of the electrodes fabricated using CeO2 was carried out using cyclicvoltammetry, choronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. From cyclicvoltammetry analysis CeO2-400 was found to exhibit the specific capacitance of 526 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The charge transfer resistance of CeO2-400 was found to be 0.29Ω. These results indicate that CeO2 annealed at 400˚C is a promising electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
