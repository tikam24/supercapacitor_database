Two samples of manganese oxide nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a simple solution-combustion method at ignited temperature 250 C (C250) and 300 C (C300). The structural and optical properties have been characterized by Xray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR), UV-Vis absorption and Photo-luminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of C300 showed a tetragonal hausmannite structure of Mn3O4 NPs, where the XRD patterns of C250 revealed a mix phase structure of the manganese oxides NPs. The obtained PL emission illustrated two broad bands. The obtained FT-IR results coincided with the XRD results. The calculated average crystallite size (D) was 27 and 26 nm for C250 and C300, respectively. The electrochemical performance of the prepared electrodes based on the synthesized samples C250 and C300 were examined in 1 M NaSO4 electrolyte solution using cyclic voltammetry. The examined electrodes based on sample C250 presented a relatively large specific capacitance 128 F.g-1. As a result, manganese oxide NPs could be a promising candidate to be used as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
