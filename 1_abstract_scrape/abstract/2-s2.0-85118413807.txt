In this article, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the heat transfer through the electrode-electrolyte interfaces of supercapacitors based on ionic liquids. The factors of thermal conductivity of interfaces between the graphene electrode and ionic liquids were analyzed. Simulation results show that when the electrode is charged, stable electrical double layers form at the electrode, and the change of EDL structure increases the molecular volume ratio, thus improving the interfacial heat transfer. At the negatively charged electrode, the extra adsorption peak makes the heat transfer stronger than that at the positively charged electrode. The interfacial thermal conductivity of the double layer at electrodes with the nanoscale roughness is lower than that of the smooth one. This is because there are fewer carbon atoms involved in heat transfer at the rough surface, which reduces the contacting area and thus weakens the heat transfer at the interface.
