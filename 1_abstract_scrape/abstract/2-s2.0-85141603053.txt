Sustainable decentralized energy generation and storage in the cities are critical for a sustainable future. Here we design a smart energy storage device based on thermal insulation and MXene (Ti3C2Tx) for powered future smart homes. The modified surface of a common thermal insulation wall (TIW) using Ti3C2Tx and polyaniline (PANI) by in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline monomer serves as an energy storage device in the wall and, at the same time, maintains the temperature inside the house. The as-fabricated PANI@Ti3C2Tx-TIW-based supercapacitor exhibited high specific capacitance with outstanding rate capability, cyclic stability, mechanical stability, and power density, and functions in extreme temperatures (−15 °C to 45 °C). Further, the device was integrated into real rock mineral wool insulation to develop a future house energy storage system that can store electricity in the house wall and supply power to operate emergency evacuation and alert devices in the event of a disaster.
