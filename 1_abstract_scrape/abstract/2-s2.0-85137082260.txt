Adequate energy storage has become a global concern in modern society, and high-performance energy-storage devices are in great demand. The need for efficient energy-storage systems is even more apparent when extended to applications such as electrical/hybrid vehicles that require hundreds of times more power than smaller devices. Supercapacitors have emerged as promising energy sources with exceptionally fast charge-discharge rates. Early carbon-based supercapacitors received significant research attention for their enhanced charging capacity, power density, and mechanical stability. Conducting polymers and their metal-based oxides led to a supercapacitor revolution, but their performance has been limited by poor capacitance and low cyclic ability. Carbon and metal-based oxide materials have improved conductivity, better cyclic ability, mechanical stability, specific capacitance, and current density. This chapter describes the characteristics and performance of various materials used to build up MO-C composites for supercapacitors. This chapter also discusses synthesis methods, features, challenges, and future MO-C composite recommendations and explores aspects of carbon-based, MO-based, transition metal-based, and rare-earth MO-based supercapacitors that had not been previously discussed in a single article. Various properties of supercapacitors are compared, and the synthesis methods and performance of MO-C composites are well described in tabular comparative analysis. It may be concluded that MO-C composites have many properties making them suitable candidates for the electrode material of supercapacitors.
