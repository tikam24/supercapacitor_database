Enhancement to the electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes were realized by incorporating highly porous conductive polymer films prepared with solution-processed polyaniline. The resultant nanostructures contained characteristic pores measuring 30-150 nm. Such electrodes generated from a solution of polyaniline-camphorsulfonic acid (PANI/CSA) exhibited higher porosity and electro-catalytic activity than those generated from conventional PANI nanomaterials. These improvements were attributed to faster ion diffusion at the PANI electrode/electrolyte interface. The highest specific capacitance observed for a supercapacitor fabricated with a porous PANI electrode obtained was 361 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1, which is more than twice that of an equivalent electrode made with pristine PANI. Furthermore, supercapacitors made with highly porous PANI electrodes exhibited high electrochemical stability and rate performances. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
