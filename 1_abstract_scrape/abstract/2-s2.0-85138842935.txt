The invention of printing technologies has revolutionized the manner in which information is transmitted and reproduced. In the modern era, printing technologies, which are equipped with computerized control and design methods, have become considerably efficient and effective, facilitating A significant breakthrough in the manufacture of high-performance electrochemical energy storage systems. Through careful design and execution, the components of energy storage devices, particularly electrodes, can be formulated into functional inks, enabling the use of divers materials and devices in high-performance energy storage applications. This reviewfocuses on three major printing technologies: inkjet printing, screen printing, and 3D printing, introducing the principles of each printing technology, the design and preparation of various electrode inks, and their applications in supercapacitors. Finally, the challenges and scope for the future development of printing technologies forhigh-performance supercapacitors are presented.
