To study the action rule of laser initiation driven by super capacitor, a time domain model of laser output driven by super capacitor was established and a laser initiation device driven by super capacitor was designed. The output waveforms of laser under different capacitance values and discharge voltages were obtained. The test data were basically consistent with the numerical simulation data. The initiation rule of laser detonator of teteraamnine bis(5 nitrotetrazoleto) cobalt(Ⅲ) perchlorate (BNCP) as the primary charge and JH 14 as the output charge was studied by the laser initiation device driven by super capacitor. Results show that the laser initiation time driven based on super capacitor decreases rapidly with the increase of discharge voltage, and the maximum decreasing amplitude reaches 71%, and the laser initiation time decreases slightly with the increase of the capacitance value, the decreasing amplitude is about 32.1%. The initiation energy is between 0.037 mJ and 0.057 mJ. The initiation energy utilization rate decreases with the increase of discharge voltage and the capacitance. Under the test conditions of discharge voltage of 13.5 V and capacitance of 120 mF, the initiation action time is as fast as 14.8 μs, which realizes the rapid laser initiation. driven by super capacitor.
