Abstract: A computer model of an autonomous electric-power system is proposed, on which the main modes of operation of static sources of electric power are calculated, including buffer and autonomous modes, the mode of parallel operation of static sources and generator sets, the mode of parallel operation of static sources with the shore power network, normal and accelerated charging of batteries and supercapacitors, and emergency modes of operation. When developing a model of a ship power plant with static sources, mathematical models of static elements were used that implement their typical volt–ampere charge–discharge characteristics.
