This paper deals with a dynamical analysis of a proposed charge balancing device. In Fact, many energy converters or harvesters need to supply a uniform signal and continuous energy flow to loads. In the context of a decentralized renewable energy sources, the intermittency poses a real challenge to ensure stable production and energy consumption flows. Several Energy storage solutions have been proposed to guarantee the satisfaction of the demand over the time. This study is focused on the solution using systems with high specific energy such as supercapacitors (SC). Hence, we studied the charge balancing process between supercapacitors connected by a charge balancing device. The nonlinear dynamic behavior of the system is an important issue to show deeply the dynamic interactions between the energy storage units. Analytical analysis and some experiments have been led to show some of these interactions in order to be taken into account for the design of the energy harvesters and the charge balancing devices.
