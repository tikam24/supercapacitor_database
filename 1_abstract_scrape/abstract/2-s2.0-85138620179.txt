Materials engineering plays a key role in the field of electrochemical energy storage, and considerable efforts have been made in recent years to fulfill the future equirements of electrochemical energy storage using novel functional electrode materials. Ternary metal oxides (sulfides, selenides) have received considerable attention owing to their interesting properties for their application in supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries, hydrogen storage and other electrochemical energy storage systems. They have been reported to exhibit a higher supercapacitive performance than single component metal oxides (sulfides, selenides), and seem to be a group of the most promising and low cost materials for pseudocapacitor. This chapter begins with a brief introduction on the fundamental understanding of charge storage mechanisms based on the sructural properties of electrode materials. The next sections briefly summarise the latest progress in developing ternary oxides (sulfides, selenides) nanostructures for supercapacitors, the recent significant breakthroughs in flexible supercapacitor based on ternary metal oxides (sulfides, selenides) electrodes. The final section highlights future trends, prospects and challenges.
