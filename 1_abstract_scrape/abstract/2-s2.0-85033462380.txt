3D network-like, ultrathin, and controllable NixCo1-xMoO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanosheets on carbon cloth have been successfully designed and synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal process. All these NixCo1-xMoO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanosheets possess similar morphologies and structures with thin nanosheets. The electrochemical performance can be optimized when x = 0.75, owing to the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt ions. The Ni0.75Co0.25MoO4 nanosheets exhibit high specific capacity of 726.6 C g-1 at 1 A g-1, excellent rate capability maintaining about 73% at 20 A g-1, and favorable cycling stability with about 97.2% retention of the initial after 3000 cycles. The corresponding hybrid supercapacitor exhibits high specific capacity of 99 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and high energy density of 35.2 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 800 W kg-1. The high specific capacity, excellent rate capability, and favorable cycling performance elucidate that these NixCo1-xMoO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) nanosheets possess tremendously promising applications in energy storage devices.
