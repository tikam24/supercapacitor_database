In this work we have demonstrated how to prepare a novel gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) with remarkable adhesive characteristics by combining a synthesized poly(ionic liquid) consisting of poly(1-vinyl-3-propylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide) (poly(VPIFSI)) and a commercial ionic liquid: 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (EMIFSI). For this purpose several PIL/IL-GPEs systems (considering the amount of IL) were subjected to electrochemical characterization. The influence of the PIL/IL-GPE (50 wt% of IL) on the properties of a flexible solid state supercapacitor was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and the galvanostatic charge/discharge technique that allows synchronous measurements of the cell voltage and the potential of the positive and negative electrodes. The influence of the ions on the formation of the electric double layer in the device during cycling employing different conditions and folding angles is discussed. The properties of the adhesive PIL/IL-GPE, such as high conductivity, good interaction between the PIL matrix and the IL liquid phase that prevents any leakage (thereby contributing to greater safety) together with the good adherability and wettability of the gel electrolyte on the electrode surface have produced a device with an improved rate capability and cyclability that undergoes hardly any changes in C sp , cell , E real , and P real of the cell when folded.
