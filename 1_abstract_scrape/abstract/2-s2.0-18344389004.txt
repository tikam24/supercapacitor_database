Supercapacitor characteristics of manganese oxide/nickel (MnO x/Ni) and manganese oxide/carbon nanotubes/nickel (MnO x/CNTs/Ni) nanocomposite electrodes were investigated in this study. The CNTs were deposited on the Ni substrate by electrophoresis in a 0.5 mg CNT/1 mL dimethylformamide solution, whereas the MnOx were synthesized by anodic deposition in a 0.16 M manganese sulfate pentahydrate aqueous solution on substrates. The crystallinity and surface morphology of these electrodes were determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The capacitive properties of these electrodes were demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry with scan rates ranging from 5 to 100 mV/s. The specific capacitances of the MnOxCNT/Ni nanocomposite electrode were 415 and 388 F/g with scan rates of 5 and 100 mV/s, respectively. After 1000 cycles of operation, this electrode can maintain 79% of its original capacitance. These MnOx/CNT/Ni nanocomposite electrodes possessing good electrochemical reversibility and high capacitance may be appropriate for supercapacitor application in the future.
