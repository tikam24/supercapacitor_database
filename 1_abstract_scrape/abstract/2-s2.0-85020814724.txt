The triply hierarchical NiCo2O4 array grown on Ni foam (NiCo2O4/NF) was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method. Furthermore, the triply hierarchical NiCo2O4/NF exhibited higher specific capacitance (ca.2370.0F g-1) comparing to the other NiCo2O4/NFs reported in previous works. At the same time, the capacitance loss was only 17.6% after 1000 charge-discharge cycling tests. The excellent specific capacitance and long cycle ability was attributed to the triply hierarchical structure. These results did not only synthesize triply hierarchical NiCo2O4/NF for application in electrode material of supercapacitors, but also proved that triply hierarchical arrays showed high capacitive properties.
