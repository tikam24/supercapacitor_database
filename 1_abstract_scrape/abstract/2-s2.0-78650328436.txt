This paper investigates the potential of supercapacitor based energy storage system for enhancing fault ride through capability of wind driven induction generator. A dynamic model of wind generation system including Static Compensator (STATCOM) is developed. The power control capability of the STATCOM is extended by incorporating supercapacitor based energy storage system. A vector control technique based on the decoupling of real and reactive power is implemented. Simulation results show that fixed speed induction generator achieves significant grid fault withstand capability when aided by supercapacitor based energy storage system. Induction generator regains prefault status immediately after the fault is cleared. Â© 2010 IEEE.
