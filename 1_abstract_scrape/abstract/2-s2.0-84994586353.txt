Considering the desirable attributes of nanosheets of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), the authors prepared composites of the two and investigated their use in supercapacitors. The best results were obtained with the MoS2:RGO (1:2) composite, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 416 F/g at 5 mV/s. They also studied the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of MoS2-RGO composites. Among the MoS2-RGO nanocomposites, the 1:2 composite showed the best ORR activity, since the attributes for a good supercapacitor performance are reported for this property as well. The excellent performance of the MoS2-RGO (1:2) composite is attributed to the combined effect of the good electrical conductivity of RGO and the unique surface properties of MoS2 as well as of RGO. This study indicates that good supercapacitor performance and ORR activity are governed by common factors.
