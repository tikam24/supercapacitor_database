This paper focuses on implementing then testing the storage secondary power source. The auxiliary power source is extremely critical since, during eclipse interval the satellite must be fed by electrical power to carry out its purpose in space. Therefore, this source will contain chemical battery particularly lithium-ion battery and/ or ultracapacitor particularly lithium-ion capacitor. Three different approaches will be presented. Using chemical battery alone, using ultracapacitor alone and last one is using chemical battery concurrently with ultracapacitor. The gains and the advantages from these approaches will be mentioned. The software programs like MATLAB and LabVIEW will be utilized to calculate the sizing of system and to verify the design. Finally, a clear comparison will be executed between the different three aforementioned approaches to distinguish the premium design approach.
