The continuous development of novel renewable energy makes the composition electrode become more and more diversified, and the composition has been relied on the multiple chemical elements. As energy storage materials, graphene and transition metal oxides have been researched at home and abroad due to their particular advantages. NiO, Mn3O4, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were synthesized the NiO@Mn3O4/rGO through a simple hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of NiO@Mn3O4/rGO is characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS, XRD and XPS. The electrochemical results (cyclic voltammetry curve, galvanostatic charge discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) confirm that NiO@Mn3O4/rGO exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of NiO@Mn3O4/rGO has a 533.97 F/g at 1 A/g. After 2000 charge and discharge cycles, it still retains a 75% capacitance at higher 10 A/g current density.
