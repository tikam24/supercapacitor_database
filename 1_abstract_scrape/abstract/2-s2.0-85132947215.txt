Through using mono-vacant Keggin anions and two S-containing ligands dithio oxamide (DiTOm) and 2,5-bis(4-pyridyl)thiazolo [5,4-d]thiazole (Py2TTz), ten rare earth mono-substituted Keggin based compounds have been synthesized, namely [RE (DiTOm)0.5(H2O)HPW11O39][H3(Py2TTz)2.5]·nH2O (RE ​= ​Sm 1, Tb 2, Gd 3, Dy 4, Ho 5, Y 6, n ​= ​16 1, 14 2 3 5 6, 13 4), [Yb(DiTOm)0.5(H2O)HPW11O39][H3(Py2TTz)1.5(PyTTz)]·18H2O (7), [Eu(H2O)2HPW11O39][H3(Py2TTz)2.5]·6H2O (8), [RE (H2O)3HPW11O39][H3(Py2TTz)2]·nH2O (RE ​= ​La 9, Pr 10, n ​= ​10 9, 13 10) (PyTTz ​= ​2-methyl-5-pyridin-4-yl-thiazolo [5,4-d]thiazole). Compounds 1–7 are isostructural, in which rare earth mono-substituted Keggin dimmers are linked by DiTOm ligands to construct a chain. Compounds 8 and the isostructural 9–10 show 1D chains with RE mono-substituted Keggin dimmers shared the same terminal O atoms. The Py2TTz ligands in compounds 1–10 are dissociative. Furthermore, the stability, magnetic and electrochemical properties of 1–10 have been studied in detail. Compounds 1 and 9 also exhibit capacitance performance. Moreover, when the current density is 1 ​A ​g−1, the specific capacitance of compound 1 is up to 734 ​F ​g−1.
