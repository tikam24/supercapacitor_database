The proceedings contains 15 papers from the conference on micro power sources - proceedings of the international symposium. The topics discussed includes: thin film supercapacitor with ruthenium oxide and solid electrolyte; electrolyte and electrode passivation for thin film batteries; cu-doped vanadium oxide(CVO) thin film cathode for microbatteries; si thin-film anode for microbatteries; chemical and electrochemical lithiated hopg and carbon fibers; high power-density polymer-electrolyte fuel cells by microfabrication and structural and electrochemical properties of vanadium oxide deposited by d.c. and r.f. reactive sputtering at room temperature.
