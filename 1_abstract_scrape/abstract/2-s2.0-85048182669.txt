Herein, we report the chemical synthesis of NiFe2O4 thin films forming nanosheet-, nanoflower-, and nanofeather-like morphologies using NiCl2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and NiSO4·6H2O nickel salt precursors, respectively, while using the same iron salt precursor. A nanostructure formation mechanism is proposed in detail using coordination chemistry theory. Interestingly, nanostructures of NiFe2O4 nanosheets revealed a maximum surface area of 47 m2 g-1, which was higher than those of nanoflowers and nanofeathers (25 and 11 m2 g-1). Similarly, the supercapacitive properties of the individual NiFe2O4 nanosheet-based electrode demonstrated maximum specific capacitance of 1139 F g-1, which is found to be better than that of NiFe2O4 nanoflowers (677 F g-1) and nanofeathers (435 F g-1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the symmetric device fabricated using NiFe2O4 nanosheet electrodes and PVA-KOH solid gel electrolyte shows higher specific capacitance of 236 F g-1 with 98% retention after 7000 cycles and higher specific energy density of 47 Wh kg-1 at a specific power of 333 W kg-1.
