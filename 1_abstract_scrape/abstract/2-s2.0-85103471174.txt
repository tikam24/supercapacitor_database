The effective preparation of high porosity carbonaceous electrode materials is a critical and challenging issue for obtaining superior supercapacitors. In this work, a novel KCl-assisted KOH strategy is developed for the preparation ofMoringa oleiferabranch-based porous carbon materials (PCMs). Benefiting from the liquid environment ofin situformed molten salts, KCl-assisted KOH activation can effectively decrease the usage of KOH, and thus increase the yield of PCMs from 9.8% to 15.6% whilst maintaining their high porosity. Therefore, the obtained PCMs possess a high specific surface area (i.e., 2314-3470 m2g−1) and pore volume (i.e., 0.94-1.69 cm3g−1). When used in supercapacitors, a typical PCM electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 421 F g−1at 0.5 A g−1and with an excellent cyclic stability of 4% capacity decay after 20 000 charge/discharge cycles in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, a maximum energy density of 33.0 W h kg−1can be achieved at 224.0 W kg−1. This attractive electrochemical performance shows PCMs to be a promising material for use in supercapacitors. Furthermore, this research provides a cost-effective and promising route for the preparation of porous carbon with high porosity.
