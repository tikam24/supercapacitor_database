Environmentally friendly activation strategies for synthesis of heteroatom-doped porous carbons are extremely welcome. Here, K2SO4 and NaCl-KCl were introduced simultaneously to prepare sulfur/oxygen co-doped porous carbons (SPC). By adopting phenolic resin (PF) as the carbon source, the optimal SPC sample with a large surface area of 1838 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 1.18 cm3 g−1 was successfully prepared. Structure characterizations demonstrated that K2SO4 mainly accounted for the pore formation while NaCl-KCl had a confinement effect on the carbon loss. Finally, as a multifunctional adsorbent, the maximum capacity for SPC-1-2-5 towards Rhodamine B (RhB) reached 2532.3 mg g−1, showing a great potential in cleaning water. As an active electrode material for supercapacitor, the specific capacitance for SPC-1-2-5 reached 296.7 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. And the specific capacitance retained 92.8 % after 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1, also demonstrating its excellent cycle stability in electrochemistry. This methodology of simultaneous activation and confinement could be extended to obtain new carbon materials for various applications.
