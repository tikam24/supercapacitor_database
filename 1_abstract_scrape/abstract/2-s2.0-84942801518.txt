Highly porous carbon, both unmodified and hexamine-coated on the pore surfaces, is tested at high working voltages in organic electrolyte for supercapacitors in order to enhance the energy density and power density. Solâ€“gel processing allows for excellent control of the porous structure and chemical composition of carbon, resulting in a material with high surface area and a low level of impurities. This porous carbon can be modified using a simple solution-based method to enhance capacitance. Increasing the working voltage from 2.0 to 3.0 V significantly improves performance for both unmodified and hexamine-coated carbon. The energy density and power density increase at higher working voltage, and under certain conditions, the capacitance increases as well. Cyclic stability is also investigated, with hexamine-coated carbon retaining more of its initial capacitance than unmodified carbon at all working voltages.
