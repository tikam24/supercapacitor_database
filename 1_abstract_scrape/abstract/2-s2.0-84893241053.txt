Highly porous metal oxide nanoflake arrays are important for developing high-performance electrochemical devices. Herein, mesoporous NiO nanoflake arrays have been successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal synthesis method. Except for the mesoporous walls, the NiO nanoflakes are interconnected with each other to form macroporous structure. This porous structured NiO nanoflake arrays possess a high specific surface area of ∼185 m2 g-1. The supercapacitor performance of the mesoporous NiO nanoflake arrays is fully characterized. The mesoporous NiO nanoflake arrays exhibit weaker polarization, higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than the common NiO nanoflake arrays. The mesoporous NiO nanoflake arrays deliver a specific capacitance of 400 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 339 F g-1 at 40 A g-1, respectively, higher than those of the common NiO nanoflake arrays (287 F g-1 at 2 A g-1 and 179 F g-1 at 40 A g-1). The enhanced performance is mainly due to the hierarchical pore system in the mesoporous NiO nanoflake arrays. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
