With prompt development of power electronics technology, increased penetration of renewable energy sources and microgrid concept is being widely considered. Further, to avail inertial provision and maintain frequency stability, virtual synchronous generator (VSG) implementation has been revolutionized from past few years. The VSG takes support of deadband droop controlled battery energy storage system (BESS) and supercapacitor (SC) for providing ancillary support in AC main grid (ACMG). It has been found out that BESS output current pre-maturely reduces to zero. As a result, discontinuous current output from BESS is observed. Hence, in order to ameliorate adverse effect of discontinuous current output from BESS, modification in deadband droop control of BESS is proposed in this article. Simulation studies on RSCAD-5.007.2 are performed to evaluate efficacy of proposed modification. Acquired results are promising, as continuous output current of BESS along with improved DC link voltage profile is obtained. Hence, improved performance while conducting further research on interconnected system is also ensured.
