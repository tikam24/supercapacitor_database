The super capacitor have become the focus in the electrochemical energy storage and successfully applied in many fields in real life, Such as: computer, timer, electric vehicles, military, aviation, new energy and other fields. In this paper use manganese dioxide and graphene composite electrode materials preparation, the first is use graphene oxide and potassium permanganate by hydrothermal method of manganese dioxide and graphene composite electrode materials. Next using the composite of manganese dioxide and graphene oxide to make an electrode sheet. Then constant current charge and discharge method and ac impedance method, such as the mass ratio of manganese dioxide was studied and the oxidation of the graphite energy storage performance.
