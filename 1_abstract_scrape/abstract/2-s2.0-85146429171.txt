The wettability of the electrode is critical to the performance of supercapacitor. In this work, a simple heat treatment strategy was applied to modify the electrochemical performance of TiO2 microsphere electrode. This heat treatment increases a large number of micropores and moderate mesopores while reducing the hydrophobic groups on the surface of TiO2, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the TiO2 microsphere electrode. After heat treatment, the areal capacitance of the TiO2 microsphere electrode increased from 4.95 to 58.58 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2, and the capacitance retention rate still retained 96.9% after 10,000 cycles. This simple heat treatment modification method provides considerable potential for the application of supercapacitors in the field of energy storage.
