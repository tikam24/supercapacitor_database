Single energy system can not give full play to its advantages and can not better meet the characteristics of large random load fluctuation in tractor operation. The energy system of hybrid tractor based on hydrogen fuel cell, power cell and supercapacitor in parallel is designed in this paper. For the system, a hierarchical decoupling control energy management strategy based on Haar wavelet and logical threshold rules was designed to realize the hierarchical decoupling of high frequency signal, sub-high frequency signal and steady state signal, and to distribute the power signal after decoupling. The model in loop simulation test was carried out, and the results showed that: Compared with the power following control strategy and fuzzy control strategy, the average efficiency of hydrogen fuel cell by the hierarchical decoupling control strategy established in this paper increases by 2.87% and 1.2% respectively in the experimental cycle. The vehicle equivalent hydrogen consumption decreased by 17.06% and 5.41%, respectively.
