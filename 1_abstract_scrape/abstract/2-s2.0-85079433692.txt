Nowadays considerable resources have been invested on low emission passenger vehicle both for private and public transportation. A feasible solution for urban buses is a full electrical traction system fed by supercapacitor, that can be recharged at each bus stop while people are getting on and off. Moreover, in order to consider the worst operating condition for the bus (like traffic jam of higher distance to be covered), a conventional battery is also installed, obtaining an hybrid energy storage system. An energy management function, able to manage the two on board energy storage system based on fuzzy control logic, has been developed and validated by means of numerical simulations and compared to a previously presented one in order to evaluate its performances.
