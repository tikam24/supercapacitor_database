CoS porous nanoflake was easily synthesized via a facile biomembrane support system at room temperature. Due to its unique structure and the character of the material itself, the obtained CoS nanomaterial as electrode shows a wonderful electrochemical performance, including high specific capacitance (366 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), excellent electrochemical stability (92% capacitance retention from 1 A g−1 up to 10 A g−1) and cycle stability (95% capacitance retention over 1300 cycles).
