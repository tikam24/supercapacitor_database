A simple and convenient one-step hydrothermal process for synthesizing nitrogen-doped graphene/p-aminophenol composite by using ethylenediamine, p-aminophenol, and graphene oxide is described. The p-aminophenol does not only act as a spacer to prevent the graphene sheets from aggregating and restacking during the hydrothermal process but also enhances the contribution of pseudocapacitance, which further improves the performance of the electrode materials. The field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and electrochemical workstation are used to characterize the materials. The as-produced composite material shows superior specific capacitance of 365.7 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and excellent electrochemical cycle stability.
