Electrochemical capacitors (ECs) are electrochemical devices that have reversible charge and discharge storage abilities. ECs consist of two electrodes and electrolyte sandwiched between the two electrodes. The electrolyte can be in the form of liquid, gel, or solid, whereby the liquid and solid polymer electrolytes have many disadvantages. Therefore, hydrogel electrolytes are ideal materials for flexible ECs. This study reports the poly (acrylamide) hydrogel, synthesized through free radical mechanism by mixing acrylamide, ammonium persulfate (APS), and clay. Acrylamide, APS, and clay were used as the monomer, initiator, and crosslinker, respectively. Then, sodium sulfate was added as a source of ions to prepare hydrogel electrolytes. Four different samples (SAM 1, SAM 2, SAM 3, and SAM 4) with different compositions of monomer and salt were developed. The structural and morphological studies were conducted using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was examined, and the study showed that SAM 4 with 40 wt% of sodium sulfate has the highest ionic conductivity (1.48 × 10–2 S cm−1) and the lowest activation energy (0.0582 eV) at room temperature. The electrochemical performance of fabricated supercapacitors has been examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanic charge–discharge (GCD) measurements. The results of CV and GCD reveal that AC/SAM 4/AC has a better performance with a maximum specific capacitance of 133.6 F/g and 165.7 F/g at 5 mV/s and 300 mA/g, respectively. The prepared poly (acrylamide) hydrogel electrolyte has promising features for intelligent electronic devices.
