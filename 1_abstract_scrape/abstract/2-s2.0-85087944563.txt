To tailor the product distribution and quality, this work proposes a strategy for fuel gas production and biochar upgrading by catalytic CO2 gasification using a pine sawdust (PS) char. Effects of the PS char gasification conditions (including reaction temperature, reaction time and the introduced nickel dosage) are investigated. The fuel gases are composed of CO2, CO, H2 and CH4, along with the combustion energy up to 4.27 MJ/kgPS-char. The introduced nickel catalyst plays a positive role on fuel gas production and the surface, morphological, textural and chemical properties of the gasified char through the reduction-oxidation cycle in the gasification course. When the gasified char serves as an electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors, the capacitance can be upgraded to 130.4 F/g at 5 A/g, which is 222.2% higher than that of the raw PS char.
