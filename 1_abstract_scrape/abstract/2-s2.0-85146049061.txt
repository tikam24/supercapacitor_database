The ubiquitous usage of metal oxide decorated reduced graphene oxide-based nanosheets in electrochemical energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors, has recently drawn much attention. Owing to this, rGO-wrapped needle-like zinc cobaltite was developed in the present study using a straightforward, inexpensive, and facile solvothermal approach, which was then subjected to an annealing procedure. To maintain a small distance for the ion diffusion process, stable structural integrity, and paths for percolating electron-conducting, ZnCo2O4 is wrapped in conducting rGO sheets in the ZnCo2O4@rGO nanocomposite. The hybrid composite electrode constructed of ZnCo2O4 @rGO exhibits a significant increase in specific surface area of 1830 Fgâˆ’1 and maximum specific capacity at 3 A/g. The workable design described in this research achieves an excellent synergy between the ZnCo2O4 and rGO, resulting in enhanced electrochemical performance.
