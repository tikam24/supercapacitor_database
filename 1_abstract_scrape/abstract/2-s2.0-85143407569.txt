Abstract: Mn2O3@Mn(Bi)OCl composite for supercapacitor were successfully synthesized via a facile solid-phase method using Bi(NO3)3 and MnCl2 with molar ratio of 2 : 1 as precursors. The Mn2O3@Mn(Bi)OCl composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area measurements, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge technique were performed for the Mn2O3@Mn(Bi)OCl mix-crystals in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions; the specific capacitance of Mn2O3@Mn(Bi)OCl was about 203 F g‒1 at the current density of 1 A g–1 with a long life time, owing to the high power density and the large surface area, good conductivity, and high stability of the of Mn2O3@Mn(Bi)OCl composite.
