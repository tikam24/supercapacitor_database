Hollow fusiform RuO2·xH2O nanostructures were prepared by using α-Fe2O3 nanospindles as a sacrificial template via a hydrothermal approach and have demonstrated good energy storage capability in pseudocapacitors with high-rate performance and excellent cycling stability. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
