Electrochemical capacitors are viable energy storage solution but their low energy density restricts their widespread deployment in many electronic devices. The motivation behind hybrid capacitor is the desire to improve the energy density output of electrochemical capacitors by combining electrodes capable of storing charges by surface adsorption with redox active electrodes. The overall performance output of the energy storage device are governed by the intrinsic characteristics of electrodes employed and their preparation techniques. In this paper, we discuss different hybrid capacitor devices employing binder-free electrodes based on electrostatic spray deposition or electrophoretic deposition techniques.
