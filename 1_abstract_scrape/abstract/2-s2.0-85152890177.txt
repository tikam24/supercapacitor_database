In this study, mixed nickel-cobalt oxalates with different composition ratios were successfully synthesized through a simple method. The research results show that the electrochemical efficiency of all mixed nickel-cobalt oxalate is significantly enhanced compared to pristine nickel oxalate, cobalt oxalate and depends on the molar ratio of Ni:Co. We found that, mixed nickel-cobalt oxalates synthesized in the Ni:Co molar ratio between 3:2 and 2:3 had the most outstanding electrochemical performance. Specifically, the NiCo-ox2/NiCo-ox3 samples deliver a specific capacitance of 2018.5/2088.1 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 (or 1219.6/1365.9 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1), ca. 200–600 % higher than that of nickel oxalate and cobalt oxalate. In addition, mixed nickel-cobalt oxalate also exhibits excellent cycling efficiency, retaining almost 82 % its initial capacitance after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Remarkable, the asymmetric supercapacitor (NiCo-ox2//AC-ASC) is made from NiCo-ox2 as the anode and active carbon as cathode delivered a maximum specific energy of 25.65 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 750 W kg−1, maintains 84.12 % specific capacitance after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. Therefore, this work provides an efficient solution to preparing high-performance materials for supercapacitor electrodes.
