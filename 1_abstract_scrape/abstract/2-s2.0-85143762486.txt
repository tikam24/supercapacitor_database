The supercapacitor is modeled so that series and parallel losses are taken into account, through the corresponding resistances, and the constitutive relationship of the capacitance itself is assumed to be fractional. The consequence of such a topological structure of the supercapacitor is a model in the form of a fractional differential equation from which the transfer function is further obtained. An expression for the voltage of the supercapacitor was derived, in the analytical form, which represents a response to a current excitation of an arbitrary shape, as well as an expression for the voltage during discharge of the supercapacitor through the external resistance. Analytical expressions for the voltage response of the supercapacitor during charging, as well as during relaxation, have been numerically confirmed.
