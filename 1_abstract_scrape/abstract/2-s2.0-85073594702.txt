Wearable supercapacitors (SCs) are gaining prominence as portable energy storage devices. To develop high-performance wearable SCs, the significant relationship among material, structure, and performance inspired us with a delicate design of the highly wearable embroidered supercapacitors made from the conductive fibers composited. By rendering the conductive interdigitally patterned embroidery as both the current collector and skeleton for the SCs, the novel pseudocapacitive material cobalt phosphides were then successfully electrodeposited, forming the first flexible and wearable in-plane embroidery SCs. The electrochemical measurements manifested that the highest specific capacitance was nearly 156.6 mF cm−2 (65.72 F g−1) at the current density of 0.6 mA cm−2 (0.25 A g−1), with a high energy density of 0.013 mWh cm−2 (5.55 Wh kg−1) at a power density of 0.24 mW cm−2 (100 W kg−1). As a demonstration, a monogrammed pattern was ingeniously designed and embroidered on the laboratory gown as the wearable in-plane SCs, which showed both decent electrochemical performance and excellent flexibility.[Figure not available: see fulltext.]
