CeO2 nanoparticles/graphene nanocomposite is fabricated by depositing CeO2 nanoparticles onto three-dimensional graphene material and its supercapacitor performance is further investigated. The nanocomposite shows a high specific capacitance and power density, demonstrating a strong synergistic effect possibly contributed from improved conductivity of CeO2 and better utilization of graphene.
