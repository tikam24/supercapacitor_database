Polyaniline (PANI) enfolded strontium titanate (STO) composites were fabricated by employing oxidative polymerization process and used as supercapacitor electrode materials. The influence of compositional variations on the electrochemical performance was scanned by varying STO to aniline ratio. Structural and functional characterization by X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirm the successful formation of the STO: PANI composites. Effective heterojunction formation with facilitated interfacial charge transfer was established by Electrochemical Impedance Spectra. A preliminary scanning of electrochemical performance via cyclic voltammetry and charge–discharge studies indicates its potential to be probed as a promising material for supercapacitor applications. For a 1:1 STO: aniline ratio, the composite (SP11) exhibited a specific capacitance 602 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 along with reasonable cyclic stability for over 1500 cycles when scanned at 9 A g−1.
