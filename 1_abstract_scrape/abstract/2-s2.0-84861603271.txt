A method has been developed for synthesizing high-surface-area carbon nanoparticle/graphene composites. Functionalized carbon nanoparticles were anchored to the graphene planes and function as spacers to prevent the restacking of graphene sheets during drying. The composite has a layered structure in which functionalized carbon nanoparticles are sandwiched between graphene stacks. This layering leads to a porous structure with a specific surface area as high as 1256 m 2/g. Such a structure provides easy access to both sides of the graphene for either gas or liquid species and allows their fast transfer. A specific capacitance as high as 324.6 F/g at a current density of 0.3 A/g was achieved using the composites in a supercapacitor. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
