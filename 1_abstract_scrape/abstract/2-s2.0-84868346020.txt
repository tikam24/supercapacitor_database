Highly uniform core-shell structured polyaniline-multiwall carbon nanotube nanocomposites have been successfully prepared by noncovalent coating of a polyaniline shell on the wall of MWNTs with the assistance of 1-pyrenesulfonic acid. It is found that 1-pyrenesulfonic acid plays important roles in dispersing MWNTs and directing the polymerization of the polyaniline shell by the sulfonic groups. The obtained nanocomposites exhibit a higher specific capacitance. This research provides a new approach for designing core-shell hybrid materials with potential application in high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.
