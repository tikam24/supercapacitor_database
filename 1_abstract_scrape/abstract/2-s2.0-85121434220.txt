Herein, α-NixCo(1−x)(OH)2 has been synthesized through etching ZIF-67. This work demonstrates that reaction temperature affects the morphology and composition of α-NixCo(1−x)(OH)2. Hydroxide nanocluster forms at lower reaction temperature, and hydroxide hollow nanocage can be obtained at or exceeding 100 °C. And the synthesis mechanism of α-NixCo(1−x)(OH)2 is speculated. The obtained hydroxide shows outstanding electrochemical performance. For example, the α-NixCo(1−x)(OH)2 obtained at 120 °C delivers high specific capacitance with 2329.2 and 1795.6 F g−1 at 1 and 20 A g−1, respectively. Furthermore, the versatile and simple synthesis strategy allows the recycling of organic ligand.
