Energy management is required to enable autonomous photovoltaic-powered membrane (PV-membrane) desalination systems to make the optimal use of solar energy. In this paper, a novel charge controller based on pre-set voltage sensing thresholds was designed to optimise the energy from PV panels and supercapacitors (SCs). The control algorithms were established from the data derivations with high-temporal-resolution (1s) solar irradiance (SI) source, allowing for resilient system operation under variable conditions. The impacts of ramp rates, in both SI and PV output voltage (VPV) on the system, were systematically investigated. Under a worst-case scenario, with a rapid ramp rate of Î”VPV = 2 V/s, the charge controller enabled the SCs to bridge the power gap to 6 min 20 s, permitting an additional 10 L of permeate water produced. The state-of-charge of the SCs varied from 11 to 86%, regardless of the magnitude of the ramp rate. The combination of the voltage thresholds (Vpump_on = 160 V and Vpump_off = 90 V) was determined to result in optimum system performance, realising a high permeate production at low specific energy consumption. It is concluded that the proposed charge controller is an effective method to enhance system resilience under worst-case solar conditions.
