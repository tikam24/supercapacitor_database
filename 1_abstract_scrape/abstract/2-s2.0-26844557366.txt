A circuit that gradually builds up energy in a supercapacitor is developed to eliminate the need for larger batteries. Because of the supercapacitor's property of low internal impedance, the momentary current can easily increase several amperes. The circuit uses a voltage-controlled switch to cut off the battery once the voltage on the supercapacitor reaches 2.2V. When the voltage is lower than 1.7V, the comparator's output is low and thus turns on the p-channel MOSFET Q 1. The comparator switches high to shut off Q 1, once the voltage on the supercapacitor reaches 2.2V.
