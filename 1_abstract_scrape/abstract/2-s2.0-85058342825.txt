Activated carbon (AC) is composed of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and has been synthesized from natural material that is coconut shell (Cocos nucifera) by dry mixing method. The purpose of this research was to know the effect of adding rGO mass on the electrode to the specific capacitance value. The rGO mass variation used was 10-25 wt%. AC/rGO electrodes were tested by cyclic voltammetry to determine their specific capacitance values at a scan rate of 100 mV/s with Sodium Sulphate (Na2SO4) 1 M in the electrolyte solution and a potential range at 0-1 Volt. The electrode by 90 wt% AC composition and 10 wt% rGO had a higher specific capacitance value of 6.26 Fg -1 than other electrode mass compositions, as well as the activated carbon individual electrodes having a specific capacitance value of 3.38 Fg -1 . Therefore, it could be concluded that the specific capacitance of the electrodes could be increased by the addition of rGO material.
