In present work, MnO2/polyaniline (PANI) composite is irradiated with high-energy electrons for modifying the supercapacitor application. The electron beam having an energy of 5 MeV is used to irradiate MnO2/polyaniline composite thin films with doses of 10 kGy, 20 kGy, and 30 kGy. After irradiation, structural, morphological, electrochemical, and supercapacitor properties with concern to different electron doses were investigated. The electron having energy dose 20 kGy shows the improved properties of MnO2/PANI composite. The high-energy electron irradiation creates defect in materials, resultant change morphology, as well as its properties. So, here in the porous MnO2/PANI nanostructures are developed using high-energy electron irradiation. The MnO/PANI irradiated at 20 KGy shows the improved specific capacitance with 840 F/g with cyclic stability of 89.2%. After the electron irradiation, specific capacitance and stability are found to increase.
