Carbon composite materials with diverse structures show enhanced electrochemical performance as electrodes in energy storage devices than single component structures. Herein, rich mesoporous carbon nanosheets embedded with vesicle structures (CS-v) were prepared by a simple synergetic assembly strategy using 1-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C18Mim]Br) as the surfactant, phenolic resin as the carbon precursor, silica precursor as an additive and iron(iii) nitrate as the catalytic active center. [C18Mim]Br played an important role in the formation of flake morphology and nitrogen doping. The silica created a rich mesoporous structure on the CS-v, which improved the surface area. The addition of iron(iii) nitrate not only creates vesicle structures but also leads to thinner sheets for CS-v, which accelerates the transfer and storage of charge, and improves the electrochemical performance. When used as the electrode in a supercapacitor, CS-v showed a high specific capacity of 341 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1 in a three-electrode system, which is more than ca. 2.5 times enhancement compared with that of pure mesoporous carbon nanosheets, and an excellent long cycling ability with 99.5% of the initial capacity was retained after 10 000 cyclic tests, demonstrating its potential in energy storage devices.
