Manganese oxide was electrochemically synthesized from spent zinc–manganese oxide alkaline batteries. The recycled MnO2 was then used as electrochemical pseudocapacitors. According to Raman spectroscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and XPS analysis primarily α-MnO2 films were grown at 25 °C and 80 °C, under galvanostatic conditions (i = 10 mAcm−2) and at a charge density of 1.0 Ccm−2. A charge efficiency of 88.0% was obtained in the anodic electrodeposition of MnO2 at 25 °C and 80 °C. The effect of temperature on the anodic electrodeposition and the film capacitance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The α-MnO2 film grown at 80 °C exhibited a porous surface, and higher specific capacitance of 367.30 F g−1 at 1.0 mV−1 and 386.30 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1. The α-MnO2 film grown at 25 °C showed a specific capacitance of 66.80 F g−1 at 1.0 mV−1 and 127.06 F g−1 at 1.25 A g−1.
