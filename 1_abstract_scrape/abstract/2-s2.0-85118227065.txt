To solve the problem of battery capacity degradation caused by high current magnitudes and frequent current variations in electric vehicles (EVs), a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) incorporating high energy density storage (battery) and high power density storage (ultracapacitor) is proposed. The HESS contains a multi-port DC-DC converter, which controls the energy flow among the battery pack, the ultracapacitor (UC) pack, and the port of output. Considering the state of charge (SOC) of UC, the speed, and demand power of EV, an energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic control (FLC) for the HESS is proposed in this paper. According to the strategy, the battery pack serves as a base power source while the UC pack serves as a transient power source so as to smooth the battery pack current and prolong the battery life. Simulation and experiment results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for UC/battery HESS in EVs. Â© 2021 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.
