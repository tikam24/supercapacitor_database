Transition metal phosphides have received considerable interest for electrochemical energy storage/conversion and catalysis. In this work, we designed a unique hybrid of NiCoP nanoparticles adhered on quasi-planar structured graphene by assembling 8.5 nm ternary NiCoP nanoparticles on graphene through a solution-phase self-assembly strategy. The NiCoP catalyst in the form of small-size particles wrapped in graphene provided more active sites, a buffer for volume alteration and enhanced conductivity for electrochemical reactions. Typically, the hybrid catalyst demonstrates a high specific capacity of around 532 mA h g-1, excellent cycling stability and superior rate performance when the hybrid material is evaluated as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, and it shows excellent electrochemical properties with a specific capacitance of 646 F g-1 at 4 A g-1, maintaining 91% of this initial value after 2000 cycles functioning as a supercapacitor.
