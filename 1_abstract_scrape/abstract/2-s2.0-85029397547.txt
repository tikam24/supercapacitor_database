Sheet-like Co(OH)2/Al(OH)3 or Co(OH)2 nanomaterial has been synthesized on conducting carbon fiber paper (CFP) by a facile one-step electrochemical deposition. The binder-free Co(OH)2/Al(OH)3/CFP displays an improved electrical conductivity, electrochemical activity and material utilization than solitary Co(OH)2, therefore Co(OH)2/Al(OH)3 nanomaterial exhibits improved electrochemical properties (a maximum capacitance of 1006 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1, with 77% retention even at a high current density of 32 Ag−1, and more than 87% of the capacitance retention after 10000 cycles at 32 Ag−1) in comparison to that of the Co(OH)2/CFP (709 Fg−1, 65%, 79%). In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) fabricated with Co(OH)2/Al(OH)3/CFP positive electrode and AC/CFP negative electrode demonstrates ultrahigh specific capacitance (75.8 Fg−1) and potential window (1.7 V). These encouraging results make these low-cost and eco-friendly materials promising for high-performance energy storage application.
