NiO has been praised for its great chemical stability and extraordinary redox properties, making it fascinating electrode material for supercapacitor applications. In order to boost their specific capacity, specially designed Mo-doped NiO nanoparticles were synthesized in this work, using a co-precipitation approach, and an assisted calcination process. Pure and Mo-doped NiO nanostructures crystallized into face-centered cubic crystal, matching JCPDS card number 73–1523. Specific capacitance increased as a consequence of smaller crystallite and grain sizes. Mo-doped NiO nanostructure with smaller grain size showed enhanced magnetization, which was explained by the presence of the bulk number of spins near the grain boundaries. Galvanostatic charge–discharge and cyclic voltammetry were used to assess the nanostructures electrochemical performance. The as-synthesized Mo-doped NiO nanostructures with superior energy density of 29 Whkg−1, prolonged discharging time, and substantial specific capacity of 1147 Fg−1 make them promising candidates for supercapacitors.
