Boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene (BCN graphene) was prepared through a simple thermal annealing approach in the presence of a single compound, melamine diborate. The as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Raman spectra and electrochemical techniques. The BCN graphene shows significantly enhanced specific capacitance due to boron and nitrogen codoping, which permits higher overall doping levels.
