In order to solve the power fluctuation and power balance problem in the AC / DC hybrid microgrid, a control strategy is proposed to dynamically adjust the output power of the bidirectional AC/DC converter connected to the AC and DC microgrid by detecting the DC voltage and the AC voltage frequency. The established method can be applied to different line impedances of AC power and load interconnections. In the hybrid energy storage, the droop control is used to automatically adjust the output power of the battery, and the supercapacitor quickly provides the high frequency component of the load power to reduce the impact caused by the load mutation on the battery and the bus voltage. Finally, a hybrid microgrid simulation model is built by using Matlab/Simulink. The simulation results show that the distributed control strategy can control the stable operation and voltage stability of the hybrid microgrid.
