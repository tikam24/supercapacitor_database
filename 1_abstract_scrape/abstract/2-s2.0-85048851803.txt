Nowadays, non-integer systems are a widely researched problem. One of the questions that is of great importance, is the use of mathematical theory of a non-integer order system to the description of supercapacitors (capacitors with very high capacitance). In the description of electronic systems built on a microscale, there are models with distributed parameters of fractional derivatives, which can be successfully approximated by finite-dimensional structures, e.g, in the form of various types of ladder systems (chain). In this paper, we will analyze a ladder system of an RC type consisting of supercapacitors.
