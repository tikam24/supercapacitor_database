Effects of the different current density on morphology and adhesion of RuO2·nH2O films were investigated by galvanostatic deposition. The mechanism of electrodeposition of hydrous ruthenium oxide was discussed. We can observe some morphological changes as the samples under SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope ).When different current density are applied but the capacitance appears to be sensitive to this variable. Elements of films were analyzed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscope (EDS); Phases of films were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction meter(XRD); Zeta potential of colloid solution was analyzed by DELSA 440SX Analyzer. It can be concluded that the thickness of RuO2·nH2O films on tantalum substrate would increased with the cathodic current density, but the trend of the crack of RuO2·nH2O films proportional to the cathodic current density after they were dried in atmosphere, when cathodic current density up to 10mA/cm2, RuO2·nH2O film flaked away from the tantalum substrate, adhesion of RuO2· nH2O film was very poor and hydrous ruthenium oxide easily drop from tantalum substrate.
