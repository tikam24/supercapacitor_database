The creation of efficient energy storage technology is becoming an ever more urgent requirement in the modern world. The creation of innovative energy storage technologies is one of the most critical steps that must be taken in order to build a sustainable energy infrastructure. It is very necessary to take into consideration the factors that affect the energy density in addition to the rate at which it is stored in order to achieve the highest possible level of performance. The development of new applications for energy storage is an ongoing demand that must be supplied by the introduction of new energy storage technology. This need has to be satisfied in order to keep up with the current trend of the development of new applications for energy storage. It is possible to store energy using energy storage technologies such as batteries and supercapacitors, which are among the most technologically advanced solutions currently available in the field of energy storage, but which are also among the most expensive solutions currently available. Although it is possible to store energy using these technologies, doing so is not recommended due to the high cost of these solutions. Energy storage technologies include the likes of batteries and supercapacitors, amongst others. In this article, we will focus on a few graphene aerogels-based materials that have been effectively utilized in supercapacitors and batteries.
