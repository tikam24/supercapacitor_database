In this work, an electrochemical approach to synthesize Metal-MetalOxide/Hydroxide core-shell nanowires electrodes (NWE) is illustrated. NWE electrodes were obtained by electrodeposition of a targeted metal into the nanopores of nanoporous alumina templates generated by one-step anodization of aluminum. Following metal electrodeposition, the alumina template was selectively etched to obtain an array of free-standing metal nanowires. The imposed electrodeposition conditions allowed directly attaining a core-shell nanostructure, with a metal core covered by a thin metal oxide/hydroxide film. NWE electrodes produced by the proposed synthesis route were tested for the application as electrodes in lithium batteries and supercapacitors. To this purpose, an array of cobalt nanowires (CoNWs) supported by a nanostructured copper current collector was produced by sequential electrodeposition of cobalt and copper, and it was employed as anode in a lithium battery, while a NWE based on Ni-NiO/OH2 (NiNWs) was obtained by nickel electrodeposition and tested as electrode in a supercapacitor. A thorough analysis and characterization of the produced electrodes were performed. The experiments with the lithium cell evidenced the positive effect of metallic core on stability, while the electrochemical characterization of the supercapacitor showed the presence of both NiO and NiOH2 leading, when cycled, to a capacity close to the best literature value.
