Recent applications of supercapacitors in modern society are limited due to their poor electrochemical properties like energy density and cyclic stability, etc. One of the effective approaches to boost the electrochemical performance is to couple the metal oxide with metal and carbon nanostructures. In this study, hybrid ternary nanocomposite, comprised of palladium, activated carbon, and nickel oxide nanoparticles (Pd-AC@NiO), has been synthesized through a simple approach. Here, metal-carbon material plays a significant role in augmenting the specific surface area, while the existence of NiO nanoparticles provides the electroactive sites for energy storage. Consequently, the as-prepared Pd-AC@NiO nanocomposite provides excellent electrochemical performance compared to the as-prepared NiO nanoparticles as an electroactive material. When the hybrid ternary nanocomposite is used as an electroactive material for supercapacitor, it displays an outstanding specific capacitance of 1539 F/g at a current density of 5 A/g in a three-electrode system. Moreover, in terms of energy and power, the as-prepared hybrid ternary nanocomposite electrode demonstrates a high energy density of 34.19 Wh/kg and power density of 1000 W/kg. Additionally, the resulting hybrid ternary nanocomposite electrode shows excellent cycling stability with the capacity retention of 95.5% after 5000 cycles. Thus, these outcomes suggest that the proposed composite material has tremendous electrochemical properties. It deliberated as a promising electrode for the development of energy storage devices with high energy and power densities.
