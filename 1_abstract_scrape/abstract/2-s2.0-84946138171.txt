Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. The formation of the Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets was explained via splitting, exfoliation and self-aggregation mechanisms. FESEM revealed the nanoplatelet morphology with a thickness of 27.9 nm. HRTEM imaging confirmed the crystalline nature of the Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets, and the SAED pattern clearly indicated that the prepared sample was Zn3V2O8. The prepared Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets were further studied for their potential application in Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The discharge capacity in the second cycle was 558 mA h g-1 at 100 mA g-1. The Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 302 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. Furthermore, a Zn3V2O8 electrode retained about 98% of its initial specific capacitance after 2000 cycles. The described Zn3V2O8 nanoplatelets were found to be a highly suitable electrode material for energy storage applications.
