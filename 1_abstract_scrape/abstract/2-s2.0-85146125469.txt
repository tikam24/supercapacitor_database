Energy storage is one of the most stimulating requirements to keep civilization on the wheel of progress. Supercapacitors generally exhibit a high-power density, have a maximum life cycle, quick charging time, and are eco-friendly. Polyaniline (PANI), a conductive polymer, is considered an efficacious electrode material for supercapacitors due to its good electroactivity, including pseudocapacitive behavior. Here, we present the fabrication of a symmetric supercapacitor device based on steel mesh electrodeposited with PANI. Due to its effective conductivity, porous nature, and low cost, steel mesh is a good choice as a current collector to fabricate a high-performance supercapacitor at a low cost. The optimum fabricated supercapacitor has a high specific capacitance of ∼353 mF cm−2. Furthermore, the supercapacitor obtained an energy density of ∼26.4 μW h cm−2 at a power density of ∼400 μW cm−2. The fabricated supercapacitor shows high stability, as the initial capacitance remained almost the same after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. PANI is a promising candidate for mass production and wide applications due to its low cost and high performance.
