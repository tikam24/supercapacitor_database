Morphology control of metal-organic frameworks plays a vital role in enhancing electrochemical performances. Here, we report a solvent-mediated synthetic route for preparing cerium hexacyanocobaltate (Ce-Co PBA) with a dendritic shape at room temperature. The structural evolution of Ce-Co PBA is further explored. The hollow dendritic Co3O4/CeO2is preparedviaannealing of dendritic cerium hexacyanocobaltate at 500 Â°C, and is utilized as a supercapacitor electrode to explore the morphology-capacitance relationships in supercapacitors.
