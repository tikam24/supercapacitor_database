Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) plays an important role in microgrid operation in terms of power quality enhancement, regulation of voltage and frequency, regularizing the intermittency of the Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and maintaining a balance between generation and demand. Among all ESSs, Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is found to be more promising. However, BESS alone cannot fulfil the desire of robustness, active response, life cycle and potential of the system due to its power delivering limitations. So, the integration of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESSs) is an emerging solution to the above issues. Basically, battery and Ultracapacitor (UC) based energy storage systems (UCESS) have compatible performances which makes them appealing in forming a HESS. As a result, the energy supplying capability of battery and storage capacity of UC is improvised. This paper attempts to bring out the advantages of the HESS as well as proposes a novel and robust Competitive Optimization Algorithm (COA) tuned PID based control strategy for improved power efficiency and for enhancing the life span of the battery. Further, the system configuration considered for study with the proposed controller is developed in the Matlab/Simulink environment and is led to variation in load. The results are indicative of the fact that an efficient control strategy is developed using the HESS. In addition to this, the THD calculation is done through FFT analysis to justify the enhancement in system stability through the control technique proposed.
