The development of high volumetric or areal capacitance energy storage devices is critical for the future electronic devices. Hence, the hunting for next-generation electrode materials and their design is of current interest. The recent work in the two-dimensional metal hydroxide nanomaterials demonstrates its ability as a promising candidate for supercapacitor due to its unique structure and additional redox sites. This study reports a design of freestanding high-mass-loaded copper-cobalt hydroxide interconnected nanosheets for high-volumetric/areal-performance electrode. The unique combination of hydroxide electrode with high mass loading (26 mg/cm2) exhibits high areal and volumetric capacitance of 20.86 F/cm2 (1032 F/cm3) at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. This attributes to the direct growth of hydroxides on porous foam and conductivity of copper, which benefits the electron transport. The asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits a high energy density of 21.9 mWh/cm3, with superior capacitance retention of 96.55% over 3500 cycles.
