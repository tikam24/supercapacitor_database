In this study, a fluorescent material, 2-naphthyl-4-amino benzoate, is synthesized by the esterification of 4-aminobenzoic acid with 2-naphthol. This molecule is used in the bulk polymerization of aniline, which results in the formation of poly(aniline-2-naphthyl-4-aminobenzoate). For comparison, polyaniline and also poly(aniline-4-aminobenzoic acid) salts are prepared via bulk polymerization. Formation and properties of these polymeric materials are evaluated by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, UV-Vis, Fluorescence, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis, electrical resistance and electrochemical techniques. P(ANI-2NA4ABA) is obtained in nanofiber morphology in 106 wt% yield with respect to the amount of aniline used with comparable conductivity of conventional polyaniline salts. This polymer salt is stable up to 220°C and indicates melting at 146°C on heating and crystal formation at 128°C on cooling. This polymer shows higher wavelength fluorescence compared to the conventional polyaniline salts. This polymer is used as an electrode material without binder, which shows a specific capacitance of 360 F g−1 at 0.25 A g−1.
