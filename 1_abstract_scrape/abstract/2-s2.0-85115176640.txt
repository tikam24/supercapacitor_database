This hybrid model, developed in Simscape, is to maximize the use of electric vehicles where each component of an HEV is developed keeping in mind the basic principle of approach in a commutable trend, authenticated by available experimental data. To achieve it, a hybrid energy storage system is used, which will increase the efficiency of regenerative braking to convert the heat energy lost in braking to electric energy. Battery with supercapacitors stores this energy and provides it to the motor during acceleration thereby increasing the efficiency of battery and also the life of vehicle. Simulations with several drive cycles are used to observe the vehicle behavior under different conditions. The result indicates the authenticity of the model for realistic prediction of the vehicleâ€™s efficiency as well as the battery life.
