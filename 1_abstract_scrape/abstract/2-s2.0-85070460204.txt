Electrospun Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) membrane is fabricated as a separator for supercapacitor applications. Different weight percentages (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 wt%) of PVdF were suspended in 50:50 wt% of THF and DMAc solvents, respectively, and electrospinning technique was used to synthesize the polymer separator membranes. The structural morphology was investigated using SEM analysis and thermal stability of the synthesized membranes were determined using TGA and DSC analysis to identify the optimum wt% of PVdF membrane with high porosity, high electrolytic uptake, and lower crystallinity, respectively. It was found that PVdF membrane with 20 wt% exhibited superior properties of lower fiber diameter of about 400 ± 8 nm, high electrolytic uptake of 200 ± 2%, and high porosity of 86.83 ± 2% compared to other synthesized membranes. Further, 20 wt% PVdF membrane was found to be thermally stable up to a temperature of about 450°C. The crystalline nature of the separator membranes were determined using the X-ray diffraction technique. Electrochemical studies (Liner sweep voltammetry) studies revealed that the synthesized PVdF membrane is stable up to 2.5 V. Thus, it was found that PVdF polymer membrane with 20 wt% exhibited superior structural and thermal properties compared to other membranes, making it as a reliable separator membrane for supercapacitors.
