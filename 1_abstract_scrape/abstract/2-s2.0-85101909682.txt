Vanadyl hydroxide (VOOH) nanosheets have been synthesized for the first time using commercial vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) as vanadium source by a facile one-step hydrothermal reaction. The morphology and crystal structure of VOOH can be controlled simply by adjusting the ratio of ethylene glycol (EG) to deionized water (H2O) in the hydrothermal reaction. The electrochemical performance of the VOOH nanosheets as electrode material for supercapacitors was investigated in 1 mol L−1 LiClO4/propylene carbonate, and it was found that the highest specific capacitance of the VOOH nanosheets is 323 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 due to their higher specific surface area and electrochemical activity, which is 3 times large than that of VOOH nanoparticles and the reported VOOH hollow spheres. Meanwhile, the VOOH nanosheets also show a good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 70% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g−1. This work demonstrates that the VOOH nanosheets, as a new member of two-dimensional materials family, not only can be simply synthesized by hydrothermal method, but also show an excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications.
