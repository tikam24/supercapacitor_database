Supercapacitors or Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors, briefly named EDLC, are very promising energy storage components. The need for higher rated voltages of capacitors or for the higher capacitance makes necessary the construction of capacitive modules (CM) using series connection or parallel connection. Such modules can be used in large temperature range. The temperature has a very important role in influencing the supercapacitors charge/discharge mode and its electrical parameters change during operation [1]. In order to verify the performances of the CMs and to identify the influence of interconnection solution of the modules, the paper targets to compare the capacitance values for individual capacitors with those obtained by serial or parallel connection for the same components. The measurements are realized at different temperature values.
