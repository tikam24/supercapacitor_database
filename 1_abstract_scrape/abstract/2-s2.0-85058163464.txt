Hybrid structured semiconductor nanomaterials possess excellent electrochemical performances owing to the synergistic effects from two components. Herein we report a novel CoMo2S4@Zn-Co-S core-shell structure as the electrode materials for asymmetric supercapacitor. The unique electrode structure is beneficial to rapid electron transport and the ion diffusion due to the existence of many vast channels. The as-synthesized core-shell structured electrode exhibits an overall improved electrochemical performance. Moreover, a quasi-solid state asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated. It reveals a specific capacitance of 0.84 C/cm2 collected at 4 mA/cm2 and an energy density of 1.87 mWh/cm3 at a power density of 31.99 W/cm3.
