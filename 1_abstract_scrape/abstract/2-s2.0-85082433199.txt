A highly efficient and effective nanostructured vanadium oxide (V2O5) compound was synthesized for supercapacitor applications. A facile two-step method comprising preheating activation, followed by a hydrothermal route was utilized to synthesize V2O5 nanorods. As an electrode, the V2O5 nanorods exhibited a high specific capacitance of 347 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The remarkable cyclic stability of the V2O5 compound indicates adequate potential for the fabrication of a symmetric supercapacitor device. A coin-cell symmetric supercapacitor device assembled using the V2O5 electrode exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, including a specific capacitance of 172 F g−1, an energy density of 23.9 W h kg−1, a power density of 937 W kg−1, and capacitance retention of 94.3% after 10,000 cycles.
