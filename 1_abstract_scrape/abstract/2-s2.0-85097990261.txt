Current desalination technologies present certain limitations associated with brine management. CDI operational conditions similar to EDL capacitors might become a solution for brine volume reduction. Innovative operating procedure utilizes a concentrated brine stream as a washing solution during the salt desorption phase. A high energy efficiency in the adsorptionâ€“desorption cycle was obtained using the electrolyte replacement procedure. A coupled RO-CDI system integration was proposed as a method to reduce the volumetric flow of brine.
