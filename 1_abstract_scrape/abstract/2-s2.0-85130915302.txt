Flexible supercapacitors (SCs) have the advantages of high flexibility, high mechanical strength, easy assembly, and high power density, so SCs can be widely used in portable and wearable electronic devices. It is of great significance to research and develop high-performance electrode materials in order to further improve the performance of SCs and expand their application fields. Here, we prepared a free-standing flexible g-C3N4/Ti3C2 hybrid film as electrode material for SCs by inserting two-dimensional g-C3N4 nanosheets between Ti3C2 layers-based vacuum suction filtration methods. The addition of g-C3N4 nanosheets effectively prevented the self-stacking of MXene layers, significantly increasing the interlayer spacing of g-C3N4/Ti3C2 hybrid film. The electrochemical results show that the mass specific capacity of 10 wt% g-C3N4/Ti3C2 is as high as 552 F g−1 at the scanning rate of 2 mV s−1, which is 3.29 times higher than 168 F g−1 of Ti3C2, the capacity retention rate of 10 wt% g-C3N4/Ti3C2 is 97% after 104 cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1.
