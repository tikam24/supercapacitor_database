The exhaustion of petroleum fuels day-by-day imposes the use of renewable energy sources in the transportation sector. The wind and solar generations are the well-established technologies in the field of renewable generation. Nevertheless, these sources suffer from the sporadic nature of electricity generation. Therefore, wind-solar sources are assisted by the energy storage systems (ESS) (i.e., battery and supercapacitor bank). In recent years, thebrushless DC (BLDC) motor became popular in the transport applications due to its reliable and efficient behaviour. To achieve the best-operating conditionsandgood efficiency in the DC microgrid, the high gain converters are used in this paper. Also, a power management algorithm is implemented to manage the proper power sharing among the DC microgrid partakers. Finally, Hardware-in-Loop validation of the proposedpower management control will be carried out using Virtex-7 FPGA kit co-simulated using Xilinx system generator.
