Recently, corrugated nanostructures have been intensely attractive among researchers due to their high electrical conductance, fast charge-discharge capability, and modest energy densities. Hence, it can be used in the design of nano supercapacitors with practical applications in defense technology. In this article, wave propagation and vibration of a nano supercapacitor are studied based on mathematical modeling. The nano supercapacitor is made from corrugated graphene (CG) layer covered by nano piezoelectric face sheets for smart control of the structure. Size effects are considered based on the novel theory of two-phase local/nonlocal elasticity. Surface stresses are taken into account based on Gurtin-Murdoch theory and the nanostructure is located on Kerr viscoelastic foundation which includes two springs, two dampers, and one shear element. For modeling the structure mathematically, refined zigzag theory (RZT) is used. According to Hamilton's principle, the governing equations are gained. The final equations are solved by the exact solution of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for obtaining the phase velocity, cut-off and escape frequencies. In this novel work, influences of nonlocal parameter and local phase fraction factor, core and face sheets thickness, surface stress, residual stress, and external voltage are investigated on the wave propagation and vibration of the nano supercapacitor. Numerical results show that by using the piezoelectric layers and applying a negative external voltage, the frequency and wave propagation of the nanostructure can be reduced.
