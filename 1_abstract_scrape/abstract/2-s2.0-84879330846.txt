Via the green chemistry route, Mn3O4/amorphous carbon nanoparticles have been synthesized. Dextrose was used as the reducing agent, and starch was used as the capping agent. The X-ray diffraction patterns reveal the Hausmannite tetragonal structure of the synthesized Mn3O 4 particles. EDAX analysis confirms the presence of carbon and stoichiometry of Mn3O4. Morphological studies reveal the nanospherical nature of the synthesized particles. The FTIR spectra confirm the presence of Mn-O bonds. Mn3O4/AC 500 exhibits highest specific capacitance of 522 F g-1 at a specific current of 1 A g -1, when measured from the charge-discharge process. This value is superior to previous reports on Mn3O4 nanoparticles as an electrode for supercapacitors. Higher energy density of 58.72 W h kg -1 could be observed for Mn3O4/AC 500, which is higher than lead acid batteries and comparable to those for the nickel hydride batteries. These results indicate that Mn3O4/AC 500 is a promising electrode for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2013 American Chemical Society.
