This research work presents the Pt functionalized ZrN and TiN nanostructured composite thin film sheet-electrodes synthesized on SS-304 flexible current collector via in-situ co-sputtering technique. Incorporation of small amount of Pt in nanostructured electrodes vastly improves the electrical conductivity, capacitive performance, and electrochemical stability of the electrodes. These improved performances of the electrodes enhance the efficiency of the contrived flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (Pt-ZrN//Pt-TiN FASC). To achieve superlative performance, these electrodes are alternately stacked in an asymmetric configuration separated by filter paper (glass microfiber GF/C) soaked in 1 M KOH aqueous solution. The series stacking helps in widening the working voltage window and enhancing the specific energy. The alternate stacking (Pt-ZrN//Pt-TiN//Pt-ZrN) of FASC works on a wide range of voltage from 0 V to 3.2 V and offers high specific-capacitance (60.2 F/g) with higher specific energy (85 Wh/kg). The fabricated cell also displays good capacitance retention of 76.8 % for a large number of charging cycles (40,000). SS-based sheet type FASC can be used as a body panel of any electronic device to provide vital protection and energy storage system. These astonishing outcomes with ideal bending performance of the FASC promise a potential candidate of energy storage for futuristic flexible electronic devices.
