To increase the operating temperature of the supercapacitors (SCs) without compromising their high cycle-life, several typical fluoro- and non-fluoro containing ionic liquids (EMI-mesylate, EMI-hydrogen sulfate, PP13-triflate, PP13-TFSI, and EMI-TFSI, as shown in Fig. 1) are studied as the electrolytes to prepare organic solutions for SC performance measurements using a two-electrode cell. Both cyclic voltammograms and charge/discharge curves at various temperatures such as 20, 40, 60 and 80 °C are collected. At 60 °C, the increased performance order in both rating and cyclability measurements are found to be as follows: 1) EMI-hydrogen sulfate < PP13-TFSI < EMI-mesylate < PP13-triflate < EMI-TFSI for rating; and 2) EMI-hydrogen sulfate < EMI-mesylate < PP13-Triflate < PP13-TFSI < EMI-TFSI for life-time. The fluoro-containing group of ILs, i.e., PP13-Triflate, PP13-TFSI and EMI-TFSI can give a specific capacitance between 100 and 170 F/g for various scan rates for a conventional carbon electrode, and an extended lifetime test of 10, 000 cycles with a capacitance degradation of less than 10%, indicating that these two ion liquids can be used for SC electrolytes operated at high temperature.
