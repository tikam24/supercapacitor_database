The two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheet-carbon composite is an attractive material for energy storage because of its high Faradaic activity, unique nanoconstruction and electronic properties. In this work, a facile one step preparation of a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet-graphene (MoS2/G) composite with the in situ reduction of graphene oxide is reported. The structure, morphology and composition of the pure MoS2 and composites were comparatively analyzed by various characterization techniques. The electrochemical performance of the pure MoS2, graphene oxide and the MoS2/G composite electrode materials was evaluated by cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The MoS2/G composite showed a higher specific capacitance (270 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1) compared to the pure MoS2 (162 F g-1) in a neutral aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the energy density of the composite electrode is also higher (12.5 Wh kg-1) with a high power density (2500 W kg-1) compared to the pure MoS2. In addition, the MoS2/G composite electrode showed excellent cyclic stability even after 1000 cycles. The enhancement in specific capacitance, excellent cyclic stability and high energy density of the composite electrode are mainly due to the interconnected conductive network of the composite as well as the synergetic effect of the pure MoS2 and graphene. The experimental results demonstrated that the MoS2/G composite is a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
