Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials in the form of bulk powders with attractive chemical and structural properties show broad application in electrochemical energy storage. Bimetallic materials-based MOFs usually show better electrochemical properties than that of monometallic derivatives, while achieving the bimetallic MOFs-derived materials on current collector as a binder-free electrode is still a challenge. Here we report a new approach to directly obtain a binder-free electrode of bimetallic MOFs-derived NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF) substrate. The porous NiCo2S4 nanosheet arrays providing fast electrolyte permeation and rich electrochemical active sites, show an excellent specific capacity of 1354.4 C g−1, high rate performance, and outstanding cycling stability of 82.6% retention after 10,000 cycles. A hybrid supercapacitor assembled with the as-obtained binder-free electrode as a cathode and active carbon as an anode, exhibits high energy density of 49.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 375 W kg−1 and superior cycling stability of 94.5% retention after 10,000 cycles. These results offer a novel and general approach to construct binder-free electrode materials with advanced performance for the portable and practical energy storage device.
