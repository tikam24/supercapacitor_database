Solution-processable conducting polymers (CPs) are a compelling alternative to inorganic counterparts because of their potential for tuning chemical properties and creating flexible organic electronics. CPs, which typically comprise either only an electron donor (D) or its alternative combinations with an electron acceptor (A), exhibit charge transfer behavior between the units, resulting in an electrical conductivity suitable for utilization in electronic devices and for energy storage applications. However, the energy storage behavior of CPs with a sequence of electron acceptors (A–A), has rarely been investigated, despite their promising lower band gap and higher charge carrier mobility. Utilizing the aforesaid concept herein, four CPs featuring benzodithiophenedione (BDD), and diketopyrrolepyrrole (DPP) are synthesized. Among them, the BDDTH-DPPEH polymer exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 126.5 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in an organic electrolyte over a wide potential window of −0.6–1.4 V. Notably, the supercapacitor properties of the polymeric electrode materials improved with increasing conjugation length by adding thiophene donor units and shortening the alkyl chain lengths. Furthermore, a symmetric supercapacitor device fabricated using BDDTH-DPPEH exhibited a high-power density of 4000 W kg−1 and an energy density of 31.66 Wh kg−1.
