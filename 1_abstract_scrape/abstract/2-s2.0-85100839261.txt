Copper ferrite/copper oxide (CuFe2O4/CuO) nanocomposites contents were prepared by using co-precipitation and sol-gel methods. The alternating current impedance and permittivity parameters of the samples were obtained by an impedance analyzer between 10 Hz and 40 MHz. The temperature dependences of magnetization were measured in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes and hysteresis curves at 300 K were investigated. In this context, it has been determined that the 25% CuO doped copper ferrite nanomaterial was showed the reduced dielectric loss and super-capacitive ability for ultra-capacitor application at high frequencies. Additionally, the samples prepared in this work were exhibited a superparamagnetic behavior.
