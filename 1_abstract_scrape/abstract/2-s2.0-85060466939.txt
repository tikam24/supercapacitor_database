To protect the environment, world mainly focused on dismissing the exhaustive gases released from the conventional vehicles which are used for transportation, in order to achieve that electric vehicle (EVs)/hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are introduced. Primarily EVs are fabricated with a single energy source for its successful operation, those are having some limitations. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) based EVs are introduced by combining battery with ultracapacitor (UC). Changing of sources present in HESS is the major challenge during real-time implementation according to electric vehicle dynamics. The key objective of this work is to design a control strategy in order to overcome the major challenge associated with HESS powered EV. Four individual math functions are considered and programmed based on the speed of an electric motor, made a new controller named as Math Function Based (MFB) controller. Thereafter different hybrid controllers are formed by combining the designed MFB with ANN as well as PID to perform the switching action of energy sources in HESS.The solar power package is integrated with the circuit to charge the battery during the solar power available time to avoid plug-in charging conditions.Three control switches are connected, which are used to charge the battery as well as supply power to the electric vehicle through the unidirectional converter (UDC) and all these actions are depending upon the state of charge (SOC) of the battery as well as solar power output. Total circuit is implemented with two hybrid controllers and made a comparative analysis based on different factors and tabulated in the conclusion section.
