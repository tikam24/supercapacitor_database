This work reports the investigations and electrochemical properties of a material, prepared by micro-sized Si (mSi) (upto 50 μm) which were partially coated with upto ~7 μm sized carbon microspheres (CS). The mixture of mSi enwrapped with CS (CS@mSi) was fabricated using a low temperature and facile hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) of dextrose. XRD and Raman study revealed an amorphous phase due to carbon/SiO2 and a highly disordered nanocrystalline graphite respectively. Also, FTIR suggested the Si–O bending and symmetric stretching of linear Si–O–Si. The electrochemical investigation with three cell assembly of fabricated CS@mSi as an electrode material for supercapacitor application exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 278.79 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 scan rate which is around 7 times as calculated for pristine mSi powder. In CS@mSi, conducting, amorphous and nano crystalline carbon combined with mSi exhibited enhanced specific capacitance and a low equivalent series resistance (ESR). mSi served as anchor and contributed to enhancing specific capacitance and providing 2 V voltage window. This work opens the possibility of designing energy materials with the waste Si and pseudocapacitive materials.
