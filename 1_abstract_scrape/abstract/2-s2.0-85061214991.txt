In recent years, a flexible supercapacitor with high storage properties, it is no longer concerned because of its low voltage window. Here, we design and synthesize CoFe2O4 nanoparticles grow on Carbon Fiber Cloth (CFC) via a mild hydrothermal and spay the ultra-conductive polymer Poly (3,4- ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) on the surface of CoFe2O4 nanolayer. The as-fabricated PEDOT:PSS /Fe2O3-CNTs /CFC and PEDOT:PSS/CoFe2O4/CFC electrodes as the negative and positive pseudocapacitor electrode show an excellent capacitance of 426 and 472.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. An aqueous flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (AFAS) at 2.0 V and achieve well specific capacitance of 181.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and the maximum energy density is 25.17 Wh kg−1 at power density of 620.7 W kg−1. To the aqueous flexible asymmetric supercapacitor, both positive and negative electrodes are important for the electrochemical performance. The power storage capacity per unit area of two electrodes should be similar, because the area of negative and positive electrode of flexible asymmetric supercapacitor must be similarity. The advantages of AFAS, according to its low-cost, high capacitances and simple fabrication process, show that AFAS can be one of the excellent candidate flexible asymmetric supercapacitor for next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.
