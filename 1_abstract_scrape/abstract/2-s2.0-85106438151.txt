Electric trams are one of the standard forms of public transport. They are characterized by large amounts of electric current and electric current gradient from the power grid, especially during acceleration. For this reason, a regenerative braking system is considered with the aim of reducing electric current peaks and increasing energy efficiency by reducing the total energy consumption of the power grid. A supercapacitor module is used as a storage device for storing and utilizing the braking energy. The supercapacitor module and the power grid constitute a hybrid energy system, for which a control algorithm has been developed. The control algorithm takes into account the influence of the elevation profile and the slope of the vehicle route in storing and using the braking energy. The operation of the algorithm was simulated and analyzed using the MATLAB/Simulink software package for tram lines with different elevation profiles.
