Temperature as an important working parameter, has a great influence on its performance and states. In this paper a three-dimension finite element model of a spiral wound supercapacitor was developed, and then the galvanostatic charge-discharge were conducted under the current of 2 A. In this way, we discussed the temperature distribution of the supercapacitor. The result shows that, the maximum temperature appears at the innermost layer of the core area and its related areas. After 5 cycles of charge- discharge, the maximum temperature is 34.5°C. When entering the steady state, it reaches 42.5°C. When the current reaches 4 A, the maximum temperature is above 60°C under the same circumstance. Some cooling strategies are necessary. It offers a reference for analyzing the internal temperature distribution of the spiral wound supercapacitor and for its structural design. © 2013 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.
