Transition metal sulfides are promising as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. Here, an in-situ hydrothermal method is developed for synthesis of NiS2/MoS2 (NMS) nanowires supported on Ni foam that facilitate the transport of electrolyte ions and electrons. Owing to the structural and compositional benefits, the NiS2/MoS2 electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 4.46 F cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and excellent cycle stability. In addition, the NiS2/MoS2//AC hybrid supercapacitor was assembled, which delivers an energy density of 0.35 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 3.63 mW cm−2, and 92.4% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. The work presents a facile in-situ hydrothermal method to synthesize high-performance binder-free electrode.
