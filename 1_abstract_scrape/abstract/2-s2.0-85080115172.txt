This study investigated the morphology dependent electrochemical behavior tuned with different stirring times (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 min, and 1 hr.) for NiCo2S4 hexagonal plate (NCS hexagonal plate) and NiCo−OH nanoparticles (NiCo−OH NPs). The altered nanostructure properties are well supported by in-depth structural and morphological analysis. When used as electrodes for supercapacitor, both NCS hexagonal plates and NiCo−OH NPs (prepared at stirring time of 20 min and 5 min, respectively) exhibit maximum specific capacitances of 833 and 733 mF cm−2 at the current density of 10 mA cm−2 along with superior rate and stable cycling performance due to their beneficial structural features. Moreover, the stability study showed 69.0 % and 67.0 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, indicating excellent stability of the samples. These outstanding properties manifest that the unique hierarchical structures promised as a suitable electrode material for the energy storage field shortly.
