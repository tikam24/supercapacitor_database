Composite materials of β-FeOOH particles and carbon powder were prepared by hydrolyzing of FeCl3+Ti(SO4)2 (aq.) in which carbon powder was dispersed. β-FeOOH formed in the presence of Ti(IV) ions became amorphous and/or low crystallinity. The composite materials prepared in the presence of Ti(IV) ions worked as lithium intercalation electrodes in nonaqueous electrolytes including lithium ions. The electrodes exhibited a good cycle performance at large charge-discharge current density over 5 mA cm-2 (4 A g-1 per weight of active material). The composite materials are one of the promising candidates as electrode materials for energy storage devices, such as hybrid electrochemical supercapacitor, that require high-power operations.
