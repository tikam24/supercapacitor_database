We report a fabrication of urchin-like nanostructure NiCo2O4 by hydrothermal method and followed by heating treatment method for cathode of asymmetric supercapacitors application. The sodium-p-styrenesulfonate (PSS) played a pivotal role in synthesizing the urchin-like nanostructure. The formation of NiCo2O4 with urchin-like nanostructure was showed by the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the crystalline structure was characterised by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The cyclic voltammetry curves exhibited a similar shape at all different scan rates, implying excellent rate capability. The galvanostatic current charge-discharge curves was also tested. The as-prepared NiCo2O4 electrode exhibited the specific capacitance of 1168 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g (25 mA/cm2) and an excellent rate capability of 733 F/g at 16 A/g (400 mA/cm2). The cycle performance of the NiCo2O4 sample under the current density of 4 A g-1 is demonstrated which the value remained at 92.75 % of the maximum value.
