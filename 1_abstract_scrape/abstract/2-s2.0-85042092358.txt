In this study, a temperature investigation is conducted on a bismuth oxide/manganese oxide (Bi2O3/MnO2) supercapacitor to determine how temperature affects the performances of the supercapacitor. Energy and power densities of 9.5 Wh kg-1 and 102.6 W kg-1 are obtained at 60 °C, respectively, which are approximately twice the values for supercapacitors at 0 °C and 1.37-fold higher than those at 30 °C. Additionally, the supercapacitors achieve energy densities of 4.9 and 6.9 Wh kg-1, and power densities of 53.8 and 74.8 W kg-1 at 0 and 30 °C, respectively. Interestingly, the hybrid Bi2O3/MnO2 active materials exhibit superior stability and reversibility, retaining 95% of the original capacitance at 30 °C and >75% at the high temperature of 60 °C. Although the cooler supercapacitor exhibits a slightly higher resistive performance, its excellent capacitance retention upon continuous charging/discharging measurement at 0 °C shows its potential for use as an all-weather compatible supercapacitor in the automotive sector.
