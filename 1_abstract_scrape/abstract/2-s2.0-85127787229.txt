Although the components of supercapacitors and their fabrication process are similar to that of batteries, but the SCs are categorized according to the charge storage mechanisms. The dominance properties of SCs (like specific power, long life time, and quick charge/discharge process etc.) over the batteries strongly depends on the active and passive components used. In this chapter the development of different components of SCs, their role in charge storage and their synergistic effect for the durability of the SC device has been incorporated.
