Microsupercapacitors (MSCs) have drawn great attention for use as miniaturized electrochemical energy storage devices in portable, wearable, as well as implantable electronics. Many materials have been developed as electrodes for MSCs. However, the thin-film fabrication for most of these materials involves multistep operations, including filtration, spray coating, and sputtering. Most importantly, these methods present challenges for the preparation of thin films at the atomic or molecular scale. Therefore, the understanding of performance of ultrathin-film-based MSCs remains challenge. Herein, a B/N-enriched polymer film is successfully prepared using the photoassisted interfacial approach. The as-synthesized polymer film exhibits typical semiconductive characteristics and can be easily scaled up to a large area of up to tens of square centimeters. This ultrathin polymer film can be directly transferred to silicon wafers to fabricate MSC through laser scribing. The prepared MSC exhibits specific volumetric capacitance as high as 20.9 F cm-3, corresponding to volumetric energy density of 2.9 mWh cm-3 (at 0.1 V s-1). Moreover, the volumetric power density can reach 1461 W cm-3, surpassing most existing semiconductive polymer film-based MSC devices. In addition, the prepared MSC exhibits typical AC line-filtering ability (-67Â° at 120 Hz). This study offers a facile interfacial approach to preparing semiconductive polymer films with aromatic moieties for microsized energy storage devices.
