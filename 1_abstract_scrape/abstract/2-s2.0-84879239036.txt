An asymmetric supercapacitor based on manganese dioxide/Au/nickel foam (MANF) electrode as positive electrode and graphene or commercial activated carbons (AC) as negative electrode was fabricated. The effect of different negative electrode materials and mass ratios of negative/positive electrodes on the electrochemical properties of the asymmetric supercapacitor was carefully investigated. The results suggest that the mass ratio of negative/positive electrode has a significant impact on the specific capacitance of the asymmetric supercapacitor. Especially, it is found that the optimal mass ratio of the negative/positive electrode is slightly lower than that calculated according to charge balance. On the other hand, the asymmetric supercapacitor with commercialized AC as negative electrode possesses higher specific capacitance and better rate capability than that of the asymmetric supercapacitor with graphene as negative electrode. The negative material has slight impact on the cycle stability of the asymmetric supercapacitor. In addition, the optimized asymmetric supercapacitor with MANF composite as positive electrode and AC as negative electrode can obtain an energy density as high as 65.9 Wh kg -1 at a power density of 180 W kg-1 and a cell voltage of 1.8 V in the neutral Na2SO4 aqueous solution.
