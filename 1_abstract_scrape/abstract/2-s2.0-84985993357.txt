The novel heterometallic polyoxotitanate cage [Ti8O7(OEt)21Er] can be used as a single-source precursor for the formation of nanostructured Er-containing titania materials (Er@TiO2). Based on the electrochromic properties and lithium ion storage capacity of Er@TiO2, an integrated bifunctional EC supercapacitor has been designed.
