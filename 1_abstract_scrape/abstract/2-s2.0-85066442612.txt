ZnO nanorods embedded on functionalized CNT have been synthesised by the chemical refluxing method. The characterization results revealed the tube-like structure of carbon nanotubes, that expose the ZnO nanorods grafted upright and parallel on the floor across the CNT surface. The powder X-ray diffraction patterns show that crystalline ZnO nanorods are highly loaded on the surface of CNT and formed as a nano-composite. Raman spectroscopy results showed that the intensity of D and G bands decreased due to the loading of ZnO nanorods. Cyclic voltammetry curves reveal the double layer capacitor (EDLC) behaviour of ZnO/CNT. The synthesised hybrid ZnO/CNT exhibits a high specific capacitance (SPc) of 189 Fg-1. The quick charge-discharge performance was found about 95 Fg-1 and the cyclic stability of 96% was observed for 1000 cycles. ZnO/CNT nano-composites also exhibit a high power density of 2250 W kg-1.
