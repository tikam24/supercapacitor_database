A low-cost hydrothermal method has been employed to synthesize phase pure Î±-MoO3 and MoO3/rGO nanocomposite electrodes with novel structures for high-performance supercapacitors. Both nanocomposites exhibited orthorhombic layered structure. Pure MoO3 exhibited nanorod-like morphology, whereas MoO3/rGO nanocomposite showed flower-like structure. The TEM studies reveal that the GO reduced to rGO and wrapped to the MoO3 nanorods. The pure MoO3 nanorods electrode demonstrated a specific capacitance of 331 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The MoO3/rGO nanocomposite electrode with unique flower-like structure showed enhanced electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 486 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g with 92% capacity retention even after 1000 discharge cycles.
