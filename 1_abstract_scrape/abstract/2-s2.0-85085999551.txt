With the rise of portable and wearable electronic devices, it is becoming increasingly important to develop energy storage devices that can display their working status. In this article, an electrochromic supercapacitor was developed based on electroactive tetraaniline-sulfanilic acid polysiloxane (TASA) and versatile Prussian blue (PB). The electrode was prepared through electrochemistry-assisted hydrolytic crosslinking reaction coupled with electrochemical deposition. The as-synthesized electrochromic TASA/PB electrodes exhibit high electrochromic performances with high optical contrast, acceptable coloration efficiency of 92.7 cm2 C-1, and good switching durability. It also exhibits specific capacitances as high as 273.4 F g-1 at the current density of 0.25 A g-1. The charge storage level (charged/discharged state) of the electrochromic supercapacitor based on TASA/PB electrode switches from green to blue, demonstrating the potential applications in energy storage and electrochromism for smart windows.
