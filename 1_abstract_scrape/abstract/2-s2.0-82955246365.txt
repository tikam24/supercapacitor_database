This paper analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using a modified center-tab rectifier in a high current bidirectional DC-DC converter. This topology is also optimized in order to reduce diode/switch reverse voltage stress. One side of the converter has to transfer currents up to 100A, so the main reason for choosing this topology is the lower conduction losses that it presents. Simulation and experimental data from a prototype are studied. The converter is designed to be attached to a supercapacitor stack in order to make a regulated output power supply. Â© 2011 IEEE.
