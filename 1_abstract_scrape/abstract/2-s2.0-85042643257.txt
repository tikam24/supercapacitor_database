A composite of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and activated carbon (AC) is synthesized for supercapacitor applications by using a simple chemical method. Weight ratio of AC to CNT in the synthesis of the composite is changed from 0.6 to 2. The resultant capacitance increases with increasing weight ratio, but decreases when the ratio reaches 2. Too much AC can isolate the CNTs from one another, resulting in a degradation of the conductive network formed by the connected CNTs, and too little AC results in a surface area that is too small for the best performance of the supercapacitor. The resultant impedance of the composite is consistent with the result for the capacitance. The impedance decreases with increasing weight ratio due to the increase in the surface area due to the presence of AC and then starts to increase when too much AC, compared to CNT, is added to the composite, which is due to the degradation of the conductive network formed by the connected CNTs. A synergic effect of AC and CNT, i:e:, the large surface area of AC and the good conducting property of the CNT network, is demonstrated for supercapacitor applications.
