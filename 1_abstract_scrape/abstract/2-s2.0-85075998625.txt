Polyaniline (PANi) decorated Mn3O4-coated graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite was fabricated via a low-temperature chemical process. The nanocomposite was demonstrated as a high-performing electrode material for supercapacitor application. The polyaniline with metal oxide composite was synthesized in two different ways: (i) with stirring and (ii) without stirring. Both gave different morphologies as nanospheres and 1D nanostructures. This 1D nanostructure with Mn3O4 deposited on the surface of graphene oxide formed the nanocomposite was characterized for SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, FT-IR, and UV-Vis. Finally, we studied electrochemistry for charge storage using ternary material Mn3O4-GO-PANi (1:0.5) synthesized without stirring as a best performing supercapacitor electrode. 1D nanostructures have received great interest for supercapacitor applications in enhancing the mobility of the electrolyte ions between the electrodes to electrolyte interface. The ternary hybrid material Mn3O4-GO-PANi without stirring (1:0.5) showed the specific capacitance value of 829 F/g at current density 0.3 A/g. Specific capacitance showed 94% over 1800 cycles.
