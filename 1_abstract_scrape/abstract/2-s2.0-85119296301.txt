Combined with the advantages of capacitor and potassium ion battery, potassium ion hybrid capacitor (PIHCs) are regarded as a promising energy storage device due to their high energy density and excellent cycle stability. However, their development are limited due to the different energy storage mechanism between anode and cathode. Herein, the carbon coated Ba0.5Ti2(PO4)3 nanospheres (BTP/C NSs) are synthesized via hydrothermal method and applied to potassium ion hybrid capacitors integrated with activated carbon as cathode in a voltage window of 1.0–3.8 V, affording a maximum energy density of 566.1 Wh kg−1 and maximum power density of 4576.9 W kg−1 together with excellent cyclability. These results indicate that the BTP/C NSs display great potential as anode for PIHCs.
