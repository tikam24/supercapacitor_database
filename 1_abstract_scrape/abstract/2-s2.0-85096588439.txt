Undoped and doped PbTe nanoparticles with neodymium (Nd) and ytterbium (Yb) ions were hydrothermally synthesized and deposited on anodized TiO2 nanotube (TNT) arrays to form hybrid binder-free TNT electrodes for supercapacitor. The as-prepared TNT electrodes were characterized by XRD, SEM, and XPS. Besides, BET method was used to confirm the surface area of as-synthesized nanoparticles. Among TNT electrodes, the one with Yb-doped PbTe exhibited enhanced capacitance (0.93 mF/cm2 at 10 mV/s, 2.16 mF/cm2 at 5 µA/cm2) and low resistance (4.68 Ω), along with good stability (~93%). Overall, TNT in combination with Yb-doped PbTe nanoparticles could provide an ideal platform for efficient delivery of capacitance.
