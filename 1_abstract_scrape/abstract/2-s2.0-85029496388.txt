For hybrid energy storage system in dc microgrid, effective power split, bus voltage deviation, and state-of-charge (SoC) violation are significant issues. Conventionally, they are achieved by centralized control or hierarchical control methods with communications. This paper proposes a simple and effective strategy to solve the problem in a decentralized manner. A high-pass filter-based droop (HPFD) controller is proposed to regulate the battery converter, and a virtual capacitance droop (VCD) controller is implemented for a supercapacitor (SC) converter. The cooperation of HPFD and VCD first achieves autonomous power split that high-frequency fluctuation is buffered by SC and low-frequency power is supplied by battery. Meanwhile, the bus voltage deviation induced by the droop-based power sharing is eliminated automatically at steady state. The resulted bus voltage restoration simultaneously enforces SC SoC back to its nominal value, and, thus, ensures continuous operation of SC as a power buffer without the violation of its SoC boundary. A design guideline is developed to ensure expected system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed method and analytical results are validated by simulations and experiments.
