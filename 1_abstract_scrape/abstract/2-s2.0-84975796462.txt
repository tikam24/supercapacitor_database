In this report, the supercapacitor was constructed with activated carbon paper as electrodes and 3 M H2SO4 solution bearing 1 M VOSO4 as electrolyte. This supercapacitor showed high areal capacitance of 2146 mF/cm2 with around 16 times higher than that of 134 mF/cm2 in pristine electrolyte of 3 M H2SO4 and good cycling performance retaining 92 % after 5000 cycles. The full-scale and enlarged Nyquist-type impedance spectra further indicate that the supercapacitor has low diffusion resistance and exhibits good power capability. Constructed by this way, the performances of supercapacitors were improved for the synergistic effect of the absorbance and catalysis of the activated carbon paper as well as redox properties of the couples VO2+/VO2+.
