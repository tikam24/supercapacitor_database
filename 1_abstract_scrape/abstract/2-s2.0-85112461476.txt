The development of supercapacitors with a high energy density and power density is of great importance for the promotion of energy storage technology. In this study, we designed and prepared petal-like CoMoO4 clusters combined with carbon cloth as an excellent self-standing and binder-free electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors. Due to the abundant electrochemical active sites, the promising electron conduction, and ion diffusion rate, the CoMoO4@carbon cloth (CoMoO4@CC) electrode exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance. The results show that the CoMoO4@CC material exhibits a high specific capacitance (664 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) and an excellent cycle stability (capacitance remains at 84.0% after 1000 cycles). The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor has an energy density of 27 Wh/kg when the power density is 600 W/kg. Even at a higher power density (6022 W/kg), it still maintains a good energy density (18.4 Wh/kg).
