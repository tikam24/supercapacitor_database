The supercapacitor has emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage device. Its excellent performance, easy handling, and stability have gained remarkable attention. In comparison with batteries, it delivers high-power density and cyclic stability. This is basically due to its charge storage mechanism, where ions get adsorbed at the electrode surface during charging and get released while discharging. This makes it different from batteries, where repeated redox reactions lead to poor stability and low-power density. Supercapacitor works similarly to the conventional capacitor, where two conductors are separated by a dielectric medium. The capacitance arises from the separation of charges at the conductor surface. In supercapacitor, the conductors have been replaced by the porous electrode, which provides efficient surface areas for the adsorption of ions. Also, the separation between two opposite charges is in the nanometer range, which further contributes to high capacitance than the conventional capacitor. Basically, the supercapacitor is classified by two types of charge storage mechanisms, where pure electrostatic, non-Faradic processes are called electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC). The other includes the Faradaic process, where a reversible redox reaction is involved and known as pseudocapacitor. Carbon-based materials are used as EDLC electrode; whereas, metal oxides and conducting polymers are used as pseudocapacitor electrode material. Further improvement in terms of performance is reported by combining both types of charge storage mechanisms called a hybrid supercapacitor. The phenomena of the charge storage mechanisms in supercapacitors have been discussed in detail. Different components of the supercapacitor and their functions have been briefly introduced in this chapter.
