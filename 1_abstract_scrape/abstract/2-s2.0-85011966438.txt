Polymer supported gold nanoparticles has been synthesized using a single-step route, from the corresponding monomer and metal salt precursors, and was analysed by means of optical, microscopic and surface characterization techniques. The metal-polymer supramolecular complex in combination with reduced graphene oxide form a ‘hybrid architecture’ and display the property of an electrochemical supercapacitor where the gold nanoparticles have a prevailing role as the charge storage component within the system.
