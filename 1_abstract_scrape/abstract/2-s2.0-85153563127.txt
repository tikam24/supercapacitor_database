This manuscript investigates the performance of an ultra-capacitor fuel cell in grid-connected mode. Voltage regulation to the ultra-capacitor was achieved with a three-level bidirectional DC-DC converter while achieving power flow from the grid to the ultra-capacitor via the bidirectional converter. The choice of a bidirectional three-level converter for voltage regulation is based on its inherently high efficiency, low harmonic profile, and compact size. Using the model equations of the converter and grid -connected inverter derived using the switching function approach, the grid's direct axis modulation index and quadrature axis modulation index, Md and Mq, respectively, were simulated in Matlab for both lagging and leading power factors. Moreover, the values of Md and Mq were harnessed in a PLECS-based simulation of the proposed model to determine the effect of power factor correction on the current and power injection to the grid.
