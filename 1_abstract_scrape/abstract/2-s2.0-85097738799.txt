In this work, four composites of varied percentage of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with Mn, Ni, and Co oxide nanoparticles (TMO) were prepared by hydrothermal process and abbreviated as MNC-1, MNC-2, MNC-3 and MNC-4. The prepared materials were characterized for their physico-chemical properties by Powder XRD, SEM, TEM, BET, XPS, FT-IR and Raman analytical techniques. The electrochemical properties of the composites were evaluated in a three-electrode system incorporating the composite as the working electrode. Among the nanocomposites investigated, the MNC-3 sample with the TMO and MWCNTs ratio of 1: 0.25 showed lowest surface area, pore volume and pore diameter. Further, this sample exhibited highest specific capacitance of 985 F/g at 2 mV/s by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M KOH solution. This material when checked for its stability at high current density of 15 A/g for 5,000 cycles, showed 83% capacitance retention which subsequently changed to 70% after 10,000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device was designed using MNC-3 as the positive electrode and a commercial activated carbon as negative electrode. The device exhibited significant specific capacitance, energy density and power density values of 58 F/g, 17 Wh/kg, and 1768 W/kg, respectively. A life cycle test conducted for the fabricated device at a current density of 15 A/g showed capacitance retention of 78% even after 10,000 cycles. The practical application of the device was checked and demonstrated by powering two red LEDs connected in series for 12 mins.
