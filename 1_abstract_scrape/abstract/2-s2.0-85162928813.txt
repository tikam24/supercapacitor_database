Supercapacitor has received considerable attention as a promising energy storage device due to its fast charging, excellent cyclic stability, and high-power density. Activated carbon is the main material used to make supercapacitor electrodes because it has a high theory-specific surface area reach of 2,685 m2g-1 and low cost. However, structure micropore activated carbon had poor ionic diffusion and transportability that make inefficient surface area utilization, long charge-discharge performance, and low cycle life. Therefore, continuous research is needed to improve supercapacitor performance by adding and modifying structure micropores to increase the performance of electrochemically active sites so that ionic diffusion is better. This research is focused on the influence of concentration PVP immersion 0 M and 0.06 M with the dehydrogenation method. The higher concentration PVP strongly influenced the microstructure, morphology, and electrochemical process. The activated carbon mesoporous was characterized by XRD, SEM â€“ EDX, FTIR, BET, and Charge Discharge. Further, the supercapacitor with the best performance is shown by the highest concentration of PVP 0.06 M exhibited the highest specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of 83.83 F.g-1, 60.06 Wh kg-1, 454.24 Wkg-1. ACM-0.06 had highest cycle stability in the cell voltage of 0-2.4 V at a current density of 0.1 Ag-1, and maximum energy density is 58.96 Wh kg-1 with 95.82 % capacity retention after 25 cycles.
