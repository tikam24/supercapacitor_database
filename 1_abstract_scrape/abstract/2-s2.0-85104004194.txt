Supercapacitors have huge potential applications in the field of wearable electronic devices, such as flexible displays, flexible biosensors and implantable multimedia devices, due to their high-power density, fast charge-discharge rates, long cycling life, and relatively simple configuration. In this paper, we demonstrated hierarchically porous and continuous reduced graphene oxide-polyacrylonitrile@polyacrylonitrile (rGO-PAN@PAN) coaxial fibers with certain strength, excellent electrochemical performance through coaxial wet spinning and thermal reduction. Coaxial fibers are carbonized at high temperature and have a graded porous structure with a conductivity of 1 703 S/m. The areal specific capacitance of the supercapacitor assembled by polyvinyl alcohol/sulfuric acid (PVA/H2SO4) gel electrolyte is 11.56 mF/cm2, and its energy density reaches 0.21 mWâ€¢h/cm3, showing good electrochemical performance. Graphene-based coaxial fibers prepared by wet spinning have a great prospect of application in electronic devices due to their excellent properties.
