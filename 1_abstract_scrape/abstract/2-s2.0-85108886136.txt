In this study, hydrothermal pretreatment, freeze-drying, and KOH activation were used to transform discarded Chinese dates (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) into high value-added porous carbon-aerogels (DPCs) for energy storage functions. The carbon-aerogel prepared under optimized conditions (DPC600−3) exhibits a moderate specific surface area of 1348.87 m2/g, which is mostly composed of micropores and macropores with unique three-dimensional architectures and ultra-high self-doped heteroatoms of O (15.71 at%). These unique properties enabled DPC600−3 to show remarkable performances in the double-layer supercapacitors of a three-electrode system, which comprised 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. At a current density of 0.5 A /g, DPC600−3 showed an excellent specific capacity of 769 F/g. In the assembled supercapacitors, remarkable energy densities of 8.75 Wh kg−1 (at 252 W Kg−1) and 26.3 Wh kg−1 (at 451 W Kg−1) were achieved when 6 M KOH and 1 M Na2SO4 were used as the electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, DPC600−3 shows an excellent reversible lithium storage of 1059.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C, with long cycle stability (560 mA h g−1 after 320 cycles at 0.2 C) and rate performance (260 mA h g−1 at 3.2 C); even at 0.8 C and after 1000 cycles, the specific capacity was still as high as 340 mA h g −1 with a capacity retention of 61.5 %. These results corroborate this study, which is the first to use discarded Chinese dates as a sustainable source to prepare a high value-added porous carbon-aerogel with multiple energy storage functions.
