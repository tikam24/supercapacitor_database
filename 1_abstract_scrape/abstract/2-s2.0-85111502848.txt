To design a unique electrode material based on multimaterial-coupled hybrids, we report on capacitive energy storage characteristics of porous hybrid consisting of nitrogen-enriched carbon (NC) coated on few-layered graphene platelets (FGP), nitrogen-incorporated tubular carbon (NTC) and deoxygenated graphene oxide (DGO) appropriate for carbon/carbon supercapacitor. Nanotextured porous carbon loaded with FGP, NTC, DGO and YP-50 exhibited a specific capacitance of 188, 147, 121, and 114 F/g (at 0.5 A/g) and capacity retention of 96.82%, 93.26%, 90.50% and 96.43% (for 1000 cycles), respectively. PNCG//PNCG (FGP loaded) exhibited a maximum energy density of 28.17 Wh/kg with the maximum power density of 4160 W/kg, superior to commercially applied YP-50 (16.32 Wh/kg and 2977 W/kg) using compressed graphite foil based current collector. This systematic method could open up a state-of-the-art approach to apply PNCG in high performance energy storage devices.
