Microporous carbon based carbon-iodine nanocomposite materials have been fabricated. The morphology and chemical bonding in this iodine-modified carbon have been studied to describe carboniodine interaction. Further, the non-faradaic and faradaic reaction mechanisms of iodated carbons have been described focusing on possible charge transfer reactions and evolution of a distinct 3.1 V faradaic pseudocapacitive reaction.
