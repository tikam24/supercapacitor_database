A combined supercapacitor and electrolytic capacitor energy storage system offers efficiency improvements in excess of 10% when compared to a supercapacitor-only storage system used in short-duration (<1s), high-current discharge applications. The technique is suited to distributed generation applications where low-voltage ride through and grid code compliance are important considerations. A simplified mathematical model of the system compares well with more complex, established modelling approaches, and simulation and experimental results verify the proposed technique. Â© 2013 IEEE.
