In this study, the nanocomposite of manganese oxide (Mn2O3)/graphene oxide (GO) is deposited on a current collector using the single-nozzle electrospinning method. The effects of the GO concentration (volume %) of the Mn2O3 nanofibers (NFs) on the structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties are investigated systematically. The presence of GO in the Mn2O3 NF samples is confirmed using X-ray diffraction patterns, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, where sp2 hybridization can be observed. The influence of the GO (volume %) in the Mn2O3 NF samples on the contribution of the capacitive and diffusion-controlled process has been calculated mathematically. GO at 5 vol% in the Mn2O3 sample exhibited a high specific capacitance of 588 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.5 mAcm−2 (2.5 Ag−1) in 1 M aqueous electrolyte with 98% cyclic stability up to 1000 cycles. Furthermore, a coin cell hybrid device was assembled using Mn2O3/GO and a Li-chip as an electrode, 1 M LiPF6 as an electrolyte, and a polypropylene sheet as a separator. This device exhibited a capacitance, an energy density, and a power density of 0.33 F (specific capacitance of 740 Fg−1), 925 Whkg−1, and 3.3 kWkg−1, respectively at a current density of 1 mAcm−2 (2.5 Ag−1) along with 90% retention in capacitance measured till 5000 cycles.
