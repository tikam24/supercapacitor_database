Herein, the supercapacitive characteristics of a novel nanocomposite based on defective mesoporous carbon (DMC) and MnO2 is presented. DMC was obtained via a facile and low-cost synthesis route and its interconnected pore network was served as host matrix for the growth of MnO2 nanoparticles to form the DMC/MnO2 nanocomposite. The deposition of MnO2 nanoparticles at the surface of DMC support was investigated using different structural analyses including FT-IR, Nitrogen adsorption/desorption, XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM. Compared to DMC and MnO2 electrodes, the DMC/MnO2 nanocomposite exhibited the highest specific capacitance reaching to 292 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1. Also, DMC/MnO2 possessed good rate performance (61% capacity retention over 0.5–10 A g−1) and cycling stability (21% capacity loss after 2000 charge/discharges cycles). Furthermore, a two-electrode symmetric supercapacitor device delivered a high specific energy of 34 W h kg−1 at specific power of 100 W kg−1.
