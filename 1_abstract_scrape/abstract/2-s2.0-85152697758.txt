In this study, we utilized a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) route to attach bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) nanoparticles on one dimensional (1D) cadmium sulfide nanowires (CdS NWs) at ambient temperature (27 °C) to design CdS@Bi2Se3 core-shell nanostructure towards active electrode for supercapacitor application. To verify and explore the retrieved surface configuration, structural, elemental, compositional, and surface morphological investigations were performed. The designed CdS@Bi2Se3 core-shell nanostructure not only offers the tremendous number of active areas, but also a continuous and quick one directional electron transport channels, demonstrating noticeable electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 198 F g−1 (aerial capacitance 59.5 mF/cm2) with 80% cyclic retention @ 2000 cycles. Superior electrochemical activity was enhanced through the mutualistic involvement of Na+ ion insertion/extraction via non-stoichiometric bismuth selenide, which was well supported through electrochemical impedance ( EIS) studies.
