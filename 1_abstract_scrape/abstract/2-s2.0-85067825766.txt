The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) plays an essential role in the shipboard medium-voltage dc (MVdc) system to provide backup power, buffer large load change, as well as improve power quality. In this paper, a novel virtual resistor and capacitor droop (VRCD) control is first proposed for HESS including battery, supercapacitor, and flywheel. It enables the generator and multiple types of energy storages (ESs) with different characteristics to respond to multiple-frequency unbalanced power instead of simple high-frequency and low-frequency power sharing by the conventional droop control method. A detailed design procedure for the VRCD control is presented. Also, the secondary state of charge recovery control is proposed to maintain high energy reserve of ESs for further power demand. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control scheme proposed in a shipboard MVdc under particular loads fluctuation, such as the propulsion motor and the pulsed load.
