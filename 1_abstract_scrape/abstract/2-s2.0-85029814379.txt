Properties related with the charge storage capacity have been evaluated for three-layered films made with two sheets of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) separated by a sheet of poly(N-methylpyrrole) or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-co-N-methylpyrrole) (3l-PEDOT/PNMPy or 3l-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-NMPy), respectively). The most distinctive trend of the copolymer, which shows electrochemical properties intermediate between those of the two homopolymers, is the formation of a biphasic structure, EDOT- and NMPy-rich blocks organizing separately. The ability to exchange charge reversibly is higher for 3l-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-NMPy) than for 3l-PEDOT/PNMPy, the electroactivity and electrostability of such two 3-layered films being significantly better than that of single-layered PEDOT. Advantages of 3l-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-NMPy) are mainly based on the nanophase-segregated structure of the copolymer. Thus, the intermediate layer can be considered as random disposition of ultrathin dielectrics having nanometric length and width. In terms of charge storage, the intermediate layer of 3l-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-NMPy) can be viewed as a thin reservoir filled of heterogeneously distributed nanometric supercapacitors that are connected in series among them and in parallel to the PEDOT layers. The superiority of 3l-PEDOT/P(EDOT-co-NMPy) as organic electrochemical supercapacitor compared to other 3-layered systems, has been proved by powering a red LED bulb.
