Carbon nanofibers derived from lignocellulosic materials have become the most prevalent free-standing electrode material for supercapacitors due to their renewable and sustainable nature. This study used Arenga pinnata bunches (APB) as raw material for hemicellulose compounds to produce carbon electrodes through carbonization processes at 650 °C, 700 °C, 750 °C, and 800 °C, in the presence of flowing N2 gas. The variations in carbonization temperature resulted in carbon electrodes with surface morphology having a nanofiber structure with micro-meso pore distribution. According to the results, the carbonization temperature of 700 °C (APB-700) is the optimum temperature for producing electrode surface morphology with a combination of nanofiber, micro-and mesopore distributions, as well as specific surface area, specific capacitance, energy density, and power density of 1231.896 m2 g−1, 201.6 F g−1, 28.0 Wh kg−1, and 109.5 W kg−1, respectively, for the two electrode systems. This shows the combination of nanofibers and the distribution of micro-and mesopores produced with variations in carbonization temperature has the capacity to improve the performance of supercapacitor cells. Therefore, carbon nanofibers derived from Arenga pinnata bunches have the potential to be used as free-standing electrode materials for supercapacitors without employing doping, binder, electrospinning, and heteroatom template methods.
