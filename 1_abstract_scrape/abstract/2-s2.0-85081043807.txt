We report on, for the first time, an on-chip high frequency micro supercapacitor (MSC) featured by ultra-high capacitance density and chip integratability. High-aspect-ratio 3D mesoporous gold (MPG) electrodes, which guarantee wide frequency response and large material loading, are developed by metal co-sputtering technique and selective etching technique. MXene quantum dots, a novel 1D material with high pseudocapacitance, are engineered on MPG through in-situ electrochemical deposition. Consequently, the device demonstrates a 9.7 times higher areal capacitance (14.5 mF/cm2) and 34.2 times volume capacitance (270 mF/cm3) than electrolytic capacitors. The MSC is applied in a low-pass filtering circuit, showing great advantage in circuit functionalization and size reduction.
