Two sets of SnO2-based supercapacitors (SCs) were synthesized and characterized. The first set, typical of double-layer (DL) capacitance, comprises Sb-doped SnO2 nanocrystallites synthesized by a sol-gel process. A surface-grafting technique was introduced to delay grain coarsening, giving rise to a maximum capacitance in 1M KOH(aq) of 16 Fg-1 (or 64 Fcm-3). The second set includes composite electrodes consisting of nanocrystalline SnO2 and RuO2 or Fe3O4 nanocrystallites, which are known to exhibit pseudocapacitance. Fe3O4-SnO2 composite electrodes exhibiting a capacitance of 33 F g-1 (or ∼ 130 F cm-3), at a voltage-sweeping rate of 50 mV s-1 in 1M Na2SO4(aq) were demonstrated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
