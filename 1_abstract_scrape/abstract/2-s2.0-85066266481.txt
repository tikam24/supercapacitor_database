Creating unique nanostructures is imperative to develop new generation of electrodes with high electro-capacitive property. Herein the molybdenum disulfide/polyaniline (MoS2/PANI) composites with different PANI loadings (40, 53, and 70 wt%) were prepared using MoS2 nanosheet as the substrate. At a 53 wt% loading amount of PANI, the obtained MoS2/PANI-53 nanopallet electrode material displayed the highest electro-capacitive property. The rational combination of the two components allowed the PANI thin layer to uniformly cover the surface of the MoS2 nanosheet and the synergistic effect of the high specific capacitance of PANI along with the fast ionic conductivity and mechanical stability of MoS2 make MoS2/PANI-53 as a suitable electrode material for supercapacitors. Therefore the MoS2/PANI-53 nanopallet symmetric supercapacitor delivered high energy density (35 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 335 W kg−1) and excellent cycling stability (81% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles). This work could be give rise to conducting polymer based composite electrode material with high performance for functional supercapacitor devices.
