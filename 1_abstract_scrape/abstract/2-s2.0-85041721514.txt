A simple one-pot route for the synthesis of highly porous N-doped carbons with an excellent performance as supercapacitor electrodes is presented. The synthesis scheme is based on the carbonization of an organic salt, potassium citrate, at a temperature in the 700–900 °C range, in the presence of urea. Such porous carbons combine ultra-high BET surface areas of up to 3350 m2 g−1, a large pore volume of up to 2.65 cm3 g−1, a porosity which can be regulated to have a micropore or micro-mesopore network and a notable nitrogen content in the 0.5–4.5 wt % range, two essential properties for their use in electrochemical devices. The presence of urea in the synthesis mixture is the key to pore development in these synthesized carbons. The applicability of this type of carbon as supercapacitor electrode material with an ionic liquid as electrolyte has also been demonstrated in this study.
