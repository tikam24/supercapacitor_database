The stability and consistency of electrical properties displayed by calcium copper titanate (CaCu3Ti4O12–CCTO) ceramics are the most important concern when they are used as capacitor dielectrics. This study investigated the influence of exposure to air and dry N2 atmospheres on dielectric properties of the as-prepared CCTO as a function of temperature. Solid-state synthesis route has been used to fabricate the CCTO sintered pellets at 1100 °C for 5 h in air. Highly inconsistent impedance spectra and dielectric properties are observed in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 MHz when the samples are tested in air at 23 °C. In contrast, stable and consistent electrical properties are obtained by testing the samples under dry N2. Value of tanδ as small as 0.014 and a large dielectric constant (ε′) of 12,935 ± 2 at 2.2 kHz are obtained when samples are exposed and tested in dry N2 at 23 °C. The details concerning the possible underlying mechanisms responsible for dielectric properties of CCTO are reported in this article.
