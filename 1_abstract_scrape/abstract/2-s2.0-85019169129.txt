Analysis the synergy among different components within graphene based asymmetric supercapacitor could help us to establish the criterion for construction the idea supercapacitor for real applications. For this purpose, 3D Networks for Fe2O3 and α- Ni(OH)2 individually/collectively decorated S-doped graphene composites were successfully synthesized. The electrochemical performances clearly indicate the multi-decorated composite possesses the largest specific capacitance, improved cycle stability and enhanced rate capability due to its efficient additive effect among the different components of supercapacitor. The pronounced high energy density, provided by redox-active transition mental oxide/hydroxide, combined with excellent conductivity, hydrophilia and efficient charge storage, originated from S-doped graphene, result in the excellent composite for asymmetric supercapacitor. Within the voltage range from 0 to 0.44 V versus Ag/AgCl, the specific capacitance of Fe2O3 and Ni(OH)2 co-decorated S-doped graphene composite can be achieved 2386 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1.
