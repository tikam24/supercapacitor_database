According to the technical rule for connecting wind farm to power system established by the state grid corporation, a method for balancing fluctuant wind power is proposed to enhance the controllability of wind power. This method is based on a new pattern hybrid energy storage system. By decomposing the fluctuation of wind power, we conduct an analysis on the performance requirement for the energy storage system. Then, we develop a new pattern hybrid energy storage system to balance the fluctuant wind power. Through the design on the operation mode, the energy storage system can exchange power precisely and efficiently with wind power system. Also, different energy storage elements can be chosen to suppress different kinds of wind power fluctuation according to their own merit. The simulation indicates that the method can develop fully the merit of energy storage elements to extend the service life and that the balanced wind power can satisfy the requirement of real-time dispatching of power system.
