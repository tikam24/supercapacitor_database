We report preparation and characterization of novel nanocomposite electrodes consisting of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) and polypyrrole (PPy) for electrochemical supercapacitors. The electrodes in the form of papers and fibers were prepared by i) vacuum filtration of SWNT/PPy methanol dispersion and ii) wet-spinning of SWNT/PPy aqueous dispersion, respectively. Electrochemical properties of prepared nanocomposites were investigated using cyclic voltammetry method in aqueous NaCl and NaPF6 electrolytes. The capacitance of the SWNT/PPy nanocomposite papers was about 5 times higher than that of pristine SWNT paper. The capacitance of SWNT/PPy fibers reached record 200 F/g values. Prospective applications of prepared materials range from supercapacitors to electrodes for batteries and electromechanical actuators. Â©2010 IEEE.
