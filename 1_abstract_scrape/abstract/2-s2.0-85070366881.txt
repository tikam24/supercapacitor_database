Given different crystallization habit of CoC2O4·2H2O and NiC2O4·2H2O, Co1-xNixC2O4·2H2O solid solutions with hierarchical structures have been rationally designed and fabricated via a chemical co-precipitation process. Typically, Co0.5Ni0.5C2O4·2H2O presents hierarchical flower-like morphology due to the rivaling competing crystallization of orthorhombic and monoclinic phase. The sample possesses high specific surface area (124.8 m2/g) and delivers a superior specific capacitance of 1226 F g-1 at the current density of 1cA g−1. Moreover, Co0.5Ni0.5C2O4·2H2O exhibits excellent rate capability (82.9% retention at 20 A g−1) and remarkable cycling stability (84.6% retention after 3000 cycles). The outstanding pseudocapacitive performance can be related to its orthorhombic-monoclinic hierarchical nanostructure, which not only improve ion and electron transfer but also facilitate surface redox reaction. Our work demonstrates Co0.5Ni0.5C2O4·2H2O can be a promising candidate in energy storage for supercapacitors.
