Transition metal sulfides have broad applications in supercapacitors for their excellent electrochemical properties. In this work, the nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) nanosheets are prepared by a facile in-situ synthesis process. The annealing process is studied in detail to analyze its effect on the electrochemical performance of Ni3S2 electrodes. Results reveal that the annealing temperature is the key factor which influences the morphology, structure, component and mass change of the electrode materials. In three-electrode system, the sample pretreated at 400 °C for 2 h (Ni3S2-400 °C-2 h) exhibits the best capacitive properties with high specific capacitance (0.84 F cm−2 at 1.33 A cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (85.90% capacitance retains after 12,000 cycles). The asymmetric device (Ni3S2-400 °C-2 h//AC) displays the maximum specific energy of 22.97 μW h cm−2 and the maximum specific power of 1.06×104 μW cm−2. This work provides a promising way to prepare the Ni3S2 electrodes and systematically analyses their electrochemical properties at different annealing conditions.
