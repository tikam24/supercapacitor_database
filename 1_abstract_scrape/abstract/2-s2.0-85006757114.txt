A promising new concept is to apply binder-free supercapacitor electrode by directly growing active materials on current collectors. However, there are many challenges to be solved, such as fabrication of well quality electronic contact and good mechanical stability films through a simple and feasible method. In this study, MoS 2 nanosheet arrays supported on titanium plate has been synthesized by a hydrothermal method without other additives, surface active agents and toxic reagents. As the supercapacitor electrode, a good capacitance of 133 F g −1 is attained at a discharge current density of 1 A g −1 . The specific energy density is 11.11 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 0.53 kW kg −1 . Moreover, the electrode shows an excellent cyclic stability. The loss of capacity is only 7% even after 1000 cycles. In addition, the formation mechanism is proposed. The facile method of fabricating MoS 2 nanosheet arrays on titanium plate affords an green and effective way to prepare other metal sulfides for the application in electrochemical capacitors.
