Monodispersed silica@nickel silicate hydroxide core–shell microspheres are prepared using a hydrothermal method. The core–shell microsphere with an average diameter of 525 nm displays a hierarchical structure. The shell with an average thickness of about 40 nm consists of Ni3Si2O5(OH)4 nanosheets yielding porous surface. Surface-dependent electrochemical property exhibits a specific capacitance of 356.7 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a good rate performance, which is attributed to the special core–shell hierarchical structures not only providing abundant electroactive sites for redox reaction but also shortening ion/electron transportation path. The current study provides a simple and efficient way to design low-cost electrodes for supercapacitors.
