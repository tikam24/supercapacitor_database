Two-dimensional Ti3C2Tx exhibits outstanding rate property and cycle performance in lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) due to its unique layered structure, excellent electronic conductivity, and high specific surface area. However, like graphene, Ti3C2Tx restacks during electrochemical cycling due to hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces, leading to a decrease in the specific surface area and an increase in the diffusion distance of electrolyte ions between the interlayer of the material. Here, a transition metal selenide MoSe2 with a special three-stacked atomic layered structure, derived from metal—organic framework (MOF), is introduced into the Ti3C2Tx structure through a solvo-thermal method. The synergic effects of rapid Li+ diffusion and pillaring effect from the MoSe2 and excellent conductivity from the Ti3C2Tx sheets endow the material with excellent electrochemical reaction kinetics and capacity. The composite Ti3C2Tx@MoSe2 material exhibits a high capacity over 300 mAh·g−1 at 150 mA·g−1 and excellent rate property with a specific capacity of 150 mAh·g−1 at 1500 mA·g−1. Additionally, the material shows a superior capacitive contribution of 86.0% at 2.0 mV·s−1 due to the fast electrochemical reactions. A Ti3C2Tx@MoSe2//AC LIC device is also fabricated and exhibits stable cycle performance.
