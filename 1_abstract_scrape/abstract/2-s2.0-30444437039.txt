Power improvement in supercapacitors is mainly related to lowering the internal impedance. The real part of the impedance at a given frequency is called ESR (equivalent series resistance). Several contributions are included in the ESR: the electrolyte resistance (including the separator), the active material resistance (with both ionic and electronic parts) and the active material/current collector interface resistance. The first two contributions have been intensively described and studied by many authors. The first part of this paper is focused on the use of surface treatments as a way to decrease the active material/current collector impedance. Al current collector foils have been treated following a two-step procedure: electrochemical etching and sol-gel coating by a highly-covering, conducting carbonaceous material. It aims to increase the Al foil/active material surface contact leading to lower resistance. In a second part, carbon-carbon supercapacitor impedance is discussed in term of complex capacitance and complex power from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data. This representation permits extraction of a relaxation time constant that provides important information on supercapacitor behaviour. The influence of carbon nanotubes addition on electrochemical performance of carbon/carbon supercapacitors has also been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.
