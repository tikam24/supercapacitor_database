Porous Mn2O3 nanocubics, which were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route followed by a calcination process, exhibited a specific capacitance of 191.1 F g-1 and a high rate capability with 58.6% specific capacitance retention even when the current density is increased by 50 times, and an excellent long-term cycle stability, and the fabricated simple symmetric supercapacitor was also fabricated and showed a good electrochemical performance, thus could be considered as a potential material for high-rate supercapacitors in some special applications that do not require a high capacitance.
