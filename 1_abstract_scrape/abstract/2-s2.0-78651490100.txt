Co-Ni layered double hydroxides (CoxNi1-xLDHs) were successfully synthesized by a 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA)-assisted hydrothermal process. Structural and morphological characterizations were performed using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results reveal that different morphologies of CoxNi1-xLDHs could be obtained by tuning the Co/Ni molar ratio. The CoxNi1-xLDHs exhibit petal-like nanospheres that are composed of nanoflakes at a Co molar fraction of 0.24. The LDH of this structure has a specific capacitance of 1735 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 as determined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge.
