We propose and demonstrate an extremely efficient annealing for the RuO2·xH2O nanoparticles incorporated in a supercapacitor employing intensely pulsed white light (IPWL). The IPWL process ensures the significant advantage of a room-temperature and millisecond-scaled process under ambient conditions. Resultant nanomorphology and crystallinity of RuO2·xH2O electrodes are analyzed for process optimization. Electrochemical characteristics of the IPWL-treated electrodes were investigated by cycle voltammetry, resulting in a specific capacitance of 439 F/g at 10 mV/s with the irradiated IPWL energy of 2.04 J/cm2 in 23 msec. © 2013, The Electrochemical Society, Inc.
