Metal hydroxychloride, as a new electrode material, shows an excellent electrochemical performance owing to the presence of abundant Cl− ions and hydroxyl groups. Herein, a single-phase quaternary M2(OH)3Cl based composite is constructed, for the first time, via a simple deep eutectic solvent annealing process, followed by the exposure to air at ambient temperature. Herein, this composite, denoted as M2(OH)3Cl-4/CoNi/N−C, is made up of ultrafine M2(OH)3Cl nanoparticles composed of Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+, CoNi alloy nanoparticles and N-doped carbon with a degree of graphitization. M2(OH)3Cl-4/CoNi/N−C exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 1576.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, exceeding the unary, binary and ternary metal hydroxychlorides, which is attributed to the synergistic effect among the four metals in M2(OH)3Cl and the formation of CoNi alloy nanoparticles and carbon substrates. Our findings offer promise for creating unique functional materials via combining multiple components with distinctive properties.
