The rational design and development of nanostructured materials having unique structural and superior electrochemical activity is urgently required for achieving ultra-high energy storage performance. In this regard, activated fullerene decorated over zinc cobaltite (A-C60-ZCO) has been synthesized and its performance evaluation was displayed towards supercapacitor application. As synthesized nanocomposite shows the enhanced specific capacitance of 593.2 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/S and retained the capacitance of 83.7% till 5000 cycles at a high current density of 8 A/g. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the hybrid nature of the prepared material, where A-C60 enhances the stability and conductivity and the ZCO enhances the charge storage owing to its pseudo capacitive nature. The incorporation of A-C60 immensely improved the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of the nanocomposite by enhancing hydrophilicity, conductivity, ion/electron transport ability, redox active functional groups and electroactive sites. Furthermore, the constructed flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device provided an energy density of 36.43 Wh/kg at a power density of 1681.47 W/kg, with a superior cycling performance of 91.06% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 6 A/g. Owing to the impressive electrochemical performance A-C60-ZCO can be considered as the potential candidate for supercapacitor application.
