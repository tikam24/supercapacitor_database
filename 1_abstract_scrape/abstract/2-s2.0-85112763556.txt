Pure V2O5 and MnO2/V2O5 hybrid nanocomposites were synthesized by microwave-assisted method for electrochemical supercapacitor application. X-ray diffraction analysis showed the orthorhombic structure for pure V2O5 and MnO2/V2O5 nanocomposites that showed the mixed state of the orthorhombic and orthogonal phase structure of V2O5 and MnO2. The average crystalline sizes were calculated as 14 nm and 17 nm for pure V2O5 and MnO2/V2O5 nanocomposites. Scanning electron microscopy and Field emission scanning electron microscopy image analysis demonstrated the mixed state of nanoplate and small rod-like shape for V2O5 and it was transformed to nanobeads shape by the addition of MnO2. The Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis confirmed the presence of V and Mn compounds in the as-prepared nanocomposites. The porous nature of nanostructures was studied by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis. Finally, the electrochemical analysis was recorded in 3.5 M KOH and 1 M H2SO4 electrolytes to compare its performance and suitability. The pure V2O5 nanostructure showed the maximum capacitance of 150 F/g and 95 F/g in KOH and H2SO4 electrolytes. The specific capacitance of V2O5 was enhanced to 570 F/g for the addition of 6 wt% of MnO2 in 3.5 M KOH electrolyte, whereas, in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the specific capacitance was 269 F/g for the addition of 6 wt% of MnO2.
