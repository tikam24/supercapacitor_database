Theory and application of new type compensator of active power variability are presented. Proposed compensator includes reversible power electronic converter with supercapacitor energy storage. The goal of the compensator operation is to stabilise source power whereas the load power is very variable. The parallel compensator controls the supply current according to average load. The running average current is calculated and source current control law is formulated. A difference between the load current and running average is used to determine the reference compensator current. Simulation results and laboratory tests of the system confirms the compensator operation.
