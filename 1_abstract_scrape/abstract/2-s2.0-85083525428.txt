Present work is focusing on the easy synthesis of MnO2@Polyaniline/Carbon nanotubes/Boron-doped graphene (MnO2@PCBG) freestanding, flexible film electrode as a highly efficient current collector and electrode material for supercapacitor application. Boron-doped graphene (BG), CNT and polyaniline (PANI) composite are used to prepare freestanding electrode on Ni foam as a template. PANI, BG and CNT have provided porosity, conducting nature and mechanical strength along with electrical double layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitive behaviours. MnO2 have deposited electrochemically on Polyaniline/Carbon nanotubes/Boron-doped Graphene (PCBG) freestanding material. The combination of EDLC and pseudocapacitive material in PCBG serve as an efficient current collector as well as an electrode for the electrodeposition of MnO2. MnO2@PCBG exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 1544 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, along with 84% cycling stability after 5000 cycles. Also, the as-prepared material shows the power density of 2353 W kg−1 and the energy density of 196 Wh kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The significant improvement in the performance of the MnO2@PCBG material might be due to the binder-free growth of MnO2 nanospheres on the highly efficient current collector.
