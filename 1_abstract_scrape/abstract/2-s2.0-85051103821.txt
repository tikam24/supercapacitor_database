Layer-by-layer approach for NiS, CoS and PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) is being fabricated. Metal sulfides have always been chosen for their remarkable electrochemical characteristics and wide beneficial domains, such as electrochemical energy conversion and storage. This work presents the preparation of cost-effective metal sulfides (NiS, NiS/CoS, NiS/CoS/PEDOT:PSS) developed on nickel foam sheets for supercapacitor (SC) applications. The assembled NiS/CoS/PEDOT:PSS array SC device exhibits an utmost energy density of 30.3 W h kg−1 and specific capacitance of 353 F g−1. All wet processing methods of fabrication accompanied with superior performance characteristics make these SCs very attractive for the next generation flexible energy storage systems.
