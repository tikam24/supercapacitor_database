To smooth the wind power output, the hybrid energy storage of wind turbine with wavelet packet-double fuzzy control is adopted to smooth out the wind power fluctuation. Firstly, using wavelet packet decomposition algorithm decompose the wind power output to obtain the grid-connected power signal and the power signal allocated to the hybrid energy storage; then, aiming for minimizing the combined annual fee of the energy storage system, a hybrid energy storage capacity optimization model is established taking into account the battery service life to determine the optimal cut-off point and energy storage capacity configuration for the power division of lithium battery and supercapacitor; finally, considering the battery and super capacitor charging state, adopting a fuzzy control algorithm optimize two different types of energy storage SOC(State of charge) and making a secondary amendment to the hybrid energy storage power allocation. The validity and economy of the proposed approach is confirmed by the simulation results.
