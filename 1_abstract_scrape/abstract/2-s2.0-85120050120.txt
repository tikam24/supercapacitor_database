Energy management strategy (EMS) of hybrid energy storage systems has an essential mission of ensuring safety, enhancing reliability and improving system efficiency. This paper focuses on optimizing sizing of HESS and parameters of EMS simultaneously. Firstly, an improved model is employed in adaptive predictive model control (AMPC). Secondly, in order to minimize the cost of supercapacitors and the capacity degradation of batteries at the same time, the multiple objective optimization problems are solved by Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D). The nine variables are decided including seven parameters of AMPC and series-parallel number of supercapacitors. Subsequently, the support vector machine combined with the gray wolf optimization algorithm (GWO-SVM) is employed to enhance the applicability of EMS. Finally, in order to prove the superiority of the proposed EMS, a combined cycle and a real cycle are performed for validation. The results illustrate that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of the system and enhance the life span of the battery. Comparing with AMPC-only, the total energy loss can be reduced by at least 17.9%. A reduction of not less than 8.8% in RMS of battery current is obtained. The Ah-throughput can be reduced by at least 2.5%. In further discussions, the superiority of MOEA/D and GWO-SVM is proved by comparing with other methods.
