In the present investigation, we have successfully assembled symmetric supercapacitor device based on cobalt hydroxide [Co(OH)2] thin film electrodes using 1 M KOH as an electrolyte. Initially, potentiodynamic electrodeposition method is employed for the preparation of Co(OH)2 thin films onto stainless steel substrate. These films are characterized for structural and morphological elucidations using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The XRD reveals formation of β-Co(OH)2 material with hexagonal crystal structure. The SEM images show formation of nanoflakes like microstructure with average flake width 100 nm. Electrochemical characterizations of Co(OH)2 based symmetric supercapacitor cell are carried out using cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. In the performance evaluation the maximum values of specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power are encountered as 44 F g-1, 3.96 Wh kg-1 and 42 kW kg-1. The value of equivalent series resistance (ESR) is estimated as 2.3 Ω using EIS. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
