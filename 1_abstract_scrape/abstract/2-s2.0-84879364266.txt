Template-free and direct-grown poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) nanowires/carbon cloth (PEDOT-NWs/CC) nanocomposite is successfully fabricated via electrochemical polymerization for hierarchical supercapacitor electrodes in neutral aqueous electrolyte of Na2SO4. The uniform distribution of PEDOT-NWs with 60-80 nm in diameter and several microns in length, and their characteristics of infrared absorption are determined by SEM and FTIR, respectively. The electrochemical impedance analysis is performed to probe the diffusion characteristics of PEDOT-NWs/CC electrode. Moreover, high gravimetric capacitance of 256.1 F g-1 at a specific energy of 182.1 Wh kg-1 and a specific power of 13.1 kW kg-1 is obtained under a wide operated potential of 1.6 V. These results clearly present a cost-effective and simple method of fabrication of the nanostructured polymers with enormous potential in flexible energy storage device applications.
