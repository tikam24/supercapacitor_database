Lead-acid batteries are widely used in the conventional cars as a main electrical energy storage system to supply the power for the following start. In this paper, the efficacy of lead batteries was evaluated and compared against ultra-capacitors and alternative battery designs via a simulation-based model of the complete process. Specifically, several parameters were assessed such as the weight and reliability. The results confirm the consistency of lead-acid batteries as an appropriate replacement to super-capacitors. The findings were also confirmed by actual measurements carried out in the car.
