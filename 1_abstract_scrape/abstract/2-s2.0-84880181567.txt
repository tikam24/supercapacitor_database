The present communication reports on the first preparation of Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes array on Ni foam, carried out by hydrothermal treatment of Ni foam in acidic medium without the presence of extra nickel salt. We further demonstrate the application of such Ni(OH)2/Ni foam as a binder-free electrode material for supercapacitors. It is found that it can deliver high capacities of 1228F/g and 918F/g at 5A/g and 30 A/g, respectively, with excellent cycling stability. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
