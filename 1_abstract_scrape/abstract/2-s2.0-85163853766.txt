Amidst different types of energy storage systems, electrochemical supercapacitors have received considerable attention as they close the gap between electrolytic capacitors and batteries. This work addresses electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), a type of electrochemical supercapacitor, and has been divided into two parts. In the former, the synthesis and characterization of activated carbon fiber-felt (ACFF) electrodes, derived from textile PAN-based fiber, have been provided. In the latter, the electrochemical characterization of EDLCs in potassium hydroxide solutions (aqueous electrolytes) and in potassium hydroxide-glycerol hybrid electrolytes (glycerol-based electrolytes) have been investigated. The synthesis of ACFF electrodes via two-step oxidation, carbonization, and physical activation resulted in low-cost and binder-free electrodes containing 87% of the total volume of pores as micropores (maximum pore width of 3 nm) and a high specific surface area of 1875 m2 g−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge–discharge techniques were carried out in a symmetric two-electrode setup at room temperature. The results showed that ACFF electrodes are suitable for aqueous electrolytes, particularly 2 M KOH, and KOH:GLY (3:1), a glycerol-based electrolyte. Although KOH:GLY (3:1) exhibited high electrolyte resistance (34 ± 3 Ω), this hybrid green-electrolyte supports a potential window that is twice greater than that of aqueous electrolytes. In addition, glycerol, commonly called glycerin, is a by-product of FAME (fatty acid methyl ester) biodiesel, which is the major source of glycerol. Glycerol-based electrolytes are promising green electrolytes for EDLCs. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease its viscosity and resistance. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
