In this study, we report a facile electrochemical method to obtain polyaniline/single-wall carbon nanotubes (PANI/SWCNTs) composite electrodes by combining the electroreduction of diazonium salts and electropolymerization of conductive polymers. In a first step, the SWCNTs are covalently functionalized with diphenyl amine through the electrochemical reduction of the 4- aminodiphenylamine diazonium salt in order to provide anchors for the subsequent polymer electrodepostion. The aniline oxidation remains possible on this grafted layer and PANI can easily be deposited on the diphenyl amine-modified electrodes. The electrochemically deposited PANI/SWCNTs composites exhibit excellent electrochemical charge storage properties making them promising electrode materials for high power supercapacitors.
