Novel hybrid, composed of α-MnS nanoparticles uniformly anchored on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets was fabricated by one-pot solvothermal approach. The α-MnS/N-rGO hybrid exhibited high electrochemical performance. As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the specific capacitance of hybrid reaches as high as 933.6 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1, and still remains 469.1 F g-1 even at a high discharge current density of 20 A g-1. To further explore the capacitive performance of the α-MnS/N-rGO hybrid, an asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) device was assembled using the α-MnS/N-rGO hybrid as positive electrode and N-rGO as negative electrode. The fabricated α-MnS/N-rGO hybrid//N-rGO ASC delivers the highest energy density of 27.7 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 800 W kg-1, and still retains 16.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 20 kW kg-1. The impressive results enable the α-MnS/N-rGO hybrid to be a promising material for energy storage applications.
