Nanomaterials based on nickel oxide (NiO) have been proposed as one of most promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors. However, their limited electrical conductivity leads to low specific capacitance and unsatisfactory cycling stability. In addition, traditional electrode preparation affects their electrochemical performances. Here, we develop a facile and effective strategy to fabricate hybrid films from NiO and oxygenated carbon nanotubes (OCNT) by filtration. The hybrid film is directly used for electrodes in electrochemical investigations and reveals superior electrochemical properties. By optimizing the ratio of two species; the as-obtained hybrid film electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance, good rate capability and considerable energy density. The superiority can be contributed to the synergistic effect of two species.
