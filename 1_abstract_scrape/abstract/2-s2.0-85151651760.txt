Wearable supercapacitors are a novel generation in energy storage systems to be incorporated in wearable electronic devices, introducing benefits for energy autonomy and integration, ease of operation and high-efficiency for components. The typical drawbacks of conventional supercapacitors can be circumvented in wearable devices by the adequate project of electrodes, gel polymer electrolytes, and the design of current collectors in truly flexible supercapacitor reinforced by specific capacitance and potential window. Herein, this paper reviews the state-of-art in the design of electrodes, electrolytes, and devices assembled to optimize the performance and autonomy of wearable electronic devices.
