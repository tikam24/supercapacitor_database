In the case of microgrid (MG) systems, the choice of the right configuration plays a vital role to meet grid/load necessities when integrating low voltage, non-linear and highly sensitive (to environmental conditions) power sources such as solar PV modules, batteries and supercapacitors (SCs), etc. In the case of MG systems, the choice of the right configuration and the appropriate type of power converters in any application can have a significant impact on the optimum performance. Numerous architectures have been proposed for the integration of various energy sources to achieve optimum performance. A large number of research articles have been published in these areas. In this article, the detailed organization of various architectures based on the arrangement of various sources and detailed analyses is presented along with a discussion on those architectures. Moreover, the suitability of all the reviewed architectures based on driving factors such as (a) high conversion gain, (b) good power decoupling, (c) high efficiency, (d) isolation, (e) power-handling capabilities and (f) compact design is presented in the discussions section. The critical examination and comparative study presented in this work can assist both industry personnel and academicians in selecting the best architectural and power converter topologies required for optimum performance.
