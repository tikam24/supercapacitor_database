Redox electroactive species have been widely used as redox additives in electrolytes or modifiers for carbon-based electrodes to increase the charge storage capacity of supercapacitors. Here, redox electroactive group-modified carbon cloth (ROCC-DAA) was designed to improve its electrochemical property as flexible electrode for supercapacitors, by facile covalent modification of the oxidized carbon cloth (OCC) with 1,5-diaminoanthraquinone (DAA) and reduction with hydrazine. The resultant DAA modified reduced OCC (ROCC-DAA) electrode possessed a high areal specific capacitance of 921 m F/cm2 at 1.0 mA/cm2 and outstanding cycling stability with retention of 116 % after 20000 cycles in 1.0 M H2SO4. The proposed flexible ROCC-DAA electrode possessed much higher electrochemical capacitive performance than the reported anthraquinone-modified carbon electrodes, and such excellent electrochemical property makes it a promising flexible electrode for high performance solid-state supercapacitors.
