Three-dimensional self-assembled graphene hydrogels (SGHs) have been fabricated by chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) with sodium ascorbate. The SGHs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, rheological tests, electrical conductivity measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman spectroscopy. Results indicate that the reduction of GO promotes the assembly of graphene sheets. The SGHs are electrically conductive (1S 路 m-1) and mechanically strong and exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. In 1 mol路L-1 aqueous solution of H2SO4, the specific capacitance of SGHs was measured to be about 240F 路 g-1 at a discharge current density of 1.2A 路 g-1.
