Ruthenium/mesoporous carbon (Ru/MC) composites for supercapacitors were synthesized from RuCl3 and peanut shell-derived MC by a microwave-assisted heating glycol reduction method. The specific capacitance of obtained Ru/MC composite increased with the increasing Ru mass loaded, maintaining 287 F g-1 even after 1000 cycles at 20% loading of Ru for Ru20/MC. The contribution of Ru nanoparticles reached 48.7% of the total capacitance. The energy density of Ru20/MC capacitor in 6 M KOH electrolyte only dropped from 10.5 Wh kg-1 to 9.8 Wh kg-1 with the energy density retention of 93.3% after 1000 cycles, showing excellent cycle stability. The results indicate that the one-step microwave-assisted glycol reduction of RuCl3 is a simple technique to the preparation of high performance Ru/MC composites for supercapacitors.
