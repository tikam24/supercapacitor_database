We propose an energy-harvesting management unit to interface a PV harvester with a storage supercapacitor while generating a 1V regulated supply VREG. Direct connection between stacked PV cells and VREG allows virtual 100% conversion efficiency between the harvester and the supplied circuits, while the use of a single bidirectional switched-capacitor DC/DC converter between VREG and the supercap allows 0.48mm2 area in a 65nm IoT vision SoC with a single external filtering capacitor. To cope with the 0-3V charge-dependent supercap voltage range and the wide 5Î¼W-10mW harvester/load power range, the converter features adaptive selection between multiple voltage gains and power modes.
