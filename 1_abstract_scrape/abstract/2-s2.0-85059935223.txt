Monoclinic VO 2 nanorod thin films were deposited on indium‑tin-oxide-coated glass substrates using radio-frequency reactive magnetron sputtering at a substrate temperature of 300 °C and various O 2 flow rates. The thin films were characterized via standard analysis techniques. The VO 2 thin films exhibited a highly crystalline monoclinic phase with an indirect band gap of ~1.73 eV. At optimized O 2 flow rate (4 sccm), the thin films was observed nanorod structures, exhibited a remarkable photocurrent of ~0.08 mA cm −2 during photoelectrochemical water splitting in the visible region. Electrochemical performance tests of the nanorod films revealed a specific capacitance of ~486 mF cm −2 at a scan rate of 10 mVs −1 . In addition, amperometric I–t curves showed that VO 2 thin film electrodes were highly stable during the photo-oxidation process. The nanorod films also exhibited a good specific capacitance of ~120 mF cm −2 after 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs −1 . The photocurrents during photoelectrochemical water splitting and the specific capacitance of VO 2 thin films deposited at O 2 flow rates of 2 and 6 sccm were 0.06 and 0.07 mA cm −2 and 398 and 37 mF cm −2 , respectively. The films deposited under Ar at 8 sccm and O 2 at 4 sccm showed the highest photoelectrochemical water splitting performance and specific capacitance, owing mainly to their nanorod-like morphology.
