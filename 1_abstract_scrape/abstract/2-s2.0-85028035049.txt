In this report, the prototype of micro-supercapacitor (MSC) arrays based on the art of paper folding (Miura folding) were demonstrated as foldable and miniaturized energy storage components. The Miura folding is a method to fold a flat surface into crease patterns consisting of parallelograms with smaller areas. Here each MSC unit was made by deposition of conductive graphene sheets followed by plasma etching to form the interdigitated patterns. The single MSC unit delivered a large areal capacitance of 1.5 mF/cm2 with excellent power handling capability. The foldable MSC arrays consisting of 3Ã—2 patterns were connected via combinations of series and parallel configurations. The folded MSCs showed ~4.3 times increase in areal capacitance with improved energy densities.
