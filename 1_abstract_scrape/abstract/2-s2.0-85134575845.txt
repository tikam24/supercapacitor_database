Three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure materials exhibit great electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. Here, 3D WO3 nanotube bundles were fabricated on carbon cloth, showing a large specific capacitance of 743 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and superior stability with the capacity retention of about 95% after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance stems from the self-supported electrode, unique 3D structure, and special tube-like morphology.
