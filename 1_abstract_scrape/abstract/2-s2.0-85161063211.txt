Herein, we report the synthesis of pure and Ni-doped SnS nanoparticles (NPs) using a simple and low-cost solvothermal method. The Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show the flower-like morphology of Ni-doped sample. The supercapacitor performance of pure and doped electrodes was studied through cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The Ni-doped electrode displays a higher specific capacitance (Cp) of 47 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s through CV studies. Further, the Ni-doped electrodes showed Cp of 40 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g, provided specific energy (SE) of 5.5 Wh/Kg and high specific power (SP) of 250 W/kg than that of the pure SnS electrode. The optimized Ni-doped electrode retained retention of 97 % with excellent coulombic efficiency of 98 % after 2000 cycles.
