Conductive hydrogels (CHs) are ideal electrolyte materials for the preparation of flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) due to their excellent electrochemical properties, mechanical properties, and deformation restorability. However, most of the reported CHs are prepared by the chemical crosslinking of synthetic polymers and thus usually display the disadvantages of poor self-healing abilities and nonadaptability at environmental temperatures, which greatly limits their application. To overcome these problems, in the present work, we constructed a sodium alginate-borax/gelatin double-network conductive hydrogel (CH) by a dynamic crosslinking between sodium alginate (SA) and borax via borate bonds and hydrogen bonding between amino acids in gelatin and SA chains. The CH displays an excellent elongation of 305.7% and fast self-healing behavior in 60 s. Furthermore, a phase-change material (PCM), Na2SO4·10H2O, was introduced into the CH, which, combined with the nucleation effect of borax, improved the ionic conductivity and temperature adaptability of the CH. The flexible supercapacitor (FSC) assembled with the obtained CH as the electrolyte exhibits a high specific capacitance of 185.3 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.25 A·g-1 and good stability with 84% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles and excellent temperature tolerance with a resistance variation of 2.11 ω in the temperature range of -20-60 °C. This green CH shows great application potential as an electrolyte for FSCs, and the preparation method can be potentially expanded to the fabrication of self-repairing FSCs with good temperature adaptabilities.
