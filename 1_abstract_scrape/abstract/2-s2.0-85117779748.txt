MXene/Ag2CrO4 nanocomposite was synthesized effectively by means of superficial low-cost co-precipitation technique in order to inspect its capacitive storage potential for supercapacitors. MXene was etched from MAX powder and Ag2CrO4 spinel was synthesized by an easy sol-gel scheme. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) revealed an addition in inter-planar spacing from 4.7 Å to 6.2 Å while Ag2CrO4 nanoparticles diffused in form of clusters over MXene layers that had been explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) demonstrated the elemental analysis. Raman spectroscopy opens the gap between bonding structure of as-synthesized nanocomposite. From photoluminence (PL) spectra the energy band gap value 3.86 eV was estimated. Electrode properties were characterized by applying electrochemical observations such as cyclic voltammetry along with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for understanding redox mechanism and electron transfer rate constant Kapp. Additionally, this novel work will be an assessment to analyze the capacitive behavior of electrode in different electrolytes such as in acidic of 0.1 M H2SO4 has specific capacitance Csp = 525 F/g at 10 mVs-1 and much low value in basic of 1 M KOH electrolyte. This paper reflects the novel synthesis and applications of MXene/Ag2CrO4 nanocomposite electrode fabrication in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors.
