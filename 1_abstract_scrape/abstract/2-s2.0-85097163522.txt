Designing advanced hybrid supercapacitors (SCs) with high energy density and long-term cycling stability remains a vital hurdle. We introduce CoSnO3, a battery anode material, to the SCs as a positive electrode through a simple synthesis of unique mesoporous CoSnO3 nanorods@reduced graphene oxide (RGO) composite, which delivers a specific capacity of 855.9 C g−1 (1902 F g−1). A porous boron-doped RGO nanosheets (B-RGO) electrode fabricated provides a remarkable specific capacity of 305.2 C g−1 (254.4 F g−1) in 2 M KOH. Hybrid supercapacitor constructed with CoSnO3@RGO composite (positive electrode) and B-RGO nanosheets (negative electrode) has a voltage window of 1.5 V with a specific capacity of 286.1 C g−1 (190.7 F g−1) at 2 A g−1. The assembled device provides a remarkable energy density of 76.1 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 1915.8 W kg−1. It is also endowed with suitable cycling stability, retaining more than 93% of its capacity after 10,000 cycles.
