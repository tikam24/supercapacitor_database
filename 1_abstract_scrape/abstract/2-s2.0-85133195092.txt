The importance of the Micro grid is increasing day to day because of reducing transmission cost, In comparison to the grid, microgrids have more renewable energy sources and it is easier to spot faults. If the main grid goes down, the microgrid can keep consumers comfortable by supplying power to homes and businesses for a while. The microgrid is best suitable in hilly areas and remote locations. Microgrid delivers important loads with a high-quality, consistent energy supply. This paper presents a Power quality improvement in Micro Grid used SRF theory. The microgrid is the interconnection of hybrid sources and load. The hybrid sources are PV cell, Fuel Cell, and Super Capacitor. By integrating these small sources, microgrids are implemented in generating the electrical power at load demand. The voltage and reactive power support to the external grid are examined using rDSTATCOM deployed at various locations throughout the microgrid. The simulation results were verified in MATLAB/SIMULINK software.
