The development of advanced electrode materials with high specific capacitance and wide voltage window is of great importance in improving the low energy density of aqueous supercapacitors (ASCs). Herein, a novel heteroatoms doped 3 D porous carbon decorated with 0 D carbon dots is prepared from egg whites and yolks. The unique honeycomb-like interconnected pore structure and multi-component feature endows the prepared material with specific surface area (1999.3 m2/g), high pore volume (1.22 cm3/g) with abundant micropores (0.67 cm3/g) and multi-doped heteroatoms including P, S, O and N, leading to excellent specific capacitance of 472.9 F/g at 1 A/g. More importantly, the symmetric supercapacitor assembled from the prepared porous carbon exhibits the voltage window as high as 2.6 V in 1.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Hence, the symmetric supercapacitor achieves a leap forward in energy density (107.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 650 W/kg and maintains about 65.2 Wh/kg at 26,000 W/kg) relative to other ASCs. These preeminent results provide important insight for the design of aqueous symmetric carbon-based supercapacitor with ultrahigh voltage window and energy density.
