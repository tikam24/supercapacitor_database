Energy storage device with high energy density at high power density is of particular importance for various applications, such as hybrid vehicles. Next generation high performance hybrid supercapacitor using organic electrolyte is able to provide high operation voltage as well as enhanced energy density. However, the energy density at high power density is usually low, partly due to the slow electrode kinetics at high current densities. In this contribution, we report a facile preparation method for orthorhombic phase niobium oxide (T-Nb2O5) nanowire structure with ultra-thin carbon coating, which shows stable high rate Li+ storage ability. A prototype of 3V hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated using carbon coated T-Nb2O5 as anode and commercially available activated carbon as cathode. This hybrid device shows high energy density of 43.4Whkg-1 and a high power density of 7.5kWkg-1 with excellent stability.
