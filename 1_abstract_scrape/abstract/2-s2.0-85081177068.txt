This paper examines the effects of the aging condition and the operating temperature on the supercapacitor Peukert constant associated with a constant current discharge process. Recent studies show that the charge delivered by a supercapacitor during a constant current discharge process increases when the discharge current decreases if the discharge current is above a certain threshold, i.e., Peukert's law applies. By sweeping the cutoff voltage of the discharge process, this paper reveals that the Peukert constant increases when the supercapacitor is more heavily aged or the operating temperature is lower. The physical mechanisms leading to the Peukert constant dependence are analyzed by simulating a five-branch RC ladder circuit model.
