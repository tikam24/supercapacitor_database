This paper investigates the effect of using a proposed supercapacitor-based mitigation method to mitigate switching overvoltages (SOVs) on a microgrid system. At first, the effectiveness of the new proposed supercapacitor-based mitigation method performance is evaluated. Then, a comparison between a traditional SOV mitigation method, such as surge arrester, and the proposed supercapacitor mitigation method is studied. SOVs result due to unsymmetrical switching operation during de-energization procedures. The Î¼G 2 operational modes, grid-connected mode and isolated mode, are taken into consideration in this study. A small hydro generation unit and 3 variable speed, doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbines are the main renewable power generation units in the investigated microgrid system. Alternating transient program is used in this study for simulating of the investigated microgrid.
