A pulsed laser deposition process using ozone as an oxidant is developed to synthesize manganese oxide nanosheet arrays, which display excellent rate capability (52% capacity retention at 100 A g-1), comparable capacitance (337 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and long cycle life (without degradation after 6000 cycles).
