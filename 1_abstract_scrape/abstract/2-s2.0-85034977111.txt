In this work, we, for the first time, have designed and fabricated V2O5/Ni3S2 nanoflakes on a nickel foam substrate by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared V2O5/Ni3S2 nanoflake active electrode exhibited high-performance lithium-ion storage and superior supercapacitor properties. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, the V2O5/Ni3S2 nanoflakes exhibited a discharge capacity of 435 mA h g-1 in the 600th cycle, demonstrating their excellent cycling and rate performances. As an electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors, it presented an areal capacitance of 4.2 F cm-2 at a current density of 5 mA cm-2. Theoretical analysis reveals that the diffusion-controlled storage process is dominant in the total capacitance, attributed to the p-n V2O5/Ni3S2 heterojunctions. The results illustrate that the V2O5/Ni3S2 nanoflakes have a wide range of potential applications in the energy storage field.
