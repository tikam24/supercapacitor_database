In this study, we have introduced a facile, effective and low-cost process of in-situ vulcanization for preparing α-MnS@C composite via simple calcination-thermolysis of one manganese coordination polymer (CP-1-ZX). In this procedure, the 1D chain [-Mn-SO4-]∞ in CP-1-ZX is completely reduced into α-MnS by the as-synthesized carbon. So the in-situ vulcanization provides an atom-economy route to fabricate sulfides by using least synthetic steps and sulfur sources. The α-MnS@C composite maintains the microball morphology of CP-1-ZX precursor, which is composed of many core–shell nanoparticles. Due to high porosity, hierarchical pores and good conductivity, the specific capacitance of α-MnS@C is up to 856F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and keeps 82% retention after 5000 cycles. Meanwhile, one asymmetric supercapacitor cell (ASC) is assembled by combining α-MnS@C with commercial active carbon (AC). The α-MnS@C//AC device delivers prominent energy density of 28.4 Wh kg−1 at power density of 395 W kg−1, and still retains 17.8 Wh kg−1 at 8020 W kg−1. Furthmore, four tandem ASC devices can brightly glow a lamp bulb for 30 s. Therefore, the α-MnS@C composite shows great applications in supercapacitors.
