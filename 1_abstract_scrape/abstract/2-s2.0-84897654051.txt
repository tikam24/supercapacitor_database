We demonstrate optimized supercapacitive characteristics of electrodeposited polyaniline by adding organic salt into electrolyte. The optimum amount of the organic salt is found to be 2 wt % which provides better ionic conductivity of the electrolyte, leading to the improved specific capacitance of 259 Fg-1. This capacitance remains at up to 208 Fg-1 (80% capacity retention) after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. The optimized organic salt added electrolyte causes better rate performance and higher cyclability. Significantly reduced electrochemical charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface results in the increased ionic conductivity, which can be useful in electrochemically preferred power devices for better applicability. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
