Highly graphitic porous carbon was derived from kelp biomass and prepared using KOH as the main activating agent with K2FeO4 as the assisting activated agent for supercapacitor applications. The optimum K2FeO4 mass in the total activating agent and temperature were investigated. The characterization results showed porous sheet carbon with a high specific surface area of 2868 m2 g−1 and a low ID/IG of 0.909. It delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 438 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. In addition, the assembled supercapacitor device reached the highest energy density of 19.9 W h kg−1 with a power density of 398 W kg−1
