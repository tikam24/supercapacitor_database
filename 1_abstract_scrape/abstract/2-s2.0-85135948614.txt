Nickel aluminate-graphene quantum dots (NiAl2O4/GQDs) composite is a nanostructured material which offers synergistic behavior and multifunctionality. The high porosity, biocompatibility, low-cost preparation and electrocatalytic performance of spinel nickel aluminate has been merged with high electrical conductivity of graphene quantum dots. The NiAl2O4/GQDs composite was characterized through SEM, TEM, XPS, EDX, IR techniques and porosimetry. The cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements allowed to investigate the electrochemical performance. The composite shows enhanced supercapacitive and electrocatalytic performance with respect to the pristine NiAl2O4. The NiAl2O4/GQDs-modified gold electrode has been applied to develop an electrochemical method for glucose detection. The constructed biosensor allowed to sense glucose in serum of diabetes patients.
