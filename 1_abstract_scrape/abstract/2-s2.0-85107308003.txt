There is a huge requirement for renewable energy resources to avoid the usage of fossil fuel attracted the researchers to work on the energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors. Herein, the novel synthesis of CeO2@MoS2@rGO (CeMG) ternary composite by two step microwave synthetic route that will be employed as an outstanding electrode material for supercapacitor. In particular, the morphology studies confirm that the cerium oxide has spherical morphology with the controlled size in the range of 12–15 nm embedded with the layered sheets of MoS2 and reduced graphene oxide. The CeMG composites exhibit excellent specific capacitance of 635 F g−1 which is achieved at the current density of 1 A g−1 compared to the pure CeO2. In addition, prolonged cyclic stability with 88.9% capacitance is retained after 10,000 cycles of charging and discharging.
