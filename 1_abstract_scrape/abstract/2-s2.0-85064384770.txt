Herein, a general strategy is provided to construct N-doped carbon-confined MoO2 and MnO by the hydrothermal process, polymerization process and carbonation process, which serves as negative electrode and positive electrode for hybrid supercapacitors. The N-doped carbon as shell can provide fast electron pathways and short ion diffusion paths, resulting in the improved performances at the high rates. Consequently, the obtained N-doped carbon-confined MoO2 and MnO possess the good electrochemical performances, including high specific capacitance, excellent cycling stability and good rate capability. Furthermore, the as-fabricated hybrid supercapacitor using N-doped carbon-confined MoO2 and MnO shows a high energy density up to 44.82 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 900 W kg−1, as well as good cycling performance. This work may provide a general strategy for constructing high-performance energy storage devices.
