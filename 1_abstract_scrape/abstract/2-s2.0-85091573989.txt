Stimulated by the distinguished merits of solid−phase synthesis for nano−structural transition metal sulfides, herein we develop a novel solid−phase route for targetedly synthesizing NiS and NiS2 nanoparticles. Pure α−NiS and pyrite NiS2 nanoparticles are facilely synthesized by thermally treating a mixture of nickel formate and elemental sulfur powder in a sealed steel autoclave under ambient atmosphere. The obtained NiS and NiS2 nanoparticles exhibit a 3D network morphology constructed by the irregular nanoparticles with a diameter of no more than 200 nm and a well−dispersive nano−spherical morphology with an average diameter of ca 80 nm, respectively. Ascribing to the special nano morphology, the α−NiS and pyrite NiS2 nanoparticles exhibit a high specific capacitance of 875.5 F g−1 and 1072.6 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The hybrid supercapacitor constructed by applying the obtained pyrite NiS2 nanoparticles as positive electrode and a porous carbon nanosheet as negative electrode exhibit a high specific capacitance of up to 152.3 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and more than 83.7% of initial specific capacitance are retained after 10,000 cycles. A high specific energy of 54.20 Wh kg−1 is arrived at a specific power of 0.94 kW kg−1.
