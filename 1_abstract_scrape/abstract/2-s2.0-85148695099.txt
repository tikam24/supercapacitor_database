Supercapacitors are outstanding electrochemical energy storage devices with high power density, quick charge and discharge and long cycle life. A well-designed structure can significantly increase its electrochemical performance as electrode materials. Carbon nanofibers (CNFs) made by electrospinning technique feature a one-dimensional nanostructure, which can provide directional electron transfer pathways and reduce the internal resistance of materials. This article reviewed the design approaches for one-dimensional nanostructured electrode materials produced from CNFs for supercapacitors, focusing on porous structure design, hollow structure design, surface functional group structure design and core-shell structure design. The porous and hollow structural designs could improve the contact area between electrode and electrolyte, allowing for faster electron/ion transport. Surface functional group structure design had the potential to improve the surface chemical properties of electrode materials, therefore enhancing their capacitance characteristics. The core-shell structure design might result in layered channels, and the diverse components of the core and shell could work together to increase the conductivity and structural stability of electrode materials. The preparation methods and structural properties of these CNF electrode materials with different structural designs were highlighted, as well as their future development.
