Light rare earth (LRE3+) ions-doped Ta2O5 semiconductor material is synthesized via coprecipitation method with the bandgap energy of 3.94–4.05 eV and an orthorhombic geometry with 74.49 nm size. The rare earth-modified Ta2O5 improves the photovoltaic functionality of the fully ambient perovskite solar cell by efficient extraction of electrons and blocking of the holes. The device achieved an efficiency of 13.36% with 63% of fill factor and negligible hysteresis index. LRE3+ triply doped Ta2O5 is used for the fabrication of an electrode by decorating on the nickel foam. This electrode outperforms the conventionally used materials by achieving a specific capacitance of 517.5 F g−1 marked by fast reaction kinetics and diffusion with an equivalent series resistance of 0.18 Ω. LRE3+-doped Ta2O5 is proved to be an excellent electrode material with the characteristic electric double-layer capacitance behavior in conjugation with the Faradic pseudocapacitive behavior. Finally, the electrocatalysis using this material indicates its excellence as a H2 generating catalyst in comparison to O2 generation with the smallest overpotential and Tafel slope values of 143 mV and 125.3 mV dec−1, respectively. The designed electrode expressed an exceptional stability over ambient conditions as well as inside an electrolyte.
