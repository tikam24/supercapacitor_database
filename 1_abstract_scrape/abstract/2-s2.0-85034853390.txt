There are ever increasing interests in three dimensional (3D) graphene for the construction of wearable electrics and flexible energy storage devices. Herein, we report a 3D porous graphene supported polyaniline (PANI) nanoarrays composite with enhanced interface bonding and high load fraction of PANI for supercapacitor application. We demonstrate that by utilizing benzenesulfonic acid functionalization followed by a pre-immersion treatment, surface chemistry and permeability of the porous graphene can be improved significantly, which favors the controllable growth of high-quality PANI nanoarrays. The resulting composite used as a freestanding electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, hence a maximum specific capacitance of 752 F/g with retention of 90.8% over 10000 cycles was achieved.
