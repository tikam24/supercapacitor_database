Novel flower-like g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 heterojunction with high supercapacitor performance has been successfully synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal process. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 heterojunction are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests, which indicate the optimal g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 532.7 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 and excellent cycling stability with 88.6% of capacitance retention at 1 A g −1 after 1000 cycles. The enhanced electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the combination of g-C 3 N 4 and flower-like MoS 2 , which provides excellent charge transfer field and electrolyte diffusion channels while effectively prevents the corruption and aggregation during charging and discharging process. More importantly, our work provides a fresh insight into designing high-performance electrode heterojunction and extending the actual application of g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 .
