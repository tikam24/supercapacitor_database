The rational design of carbon materials with high electrical conductivity, low tortuosity, large specific surface area, and sufficient heteroatom doping for high-performance supercapacitor application is highly desired but remains as a major challenge. Herein, by templating the natural microtubular and thin-walled structure of willow catkin, a highly conductive nitrogen-doped hollow carbon microtube material was synthesized through an integrated procedure including polymerization, pyrolysis, and activation. Robust N-doped crosslinked graphene was grafted on the internal and external walls of carbonized hollow catkin to form a sandwich structure of the derived carbon. The obtained carbon microtubes exhibit a large specific surface area (2608 m2 g−1), short and unimpeded ion-diffusion paths, high-level heteroatom doping (O: 12.5 at %, N: 3.4 at %), and excellent electrical conductivity (128 S m−1). Benefitting from its desirable textural properties and favorable elemental composition, the derived electrode, without the addition of conductive additives, delivers impressive capacitance values of 408 F g−1 (0.5 A g−1) in 6 M KOH electrolyte and 420.8 F g−1 (1 A g−1) in 1 M H2SO4, as well as an outstanding rate capability and excellent cycling stability. In addition, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays an ultrahigh energy density of 27.3 Wh kg−1 at 182 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. These advanced characteristics ensure the carbon microtubes hold great promise for energy storage/conversion applications.
