A copolymer of ortho phenylenediamine and aniline was synthesised by a microwave assisted technique. Acid functionalised carbon nanotubes were incorporated into the polymer matrix. The copolymer and the nanocomposite were extensively characterised using spectral, morphological and thermal analysis techniques. Fabric-based supercapacitor devices were fabricated using these materials and their electrochemical properties were analyzed. Both the copolymer and the nanocomposite exhibited a high specific capacitance of 147.14 F g−1 at 0.50 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 82%. A low relaxation time constant of 4.5 ms was observed for the fabricated device using the nanocomposite. The copolymer and the nanocomposite were also subjected to in vitro cytotoxicity studies and they showed high biocompatibility. Due to their enhanced electrochemical performance coupled with biocompatibility, these materials can be expected to exhibit great promise as an alternative to traditional supercapacitors.
