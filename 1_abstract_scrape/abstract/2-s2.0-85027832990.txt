Coprinus comatus-based nitrogen-doped activated carbon (N-ACC) is prepared by chemical activation and nitrogen-doped methods. The N-ACC possesses large specific surface areas (976.96m2g-1), high nitrogen contents (11.53wt.%), and super hydrophilicity. As electrode material for supercapacitors, the N-ACC shows remarkable electrochemical performance, such as 346Fg-1 maximum specific capacitance at a current density of 1Ag-1, which retains 260Fg-1 even at a high current density of 10Ag-1 (about 75% capacitance retention) in 2M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The assembled N-ACC//N-ACC symmetric supercapacitor exhibits energy density of 14.63Whkg-1 at power density of 810W kg-1, and excellent cycling stability with 92% specific capacitance retention after 10000 cycles in the voltage range 0-1.8V in 0.5M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. These results indicate that the N-ACC as electrode materials can be used for high performance supercapacitors.
