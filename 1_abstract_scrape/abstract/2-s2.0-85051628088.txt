Fast supercapacitors that can be charged and discharged at tens of hertz high frequency are reported using binder-free electrodes of MoS2 nanosheets grown on plasma pyrolyzed cellulose microfiber (pCMF) paper. Rapid plasma pyrolysis was applied to obtain highly conductive carbon fiber sheet from conventional cellulose filter paper to be used as a scaffold, on which MoS2 nanosheets were grown vertically wrapped around carbon microfibers in a hydrothermal reaction. Such binder-free MoS2-pCMF electrode based supercapacitor demonstrated fast-rate performance in an aqueous electrolyte with a cutoff frequency of 103 Hz. A large specific capacitance density of 125 mF cm−2 was also measured. The organic electrolyte cell of these electrodes exhibited a power density of 12.05 W cm-3 at a rate of 15 V s−1. These MoS2-pCMF electrodes were highly stable. In a cycling test at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, the cell maintained its capacitance with trivial degradation in 50,000 cycles.
