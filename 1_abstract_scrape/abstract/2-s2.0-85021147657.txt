A novel benzimidazole appended arylimide (pyromellitic, naphthalene and perylene) based covalent organic framework (COF) has been synthesized through the condensation polymerization pathway, by taking consideration of the special noncovalent interaction with carbon dioxide. Formation and chemical connectivities of these polymers were thoroughly investigated by 13C NMR and FTIR studies. Presences of pores in these polymers have been primarily checked with FESEM and HRTEM observations, prior to adsorption studies. The pyromellitic diimide containing benzimidazole COF (BIBDZ) exhibit highest BET surface area, 177.095 m2 g−1 with pore diameter of 30–32 angstorm among the COFs reported here which is also consistent with our computational study. Naphthalene diimide and the diaminobenzidine containing COF (NIBDZ) has the highest binding affinity with CO2 i.e. 127.87 cc g−1 (14.56 wt%) at 195 K, than the other two COFs. On the other side BIBDZ has showed specific capacitance value of 88.4 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density in the 1M H3PO4 electrolytic solution as well as remarkable retention of specific capacitance (93.61%) after 5000 galvanostatic charge discharge cycles.
