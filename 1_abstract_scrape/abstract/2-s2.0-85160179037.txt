Two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit various unique characteristics such as remarkably high morphological and structural anisotropy, great diversity in composition and structure. Graphene is the wonder material. The large 2D surface area and high electrochemical activity of graphene structure render them as potential materials for supercapacitor electrodes. The electrode performance of this material can be further improved by their hybridization with highly conductive and/or electrochemically active species. The market for graphene has grown hugely in the past decade, because this is potentially a huge breakthrough with numerous products now on the market including clothing, sportswear, footwear, tires, batteries, and so on. Graphene is attracting increasing attention from investors, researchers and industrial players due to exceptional mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties. This chapter focuses on the application of graphene material as supercapacitor electrodes and various characterization techniques to study morphological and structural of graphene. Several examples of graphene analysis electrode materials have also been provided.
