Various carbon-based materials with tunable porous structure, high surface area and good conductivity were widely used in energy storage devices. In this work, porous carbon nanosheets/particle composites were pyrolyzed directly from abundant and inexpensive waste litchi shell via a simple KOH activation method. High specific capacitance of 222.0 F gâˆ’1 at current density of 0.1 A/g and excellent rate performance were obtained when the prepared porous carbon nanosheets/particle composites served as supercapacitor electrode. In addition, the composites material exhibits favorable cycling stability of 97.3% after 5000 cycles at current density of 1 A/g, suggesting the promising application for high-performance supercapacitors. The presented method may provide an easy, economical and scalable strategy in synthesizing of 2D based carbon materials derived from biomass for energy storage devices.
