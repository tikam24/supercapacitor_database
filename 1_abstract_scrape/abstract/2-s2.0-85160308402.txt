A co-precipitation technique has been used to prepare Bismuth tungstate nanoparticles (Bi2WO6) for electrochemical capacitors and electrochemical sensing of Ascorbic acid (AA). Using a scanning rate of 10 mV s −1, the electrode was performed as the pseudocapacitance behavior and the specific capacitance to be up to 677 Fg −1 at 1 A/g. Bi2WO6 versus Glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was also used to study the behavior of the Bi2WO6 modified electrodes in detecting ascorbic acid. This electrochemical sensor shows excellent electrocatalytic performance when ascorbic acid is present, as determined by differential pulse voltammetry. In solution, ascorbic acid diffuses to an electrode surface and controls its surface properties. Based on the results from the investigation, the sensor showed a detection sensitivity of 0.26 mM/mA, and a limit of detection (LOD) of 77.85 mM. It is clear from these results that Bi2WO6 may find application as an electrode material for supercapacitors and glucose sensors.
