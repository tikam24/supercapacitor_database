Incorporation of two transition metals offers an effective method to enhance the electrochemical performance in supercapacitors for transition metal compound based electrodes. However, such a configuration is seldom concerned in pyrophosphates. Here, amorphous phase Co - Ni pyrophosphates are fabricated as electrodes in supercapacitors. Through controllably adjusting the ratios of Co and Ni as well as the calcination temperature, the electrochemical performance can be tuned. An optimized amorphous Ni - Co pyrophosphate exhibits much higher specific capacitance than monometallic Ni and Co pyrophosphates and shows excellent cycling ability. When employing Ni - Co pyrophosphates as positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor cell exhibits favorable capacitance and cycling ability. This study provides facile methods to improve the transition metal pyrophosphate electrodes for efficient electrodes in electrochemical energy storage devices.
