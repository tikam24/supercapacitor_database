Transition metal sulfides are widely used in energy storage and conversion due to their exclusive physical and chemical performance. In this work, FeSx/C/CNT composites have been prepared by spray drying assisted and then calcined in an Ar atmosphere. As lithium-ion battery anodes and electrode material for supercapacitor, the FeSx/C/CNT composites display the excellent reversible capacity, capacitance and cycle stabilities. Cyclic voltammetry at different scan rates indicate that the Faraday electrochemical reaction and surface capacitance behavior occur simultaneously when the FeSx/C/CNT composites act as anode material for lithium ion battery. Cycling under 200 mA g−1 current density for 100 times, the Coulomb efficiency is still about 99% while the capacity is about 630 mAh g−1. At the current density of 1, 2, 3 and 5 A g−1, the specific capacitances of the FeSx/C/CNT composites are 617.5, 508.0, 436.1 and 365.0 F g−1, respectively. Thus, as-prepared FeSx/C/CNT composites are expected to become anode materials for high-performance lithium-ion batteries and electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
