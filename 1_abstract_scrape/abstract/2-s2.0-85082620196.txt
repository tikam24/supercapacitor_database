In order to realize the self-power supply of the wireless temperature sensor at the tension clamp of the high-voltage transmission line, the environmental energy is harvested and stored, and to power the transmission line sensor nodes. A hybrid environment energy harvesting system for the transmission line is designed, which harvests the solar energy and transmission line vibration energy in the environment and harvests the solar energy and the piezoelectric ceramic through the photovoltaic panel. The output voltage of the photovoltaic cell is low under weak light. A new type of energy harvesting circuit is designed for the low output voltage of the photovoltaic cell, which can efficiently harvest the light energy in the transmission line. However, the vibration frequency of the transmission line is low, the structure of piezoelectric vibration energy harvester is designed by finite element method, the natural frequency is close to the vibration frequency of the excitation source, and the energy utilization ratio is the largest. The two energy collectors are impedance matched respectively in order to increase the energy output power of the whole system. The system is controlled with supercapacitor by energy management mode, which provides stable electric energy for load and realizes the sustainable self-power supply of wireless temperature sensor.
