This article presents a study of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system taking into account the fuel starvation phenomenon; this phenomenon causes serious problems when the load changes rapidly. Therefore, oxygen and hydrogen excess ratios are two important issues that should be controlled in the proton exchange membrane fuel cell. To verify the influences of this phenomenon on the fuel cell performances, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell emulator system is realized with dSpace (Cedex, France). In addition, a supercapacitor as an energy storage system is proposed as another solution to prevent this phenomenon, improve performance, and increase lifetime. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed emulator is an excellent tool for testing and experimenting energy storage systems and electronic devices for proton exchange membrane fuel cell applications and determine their impact on the fuel cell characteristics.
