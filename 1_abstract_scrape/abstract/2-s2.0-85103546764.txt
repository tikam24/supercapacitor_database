The demand for electric double-layer capacitors, which have high capacity and are maintenance-free, for use in a variety of devices has increased. Nevertheless, it is important to know the degradation behavior of these capacitors at high temperatures because they are expected to be used in severe environments. Therefore, degradation tests at 25◦C and 80◦C were carried out in the current study to analyze the degradation behavior. Steam-activated carbon, Ketjen black, and PTFE were used as the electrodes, conductive material, and binder, respectively, and KOH was used as the electrolyte. The impedance and capacitance were calculated from the voltage and current in the device using the alternating current (AC) impedance method. The results showed that the impedance increased and the capacitance decreased over 14 days at 80◦C, which is the inverse of what we observed at 25◦C. Rapid degradation was also confirmed from the 80◦C degradation test. The residual voltage after measuring the current and voltage was a prominent factor influencing this rapid degradation.
