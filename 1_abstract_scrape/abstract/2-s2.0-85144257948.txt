Among the transition metal chalcogenides, MoS2 has been one of the most widely studied nanomaterials because of its interesting physico-chemical properties. Its layered structure and high surface-to-volume ratio have triggered much attention in energy storage area, resulting in numerous applications. Few review articles published in this area are MoS2 and MoS2-based nanocomposites for energy storage applications, but virtually lesser reviews focusing on supercapacitor performance of MoS2 are not available. Herein, we report the recent advances on MoS2 based supercapacitors to understand how the research has improved its energy storage performance without the use of any composites of MoS2 with other nanomaterials. A general overview of the conducting-semiconducting phases of MoS2, effect of doping in MoS2, and the status of MoS2 in flexible as well as wearable supercapacitors are discussed along with future scope and challenges of MoS2 as the electrode materials.
