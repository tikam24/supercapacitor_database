In this paper, a control strategy for a combination PV-BESS-SC hybrid system in islanded microgrid with a DC load is designed and analyzed using a new topology. Although Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is employed to keep the DC bus voltage stable; however, it has a high energy density and a low power density. On the other hand, the Supercapacitor (SC) has a low energy density but a high-power density. As a result, combining a BESS and an SC is more efficient for power density and high energy. Integrating the many sources is more complicated. In order to integrate the SC and BESS and deliver continuous power to the load, a control strategy is required. A novel method for controlling the bus voltage and energy management will be proposed in this paper. The main advantage of the proposed system is that throughout the operation, the State of Charging (SOC), BESS current, and SC voltage and current are all kept within predetermined ranges. Additionally, SC balances fast-changing power surges, while BESS balances slow-changing power surges. Therefore, it enhances the life span and minimizes the current strains on BESS. To track the Maximum Power Point (MPP) or restrict power from the PV panel to the load, a unidirectional boost converter is utilized. Two buck converters coupled in parallel with a boost converter are proposed to charge the hybrid BESS-SC. Another two boost converters are used to manage the discharge operation of the BESS-SC storage in order to reduce losses. The simulation results show that the proposed control technique for rapid changes in load demand and PV generation is effective. In addition, the proposed technique control strategy is compared with a traditional control strategy.
