A novel approach for template-free synthesis of ultramicroporous carbon nanoparticles (UCNs) derived from metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO67 is demonstrated. UiO67 nanocrystals are fabricated via a solvothermal reaction of biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2bpdc) and zirconium (IV) chloride using benzoic acid as a modulator, and serve simultaneously as a carbon source and a self-template to generate regular ultramicropores during carbonization. The modulator equivalent and carbonization temperature show significant influences on the morphology and pore structure of the resulting UCNs. The simple prepared with 20 equivalents of benzoic acid and carbonized at 750 °C (denoted as UCN-20-750) manifests nanoscale particle size, a high specific surface area of 843 m2 g−1 and a regular ultramicropore of 0.53 nm, achieving a balance between the conductivity and surface area in the electrode for high performance energy storage. UCN-20-750 as a supercapacitor electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 256 F g−1 at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. Besides, the electrode shows excellent cycling stability with 91% retention after 10000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1. The present MOF-derived strategy to synthesize UCNs could be simply and efficiently implemented without any pretreatment, hard/soft template or activation process, and opens up a new window to precisely control the pore size in ultramicropore region for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
