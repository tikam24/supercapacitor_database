In this work, the hierarchical CoMoO4@MnO2 core-shell nanosheet arrays have been synthesized, which are grown directly on Ni foam as an integrated electrode for supercapacitors. Nanosheet arrays of cobalt-molybdenum precursors are synthesized first by a mild hydrothermal reaction and used as the "core". After the second facile hydrothermal process with a successive annealing, the Co-Mo precursors are transformed into the 3D hierarchical CoMoO4@MnO2 core-shell nanostructure. This core-shell heterostructure exhibits desirable electrochemical properties. It shows a high specific capacitance of 2159.4 F g-1 (2.27 F cm-2) at 3 mA cm-2 and high cycle stability with 93% retention of its initial specific capacitance at 20 mA cm-2 after 3000 cycles in 1 M KOH solution. In conclusion, the CoMoO4@MnO2 composites could be used as promising electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage due to their remarkable electrochemical properties.
