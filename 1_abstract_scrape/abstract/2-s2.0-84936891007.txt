An effective strategy to significantly boost the capacitive properties of Fe2O3-based anodes by Ti doping and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coating is successfully demonstrated. The Ti-Fe2O3@PEDOT electrode exhibits a significant capacitance improvement and exceptionally cyclic stability. A remarkable energy density of 0.89 mWh cm-3 can be obtained for a high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor device consisting of Ti-Fe2O3@PEDOT and a MnO2 anode.
