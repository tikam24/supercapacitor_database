Copper oxides (CuxO) play an active role in the field of binder-free electrodes for supercapacitors due to their own advantages, including high theoretical capacity, non-toxicity, low cost, etc. Developing mild and cheap process to prepare CuxO nanomaterials would broad its application in supercapacitors. In this paper, copper oxide is used as an active material and copper foam (CF) is chosen as a substrate to synthesize metal oxide-based electrodes by an in-situ oxidation method. Ingeniously, the availability of copper foam has a dual nature encompassing as a collector as well as a copper source. The as-obtained CuxO/CF-60 electrode possesses an area capacitance of 354.6 mF cm−2 under 2 mA cm−2. It also has superior cycle stability with 93.8 % of initial capacitance undergo 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, the all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor, combining CuxO/CF-60 and activated carbon (AC) pasted on nickel foam (NF) as the respective positive and negative electrodes, exhibits an energy density of 25 μWh cm−2 when power density reaches 3 mW cm−2. The CuxO/CF-60//AC/NF device displays better cycling stability as 80.2 % of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles. This work provides a simple way for designing CuxO based electrodes and lays the foundation for subsequent improvements in electrochemical performance.
