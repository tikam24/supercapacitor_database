In this study, we proposed an effective and rational method for in situ decoration of tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles on single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) by using poly (sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) as dispersing agent and stabilizer. The morphology and nanostructure of SnO2/SWNH composites were tested by TEM, XRD and XPS in detail. The results indicated that uniform dispersion of SnO2 nanoparticles with mean size about 5nm on the SWNHs. The nanocomposites as electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors were tested by cyclicvoltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). Experimental results exhibited a high specific capacitance of 180.69 F/g at 1 A/g in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The SnO2/SWNH composites showed good cycling stability, which the retention rate of the specific capacitance was 80.72% after 1200 times of charge and discharge cycles.
