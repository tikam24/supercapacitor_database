Due to the rapid expansion of portable electronics and electric vehicles market, the projected demand of rechargeable batteries is huge and may lead to shortage of critical minerals, especially nickel (Ni) metal. In the present study, we upcycled NiO material from spent Nickel–Metal hydride batteries (Ni-MH) as electrodes in Li-ion battery (LIB) and supercapacitor. Intriguingly, recycled NiO was applied successfully to develop sustainable LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode, delivering the promising capacity. As the recovered NiO-anode in LIBs, the device exhibited ultrahigh capacity of 1248 mAh g−1 at 0.1C, exhibiting excellent rate capability and cycle life in traditional carbonate-based electrolyte. The full cell with NMC cathode gave a high discharged capacity of 137.4 mAh/g. Addition to conventional electrolyte, a safe and non-flammable diglyme electrolyte using recovered NiO was investigated under identical condition. The maximum reversible capacity of 642 mAh g−1 at 0.1C was achieved along with good rate performance. Likewise, the NiO-based supercapacitor electrode delivered a maximum capacitance of 106C g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Hence, upcycling of abundant NiO waste as low-cost electrode materials from end-of-life batteries paves the way for future generation of Li-based energy storage devices and sustainable supply of critical minerals and clean environment.
