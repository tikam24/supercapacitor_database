Electrodes from carbonized Zn4O(1,4-benzodicarboxylic acid) (MOF-5) structures were prepared successfully via evaporating the solvent with a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binder. The solvent used for a nanocomposite cast was easily removed. Such an elegant method for preparing electrodes provides a facile, cost-effective, and void/cracking-free nanocomposite distribution on the current collector. The highly porous nanoparticles containing pure carbon attach well to the PVDF membrane which results in an increased active surface area of the electrode to 847 m2/g. The electrochemical analysis shows that the best weight ratio of CMOF-5 to PVDF equals 85:15, 80:20, and 75:25, respectively. The specific capacitance of these samples is 218 F/g, 210 F/g, and 180 F/g, correspondingly. An additional advantage of the electrode prepared from the carbonized MOF-5 is the possibility to synthesis MOF structures from recovered substrates used in its synthesis (distilled N,N-Dimethylformamide DMF and terephthalic acid recovered from polyethylene terephthalate waste). We will demonstrate this in this contribution as well. Furthermore, the carbonized MOF-5 can be recovered from the spent electrode and reused again in the electrochemical device.
