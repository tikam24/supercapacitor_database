Metal-organic framework materials (MOFs) have extensive application prospects as carbon precursors for super-capacitors are of great interest due to diverse microstructures, uniform pore size, high porosity, and tunable pore parameters. Here, nitrogen self-doped porous carbon materials (ZABC-T) derived from [Zn2(BTEC)0.5 (ATZ)2(H2O)3]·H2O (ZAB) have been prepared via a facile and fast carbonization method at different temperature. The nitrogen self-doped porous carbon material (ZABC-800) features a high specific surface area of 1008 m2 g−1 and high nitrogen content of 4.09%. Consequently, the ZABC-800 shows an excellent specific capacitance of 316.3 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1, superior rate capacity, and remarkable cycling stability (81.9% retention after 5000 cycles). This work indicates that the ZABC-T has a great potential as electrode materials for high performance super-capacitors.
