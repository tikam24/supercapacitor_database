In this paper, the work is about elaborating a system of diagnosis for components energy storage, especially lithium batteries and supercapacitors for vehicle applications. This system is based, firstly, on the artificial intelligence technique namely fuzzy logic and expert systems, then, the distributed artificial intelligence as multi-agent systems, our research theme. These two main methods are combined in the proposed system to accomplish the task of diagnosis. Indeed, a fuzzy inference system is used to take into account the uncertainty in the detection and diagnosis; and the agents to distribute diagnostic analysis at sub-step, the location and identification of failures or isolated degradations.
