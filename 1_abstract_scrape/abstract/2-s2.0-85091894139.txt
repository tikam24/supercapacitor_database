In general, self-powered sensor networks/Internet of Things (IoT) are equipped with a power management system and use a timer as a reference for the device's actives time, both using an internal timer and an external timer. The system is less efficient because it requires that there are parts that continue to function when the device is in sleep mode. In addition, the amount of harvested energy also influenced by many factors with an uncertain amount. An IoT self-powered system that uses a timer as an active interval reference will encounter problems when the amount of system energy demand is greater than the harvested energy. This paper presents an adaptive power management system equipped with feedback for self-powered IoT for room temperature and humidity monitoring applications. The power management system can provide adaptive active intervals based on the harvested energy capacity. Microcontrollers send feedback to the power management circuit at the end of each cycle. The power management circuit immediately disconnects the controller circuit from the energy storage's component (supercapacitor) so that energy used efficiently. Several methods of minimizing the energy consumption of the device are also applied to provide optimal results. The research method begins with system modelling, including an energy harvester circuit, power management, and controller. The research scenarios include energy harvester performance tests, calculating the energy requirements of the power management and controller circuit, and validating research results. Overall, the system can work well, the active interval/data transmission of 14.41 seconds to 22.34 seconds in a room with a light intensity of 800 lux to 1000 lux.
