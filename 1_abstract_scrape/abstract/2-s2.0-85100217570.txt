Studies on high-performance novel electrode materials for energy conversion and energy storage applications need a group of active materials with a large specific surface area, high porosity, structure conducive to conductivity, and mechanical robustness. A hierarchical nanocomposite with doping Ce in NiCo-LDH and grown on the surface of the carbon nanotubes surface has been synthesized by applying simple hydrothermal methods. The CNT contributes as a structural scaffold and excellent conductor to improve the conduction of electrons and prevent aggregation of NiCoCe-LDH nanosheets; however, it also helps in increasing the specific capacitance. The Ce doping effect (Ce4+/Ce3+) has been an efficient method to increase the rate properties and specific capacitance of the supercapacitor. Here, we show that nanocomposites structures made with doping Ce in NiCo-LDH and grown on the surface of CNT substrates show improved gravimetric specific capacitance (187.2 F/g at 1 A/g), although the capacitance contribution of NiCo-LDH is very insignificant compared to NiCo-LDH/CNT nanocomposites. The capacitance retention of NiCoCe-LDH/CNT remains around 85.6% at 9000 cycles, while the Coulombic efficiency is preserved at almost 100% in the KOH solution.
