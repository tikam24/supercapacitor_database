This work reports the fabrication of CuCo2S4 (CCS) nanostructures (NSs) by a hydrothermal method. The CCS-NSs are synthesized at 170 °C by varying calcination times. Nickel mesh (NM) is utilized as a current collector. The CCS- NSs are derived at different calcination times, such as 12 h, 14 h, and 16 h and are coated onto NM to fabricate electrochemical supercapacitors (SCs). The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis of CCS-NM electrodes are performed in 1 M LiOH electrolyte. The electrodes fabricated with the CCS-NSs with a calcination time of 14 h (CCS@14h-NM) showed the maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 995.86 F g−1 at a scan rate of 10 mVs−1.In addition, the CCS@14h-NM electrode showed an 83 % capacitance retention rate after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 1 mA cm−2. The excellent capacitance retention rate of CCS-NM electrodes reflects an extensive scope in fabricating efficient electrochemical SCs involving earth-abundant and environmentally benign elements. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor device with CCS@14h-NM as the anode and AC-NM as the cathode produces excellent Csp (103 F g−1), specific energy Esp (16 Wh kg−1), and specific power Psp (7.4 kW kg−1) as well as remarkable long cycle life (retention of 81 % after 10,000 cycles).
