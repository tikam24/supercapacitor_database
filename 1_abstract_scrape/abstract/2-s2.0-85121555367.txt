Pepper peel waste is one of the byproducts of pepper production, especially in the Province of Bangka Belitung Islands. One of the efforts to utilize pepper peel, which is used as an activated carbon material that can be used as supercapacitor electrodes, has been carried out. Activated carbon based on pepper peel is synthesized by drying it to dry and then pre-carbonization. The next step is chemical activation using ZnCl2 and followed by physical activation at 700 Â°C in nitrogen flow conditions (N2) for 3 hours. Characterization of activated carbon material was carried out using SEM-EDX and BET, while the electrode performance used CV (Cyclic Voltamettry). The SEM-EDX and BET test results show that the activated carbon material has a porous structure with an average pore diameter of 2.059 nm. The CV test results were used to determine the energy storage capability with a specific capacitance value of 7.77 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s.
