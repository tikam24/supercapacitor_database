Reversibly deformable and highly performing solid-state yarn supercapacitors are obtained using MnO2-deposited microcoiled yarn electrodes. The core(CNT)-shell(MnO2)-structured coiled electrodes achieve high stretchability (37.5%) without the help of elastomeric substrates, minimizing the size of the supercapacitors. Therefore, high specific capacitances of 34.6 F cm-3, 61.25 mF cm-2, and 2.72 mF cm-1 are achieved for coiled supercapacitors without impairing mechanical stretchability or electrochemical cyclability.
