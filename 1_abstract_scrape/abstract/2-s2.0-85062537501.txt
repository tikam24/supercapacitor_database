This paper describes the use of a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery and supercapacitor as power sources and a multi-input bi-directional interleaved DC/DC converter to provide energy to an electric urban bus. Using a control strategy that divides in different cutoff frequencies for each power source, it is possible to use the supercapacitor for rapid changes on the load demands, while the battery is used for the constant load.
