In this present work, NiMn2O4 nanostructures were prepared by using KOH/NaOH double hydroxide solution by hydrothermal method. The structure and chemical composition of the prepared material was confirmed by XRD and FT-IR, respectively. HR-TEM revealed the surface morphology of the NiMn2O4. The enhanced electrochemical properties of the NiMn2O4 material were examined by the CV, CP, and EIS analyses. The supercapacitor based on the nanostructured NiMn2O4 revealed the higher specific capacitance (854.7 F/g at 5mV/s in 2 M aqueous KOH electrolyte), better performance and cyclic stability (94.6% capacitive retention after 1000 cycles at 4 A/g). The hexagonal morphology plays an important role in enhancing the specific capacitance of the electrode. The electrochemical behaviors infer that the hexagonal-like NiMn2O4 nanostructured electrode can be potentially used in supercapacitors.
