In this study, titanium dioxide (TiO2), a mineral with a potential and supercapacitor, is used as the reinforcing material to improve the filtration efficacy of electret melt-blown fabrics. Next, the electret melt-blown fabrics are evaluated in terms of surface voltage and filtration efficiency, thereby examining the influences of the TiO2 ratio and electric field intensity. The test results indicate that the filtration efficiency is proportional to the ratio of TiO2 and electric field intensity. In particular, with a TiO2 ratio of 3 wt% and an electric field intensity of 2.5 kV/cm, the electret melt-blown fabrics demonstrate a maximal filtration efficiency of 96.32%, a lowest pressure drop of 40 Pa, and an optimal quality factor of 0.083 Pa-1.
