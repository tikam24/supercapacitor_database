Energy and sensors play a significant role in ensuring that human beings live healthy and reliable lives, and their materials are major factors in the economy. This study presents the synthesis of a nitrogen-doped zeolite imidazolate framework (N-ZIF-67) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based hybrid nanocomposite (N-ZIF-67.rGO) via an in situ method. The structural features of the as-synthesized material were characterized using a variety of physicochemical techniques. The electrochemical properties of N-ZIF-67.rGO were investigated by impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, square wave voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry. The voltammetric response of N-ZIF-67.rGO/GCE as a sensor for the detection of hydroxylamine (HA) was significantly higher than that of N-ZIF-67 because of the synergistic effects between the rGO and the N-ZIF-67 framework. It was found to possess a limit of detection of 0.29 Î¼M and to cover a wide linear range for the electrochemical determination of HA. Additionally, it exhibited superior specific capacitance (962 F g-1) as a supercapacitor compared with N-ZIF-67. At the same time, approximately 97% capacitance retention was achieved after 1000 cycles. These superior characteristics are related to the fast electron transfer kinetics, enhanced electrode surface area, and high stability of the N-ZIF-67.rGO composite. Our method may create a new platform to synthesize other metal-organic framework and rGO-based composites in the near future.
