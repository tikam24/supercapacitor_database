Heteroatoms (N-, Si-) self-doped spongy carbon material was synthesized for the first time via activation and carbonization of sharia bambusicola. Due to the hierarchical porous nature and heteroatom doping efforts, the obtained materials show a high specific capacitance (339 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), superior rate stability (75% capacitance retention at the range of 0.5 to 50 A g−1) and long cycle period (98% capacitance retention over 5000 cycles).
