There are several methods of V-I characterization for solar cells/modules. With the passage of time earlier laborious and slow analog methods is replaced by smarter and faster digital methods. In this course of development, another approach of V-I characterization using suitable supercacitive load has been established by the researchers. PV modules are known to be the fundamental building block for configuring large size (GW level) PV Arrays which have to be designed with due care and special emphasis on the interlinking power losses. So, reliability analysis in terms of module quality and power loss is considered the most valuable task. So, in this paper authors have shown how a user or researchers easily performed the reliability checks using their own set-up. To judge the accuracy and precision of this method authors have carried out V-I characterization of a solar module at different insolations and also verified the linearity of selected electrical parameters of the characteristics against varying levels of insolation. The V-I curves derived from this method have also been compared in this paper with standard test results obtained at ERTL (Electronics Regional Test Laboratory), Government of India, in Kolkata using PASAN solar cell testing machine.
