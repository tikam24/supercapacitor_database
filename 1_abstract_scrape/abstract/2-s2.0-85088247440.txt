We report the microstructure and electrochemical performance of poly(azomethine ether) (PAME)-derived carbon nanofibers (CNFs), which were fabricated by a facile two-step process of electrospinning and carbonization, as self-standing and binder-free supercapacitor electrode materials. The SEM images showed that the average diameter decreased noticeably from ~293.9 nm of as-spun nanofibers to ~150.3 nm of CNFs after the carbonization at 1000Â°C. The EDS, XPS, Raman, and XRD analyses demonstrated that PAME-derived CNFs have a nitrogen self-doped graphitic structure. Accordingly, PAME-derived CNFs were characterized to have relatively high electrical conductivity of ~3.1 S/cm and excellent wettability to water. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests revealed that PAME-derived CNFs have a high specific capacitance of 298 F/g at 0.3 A/g, energy density of 3.3 to 13.9 Wh/kg, power density of 37.5 to 250.0 W/kg, and capacity retention of ~94% after 1000 cycles.
