We successfully developed a 3D porous CNT/MnO2composite electrode based on manganese oxideand carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a simple "dipping and drying" process followed by a potentionstaticdeposition technology for non-enzymatic glucose detection and supercapacitor applications. The com-position and structure of the as-prepared electrode were characterized by energy-dispersive X-rayspectroscopy (EDX), field Emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM), respectively. The electrochemical performances were evaluated by cyclic voltam-metry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and Amperometric it techniques. The as-prepared sensor couldaccurately detect glucose in 0.5 M NaOH solution in the presence of interferences, such as ascorbic acid,uric acid and fructose, with a high sensitivity up to 3406.4 Î¼A/(cm2mM). These excellent electrochem-ical performances were closely related to the synergistic effect of two components and the unique 3Dporous architecture of the electrode. A symmetrical supercapacitor has been also fabricated using thenovel electrodes and it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 160.5 F/g at the current density of 1 A/gwhich can rival with the asymmetrical supercapacitor. Such symmetrical device delivered prominentenergy density of 22.3 Wh kg?1at the power density of 500 W kg?1. All of these perfect performancespaved the way for this hybrid to be a potential competitive candidate in the application of glucose sensorand supercapacitor.
