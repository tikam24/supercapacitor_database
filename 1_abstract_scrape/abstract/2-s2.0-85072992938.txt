Molybdenum (Mo)-doped vanadium dioxide (VO2(B)) nanobelts were successfully synthesized using commercial vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) as the starting material and ammonium molybdate as the dopant by a simple hydrothermal route. Then, Mo-doped VO2(B) nanobelts were transformed to Mo-doped V2O5 nanobelts by calcination at 400Â°C under an air atmosphere. The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The results showed that Mo-doped VO2(B) and V2O5 solid solution with high purity were obtained. The electrochemical properties of Mo-doped VO2(B) and V2O5 nanobelts as supercapacitor electrodes were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The specific capacitance of VO2(B) nanobelts slightly declines with Mo doping, however, the specific capacitance of V2O5 nanobelts greatly improves with Mo doping. Mo-doped V2O5 nanobelts exhibit the specific capacitance as high as 526 F g-1 at the current density of 1 A g-1. Both CV and GCD curves show that they have good rate capability and retain 464, 380, 324 and 273 F g-1 even at a high-current density of 2, 5, 10 and 20 A g-1, respectively. It turns out that Mo-doped V2O5 nanobelts are ideal materials for supercapacitor electrodes in the present work.
