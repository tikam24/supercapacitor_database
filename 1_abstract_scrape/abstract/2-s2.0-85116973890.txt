An inexpensive and eco-friendly method has been reported for the straightforward synthesis of cuprous oxide/reduced graphene oxide/polyaniline (Cu2O/rGO/PANI) composite. Citrus maxima (Pomelo) juice was used as a reducing agent to synthesize Cu2O/rGO composite, and further polyaniline was grown on it. The Fourier-transform infrared, UV–visible, and Raman spectroscopy results suggested that Cu2O/rGO/PANI composite was synthesized. X-ray diffraction patterns further suggested the synthesis of Cu2O/rGO/PANI composite. The SEM results showed spherical Cu2O particles decorated on rGO/PANI matrix. The composite was coated on a glassy carbon electrode and was used for electrochemical studies viz cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The composite exhibited a high specific capacitance value of 496.61 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s and showed excellent cycling stability.
