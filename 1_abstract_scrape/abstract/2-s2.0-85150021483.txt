Mixed-phase MoS2 (MS) nanosheets anchored carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have been synthesized via a hydrothermal route. The concentration of CNFs has been varied in the MS/CNF-x composite (where, x = 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 represents the molar concentration of CNFs) to investigate the impact of CNFs on the electrochemical behavior of the material. The incorporation of CNFs offers a conductive path for the diffusion of ions and provides structural support which limits the restacking of the MoS2 layers during the charging/discharging. The MS/CNF-2 composite delivered superior electrochemical performance compared with the other composites owing to the positive synergy between MoS2 and CNFs. The specific capacitance manifested by MS/CNF-2 (626.08 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) is about four times that of pristine MS (159.35 F g−1). It is also observed that MS/CNF-2 exhibited higher electrochemical stability than pristine MS. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device achieved a tremendous energy density of 42.6 Wh kg−1 at 2.4 kW kg−1. To test its practical applicability, LEDs of different color (red, green, and blue) have been illuminated using a series combination of three symmetric electrode cells. The red, green, and blue LEDs lighted up for 15 mins, 7 mins, and 3 mins. The results demonstrate the superiority of the MS/CNF composite for symmetric supercapacitors.
