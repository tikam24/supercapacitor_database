The growth of active materials on Ni foam was proved to be an effective strategy to enhance redox reactions for electrochemical capacitors. But for NH4NiPO4·H2O materials, a uniform nanostructure on Ni foam has not been achieved. Here, the NH4NiPO4·H2O nanoplate arrays on Ni foam are fabricated by a facile solvothermal method. To further promote the transitions of current carries and benefit the electrochemical reactions, the surfaces of NH4NiPO4·H2O nanoplate arrays were modified by a thin layer of polypyrrole through an in situ chemical polymerization method. The polypyrrole-modified NH4NiPO4·H2O nanoplate arrays on Ni foam showed much enhanced specific capacitance in comparison with the bare NH4NiPO4·H2O nanoplate arrays. When employing polypyrrole-modified NH4NiPO4·H2O/Ni foam as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode to assemble the asymmetric supercapacitor cells, favorable capacitance and cycling ability were achieved. Such a fabrication provides a feasible method to construct efficient electrodes for sustainable electrochemical energy storage.
