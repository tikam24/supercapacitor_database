Cellulose nanofibers are selected as nano-spacers, electrolyte nano-reservoirs and hierarchical nanostructure makers of CNF-RGO hybrid aerogel. The CNF-RGO hybrid aerogel based flexible supercapacitor exhibits high capacitance (207 F g-1). Taking its higher capacitance, low cost and environmentally friendly nature, they have great potential for use in flexible supercapacitors. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
