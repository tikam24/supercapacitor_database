The Fe2O3 material is a common active material for supercapacitor electrodes and has received much attention due to its cheap and easy availability and high initial specific capacitance. In the present study, we prepared adhesive-free Fe2O3 sheet electrodes for supercapacitors by growing Fe2O3 material on nickel foam by hydrothermal method. The sheet electrode exhibited a high initial specific capacitance of 863 F g−1, but we found that the sheet lost its specific capacitance too quickly through cyclic stability tests. To solve this problem, Fe2O3/MgFe2O4 composites were grown on nickel foam (NF). It was found through testing that the cycling stability of the sheet electrode gradually increased as the content of MgFe2O4 material increased. When the molar ratio of Fe2O3 to MgFe2O4 material was 1 : 1, the initial specific capacitance of the sheet electrode was 815 F g−1 and the capacitance remained at 81.25% of the initial specific capacitance after 1000 cycles. The better cycling stability results from the more stable structure of the composite, the synergistic effect leading to better reversibility of the reaction.
