Graphene-based aerogels with different chitosan contents are selectively prepared by the hydrothermal reaction. It is found that with increasing chitosan content, the density of graphene-based aerogels decreases and their specific surface area enhances gradually. With the optimized mass ratio of chitosan to graphene oxide (4:1), its density and specific surface area are 11.0 mg cm−3 and 616 m2 g−1, respectively. Due to the well-dispersed functional groups grafted on graphene and strong coordination ability to heavy metal ions, its saturated adsorption capacities for Cu2+ and Pb2+ are as high as 342.4 and 945.1 mg g−1, respectively. After carbonization at 900 °C, the nitrogen element is incorporated into the skeleton of aerogels, and the resulting nitrogen-doped graphene-based aerogels show excellent electrochemical performance in supercapacitor applications. The present method paves the way for the synthesis of heteroatom-doped graphene-based aerogels for multifunctional special applications.
