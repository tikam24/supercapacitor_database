Ti@MoOx core-shell nanorod arrays with diameters within 100 nm were fabricated by electrodepositing MoOx on a Ti nanorod array prepared by oblique angle deposition. A high areal capacitance of 27 mF cm - 2 and satisfactory cycling stability were obtained. After post-annealing, MoO2 grains were introduced to enhance the rate capability, suggesting a potential pseudocapacitive micro-electrode. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.
