One of the effective ways to improve the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is to fabricate a combined electric double layer capacitor (EDLC)-pseudocapacitance system. In this study, we synthesized the composite material FeCo2O4@PC by hydrothermal method, which can enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors by the synergetic effect of EDLC and pseudocapacitance mechanisms. A series of physical characterizations including X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to demonstrate the successful compositing of FeCo2O4@PC. And FeCo2O4@PC was used for the testing of supercapacitor and the electrochemical performance was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The results show that the composite FeCo2O4@PC-5 possesses larger specific capacitance and excellent rate capability. This further confirms that the composite of the two materials can overcome their respective shortcomings and improve the overall capacitive performance of the electrode. The composite electrode material FeCo2O4@PC has great application potential and prospects in the field of supercapacitors.
