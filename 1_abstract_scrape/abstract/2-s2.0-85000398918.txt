Developing a high energy density micro-supercapacitor still remains a big challenge. In this paper, a two-dimensional (2D) CoMoO4 ultrathin nanosheet (NS)-based asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated. It is found that the CoMoO4 NS electrode processes a high specific capacitance (153.2 F g-1) at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 and this ASC can deliver an energy density of 0.313 mWh cm-3 at a power density of 80 mW cm-3, which is higher than that reported in the literature. Moreover, the ASC can drive a light emitting diode (3 mm diameter, red) to work for 6 min after being charged for 10 s. After 5000 cycles, 77.37% of capacitance still remains. We maintain that the ultrathin thickness can significantly shorten the diffusion paths for both electrons and ions, thus leading to fast electron transport and ion diffusion rates. Our results demonstrate that 2D ultrathin NSs could be a new, promising candidate for energy conversion/storage devices, which could offer more accommodating sites for ion intercalation.
