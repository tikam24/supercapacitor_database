All solid-state micro-supercapacitors are an attractive solution for integrated, on-chip energy storage. Photoresist-derived porous carbon, which has a high specific capacitance and good conductivity, is used as an electrode material in conjunction with an ionogel electrolyte to fabricate a high energy density supercapacitor. Fabricated devices yield extremely high volumetric capacitance of 9.8 F/cm3 and a wide electrochemical voltage window of 3 V. Â© 2013 IEEE.
