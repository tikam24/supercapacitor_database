The proposed research investigation has successfully assembled symmetric pelletized solid dielectric (BaTiO3) supercapacitors, based on MnO2 and MnO2 doped V2O5 electrodes that can operate over a frequency range of 1MHz. The electrical characterization of symmetric supercapacitors based on MnO2 and MnO2-doped V2O5 electrodes were carried out by LCR meter, CV meter and semiconductor device analyzer. The major objective of this research is on the development of symmetric pelletized metal oxide based supercapacitors with higher capacitance density, improved quality factor and low loss tangent. In the performance evaluation, maximum values for capacitance density of 22.16 fF/\mu m^{2} and 20.21 fF/\mu m^{2} and quality factor of 54.3, 66.4 at lMHz frequency was obtained. Comparatively low leakage current density 1.26 x10-sA/cm2 and 1.39 x10-sA/cm2 with minimum loss tangent of 0.0184 and 0.015 was encountered. Thus, demonstrated supercapacitors, an upcoming technology that poses higher capacitance density and improved quality factor with minimum loss tangent becomes a promising candidate for developing flexible and low cost energy storage applications in compact systems.
