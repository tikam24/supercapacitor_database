Supercapacitors (SCs) with high energy density and power density are a research hotspot. Herein, we report a flexible porous carbon membrane supercapacitor prepared by electrospinning polyacrylonitrile (PAN) with γ-cyclodextrin-MOF (γ-CD-MOF) and then carbonizing at 900 °C. BET results showed that the supercapacitor retained the skeleton of γ-CD, γ-CD-MOF and the pores formed by the spun-fibers, which were 0.73, 1.09 and 23–186 nm, respectively, showing a high specific surface area of 134.7 m2/g. The hierarchically porous structures ensure rapid charge transfer and ion diffusion, resulting in the PAN/γ-CD-MOF carbon electrode with a high capacity of 283.3 F/g. Moreover, the supercapacitor had a high energy density up to 17.5 Wh/kg and power density up to 6 kW/kg. Significantly, it showed excellent cycle stability with a capacitance retention of 97.5% after 6000 cycles. This work provides a supramolecular strategy to construct a flexible porous carbon membrane, which has potential for supercapacitor applications.
