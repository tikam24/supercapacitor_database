Despite rapid developments, multifunctional wearable electronics are still not significant in practical applications as compared to portable and stretchable power devices. In this paper, we present the flexible and easy large-scale production of single-electrode mode triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and supercapacitor yarn-based self-charging power fabric, for simultaneously converting and storing biomechanical energy. Fabricated using traditional knitting technologies, the self-charging power fabric can adapt to complex mechanical deformations owing to its high flexibility and stretchability. Additionally, the output characteristics of the TENG fabric were systematically investigated with the purpose of energy generation. The TENG fabric can generate a maximum peak power density of ∼90 mW•m-2 using nylon as the contact material, with an operating frequency of 4 Hz. The as-prepared yarn-based supercapacitor exhibited high capacitance, good cycling stability, and flexibility, making it an appropriate wearable energy-storage device. Moreover, the proposed design uses energy harvested from biomechanical motions to sustainably power portable electronic devices. The results of this study indicate that the proposed design is a promising sustainable power source for wearable electronic devices.
