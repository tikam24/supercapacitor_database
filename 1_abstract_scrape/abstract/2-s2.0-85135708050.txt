Fossil fuels are the major source of energy in the world, which are being depleted day by day. Fossil fuels are also polluting the environment by releasing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. To overcome environmental pollution as well as energy crisis, exploration of new ways of storing energy is the need of the time. In the presented work, reduced graphene oxide/Strontium selenate nanocomposite has been synthesized as an electrode material for energy storage devices. The structure of rGO/ SrSeO4 nanocomposite was confirmed by x-ray diffraction while the morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical measurements, such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic stability, were also carried out. The synthesized nanocomposite showed excellent specific power of 684.16 W/kg with 3.67 Wh/kg specific energy, which is significantly much better than already reported metal selenide materials.
