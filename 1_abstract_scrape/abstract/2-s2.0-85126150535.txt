Developing high-efficiency multifunctional nanomaterials is promising for wide pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and energy storage but still challenging. Herein, a novel in-situ doping-induced lattice strain strategy of NiCoP/S nanocrystals (NCs) was proposed through using seed crystal conversion approach with NiCo2S4 spinel as precursor. The small amount of S atoms in NiCoP/S NCs perturbed the local electronic structure, leading to the atomic position shift of the nearest neighbor in the protocell and the nanoscale lattice strain, which optimized the H* adsorption free energy and activated H2O molecules, resulting the dramatically elevated HER performance within a wide pH range. Especially, the NiCoP/S NCs displayed better HER electrocatalytic activity than comical 20% Pt/C at high current density in 1 M KOH and natural seawater: it only needed 266 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 660 mV vs. RHE to arrive the current density of 350 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH and natural seawater, indicating the application prospect for industrial high current. Besides, NiCoP/S NCs also displayed excellent supercapacitor performance: it showed high specific capacity of 2229.9 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and energy density of 87.49 Wh kg−1, when assembled into an all-solid-state flexible device, exceeding performance of most transition metal phosphides. This work provides new insights into the regulation in electronic structure and lattice strain for electrocatalytic and energy storage applications.
