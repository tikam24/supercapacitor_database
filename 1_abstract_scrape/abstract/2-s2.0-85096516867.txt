In this investigation, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4/GCN) nanosheets were fabricated as electrode materials for supercapacitors through facile solvothermal route. The electrochemical properties of GCN electrodes were investigated using CV, GCD and EIS studies in 1.0 M Na2SO4 solution. The prepared GCN electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance of 220 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 with superior capacitance retention of 97.5% at a current density of 1.0 A g-1, respectively. These enhanced attributes in electrochemical properties are due to the presence of more number of electrochemical active sites in nanosheet structures of GCN. Hence, it is evident that GCN nanosheets can be one of the economical and active candidates as supercapacitor electrode materials.
