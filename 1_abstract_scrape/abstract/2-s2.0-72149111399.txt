The energy storage is key issue for traction applications like Electric Vehicles (EVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). Indeed, it needs a higher power and energy density, a weak bulk and size, a long lifetime and a low cost. A hybrid Energy Storage System (ESS) using batteries and supercapacitors, seems to be a good device to answer to these constraints. The objective of the paper is to study the influence of control strategies for this hybrid ESS. Indeed, according to the used strategy, this association can be more and less interesting compared to an ESS only composed of batteries. Three control strategies are proposed. Â© 2009 IEEE.
