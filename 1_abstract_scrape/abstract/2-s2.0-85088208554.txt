Here we demonstrate an unconventional fabrication of highly transparent supercapacitors and electrodes using random networks of nanostructured metallic glass nanotroughs for their integrations as wirelessly rechargeable and invisible, skin heat patches. Transparent supercapacitors with fine conductive patterns were printed using an electrohydrodynamic jet-printing. Also, transparent and stretchable electrodes, for wireless antennas, heaters and interconnects, were formed using random network based on nanostructured CuZr nanotroughs and Ag nanowires with superb optoelectronic properties (sheet resistance of 3.0 Ï‰/sq at transmittance of 91.1%). Their full integrations, as an invisible heat patch on skin, enabled the wireless recharge of supercapacitors and the functions of heaters for thermal therapy of skin tissue. The demonstration of this transparent thermotherapy patch to control the blood perfusion level and hydration rate of skin suggests a promising strategy toward next-generation wearable electronics.
