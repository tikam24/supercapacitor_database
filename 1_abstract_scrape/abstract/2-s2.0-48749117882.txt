Polyaniline nanofibers doped with citric acid was prepared by a novel surfactant-assisted dilute polymerization technique. It was possible to synthesize polyaniline nanofibers without using any organic solvent by easier pathway. Polyaniline salt was characterized by conductivity, FTIR, and X-ray diffraction studies. The specific capacitance behavior of the polyaniline nanofibers was characterized using cyclic voltammetry which exhibits highest specific capacitance of 298Fg-1. The morphology of the obtained nanofibers was characterized by SEM studies. So, these kinds of specific properties of polyaniline nanofibers could be beneficial to the development of energy storage devices. Copyright Â© 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
