Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are emerging as progressive energy storage systems with high energy density, high power output, and a long cycle life span. The key to constructing LICs with high performances is alleviating the dynamics mismatch between the faradic anode and capacitor-type cathode. Herein, nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon linked hierarchically porous Co3O4 nanofibers (NAC-L-Co3O4 NFs) were prepared by electrospinning strategy, where the amorphous carbon can mitigation the volume variation of Co3O4 during the lithiation/delithiation process, while the hierarchically porous structure provides effective channels and exposes more active sites for fast electron transfer and Li+ storage. The delicate structure endows NAC-L-Co3O4 NFs with remarkable rate capacity and robust cycling durability. Furthermore, nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedron (NPCP) is prepared for the cathode, displaying superior rate performances and cycling stability. As a result, by assembling the NAC-L-Co3O4//NPCP LICs, a high energy density of 296 Wh kg−1 and a high output of 11750 W kg−1 is delivered. Additionally, the LIC devices display excellent cycle lifespan (80% capacity retention after 10000 cycles at 1 A g−1).
