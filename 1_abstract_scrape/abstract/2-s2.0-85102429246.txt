The mechanical properties of nanoporous metals (NPMs) are very important for their potential applications in flexible electronics. Here, the NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al metallic glass (NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG) composite with high strength, high hardness, and good flexibility is reported. The NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG was synthesized by a two-step dealloying method. First, the flexible NP Zr-Cu-Al MG was prepared by selective etching the active Y-rich MG from the pseudobinary MG system (Zr47Cu46Al7 MG + Y47Cu46Al7 MG) of Cu46Zr23.5-Y23.5Al7 alloy. The NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG was then obtained by further etching the NP Zr-Cu-Al MG and the Cu layer was evenly covered on the MG matrix of ligaments. The NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG demonstrated good flexibility due to its non-cracking structure and the existence of flexible Zr-Cu-Al MG. Additionally, the NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG showed the highest tensile strength of 143.9 MPa and nanohardness of 0.79 GPa among all the reported NPMs. The Zr-Cu-Al MG strengthening phase weakened the rupture of Cu@Zr-Cu-Al ligaments, which could effectively restrain the crack initiation and propagation in the NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG. Finally, it could improve the comprehensive mechanical properties. The NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG was applied as an electrode for supercapacitors and glucose biosensors. The NP Cu@Zr-Cu-Al MG electrode displayed better conductivity and supercapacitor capacitance than the bare NP Zr-Cu-Al MG electrode.
