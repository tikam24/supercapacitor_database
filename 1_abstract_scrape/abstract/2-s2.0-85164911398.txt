Waste biomass-derived carbon materials are an attractive eco-friendly material. Biomass-derived carbon materials have received increasing attention due to the demand for renewable energy. In this work, abundantly available waste eggshell membrane was converted into carbon material and activated by KOH. The eggshell membrane-derived activated carbon (EgC) was mixed with calcium bismuth oxide (CBO) to form a composite material (EgC/CBO). Various characterization techniques were used to confirm the synthesized materials, including x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized materials EgC, CBO, and (EgC/CBO) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EgC/CBO electrode material exhibited a good specific capacitance value of 222F/g at 1 A/g. The composite material also exhibited a long cyclic stability, up to 5000 cycles at 5 A/g. The present study clearly confirms that the EgC/CBO material can be employed as a potential electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor energy storage applications.
