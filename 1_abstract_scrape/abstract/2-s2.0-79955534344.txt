We have fabricated composite electrode materials consisting of manganese-molybdenum mixed oxide and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for supercapacitor application. The process involves electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of multi-walled CNTs onto an ITO electrode, followed by anodic deposition of Mn-Mo oxide from an aqueous Mn(II) solution containing MoO42- anions. Electrochemical properties of the composite electrodes with various combinations of Mn-Mo oxide and CNTs were evaluated systematically with the aim of maximizing the electrochemical utilization of the oxide. Optimization led to a high specific capacitance of 408 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1, with an area-normalized capacitance of 31 mF cm-2 (or a volume-normalized capacitance of 76 F cm-3).
