A simple and cost-effective in-situ chemical route to prepare the nanocomposites based on graphene and Poly(aniline-co-pyrrole) [PPP] has been proposed. Introduction of graphene changes the morphology of copolymer from spherical to fiber like. Graphene/Poly(aniline-co-pyrrole) [GPPP] nanocomposite achieved highest specific capacitance of 351 F/g and energy density of 124.8 Wh/Kg at 10 mV/s scan rate. The composite also obtained moderate specific capacitance retention of 66% after 500 cycles, which establish its potentiality as supercapacitor electrode materials. The composite also exhibited high electrical conductivity and superior microwave absorbing properties (maximum reflection loss is -29.97 dB). The absorption range corresponding to â‰¥90% absorption (or -10 dB) is 2.72 GHz which is excellent for the microwave absorbing applications.
