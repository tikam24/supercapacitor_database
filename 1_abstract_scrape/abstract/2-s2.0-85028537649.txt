Honeycomb-like NiMoO4 with nanosheet arrays is grown on reduced graphene oxide, which is supported on Ni foam having successfully fabricated by a simple hydrothermal treatment followed by a calcined process. In the as-synthesized Ni foam@reduced graphene oxide@NiMoO4, Ni foam served as “skeleton” to support reduced graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide directly grown on Ni foam served as the “skin” to provide high passway of electrons and ions, which simultaneously accommodated the volume change during the process of charge–discharge and NiMoO4 acted as active substance to provide high areal capacitance. It shows a high areal capacitance of 2165.9 mF cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and long cycle stability with 93.8% capacitance retained over 1000 charge–discharge cycles. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor has been constructed by using Ni foam@reduced graphene oxide and Ni foam@reduced graphene oxide@NiMoO4 as negative and positive electrodes. The energy density of this asymmetric supercapacitor is 0.579 mWh cm−2, and it retains 93.1% capacitance over charge–discharge 5000 cycles. Therefore, it reveals great promise for practical applications in energy storage devices.
