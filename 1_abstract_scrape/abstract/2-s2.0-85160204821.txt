Electrification of transport sector is a necessary step towards clean and less pollutant transport systems including waterborne vehicles. This paper presents innovative power and control systems for electric vessel, which utilise ultra-capacitor and SMES systems to stabilize the vessel DC-micro grid, subjected to transient or highly dynamical operating scenarios. It discusses and analyses the systems, including their power electronic converters in some details for deriving the dynamic close-loop model of the vessel power system and their design and testing procedures. The testing results, obtained through detailed system simulation, have validated the system design characteristics and performances, and proved the effectiveness of the proposed power and control systems to neutralize the effect of transient propulsion loads.
