Supercapacitors attract great interest because of the increasing and urgent demand for environment-friendly high-power energy sources. Ti3C2, a member of MXene family, is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors owing to its excellent chemical and physical properties. However, the highest gravimetric capacitance of the MXene-based electrodes is still relatively low (245 F g−1) and the key challenge to improve this is to exploit more pseudocapacitance by increasing the active site concentration. Here, a method to significantly improve the gravimetric capacitance of Ti3C2Tx MXenes by cation intercalation and surface modification is reported. After K+ intercalation and terminal groups (OH−/F−) removing, the intercalation pseudocapacitance is three times higher than the pristine MXene, and MXene sheets exhibit a significant enhancement (about 211% of the origin) in the gravimetric capacitance (517 F g−1 at a discharge rate of 1 A g−1). Moreover, the as-prepared electrodes show above 99% retention over 10 000 cycles. This improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the large interlayer voids of Ti3C2 and lowest terminated surface group concentration. This study demonstrates a new strategy applicable to other MXenes (Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, etc.) in maximizing their potential applications in energy storage.
