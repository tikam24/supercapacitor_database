This article presents interpretation of electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) floating ageing results by a new model called multi-pore (MP) model. This model allows to separate the different pores by time constant and to follow each pore group ageing. A comparison between ageing interpretation between the classical EDLC impedance model used for EDLC ageing monitoring (the constant phase element (CPE) model) and the multi-pore model will be achieved. This is the first time that multi-pore model is used for interpretation of EDLC floating ageing. Â© 2012 IEEE.
