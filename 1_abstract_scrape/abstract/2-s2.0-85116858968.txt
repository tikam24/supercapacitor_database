A composite material electrode consisting of NiCo2O4 and MnO2 was synthesized by hydrothermal method and electrodeposition followed by annealing treatment and simply drying. Then, a serious of electrochemical tests were performed to measure the electrochemical characteristics. The obtained electrode shows a prominent specific capacitance of 1485.24 F g−1 (2 A g−1) and satisfying cycling stability of 87.5% (3000 cycles) compared to the beginning. Moreover, we fabricated an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device successfully which is based on MnO2/NiCo2O4/Ni Foam (simplified as MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF). Through testing, the ASC device exhibits a noteworthy specific capacitance of 108.4 F g−1 (1 A g−1). All these prominent performances, to the greatest extent, can prove that the obtained MnO2/NiCo2O4 composite material is suitable for supercapacitor.
