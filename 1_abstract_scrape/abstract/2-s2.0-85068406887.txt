A free-standing hybrid film combining graphene and zinc oxide nanoflakes used as electrode materials was prepared by facile filtration self-assembly and thermal reduction process. The as-prepared ZnO nanoflakes were inserted into the graphene sheets to form unique layer-layer structure. The hybrid film can be directly employed as binder-free and self-supported electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). The max specific capacitance of fabricated zinc oxide nanoflakes/reduced graphene oxide (ZnO/rGO) SCs is as high as 167.2 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which is nearly 50% higher than pure rGO (111.4 F g−1) and more than twice as much as ZnO nanoflakes (71.1 F g−1). The enhanced electrochemical performance could be due to the efficient utilization of electroactive ZnO nanoflakes and high conductive graphene sheets network and the good synergistic effect between them. The free-standing hybrid film also exhibits an excellent cycling capability, retention of the initial capacity over 90% after 2000 cycles. The EIS analysis of the hybrids showed low electrical resistance, improving ion diffusion capacity and surface charge transfer performance of the working electrode. It holds a potential for high performance electrochemical energy storage applications.
