Supercapacitors are energy storage devices with higher capacitance and energy density than conventional capacitors and batteries. They are made up of three important distinct components: the electrodes, the electrolyte, and the separator. Polymeric nanocomposite materials have found applications in all these components. The use of conducting polymers such as polyaniline, polythiophene, poly-(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene), and polypyrrole filled with carbon-based materials has been observed to be suitable for high-performance supercapacitors. More specifically, the influence of the addition of fullerene to the conducting polymer enhances the specific capacitance, the energy density, and the power density of the supercapacitors. Fullerene nanoparticles exit in various forms, such as C60, C70, C76, C78, C80, etc. This chapter discusses the performance of supercapacitors based on polymer/fullerene nanocomposites.
