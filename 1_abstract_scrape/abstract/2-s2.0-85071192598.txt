Layered hierarchical CoMoO4 nano-structured arrays grown on nickel foam were designed and synthesized by a two-step hydrothermal method following by annealing. With the increase in the nearly three times loading mass of active materials, the specific capacitance of the layered hierarchical CoMoO4 nano-structured arrays only shows a slight loss compared with the single-layer CoMoO4 nano-structured arrays, which dramatically improved the areal capacitance from 2.47 to 6.79 F cm-2. Also, the layered hierarchical CoMoO4 nano-structured arrays showed 94.8% capacitance retention after 2500 cycles, which is mainly due to the welldesigned layered hierarchical structure and good conductivity.
