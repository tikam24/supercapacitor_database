Hollow or solid graphene beads were fabricated via a simple emulsion process by using polyvinylpyrrolidone as the binder of graphene oxide sheets to keep spherical shape stable. The stirring rate played an important role in the diameters of graphene beads and internal morphologies. The graphene beads with wrinkled structure were applied for supercapacitor electrode materials and exhibited a specific capacitance of 237 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> in 6 M KOH.
