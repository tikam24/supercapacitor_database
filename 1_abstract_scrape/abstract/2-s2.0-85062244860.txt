N/P co-doped hierarchically porous carbon materials were successfully prepared using polypyrrole (PPy) as carbon precursors via a one-step carbonization-activation method. The electrochemical capacitive behavior of the prepared carbons was systematically studied in 6 mol/L KOH and 1 mol/L Na 2 SO 4 electrolytes. The specific surface area of carbon material (A-Z0) after activation was found to be 1 433 m 2 /g with a total pore volume of 0.96 cm 3 /g. Nitrogen and phosphorus contents were 1.78% and 0.24%, respectively. The synergistic effect of high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity and N/P functionalities resulted in an excellent electrochemical characteristic of A-Z0 material. Specific capacitances of A-Z0 reached 209.3 and 176 F/g at current densities of 0.5 and 30 A/g, respectively, showing high specific capacitance and outstanding rate performance. In addition, A-Z0 exhibited superior cyclic stability (98% retention after 10 000 cycles at 4 A/g). The A-Z0 based symmetric capacitor was assembled and delivered high energy density of 13.3 Wh/kg in neutral electrolyte, indicating potential applicability of A-Z0 material in supercapacitors.
