The capacitor properties of cobalt compound nanowire (CCNW) electrodes, prepared by the one-step electroreduction of [Co(NH3) 6]3+ in water, have been investigated. The CCNW electrode changes its various properties during its growth. During the initial growth stage, the CCNW electrodes consist of nanowires with smooth surfaces and have a specific capacitance (Cm) of 310 F g-1. During the middle stage, prickles grow on the CCNW surface, leading to a reduction in its real surface area and its Cm value to 230 F g-1. During the final stage, further growth of the prickles is accompanied by the fusion of the CCNWs, and hence, a drastic decrease in the real surface area. However, a maximum capacitance of Cm = 420 F g-1 was obtained during this stage. This unexpected capacitance change was discussed in terms of the effects of rapid ion transfer and the electroactive material/electrolyte interface area. In addition, the aging effect and the cycle life of the CCNW electrode were also investigated. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.
