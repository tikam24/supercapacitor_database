The conventional energy sources are depleting drastically. The engineers and practitioners have to overcome challenge for fulfillment of tremendous growth in the demand of electrical power. The option is to think about the renewable energy sources, providing the clean output. The renewable includes solar energy sources, wind energy, pumped storage scheme, tidal energy etc. The major drawbacks of the renewable are the variable and intermittent output. The output depends upon the naturally available uncontrolled input. Due this major drawbacks in integrating such a sources with a grid while fulfilling the grid specification, the upcoming research uses various energy storage technologies to smooth the output of renewable before injecting in to the grid. This paper includes the energy storage technologies as fuel cell and super capacitor for mitigating the output fluctuation of wind power farm. In this paper the simulation with hybrid ESS (energy storage system) for smoothing the power output in wind farm is discussed. The system is validated with simulation in MATLAB 7.
