A cylindrical composite material of three-dimensional copper oxide/graphene oxide aerogel (3DCuO/GOA) has been successfully synthesized as a supercapacitor electrode material by a convenient one-step hydrothermal self-assembly method. Citric acid is not only used as a reducing agent for GO but also as a binding agent for coating CuO on the surfaces of GO sheets. The structural and morphological properties of 3DCuO/GOA have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is shown that CuO is distributed on the surfaces of GO sheets. Electrochemical behavior and supercapacitive performance of the composite electrode have been investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and chronopotentiometric charge/discharge. The as-prepared 3DCuO/GOA material exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 211 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution.
