Ti3C2Tx has attracted great attention as negative electrode material of supercapacitors owing to its high metallic conductivity, abundant surface terminations, and suitable potential range. However, the inevitable restacking of two-dimensional nanosheets dramatically restrain the electrochemical performances of individual Ti3C2Tx electrodes. In this work, interface-induced in-situ growth strategy was developed to construct W18O49/Ti3C2Tx heterostructures through a simple solvothermal reaction. The optimized W18O49/Ti3C2Tx hybrid electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 472.6 F g−1 at 1 mV s−1 and retained 73.3% of its initial capacitance under 100-fold scan rate. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with W18O49/Ti3C2Tx negative electrode and RuO2@CC positive electrode exhibited a high energy density of 29.6 Wh kg−1 and maximum power density of 7.0 kW kg−1. In sum, the designed negative electrode materials look promising for future use in high-energy-density supercapacitors.
