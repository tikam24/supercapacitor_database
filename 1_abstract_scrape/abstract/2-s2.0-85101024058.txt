Imparting high energy density to already power dense capacitor leads to hybrid supercapacitor (SC), which is most sought after in automobile, heavy-duty electronics application, and internet of things. The hybrid SCs with lithium or sodium ion chemistry demand organic electrolytes for their operation, which is environmental unfriendly and poses fire-hazard. As an alternative, here we report a low cost and highly safe energetic hybrid SC based on zinc-ion chemistry operated in 3 M ZnSO4 with high surface area (1018 ± 4 m2 g−1) hierarchical porous carbon cathode material derived from the Tamarindusindica seeds (ACTS-800), a bio-source. The hybrid SC demonstrates a maximum energy density of 127 (± 3) Wh kg−1 (254 μWh cm−2) at 0.1 A g−1 and power density of 7920 (± 24) W kg−1 (15.84 mW cm−2) at 10 A g−1. Besides having excellent power/energy density values, ∼ 100% capacity retention over 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles was observed. The most interesting feature of this SC is its low open-circuit voltage decay (34% in 60 h) and low leakage current density (11 mA g−1), which allows it to hold charge for longer duration qualifying it as one of the best aqueous SC known in the literature.
