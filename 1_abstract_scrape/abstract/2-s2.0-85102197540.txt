The work is devoted to increasing the energy efficiency of uninterruptible power supplies in enterprises with a continuous technological cycle. During the operation of continuous technological processes, a power failure even for a short period of time leads to significant economic damage. The most modern technical solution to this problem is the creation of guaranteed power supply systems using diesel power plants (DES) and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), based on rechargeable batteries and supercapacitor modules. It is proposed to use supercapacitors in parallel with the battery in order to ensure the stable operation of the diesel generators under starting conditions, as well as during load transfer. In this case, when using supercapacitors, it becomes possible to reduce the power capacity of the generators and uninterruptible power supplies along with the size of their batteries. Therefore, the cost of the solution decreases and its energy efficiency increases. To test the efficiency of the system, a computer model was created using MATLAB. The system showed a successful operation in supplying the load from all the power sources as well as maintaining Unity Power Factor at the Mains/Generator side.
