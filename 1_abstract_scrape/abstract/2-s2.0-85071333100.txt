Biochar produced by pyrolyzing biomass at relatively low temperature generally possesses poor conductivity and is rarely used in the field of energy-storage. Herein, a nitrogen-enriched compact biochar-based material with high conductivity is successfully prepared from sodium ligninsulfonate, graphene oxide and p-phenylenediamine through evaporation and low temperature pyrolysis. Sodium ligninsulfonate is used as biochar source, and graphene oxide is reduced to provide high conductivity. The product of p-phenylenediamine reacting with sodium ligninsulfonate and graphene oxide, and polymerized through evaporation and carbonization process forms compact char. As-prepared biochar possesses high nitrogen content (14.3 at.%), yield (69.5 wt%), density (1.98 g cm−3) and conductivity (~0.078 S m−1). The biochar single-electrode exhibits superior gravimetric specific capacitance (480 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), ultrahigh volumetric specific capacitance (950 F cm−3) and good cycle stability in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Particularly, assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivers outstanding gravimetric and volumetric energy density (13.4 W h kg−1 and 26.5 W h L−1, respectively) in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, and even better performance in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (21.6 W h kg−1 and 42.8 W h L−1, respectively). This novel strategy provides a promising approach to prepare biochar-based materials as high performance supercapacitor electrodes in the applications of sustainable energy-storage devices.
