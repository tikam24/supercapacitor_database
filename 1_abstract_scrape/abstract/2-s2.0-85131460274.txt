2D layered MoS2-carbon composite developed with the DC sputtering technique is a promising electrode material. The phase purity of the composite thin film is examined by the X-ray diffraction technique. The morphological study reveals the formation of nanoworms structures, which is suitable for charge storage. Elemental mapping and core level spectroscopy (XPS) confirm the presence of appropriate compositional and valence states of molybdenum, sulfur, and carbon constituents. The fabricated supercapacitor symmetric device has specific capacitance, energy and power values of 118 Fg−1, 41.21 WhKg−1, and 0.61 kWKg−1 respectively.
