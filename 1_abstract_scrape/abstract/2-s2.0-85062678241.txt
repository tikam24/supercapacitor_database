Due to the advantages and limitations on each particular electric source, the hybridization of sources and storage elements is becoming a necessity for embedded applications. This, in order to ensure particularly the continuity of service and the components lifespan. The hybrid electrical vehicle is the best example that uses the embedded system, namely the fuel cell as a primary source and the battery and/or supercapacitor as storage elements. However, the energy management of hybrid electrical system is a crucial task to be answered in order to satisfy different criteria and meet other objectives. In this paper, the studied hybrid electric system is composed of a fuel cell as the main source and a battery as the auxillary source. Each one of them is controlled using its own power converter to supply the load. The proposed strategy of the energy management is using nonlinear control based on passivity method. The passivity based control allows a smart energy management and proves the system stability by making it passive which is an undoubtable advantage compared to the classical controllers that show limitations in terms of the uses, saturation and the lack of stability prove. The performance of the proposed controller is validated by simulation and experimental studies. The obtained results prove the efficacy and the feasibility of the proposed approach for a real electrical vehicle.
