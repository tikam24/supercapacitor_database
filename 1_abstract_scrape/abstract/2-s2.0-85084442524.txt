SnS/Ni foam electrode via in situ hydrothermal growth as multifunctional catalyst for both electrochemical energy storage and conversion was explored. Half cell fabrication was achieved with usage of binder free in situ grown SnS/Ni foam working electrode in alkaline medium for supercapacitor and water oxidation. Higher specific capacitance of 686F/g at 10 mV/s and 145F/g at 5 A/g was achieved for SnS/Ni foam electrode from cyclic voltammogram (CV) and galvanostatic charging discharging (GCD) profiles. The higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of 419 mA/g with 286 mV overpotential was attained from linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) study with very low charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 12.9 Î©. Excellent and robust OER stability of 99% was achieved over 10 h of sustainable water oxidation. This result would give an appreciable impact on in situ growth of metal chalcogenides for electrochemical energy applications.
