In the present investigation, we report facile synthesis method for the large area growth of nanoflakesof β-Co(OH)2 thin film on SS substrate. The X-ray diffraction studies confimi the phase formation with brucite structure. The average thickness of the nanoflakes is about 100 nm. The electrochemical capacitive behavior of β-Co(OH)2 thin film is investigated by cyclic voltammetry in 1M KOH electrolyte and shows maximum specifie capacitance of 374 Fg-1. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
