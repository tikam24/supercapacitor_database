A facile synthesis scheme is employed to form NiMoO4/CoMoO4 nanorods. The as-prepared sample was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical characterization of the sample was investigated by employing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Our facilely synthesized NiMoO4/CoMoO4 nanorods utilizes the synergic effects of Ni and Co ternary molybdates which enabled a high specific capacitance of 1445 F/g to be achieved at a current density of 1 A/g and retained 78.8% of its initial capacitance after 3000 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g. The sample also exhibited a low ionic resistance of 1.20 Î©. This performance was much higher than individual NiMoO4 and CoMoO4 nanorods. The simple and scalable scheme employed to form the high performance NiMoO4/CoMoO4 nanorods makes it a significant low cost electrode material for supercapacitor application.
