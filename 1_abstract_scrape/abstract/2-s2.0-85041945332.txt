We have successfully synthesized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with controlled sizes and morphology by a facile method in methanol solution. Then the varisized ZIF-8 coated on the carbon nanotube film (CNTF) and further electrochemically deposited polypyrrole (PPy) to give flexible porous electrodes (noted as PPy/XZIF-8-CNTF). Electrochemical dates show that the PPy/lZIF-8-CNTF electrode prepared by large size ZIF-8 exhibits an exceptional areal capacitance (264.8 mF cm−2) at the current density of 1.0 mA cm−2. We also assembled and tested a PPy/lZIF-8-CNTF symmetric solid-state supercapacitor, which shows excellent areal capacitance (143.3 mF cm−2) at the current density of 0.4 mA cm−2. The device also exhibits good cycle stability and flexibility.
