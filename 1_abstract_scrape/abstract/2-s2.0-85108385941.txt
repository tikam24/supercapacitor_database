As globally, the main focus of the researchers is to develop novel electrode materials that exhibit high energy and power density for efficient performance energy storage devices. This review covers the up-to-date progress achieved in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) (e.g. MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, and WSe2) as electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). The TMDs have remarkable properties like large surface area, high electrical conductivity with variable oxidation states. These properties enable the TMDs as the most promising candidates to store electrical energy via hybrid charge storage mechanisms. Consequently, this review article provides a detailed study of TMDs structure, properties, and evolution. The characteristics technique and electrochemical performances of all the efficient TMDs are highlighted meticulously. In brief, the present review article shines a light on the structural and electrochemical properties of TMD electrodes. Furthermore, the latest fabricated TMDs based symmetric/asymmetric SCs have also been reported.
