KMnO4 reacted with MnCl2 while doped different activated carbon in reaction kettle at 140℃ for 6 h, then compo-site electrode materials for supercapacitor were prepared after ball mill. Specific surface area of 451 m2/g was obtained through BET mehtod for content of 29wt% activated carbon. XRD result revealed that MnO2/activated carbon composite were hydrated and amorphous. Morphology of composite was tiny and surrounded micro-nanometer pompon globe by SEM. XPS spectrum showed composite existence of Mn4+ in oxide form. Specific capacitance of the electrode reached 365 F/g when scan rate was 50 mV/s, and charge-discharge efficiency was 93% as well as equivalent series resistance value of 0.87 Ω. Composite electrode appeared crystal phase with different degree after 3 000 cycles, meanwhile, morphology of the electrode turned into particles and block, and capacitance value of the electrode decayed to only approximate 6%.
