This paper investigates the dependence of the supercapacitor Peukert constant on its terminal voltage when a constant power load is applied. Recent studies show that the energy delivered by a supercapacitor during a constant power discharge process increases when the discharge power decreases if the discharge power is above a certain threshold, i.e., Peukert's law applies. This paper reveals that the supercapacitor Peukert constant associated with a constant power discharge process increases when the initial voltage of the discharge process is lower. The physical mechanisms accounting for the Peukert constant dependence on voltage are illustrated by analyzing a five-branch RC ladder circuit model for supercapacitors.
