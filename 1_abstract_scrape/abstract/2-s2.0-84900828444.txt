In this paper, size controllable SiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by adjusting the hydrolysis-condensation time and the concentration of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol-water solution in the presence of ammonia as a catalyst were encapsulated within resorcinol-formaldehyde polymer microspheres which were fabricated in the same ethanol-water-ammonia system. After carbonization and following etching with NaOH solution, a series of mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs) with an average diameter of 500 nm, a mesopore size of 3.2-14 nm and surface areas of 659-872 m2 g -1 are obtained. As electrode materials for supercapacitors, typical samples of MCMs with a mesopore size of 3.2 nm and 13.5 nm show an initial specific capacitance of 289 and 268 F g-1 under a current density of 1.0 A g-1. After 10000 charge-discharge cycles, the specific capacity remains 261 and 254 F g-1 with the retention of 90.3% and 94.7%. Besides, electrochemical performances influenced by the mesopore size were investigated. Â© 2014 the Partner Organisations.
