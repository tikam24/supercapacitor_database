By offering a green and sustainable option to reusing biomass, the creation of energy harvesting/storage systems from biomass/waste materials has significant scientific and technological implications. To achieve the required applications in the fields of supercapacitor and conversion, microstructure management is crucial for carbon-based materials. Here, a facile production of heteroatom-doped porous carbon (HAPC) from Enhydra fluctuant leaves as electrode material for supercapacitor is demonstrated. Large specific-surface area and good pore-size distribution were achieved. An exceptional specific-capacitance (Csp) 428 F/g at 1 A/g in an acidic electrolyte was achieved. The solid-state symmetric-supercapacitor device (SSSD) produces the highest Csp of 113 F/g and 73.88 Wh/kg energyâ€“density at 1 A/g, whereas 5.11 kW/kg power-density was achieved at 10 A/g. The SSSD exhibits outstanding durability, where it holds 94% of its Csp after 10,000 charge/discharge series.
