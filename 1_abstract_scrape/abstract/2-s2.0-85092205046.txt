An easy arc discharge method was developed to synthesize nanocomposites composed of Mn3 O4 nanoparticles loaded on graphene sheets. The morphology and structure of the obtained nanocomposites were analysed via X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical behaviour of the product was evaluated via cyclic voltammetry and alternating current impedance. Results showed that Mn3 O4 was dispersed homogeneously on the surface of graphene. The supercapacitor constructed by graphene/Mn3 O4 as the positive electrode showed both high capacitance and good electronic conduction, which may lead to the development of nanocomposites with great potential for applications in biosensors and electrode material analysis.
