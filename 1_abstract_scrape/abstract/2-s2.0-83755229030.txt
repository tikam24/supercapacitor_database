Nanocomposites supercapacitors electrodes are synthesized by homogeneously coating the nano-structured polypyrrole (PPy) on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) via a facile electrochemical method. The capacitance properties of the composites are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. The results show that the porous composites structure exhibit a remarkable specific capacitance of 674 F g -1 at a current density of 2 A g -1. Electrochemical experiments indicate that the high specific capacitance is associated with uniform PPy coating. Moreover, the composites present a nearly ideal rectangular shape of cyclic voltammetry characteristics. The stability of the composites electrode is also examined and only 10% capacitance decrease after 800 cycles. This technique provides a feasible solution for developing high-performance electrical energy storage devices.
