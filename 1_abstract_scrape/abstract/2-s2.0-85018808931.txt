Based on the analysis of its working mechanism, it is found that the impact load of traditional micro-turbine power generation system during its operation in microgrid is due to the slow response of its micro-turbine output power regulation, aiming at which, a strategy of quick instantaneous power control based on the impact compensation is proposed to make up for the instantaneous output power shortage of micro-turbine. The instantaneous compensation power control is based on the power response prediction of micro-turbine generator set while the quick dynamic power response is based on the super-capacitor energy storage to compensate the slow dynamic power response of micro-turbine output power, which balances the system instantaneous power in real time to ensure the stable DC bus voltage and enhance the adaptability of microturbine power generation system for the impact load. The correctness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy are verified by experiments.
