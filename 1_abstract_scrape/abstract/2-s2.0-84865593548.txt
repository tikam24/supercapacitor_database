Two step reduction method that microwave irradiation combined with high temperature pyrolysis was employed for the preparation of graphene. The two step reduction results in fully reduction and exfoliation of graphite oxide. The obtained graphene is of good conductivity and its specific surface area is up to 675.4 m 2·g -1. In this work, the as-prepared graphene was used as raw materials for the fabrication of graphene/Co-Ni double hydroxides composites with the hydrothermal synthesis method. Electrochemical property of the composites was also investigated as supercapacitor electrode materials. The research revealed the wrinkled graphene nanosheets were well dispersed in the Co-Ni double hydroxides. This improved conductivity and structure stability of the Co- Ni double hydroxides. At 0.25 A·g -1 discharge current' the supercapacitor specific capacitance was 800.2 F·g -1. With increase of current density up to 10 A·g -1 the discharge current specific capacitance was 386.5 F·g -1. After galvanostatic charge-discharge 500 times the specific capacitance also remains more than 99%' indicating that the composites is of excellent electrochemical performance.
