This paper proposes a hierarchical active power management strategy for a medium voltage (MV) islanded microgrid including a multihybrid power conversion system (MHPCS). To guarantee excellent power management, a modular power conversion system is realized by parallel connection of small MHPCS units. The hybrid system includes fuel cells (FC) as main and supercapacitors (SC) as complementary power sources. The SC energy storage compensates the slow transient response of the FC stack and supports the FC to meet the grid power demand. The proposed control strategy of the MHPCS comprises three control loops; dc-link voltage controller, power management controller, and load current sharing controller. Each distributed generation (DG) unit uses an adaptive proportional resonance (PR) controller for regulating the load voltage, and a droop control strategy for average power sharing among the DG units. The performance of the proposed control strategy is verified by using digital time-domain simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. Â© 2010-2012 IEEE.
