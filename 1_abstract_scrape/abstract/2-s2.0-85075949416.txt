Conductivity of supercapacitor based PAni-GO-Cellulose-Lanthanum has been improved by modifying the surface of Al current collector using chemical etching methods and gamma irradiation. The purpose of this research is to study the effect of surface roughness of current collector, and radiation dose of gamma irradiation to interface resistance, internal resistance, and conductivity supercapacitor. The roughness of the Al current collector surface can increase the contact area between the electrode and the current collector by increasing the adhesion force, while the irradiation of the PAni-GO-Cellulose-Lanthanum electrode material can improve the wettability properties of the electrode with increasing carboxyl group, thus helping the ion dispersion process in the electrode. The experimental results showed that the chemical etching process at 0.4 N NaNO3 concentration, and irradiation dose at 40 kGy gave a synergistic effect on the performance improvement of the supercapacitor by decreasing the resistance interface to 109.67 Ω and the internal resistance to 122.63 Ω, also increasing the conductivity to 1160 μS/cm. The improved conductivity properties of the supercapacitor cell represent an alternative promising candidate for the application as energy storage devices and offered a new facile method.
