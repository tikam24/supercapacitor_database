A facile hydrothermal reduction of self-assembled 3D graphene oxide (GO) is reported. A binder-free flexible supercapacitor is fabricated using the 3D graphene made in house, which exhibits high gravimetric capacitance (up to 220 F g-1) and excellent cycle stability with >80% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles under a bending state.
