This paper presents the smart public transportation network expansion and its interaction with the grid. Electric buses have been used to perform the mass transportation in the Guwahati city, Assam, India. Electric buses receive energy from the electric bus stops that are present through the ring road of the Guwahati city. A high capacity energy storage device and the solar plant have been connected to every bus stop, to achieve the smooth performance of the smart public transportation network. In this work, the capa-buses (supercapacitor based buses) and the electric vehicles have been used along with the electric buses to expand the electrified transportation network in the Guwahati city. Algorithm based controllers are responsible to control the energy flow between the high capacity energy storage device, the capa-buses and the electric vehicles. Fuzzy logic controller is present at every bus stop to control the energy flow between the grid, the energy storage device and the solar plant. The complete system response has been verified through Simulations: for different situations in all the seasons of a year and for the uncertain situations that exist in the system. This system is helpful to improve the air quality in city region and also improves the voltage profile of the grid.
