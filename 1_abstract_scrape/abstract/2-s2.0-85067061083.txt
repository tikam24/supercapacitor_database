Ni0.6-xMo0.4-xIrx-oxide coatings were fabricated with the purpose of investigating the influence of Ir content on their charge storage/delivery capability when used as an electrode for electrochemical supercapacitor. Experimental work in alkaline medium confirmed that the amount of Ir in the Ni-Mo-oxide significantly influences the material’s charge storage capacity. The highest overall capacitance (108 ± 2 mFcm−2 at 1 mA cm−2) was obtained for the composition containing 40 mol% of Ir (Ni0.36Mo0.24Ir0.4-oxide), while the best candidates in terms of the intrinsic (surface area–independent) charge storage/delivery are the compositions containing 20 and 40 mol% of Ir (no statistical difference). Ni0.36Mo0.24Ir0.4-oxide was found to retain ca. 86% of its initial capacitance after 2500 charge-discharge cycles, at 1 mA cm−2.
