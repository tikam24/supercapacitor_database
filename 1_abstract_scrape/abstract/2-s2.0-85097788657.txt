In this paper, a Split-pi converter is presented for resistance welding application. Generally, the resistance welding application requires high current and low voltage circuits with high operating frequency as a current pulse shaper. The recently invented Split-pi converter has great potential in the power electronics field due to its ability to work in different switching modes during operation. The utilization of hybrid energy storage such as battery-supercapacitor combination in the resistance welding application can make a negative effect on the current pulse shaper circuit. To overcome this effect, a Split-pi converter is presented in this work. The operation of the converter topology is validated with simulated results.
