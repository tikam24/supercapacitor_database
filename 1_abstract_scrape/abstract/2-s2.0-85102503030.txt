Hybrid materials are essential materials for the future age elite electrochemical supercapacitors. A hybrid material or organic polymer-inorganic metal oxide composite comprises of polyaniline (PANI) with fly ash (FA) is made by in-situ polymerization of aniline monomer with fly ash, an inexhaustible asset. The impact of fly ash on polyaniline is resolved from electrical and electrochemical measurements. PANI-FA is utilized in a supercapacitor cell as the electrode. FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, TGA and BET evaluate properties of this hybrid, and their electrochemical properties are assessed by CV, CD, and EIS measurements. PANI with 10 wt.% of FA (PANI-FA01) indicates higher conductivity and supercapacitor execution than its individual material via metal oxide, acting as an intermediate for transferring ions from PANI and electrolyte. PANI-FA01 demonstrates a higher capacitance estimation of 208 F g−1 contrasted with PANI (83 F g−1) at 2.5 A g−1. The hybrid electrode material shows better charge-discharge cycles, holding over 66 % of its first cycle gravimetric capacitance after 5000 cycles with effective coulombic efficiency of 99–100 %, which is as yet 43 % higher than the specific capacity of PANI. The Bode plot shows a phase angle of 80°.
