To enable a society based on carbon-free electricity, electric energy storage is crucial. In this regard, the development of novel supercapacitors with high capacity and long cycling stability is critical as supercapacitors have a higher power density than batteries. A promising group of supercapacitors is chalcogenide-based materials as they show excellent ionic conductivity and stability. Moreover, ternary chalcogenides are earth-abundant, low-cost, non-hazardous materials, and the third constituting element can optimize the structural and electrochemical properties leading to improved performances. However, so far, only a few ternary chalcogenide-based supercapacitors have been developed. Herein, we have synthesised and characterized Cu3Sb(S/Se)4, Cu9S5, and Cu2-xSe using the same solution-based method at 150Â°C. We compare the electric properties of all four compounds to check their suitability as supercapacitor electrode materials. The highest capacitance and cyclic stability is found for Cu3SbS4. Notably during CV studies, very high specific capacitance of 397 F/g was recorded at 5 mV/s. Motivated by this result, a coin cell based on Cu3SbS4 is developed showing 21 F/g at a current rate of 0.5 A/g with excellent cyclic stability.
