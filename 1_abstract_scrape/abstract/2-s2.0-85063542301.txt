The paper describes design of the induction motor based test bench that replaces a real elevator drive system and load for performing tests and research on energy storage system for brakmg energy recovery. Before physical implementation a virtual model of the bench was buV and simulations were performed by using Matlab/Simulink software. After verification of system work in simulation software real hardware with test bench control system was designed, the working principle of the bench and applied components is described in the paper. The developed test bench was used to test bidirectional DC-DC converter with supercapacitors based energy storage for braking energy recovery of elevator, some test results are reported in the paper.
