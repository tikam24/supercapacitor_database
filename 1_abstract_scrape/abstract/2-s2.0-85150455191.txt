Flexible supercapacitors show potential applications in wearable and portable electronic energy storage devices. Carbon materials usually serve as flexible substrate and conductive active filler in flexible supercapacitors due to their excellent flexibility, high conductivity and large specific surface area. Hence, this paper reviewed three energy storage mechanisms in supercapacitors, the double electric layer, the pseudocapacitor and the hybrid. The latest research progress of carbon materials as flexible substrate and conductive filler was introduced in the following part, respectively. According to three energy storage mechanisms, the analysis of carbon materials as flexible substrate and pseudocapacitance materials can provide not only large specific surface area, but also a large number of active sites for redox reaction. As a conductive filler, it can improve the stability of pseudocapacitance materials and transport channel for electrolyte ions. Finally, the main problems of current electrode design in terms of mechanical properties, preparation methods and evaluation standards were presented.
