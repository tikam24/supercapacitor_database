Graphene is a new two-dimensional carbon material. Its special lattice structure and the nature of the carbon element make it perform excellent in the fields of electricity, heat, light, force, and so on. It also has great potential for applications in some branches of the electrical field. This paper first introduced the structure and common preparation methods of graphene. Then the current research status and applications mechanism of graphene in several fields of electrical field were reviewed, namely, lithium ion battery field, super capacitor field, transistor field and electromagnetic shielding field. Finally, it is concluded that the future research of graphene will focus on the optimization of production process to improve its own structure and the composition with other materials.
