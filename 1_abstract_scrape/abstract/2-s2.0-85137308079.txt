The development of a smart and simple “one stone two birds” synthetic strategy to design remarkable electrode material for green energy harvesting and storage has always been challenging. Among the materials, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are the most potential hotspot for developing state-of-the-art materials for efficient oxygen evolution and energy storage application because of their fascinating chemical and structural traits. Herein we present a wet chemical method for the synthesis of a binder-free electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and an admirable supercapacitor electrode. The designed 3D MOF (AgTz-1) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution activity, with an ultralow overpotential (η) of 196 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 114 mV dec-1. Furthermore, the AgTz-1-based electrode has a high energy density of 49.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 545 W kg−1. The results demonstrated not only a benchmark for pristine MOF in electrocatalysis and energy storage but also a novel family of nitrogen-rich MOF to enhance electrocatalytic performance due to significant active sites.
