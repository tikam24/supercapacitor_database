Fullerene, a remarkable nanocarbon, has attracted considerable attention in recent decades. The most significant application of fullerene is the reinforcement in polymer matrices. This review basically highlights several indispensable aspects of the fullerenes and polymer/fullerene nanocomposites with special emphasis on high-performance coatings. Various methods have been employed to develop the polymer/fullerene nanocomposite coatings such as blade/knife coating, spin coating, and printing techniques. The dramatic improvement in the nanocomposite coating properties (electrical, photovoltaic, capacitive, thermal, mechanical, and physical features) may be attributed to the interfacial interactions between fullerene and the polymer matrices. Moreover, the nanoscale morphology of the nanocomposite coating may affect the formation of the charge transport pathways and essential material characteristics. However, the major challenges to attain the high-performance polymer/fullerene nanocomposite coatings include the facile processing, nanofiller dispersion, and adhesion between the matrix and nanofiller. The challenges can be overcome by using the functional fullerene nanoparticles, which may be capable of forming the physically or covalently linked functional networks accountable for the improved features of these nanocomposite coatings. Finally, the functional and future prospects of the high-performance polymer/fullerene nanocomposite coatings have been summarized regarding the progress in the emerging area of the fullerene-based nanocomposite technology especially the solar cells, supercapacitors, fuel cells, batteries, sensors, etc. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
