CAP-XX supercapacitors, with their high C (1 F or more)and low ESR (<100mÎ©) are able to support the battery and provide the pulse power required by the LED, while their thin prismatic form-factor works in a space-constrained application such as camera phone. There are two places where supercapacitors can be placed, to provide enough LED flash power to eliminate dark and blurry photos from a lack of light. In one case the supercapacitorcan be placed at the output of a buck-boost converter while other uses a supercapacitor in series with the battery. The second case enables to achieve higher LED current for a given battery current than from using a current controlled boost converter to directly drive the flash LEDs like in solution 1.
