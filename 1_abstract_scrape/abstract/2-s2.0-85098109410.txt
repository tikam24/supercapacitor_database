As one kind of agricultural bio-waste, the corn stalk is abundant in the nature. The corn stalk carbon owns inherent sheet-like and porous structure, bestowing favorable condition to load δ-MnO2 nanowalls on it. The corn stalk was directly carbonized at 500 °C without being activated by KOH, and the as-prepared carbon (Corn-C) was dispersed in KMnO4 solution and hydrothermal treated at 140 °C for 12 h, finally δ-MnO2/C composite was obtained. δ-MnO2/C possesses lower diffusive resistance and faster ion transport than pure δ-MnO2 due to the formation of meso- and macro-porous structure. δ-MnO2/C exhibits high specific capacitance of 520 F g−1 at the scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and excellent cycle stability. The capacitance retention is about 80.9% at 5 A g−1 after charging-discharging for 5000 cycles.
