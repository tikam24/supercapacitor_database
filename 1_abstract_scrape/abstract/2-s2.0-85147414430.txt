In this study, we developed a one-pot carbonization procedure to produce bacteria grafted graphene oxide for supercapacitor electrodes. Graphene oxide (GO) was combined with a gram positive bacterial (Bacillus sp.) solution, and carbonized at 600 Â°C for 1 h. As an electrode application for supercapacitor, the electrochemical characteristics showed exceptional electrochemical performance. At a current density of 1 A/g, the produced electrode's (B@GO) specific capacitance was 111.09 F/g, more than three times that of GO. It also had good cycling stability with 86.91 % retention after 5000 cycles. These fascinating findings imply that high-performance supercapacitor electrodes can be made from composites of GO and bacteria.
