A program to modify a hydrogen hybrid electric bus is described. This is an electric bus that uses a hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engine to charge on-board batteries. The primary goal of the reported work is to extend the range of the bus in a cost-effective manner. Among the modifications being made are the development of a new engine, upgrading the power control system, rewiring critical elements, adapting a supercapacitor regenerative braking system, devising more effective changes to the safety hydrogen systems, and adding a high pressure gas storage system to supplement the existing hydride bed hydrogen storage. All of this work is being supplemented with the use of a dynamic simulation code to determine optimal operational strategies. Â© 2000 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.
