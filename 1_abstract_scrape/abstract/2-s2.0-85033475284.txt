Nitrogen doped porous carbons (NCs) with high specific surface areas, moderate graphitization degree and high N contents were synthesized by pyrolysis of melamine sponge-polyaniline composite. The as-prepared NCs demonstrate considerable capacitive performances in acidic electrolyte. More importantly, the NCs demonstrated high catalytic activity for the redox reaction of iodides in acidic electrolyte, thus enabled prominent pseudocapacitance via the faradic reaction of redox electrolyte. Under the optimal concentration of KI in acidic electrolyte, the electrode specific capacitance achieved 616 F g−1, which is 3 folds higher over that in solely acidic electrolyte. High cycling performance was also maintained for the avoidance of volumetric variation of electrode during charge–discharge cycles. The current work proposed a viable way to ameliorate the capacitive performance via the catalytic NCs electrode-redox iodide electrolyte system.
