A one-step strategy for preparing 3D mesoporous graphene networks (3DMGNs) based on the concepts of space-confined effect, catalytic effect and chemical activation is reported in this work. The soluble salts act as the in-situ templates to confine the thickness of 3D graphene layers. Meanwhile, the Fe-catalysts greatly improve the graphitization of the graphene matrix, which are easy to be removed by acid treatment. In addition, the KOH activation introduces abundant mesopores into the graphene networks, which facilities the electrolyte permeation. Thus, when using as electrode materials for supercapacitor, the as-obtained 3DMGNs with high electron conductivity, large surface area and hierarchical porous structure exhibit excellent capacitive properties, including high specific capacitance (215 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 ) and superior rate performance (168 F g −1 at 50 A g −1 ).
