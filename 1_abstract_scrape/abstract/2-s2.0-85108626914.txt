With the increase of global energy consumption and serious environmental pollution, green and sustainable electrode materials are urgently needed for energy storage devices. Cellulose foams and aerogels have the advantages of low density, and biodegradability, which have been considered as versatile scaffolds for various applications. Recently, rational design and fabrication of cellulose based composite foams and aerogels for energy storage devices have received extensive attention which gradually becomes a hot spot in the research of sustainable electrode materials. In this review, we begin with a brief summary of the category and preparation strategies of cellulose foams and aerogels. Then, the fabrication methods of cellulose-based composite foams and aerogels compounded with various kinds of active materials are introduced, and their performances as electrode materials for supercapacitors and batteries were comprehensively elaborated, respectively. Finally, we proposed the current challenges and future prospects of the cellulose based composite foams and aerogels for advanced energy storage devices.
