This study reported an ultrahigh specific capacitance of a supercapacitor, using self-oxygen doped 3D-porous carbon derivatives from dried banana leaves. The samples were synthesized by ZnCl2 impregnation at different temperature pyrolysis of 700–900 °C. Furthermore, the overall process significantly increased the specific surface area from 429.6 to 860.4 m2 g−1 followed by the formation of 3D-interconnected pores structures. Unexpectedly, the activated carbon demonstrated high-level oxygen dopants between 9.47–12.45%. These valuable physical features showed a ultrahigh specific capacitance of 401 F g−1 and 235 F g−1 in a two-electrode configuration system, using electrolytes of 1 M H2SO4 and 6 M KOH, respectively. Also, electrochemical properties were evaluated in the form of pellet binder-free materials. Porous carbon sources were known to generate extensive specific energy of 55.69 Wh kg−1 and specific power of 200.09 W kg−1. Based on the technique and results, the use of hierarchical 3D-porous carbon derivatives is validated as robust electrode materials in developing high-performance electrochemical energy storage.
