In this article, we report a room-temperature synthesis of 3-dimentional (3D) Ag-graphene hybrid hydrogels and fabricate a symmetric supercapacitor with this hybrid material. The preparation of this 3D Ag-graphene hybrid hydrogel is facile and its application in macroscopic devices is more convenient than 2-dimentional (2D) graphene-based material. Our work may provide new insights into the room-temperature synthesis of graphene-based materials. In this novel 3D graphene-based material, the unique structure and combination with Ag nanoparticles made this material exhibit better electrochemical performance compared with the pure graphene. Thus, the obtained Ag-graphene hybrid hydorgels could be widely used in various energy storage devices. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
