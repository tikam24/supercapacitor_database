Perovskite oxides have recently emerged as a novel class of electrochemical materials owing to their amazing reversible redox capabilities and enriched electrical characteristics, rich oxygen vacancies, and highly stable structure. Herein, the impact of Nd-substitution on the morphological and electrochemical features of Nd-doped LaCoO3 nanoparticles has been studied. A facile and cost-effective sol-gel process routed via auto-ignition was used for sample synthesis. The development of pure single-phase cubic LaCoO3 perovskite and its structural stability throughout the series was confirmed via X-ray diffraction. The transformation from sponge-like structure to grains-like morphology was evident by a field-emission scanning electron microscope. Cyclic voltammetry measurements revealed a surface redox and intercalation pseudo-capacitive nature of the samples. It is outcome that La0.95Nd0.05CoO3 at 6 A g-1 of current density exhibits paramount power (5788.8 W kg-1) and energy (0.975 Wh kg-1) densities. All the revealed consequences had inferred La0.95Nd0.05CoO3 (x = 0.05) as a potential candidate for electrode material in supercapacitors.
