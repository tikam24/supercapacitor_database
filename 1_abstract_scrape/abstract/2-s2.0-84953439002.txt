In the present work, we describe a simple and easy method for the deposition of nanostructured cadmium oxide films on glass by spray pyrolysis. The electrochemical capacitive properties of these films have been studied for different electrolyte species under the different scan rates. The present results show a high value of specific capacitance of 18 F g-1 in 1MNaOHelectrolyte for the scan rate of 10mVs-1. This value of specific capacitance is the highest ever reported value for cadmium oxide thin films. These results emphasize that the ion diffusion between the electrode and the electrolyte is significantly high due to the highly porous nanostructure of cadmium oxide and these results confirms the cadmium oxide as a capacitive material. The constructed devices were stable even after the 1000 cycle.
