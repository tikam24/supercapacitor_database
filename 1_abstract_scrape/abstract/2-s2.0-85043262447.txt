Highly compressible electrodes are in high demand in volume-restricted energy storage devices. Superelastic reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogel with attractive characteristics are proposed as the promising skeleton for compressible electrodes. Herein, a ternary aerogel was prepared by successively electrodepositing polypyrrole (PPy) and MnO2 into the superelastic rGO aerogel. In the rGO/PPy/MnO2 aerogel, rGO aerogel provides the continuously conductive network; MnO2 is mainly responsible for pseudo reactions; the middle PPy layer not only reduces the interface resistance between rGO and MnO2, but also further enhanced the mechanical strength of rGO backbone. The synergistic effect of the three components leads to excellent performances including high specific capacitance, reversible compressibility, and extreme durability. The gravimetric capacitance of the compressible rGO/PPy/MnO2 aerogel electrodes reaches 366 F g-1 and can retain 95.3% even under 95% compressive strain. And a volumetric capacitance of 138 F cm-3 is achieved, which is much higher than that of other rGO-based compressible electrodes. This volumetric capacitance value can be preserved by 85% after 3500 charge/discharge cycles with various compression conditions. This work will pave the way for advanced applications in the area of compressible energy-storage devices meeting the requirement of limiting space.
