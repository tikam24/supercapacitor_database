This article proposes a multi-agent approach for managing electric vehicle energy. The vehicle power source consists of a Lithium Metal Polymer (LMP) battery and a Super-capacitor. The adopted management strategy is a hybrid strategy, based on three techniques of artificial intelligence, on the fuzzy logic and the genetic algorithms on one hand, on the other hand, on the multi-agent systems. These main methods were combined in the developed system to carry out the management task. The fuzzy inference system is first optimized off-line by the genetic algorithm. Then it is used during on-line checking to take into account the uncertain case. The architecture of our system is based on the agents, they have been applied to distribute the control tasks and locate accordingly the command of the components of the hybrid electrical source. During the simulation tests (on the New European Driving Cycle NEDC) we succeeded, due to the results, to achieve the objective of this work; indeed the system works effectively with the used method. Thus, the hybrid strategy is operational, and it realizes an important sheath in terms of energy, that is to say a longer autonomy of electric vehicle.
