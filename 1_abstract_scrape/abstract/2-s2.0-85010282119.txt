One-dimensional (1D) hierarchical structures composed of nickel sulfides/MoS2(NMS) supported on carbon nanotube (CNT) are fabricated through a one-step facile glucose-assisted hydrothermal method (NMS/CNT). The curled and tangled 1D structure is intertwined with each other and constructs three-dimensional (3D) porous networks, providing easy access of electrolyte. Meanwhile, the formation of metallic 1T-2H hybridized MoS2and the synergistic effect between the MoS2layers and nickel sulfides (NS) nanoparticles promotes the ions diffusion on the surface of the electrode, and the void space formed between NMS sheets can endure volume change in redox process for more stable structures. Therefore, the assembled NMS/CNT//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor manifests favorable specific capacitance of 108 F g−1at 0.5 A g−1, along with a high energy density of 40 Wh kg−1and good cycling stability of almost 100% capacity maintained after 10,000 cycles, implying it's the promising candidate for energy storage.
