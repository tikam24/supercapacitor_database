NiCo2S4 is a promising electrode material for supercapacitors due to its high conductivity and rich elemental valence distribution. However, the low specific capacitance and poor cycling stability of NiCo2S4 electrode material restricted its practical application. In this paper, we proposed a dual regulation strategy of nitrogen-doped carbon cloth current collector (NCC) and the introduction of S vacancies in the NiCo2S4 (NCS) to prepare a high electrochemical performance of integrated electrode material. The introduction of N doping into the CC current collector helped to improve the loading capacity of NCS and contributed to capacitance, while the rich S vacancies in NCS could provide more electroactive sites and increase its electrical conductivity. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of NCC and S vacancies, the fabricated NCS4–0.5/NCC integrated electrode material illustrated an ultra-high specific capacitance of 4075.89 mF cm−2 (2079.53 F g−1) at 1 mA cm−2 and superior electrochemical cycling stability with 80.03% of initial capacitance at a high current density of 20 mA cm−2 after 5000 cycles. Therefore, the present dual regulation strategy provides a new route to fabricate supercapacitor electrode materials with excellent electrochemical properties.
