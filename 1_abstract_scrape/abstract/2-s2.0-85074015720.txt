The current approaches used to fabricate hexagonal boron nitrides (h-BN) from boron trioxide and urea always results in contamination of the h-BN product with carbon/oxygen. Thus, discovering a facile way of mass producing high-purity h-BN remains a challenge. A simple yet highly efficient thermal treatment approach to large-scale fabrication of nanoporous h-BN with high yield, high purity, and high crystallinity is described using NaNH2 and NaBH4 as the oxygen- and carbon-free precursors. The unique properties of inorganic metal salts, i.e., high melting point and strong electrostatic interaction with carbon substrates, render this strategy suitable for the production of homogeneous h-BN/mesoporous carbon and h-BN/carbon nanotube heterostructures of high crystallinity, high h-BN dispersity, and with a strong interfacial effect. These unique features make them promising candidates for supercapacitor applications, resulting a significantly enhanced specific capacitance. This study provides new insight into the fabrication of high-purity h-BN and h-BN-based heterostructures thus expanding their application in the field of energy storage and transformation.
