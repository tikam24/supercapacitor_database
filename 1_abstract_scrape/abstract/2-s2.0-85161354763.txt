For the past two decades starting from 2004, 2D dimensional materials-based research has begun around single-layer graphene materials. As a result of a long-term effort, this interest was turned in another direction with the discovery of MXene materials in 2011. Later, this attracted tremendous attention as an excellent electrode material for the fabrication of energy storage devices due to its uncommon features of hydrophilicity and conductivity. Since it owned both pseudo-capacitive and electric double-layer behaviors, it is in high demand for the production of supercapacitors. Their inherent characteristics also lead to the promotion of electrochemical performance in batteries such as metal-ion, metal sulfur, etc. These types of apparatus were invented as a result of MXene's unique features of surface reactivity, higher density, kinetically sensitive structures, etc. Due to these advanced properties, this material is widely used in electric vehicles, sensors, catalysis, electronic devices, etc. Herein, some basic aspects of variations in MXenes, their synthesis methods, their contribution to energy storage, and their applications are discussed throughout this review article. The main focus of this review is on the energy storage mechanism of different types of MXene-based devices. It is further intended to illustrate that the flexible MXene-derived devices are also beneficial in various applications like wearable, sensing, etc.
