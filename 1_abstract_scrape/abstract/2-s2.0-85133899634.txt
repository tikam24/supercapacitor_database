Optimization of pore parameters for specific applications is crucial for utilization of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC). In this work, we report a facile method to obtain HPCs for targeting applications in a controlled manner by a one-step site-specific activation method with trace amounts of KOH. For CO2 adsorption applications, the material is optimized to have a pore size consistent with the kinetic diameter of CO2, which facilitates the diffusion of CO2 in the material. The optimized material shows exceptional CO2 adsorption capacity (5.21 mmol g−1 at 0 °C and 3.54 mmol g−1 at 25 °C), and excellent adsorption reversibility (97.6% at 0 °C and 98.9% at 25 °C). For supercapacitor applications, the pore size of the optimized HPC is multiple of the size of hydrated potassium ions, which enhances the transport of electrolyte ions. The optimized material provides a high specific capacitance of 369 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, and the assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an extraordinary energy density of 30.51 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 92.23 W kg−1. This work provides new insight into tuning of the pore parameters for specific applications of HPCs, and a facile strategy for value-added utilization of biomass materials.
