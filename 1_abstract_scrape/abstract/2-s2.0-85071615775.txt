In this paper, we study a supercapacitor model represented by an equivalent RC circuit considering five different types of derivatives: Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Atangana-Baleanu fractional derivatives and the conformable and integer-order derivatives. A set of experimental data from six commercial supercapacitors are used to estimate the parameter values for each derivative model by applying interior point optimization. The results show that the most accurate approach is achieved with the conformable derivative followed by the Caputo fractional derivative.
