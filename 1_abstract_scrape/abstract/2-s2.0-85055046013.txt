In this paper, flake-like S doped NiTe was synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method. The phase and morphology of the materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The results show that the doping ratio of S to Te had a great influence on the electrochemical properties of NiTe:S as the electrode material of supercapacitor. When the molar ratio of S:Te was 3:50, the specific capacitance of the electrode material at a current density of 5 A/g reached 887.3 F/g, which was increased by 214% compared to undoped one. Furthermore, the as-prepared NiTe:S electrode (as positive electrode) was assembled with an AC electrode (as negative electrode) to form an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The ASC exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance and the energy density and power density could reach 32.8 Wh/kg and 800.5 W/kg, respectively.
