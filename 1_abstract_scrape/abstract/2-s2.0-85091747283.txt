A comparison was made between the structure and electrochemical properties of CuFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared by five different preparation methods, involving the co-precipitation, green sol–gel, green hydrothermal, auto-combustion, and microwave. The obtained ferrites were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, BET, SEM, and TEM techniques. A spinel crystal structure was observed for all samples with morphological structures, surface textural properties, and particle sizes hanging on the synthesis process and set in the range of 12–45 nm. The sample prepared in the presence of gelatin shows well-dispersed nanosphere particles. The electrochemical properties of obtained ferrites were studied using cyclic voltammetry, charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The as-synthesized CuFe2O4 (Cugg) sample acts as excellent electrode material in supercapacitor with a high specific capacitance of 145F g−1, an energy density of 18.9 Wh kg−1, and a power density of 486 Wkg−1 at 1 Ag−1 and good retention value of 90.2% after 1000 cycles at 1Ag−1.
