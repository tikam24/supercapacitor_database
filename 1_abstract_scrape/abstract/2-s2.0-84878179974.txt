The study on polymer gel electrolyte comprising of poly vinylidene fluoride co-hexafluropropylene (PVdF-HFP)- polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)-sodium iodide (NaI) with a view to use them as electrolyte material for redox supercapacitor with electrochemically deposited polypyrrole as electrode material has been carried out. The fabricated gel electrolyte shows high ionic conductivity of the order of 1.7 Ã— 10-2 S cm-1 at room temperature with excellent mechanical/dimensional stability. The redox supercapacitor has been characterized using ac impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge discharge tests. The overall capacitance values are found to be 128 mF cm-2; which is equivalent to single electrode specific capacitance of 514 F g -1. It corresponds to energy density of 43.0 W h kg -1 and power density of 4.0 kW kg -1.
