Tailored construction of advanced flexible supercapacitors (SCs) is of great importance to the development of high-performance wearable modern electronics. Herein, a facile combined wet chemical method to fabricate novel mesoporous vanadium nitride (VN) composite arrays coupled with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as flexible electrodes for all-solid-state SCs is reported. The mesoporous VN nanosheets arrays prepared by the hydrothermal–nitridation method are composed of cross-linked nanoparticles of 10–50 nm. To enhance electrochemical stability, the VN is further coupled with electrodeposited PEDOT shell to form high-quality VN/PEDOT flexible arrays. Benefiting from high intrinsic reactivity and enhanced structural stability, the designed VN/PEDOT flexible arrays exhibit a high specific capacitance of 226.2 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and an excellent cycle stability with 91.5% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1. In addition, high energy/power density (48.36 Wh kg−1 at 2 A g−1 and 4 kW kg−1 at 5 A g−1) and notable cycling life (91.6% retention over 10 000 cycles) are also achieved in the assembled asymmetric flexible supercapacitor cell with commercial nickel–cobalt–aluminum ternary oxides cathode and VN/PEDOT anode. This research opens up a way for construction of advanced hybrid organic–inorganic electrodes for flexible energy storage.
