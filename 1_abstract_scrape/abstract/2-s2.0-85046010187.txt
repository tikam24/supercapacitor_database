The purpose of this work is to build the dielectric of a supercapacitor based on carbon nanotubes. To achieve this, the synthesis of boron-doped nanostructures in an electric arc reactor, its characterization, the preparation of inks to be impregnated in a material that will be the dielectric, the construction of the dielectric and the assembly of a supercapacitor for capacitance tests are carried out. From the results obtained by Raman spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy it is shown that carbon nanotubes were formed from the electric arc synthesis. Previous results of the capacitances obtained with supercapacitors based on carbon nanotubes are also shown.
