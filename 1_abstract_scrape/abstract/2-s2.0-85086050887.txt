The high rate capable, high energy (higher than the lead acid batteries & Nickel-cadmium batteries and comparable with Li-ion batteries) and long lasting supercapacitive performance was achieved from a ternary nanocomposite of rGO/Al(OH)3/PANI (5.88%:11.77%:82.85%) (GAlP82). The GAlP82 exhibited high cyclic stability till 47,500 cycles at 400 mV s−1, with increasing trend of specific capacitance (Cs) with increase in No. of energy storage/delivery cycles. After 41,500 cycles the GAlP82 exhibited a Cs of 490.19 F g−1, an energy density (E) of 98.03 W h kg−1 and a power density (P) of 2.2829 kW kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The GAlP82 exhibited a good rate capability by retaining 73% of Cs up to 10 A g−1 before cyclic stability study and 33% of Cs up to 23 A g−1 after 41,500 cycles; and all these impressive performances are achieved from the symmetric supercapacitor cell of GAlP82.
