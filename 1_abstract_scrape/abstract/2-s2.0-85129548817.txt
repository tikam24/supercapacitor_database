The article presents a functional model created for the study of supercapacitors. They can be used to replace a battery or in parallel with it, as it is the case with hybrid vehicles. This study focuses on the behavior of supercapacitors at charge and discharge process. The proposed mathematical model, the experimental model and the virtual model necessary for the study of the electrical parameters of the supercapacitors are presented in this paper. The developed experimental system allows measurements of two types of supercapacitors (EDLC, 2.5 F, 5 V, SCMS22C255PRBA0, AVX and EDLC, 5 F, 5.4 N, PHV- 5R4V505-R, EATON). In order to validate the results obtained, the simulated results obtained on the basis of the proposed equivalent circuit were compared with the results obtained by the experimental model.
