It is well known that the elements doping and morphology adjusting strategy are an effective ways to enhance the performance of supercapacitor electrode materials. In this work, using a Co-MOF as a precursor, a series of hollow-porous leaf-like V-doped nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (Ni-Co/V) nanosheets are successfully fabricated through a step-to-step etching process. The optimized Ni-Co/V-12-2 hollow leaf-like structure presents a typical hierarchical structure constructed by ultra-thin nanosheets and a hybrid pore of micro-/meso-porous with a BET surface area of 126.3 m2 g−1, which will provide the more active site and rich diffusion channels for enhanced energy storage performance. Therefore, the Ni-Co/V-12-2 electrode exhibits a high capacity of 161.4 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability of maintaining 93.14% after 5600 cycles. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor with the Ni-Co/V-12-2 as the positive electrode and reduced graphene oxide (PPD/rGO) as the negative electrode, performs a high energy density of 55.22 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 0.375 kW kg−1.
