This study proposes model predictive control (MPC) for onboard ultracapacitors for light rail vehicles using a maximum current constraint. In this study, a Kalman filter is used to estimate the system states. Compared to the PID controller, the MPC-based charging control strategy can solve the maximum current limit problem because it converts the charging problem to an optimization one. Simulation and experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
