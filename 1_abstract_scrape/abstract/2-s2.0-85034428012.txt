Porous tremella-like NiO on conductive substrates have been fabricated by a facile chemical bath deposition approach and further investigated as the binder-free electrode for high-performance supercapacitors. The microstructure and morphologies of the resulting materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, and electrochemical measurements. Owing to the superior electrical conductivity, the porous structure of the NiO microspheres combinated the advantages of each subunit can deliver a high areal capacitance of 3.5 F·cm-2 and a corresponding specific capacitance of 705 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A·g-1, as well as a good rate capability (68.1% capacitance retention from 0.5 A·g-1 to 8 A·g-1), and excellent cycling stability (17.6% capacitance increasing after 3000th cycling at high current density 12 A·g-1).
