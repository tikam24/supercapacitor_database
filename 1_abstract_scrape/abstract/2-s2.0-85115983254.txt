This work presents for the first time a new diglyme-based gel polymer (DOBn-GPE) suitable for Na-based energy storage devices. The DOBn-GPE, which contains a methacrylate-based polymer, exhibited an excellent high ionic conductivity (2.3 mS cm−1 at 20 °C), broad electrochemical stability (>5.0 V), and high mechanical stability. DOBn-GPE could be successfully used for the realization of Na-ion capacitors, sodium-metal batteries, and sodium-ion batteries, displaying performance comparable with those of systems containing liquid electrolytes at room temperature and at 60 °C. The results of these investigation indicated that the development of diglyme-based gel polymer electrolytes represents a promising strategy for the realization of advanced Na-based energy storage devices.
