Owing to the rapidly growing global energy consumption, the development of high-performance power sources has become an urgent and increasing demand in various fi elds such as portable electronics and sensor networks. [ 1-3 ] As a result of their excellent characteristics, such as superior power density, fast charge/discharge rates, and long cycle lifetime, supercapacitors (SCs, also known as electrochemical capacitors or ultracapacitors), which bridge the gap between high specifi c energy batteries and high specifi c power conventional capacitors, have been employed as state-of-the-art energy storage systems and widely used in consumer electronics, backup power sources, and pacemakers. [ 4-7 ] Since the energy density is proportional to the capacitance (specifi c or areal capacitance), C , and square of the cell voltage, ? U , which can be calculated as E = 0.5C(ΔU)2 (1) an enhancement of energy density can be achieved by maximizing the capacitance and/or the operating voltage of SCs. [ 8 ] Compared with carbon-based materials, pseudo-capacitive materials such as transition metal oxides and conducting polymers [ 9-13 ] show much higher capacitive performance. Although the use of an organic electrolyte is one possible approach to increasing the operating voltage up to 4 V, [ 14-16 ] poor ionic conductivity will result in high equivalent series resistance (ESR) and low power output. Alternatively, asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) provide an environmentally friendly and effective approach to improving the energy density of SCs, as the operating voltage can be broadened by combining two appropriate electrodes with different potential windows.
