Aiming at the randomness and intermittence of renewable energy in microgrid and the problems caused by the limited capacity of energy storage devices, a secondary power assignment and interactive control strategy for hybrid energy storage is proposed. The strategy determines the operating mode of the system according to the SOC (state of charge) of the supercapacitor, and the coordinated control method of slack terminal in each working mode is analyzed in detail. In the critical limit charging and discharging mode, the concept of interactive correction current is introduced, the action interval of the interactive correction current is determined according to the magnitude of voltage change rate, so that the state of charge of the supercapacitor changes to a stable direction. In the limit charging and discharging mode, secondary power assignment and interactive control strategy that take into account the charge and discharge amount and SOC recovery change the filter time constant is proposed. Finally, the proposed control strategy is applied to the simulation of a DC micro-grid. The results show that the control strategy can enhance the reliability of the energy storage device, realize the self-recovery of the state of the charge, and reduce the capacity configuration of the supercapacitor.
