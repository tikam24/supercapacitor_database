A novel device architecture of a coaxial supercapacitor cable that functions both as an electrical cable and an energy-storage device is demonstrated. The inner core is used for electrical conduction and the overlying layers are used for energy storage. This unique design provides excellent flexibility, long and stable cycle lifetimes, and high energy and power densities. All these remarkable results demonstrate a clear technological advance achieved by clubbing electrical conduction and energy storage into a single cable. Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
