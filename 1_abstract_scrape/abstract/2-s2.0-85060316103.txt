Porous nickel foam possesses the advantages of light weight, large specific surface area, good permeability and so forth, which is widely applied in the field of new energy materials including lithium battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell etc. The nickel foam supported cobalt (Co/Ni-foam) catalyst was synthesized by electrodeposition for alcoholysis of sodium borohydride, and hydrogen generation rate was tested by drainage method. The results of XRD show that the active component cobalt of the Co/Ni-foam catalyst was α phase. The SEM images showed the Co/Ni-foam catalyst had a smooth and neat surface, as well as a three-dimensional structure, which was beneficial to the gas-liquid flow during the catalytic reaction. The effects of electrodeposition time, bath temperature, current density and bath concentration on the hydrogen production performance of the catalyst were also investigated, and the preparation conditions were optimized. The hydrogenation rate of the sodium borohydride was about 17 685.81 mL•min -1 •g -1 (Co), with the electrodeposition time of 1.5 h, the bath temperature of 40℃, the current density of 5 mA/cm 2 , and the bath concentration of 50 g/L. This method present broad application prospects in the portable hydrogen production technology.
