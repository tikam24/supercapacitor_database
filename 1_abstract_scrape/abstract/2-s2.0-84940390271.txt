Porous Mn3O4 hexagonal nanoplates were synthesized through annealing the hydrohausmannite precursor obtained by a one-pot hydrothermal process and by precisely controlling the concentrations of potassium hydroxide and glucose. The effect of potassium hydroxide and glucose on the growth of hexagonal nanoplates was investigated, and a growth mechanism was also proposed. Due to its abundant pores, the pure Mn3O4-based electrode exhibits excellent cycling stability with 100% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high performance with an energy density of 17.276 W h kg-1 at a power density of 207.3 W kg-1 in a wide potential window of 1.5 V.
