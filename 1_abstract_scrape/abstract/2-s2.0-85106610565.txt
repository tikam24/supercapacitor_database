Over the past few decades, the application of new novel materials in energy storage system has seen excellent development. We report a novel MnCo2O4/NiO nanostructure prepared by a simplistic chemical bath deposition method and employed it as a binder free electrode in the supercapacitor. The synergistic attraction from a high density of active sites, better transportation of ion diffusion and super-most electrical transportation, which deliver boost electrochemical activities. X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been used to investigate the crystallinity, morphology, and elemental composition of the as-synthesized precursors, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electron impedance spectroscopy have been employed to investigate the electrochemical properties. The unique nanoparticle structures delivered additional well-organized pathways for the swift mobility of electrons and ions. The as-prepared binder-free MnCo2O4/NiO nanocomposite electrode has a high specific capacity of 453.3 C g−1 at 1 Ag−1, and an excellent cycling reliability of 91.89 percent even after 4000 cycles, which are significantly higher than bare MnCo2O4 and NiO electrodes. Finally, these results disclose that the as-fabricated MnCo2O4/NiO electrode could be a favored-like electrode material holds substantial potential and supreme option for efficient supercapacitor and their energy storage-related applications.
