To meet the demands of modern vehicles and electronic devices, an increasing number of new materials for the cathode of high-performance supercapacitors have been studied in depth. Here, GO/NA-Cl composites were successfully fabricated by in-situ grow NiAl layered double hydroxide (NiAl LDH) nanosheets on graphene oxide (GO) flakes through one-step hydrothermal procedure for the cathode of supercapacitor. The image of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) exhibited that the NiAl-Cl LDH nanosheets were evenly and vertically arranged on the GO flakes and interlaced to form a network structure, presenting a considerable surface area, which afford abundant active sites in contact with the electrolyte and alleviate the expansion of GO/NA-Cl during the process of electrochemical reaction to improve its stability. The results of electrochemical test show that the GO/NA-Cl is a typical pseudocapacitive material, which provides a prominent specific capacity of 1573 F/g at 1 A/g, and superior rate property (the rate of capacity retention is 62% even at 20 A/g). Furthermore, the GO/NA-Cl electrode shows a superior cycling life after 1000 cycles at 1 A/g with about 80% capacitance retention.
