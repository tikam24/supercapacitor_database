The structural and electronic properties of the Ni/NiO were investigated using a combined theoretical and experimental approach. The Ni/NiO was obtained by a cheap synthesis route and synthesized in order to offer a proposal for an energy storage device. The structural and electronic properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction performed by Rietveld refinement and materials modeling. Their electrochemical properties confed by Cyclic Voltammetry, Galvanostatic Charge, and Discharge tests and Electrochemical Impedance. The study shows that among the prepared electrodes, CAS-NiO presented the highest values for the specific capacitance properties Csc (96.1 m A h g−1), C (27.5 m A h g−1), and E (85.3 W Kg−1). On the other hand, CLS-Ni/NiO presented low values for for the properties. The study confirms that the difference in the structural configuration of the electrodes influences their electrochemical efficiency and presents promising materials for the desired application.
