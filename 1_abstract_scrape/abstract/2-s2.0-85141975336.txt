Separators in supercapacitors (SCs) typically suffer from defects of low mechanical property, limited ion transport, and electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal stability, impeding the development of SCs. Herein, high-performance regenerated cellulose (RC) based separators are designed that are fabricated by effective hydrolytic etching of inorganic CaCO3 nanoparticles from a filled RC membrane. The as-prepared RC separator displays excellent comprehensive performances such as higher tensile strength (75.83 MPa) and thermal stability (200 °C), which is superior to commercial polypropylene-based separator (Celgard 2500) and sufficient to maintain their structural integrity even at temperatures in excess of 200 °C. Benefiting from its hydrophilicity, high porosity, and outstanding electrolyte uptake rate (208.5%), the RC separator exhibits rapid transport and permeability of ions, which is 2.5× higher than that of the commercial nonwoven polypropylene separator (NKK -MPF30AC-100) validated by electrochemical tests in the 1.0 m Na2SO4 electrolyte. Results show that porous RC separator with unique advantages of superior electrolyte wettability, mechanical robustness, and high thermal stability, is a promising separator for SCs with high-performance and safety.
