Designing two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures based on suitable energy materials is a promising strategy to achieve high-performance supercapacitors with hybridized transition metal and carbonaceous-based electrodes. The influence of each component and its content on the capacitor performance necessitates deeper insights. In this study, a 2D/2D heterostructure made of hierarchical pseudocapacitive cobalt phosphide/oxide and P-doped reduced graphene oxide (PrGO) nanosheets (CoP/CoO@PrGO) was fabricated using porous zeolitic-imidazolate framework precursor. The decoration of 2D leaf-like CoP/CoO hybrid onto PrGO could create a unique interface with a large number of active sites, CoO-driven creation of pseudocapacitive surface POx species, and high P content (∼3 at.%) in PrGO, thus promoting the Faradaic reaction, electrical conductivity, and overall charge storage. This framework yields a high specific capacitance of 405 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (over 100 % after 10,000 cycles), superior to those of pristine CoP@PrGO (300 F g−1 at 5 A g−1). Furthermore, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor delivers reasonable energy density of 4.2 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 785 W kg−1 and cycling stability of ∼100 % after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, CoP/CoO@PrGO with its unique interfacial properties can promote the development of heterostructure electrode for high-performance supercapacitors.
