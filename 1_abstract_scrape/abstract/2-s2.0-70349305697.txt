Tin dioxide-multiwalled carbon nanotubes composite (SnO2/MWCNTs) has been synthesized by using low-heating solid-state reaction with dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as surfactant. The structure and morphology of the obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that SnO 2 nanodots could symmetrically grow on the surface of the MWCNTs. Electrochemical performance of these electrodes has been investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge. Compared with bare SnO 2 nanodots and purity MWCNTs, SnO2 nanodots uniformly dispersed on MWCNTs lead to a significantly improved capacitive performance in 1.0 mol L-1 Na2SO4. Galvanostatic charge- discharge studies show that SnO2 has a maximum specific capacitance of 217.3 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 with 11wt% loading.
