A new configuration combining Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC), battery and ultracapacitor is presented in this paper for active and reactive power support together. This type of system is denoted as hybrid E-STATCOM (Energy storage + STATCOM). Two different types of energy storage systems are considered here to support both high energy density and high power density loads. Battery and ultracapacitors are distributed at the dc-bus of MMC. The topology offers higher redundancy, modularity and lower losses compared to the conventional configurations, where energy storage units are lumped at the dc-link. The integration of two different energy storage systems with MMC and the associated control issues are discussed in this paper. The performance of the proposed configuration is verified for a Wind Energy Generation System (WEGS), where the E-STATCOM is employed to reduce fluctuation in the wind power and to provide reactive power for voltage regulation at PCC. A simulation model of the whole system is developed in PSCAD for performance evaluation and the results show satisfactory performance.
