In this work, the best operating parameters of NiO electrodeposition process have been identified using artificial intelligence and metaheuristics. The objective is maximizing of specific capacity of G-NiO electrodes for usage in electrochemical energy storage devices. The proposed strategy integrates ANFIS modelling and marine predators optimization (MPA). The study focuses on three operation parameters: deposition potential and time of the G-NiO and the concentration of the electrolyte, to maximize the specific capacity of G-NiO. Based on measured data, ANFIS model is created to simulate the electrodeposition process. Next, using MPA, the best values of deposition potential and time of the G-NiO and the concentration of the electrolyte are estimated. To confirm the advantage of the adopted strategy, the response surface methodology was utilized to check the findings. The integration between ANFIS and MPA succeeded in improving the specific capacity of G-NiO electrode by 12.7% compared to the response surface methodology.
