The paper examines the use of energy storage system to smoothen the output power from wind farms, and to make dispatch planning from the wind power generators possible. Firstly wind power is segregated into components through the use of filters designed from the application of empirical mode decomposition technique. Buffering of the high- and mid-frequency components of the wind power is then effected through the use of battery-supercapacitor banks, while the low-frequency components of the wind power are used in conjunction with a pumped-hydroelectric storage system to realize short-term dispatch planning. The proposed method is illustrated using data obtained from an existing wind farm.
