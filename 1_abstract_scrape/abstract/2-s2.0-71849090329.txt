Carbon nanotube (CNT)-zinc oxide (ZnO) nanocomposite and gel poly(vinyl alcohol)-phosphomolybdic acid were employed as the electrode and electrolyte of the experimental supercapacitor cell, respectively. The ZnO nanodots were deposited onto CNT films by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis in different times. The results of electrochemical measurements showed that the electrode with ZnO deposited in 5 min had the optimal capacitive properties among the experimental series, with a lowest interfacial electron transfer resistance, a very high capacitance of 323.9 F/g and good reversibility in the repetitive charge/discharge cycling test.
