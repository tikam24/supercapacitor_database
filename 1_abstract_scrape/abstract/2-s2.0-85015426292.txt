A new mesoporous NiO-CeO2Sm doped nanocomposite electrode on copper foam has been prepared by pulse electrodeposition technique. The as-prepared NiO and NiO-CeO2Sm doped nanocomposite electrodes were characterized by SEM, TEM, EDAX, XRD and BET. Electrochemical performance of the as prepared materials was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy. The specific capacitance of NiO-CeO2Sm doped nanocomposite electrode (1314 F g−1) is high compared to NiO (914 F g−1). The NiO-CeO2Sm doped nanocomposite electrodes offer good capacitance retention of 91% at 2 A g−1 after 3000 continuous charge-discharge cycles. The solution resistance and charge-transfer resistance of NiO-CeO2Sm doped nanocomposite electrode is 0.1897 Ω and 0.6382 Ω. This electrode could be a promising attractive material for electrochemical energy storage.
