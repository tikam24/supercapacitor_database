Electrochemical capacitors, so-called double-layer capacitors, supercapacitors, or ultracapacitors, are electrical power sources that utilize the capacitive properties at the interface between an electronic conductor (electrode) and a liquid ionic conductor (electrolyte solution). This chapter covers all aspects of electrochemical double-layer capacitor technology that are pertinent to energy storage for renewable sources and grid balancing.
