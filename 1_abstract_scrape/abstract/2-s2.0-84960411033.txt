In this study, polyaniline/titanium oxide (PANi-TiO2) nanoweb composite was fabricated through electrochemical deposition and electrospinning techniques, and the composite was further utilized as an electrode for a supercapacitor. The PANi-TiO2 composite film showed three-dimensional hierarchical micro/nano architecture. The film was deposited on the current collector without the use of any binders. The morphology of the PANi-TiO2 composite film was confirmed by the use of field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis that polyaniline was grown in the form of nanorods with a diameter of 100 nm-200 nm on a TiO2 nanoweb. The chemical composition and quantitative analysis were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The electrochemical properties were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The result of electrochemical tests indicated that TiO2-PANi electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 306.5 Fg-1 at the scan rate of 20 mVs-1, with the capacitance retention ratio being 103% after 500 cycles at the scan rate of 50 mVs-1.
