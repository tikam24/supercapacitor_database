Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/graphene oxide (PEDOT/GO) composites with wrinkled paper-like sheets morphology were electropolymerized potentiostatically at 1.2 V with different electrodeposition times (1-30 min) and various concentrations of GO (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/mL). The electrochemical properties of PEDOT/GO composites as an electrode material for supercapacitor were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD). The CV results revealed that PEDOT/GO containing 1.0 mg/mL GO and electropolymerized for 10 minutes exhibited the highest specific capacitance (157.17 F/g). This optimum PEDOT/GO was found to have energy and power density of 18.24 W/kg and 496.64 Wh/kg, respectively, at 1.0 A/g current density. The resistance of charge transfer obtained for PEDOT/GO is very low (13.10) compared to PEDOT (638.98), proving that PEDOT/GO has a good supercapacitive performance due to the synergistic effect of the high conductivity of PEDOT and large surface area of GO.
