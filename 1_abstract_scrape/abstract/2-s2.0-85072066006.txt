Electropolymerization and characterization of poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) /3-methylthiophene and 3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene/2 aminophenol were studied. They were fabricated by a simple oxidative electropolymerization method. The nanocomposite coatings have been prepared by using electrochemical methods from aqueous solutions, such that the components were deposited simultaneously onto platinum electrode substrate. The morphology of composite films was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical and physical properties of the resulting composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 0.1M LiClO4 aqueous solutions. The synthetic, morphological and electrical properties of the obtained nanocomposite films were compared. The value of specific electrochemical capacitance of the composite films is considerably higher than for pure polymer films, and PEDOT/3-methylthiophene composite films have high specific capacitance than PEDOT/2 aminophenol. The improved properties of the electrodes were obtained by using these composite films. All of the composite films constituted a very promising electrode material for application in a supercapacitor.
