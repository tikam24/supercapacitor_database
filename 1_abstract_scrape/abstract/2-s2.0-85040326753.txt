In present study, new strategy is employed to build composite nanostructure and asymmetric configuration to enhance the capacitive performance of supercapacitor device. The WO3-MnO2 composite with mesoporous structure is prepared by single-step hydrothermal method and used to gain superior electrochemical performance in asymmetric configuration. A binder-free and additive-less WO3-MnO2 composite electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 609 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The flexible asymmetric supercapacitor device with WO3-MnO2 as a positive electrode and WO3 as a negative electrode demonstrates stable operating potential window of 1.4 V with specific capacitance of 103 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and energy density of 24.13 Wh kg−1 at power density of 915 W kg−1. Furthermore, WO3-MnO2//WO3 device exhibits good cycle life with capacity retention of 95% after 2500 cycles and excellent mechanical flexibility. These results reveal the potential of WO3-MnO2 composite electrode for fabrication of high-performance supercapacitors.
