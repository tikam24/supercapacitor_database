Supercapacitors are energy storage devices designed to operate at higher power densities than conventional batteries, but their energy density is still too low for many applications. Efforts are made to design new electrolytes with wider electrochemical windows than aqueous or conventional organic electrolytes in order to increase energy density. Ionic liquids (ILs) with wide electrochemical stability windows are excellent candidates to be employed as supercapacitor electrolytes. ILs containing tetracyanoborate anions [B(CN)4] offer wider electrochemical stability than conventional electrolytes and maintain a high ionic conductivity (6.9 mS cm−1). Herein, we report the use of ILs containing the [B(CN)4] anion for such an application. They presented a high maximum operating voltage of 3.7 V, and two-electrode devices demonstrate high specific capacitances even when operating at relatively high rates (ca. 20 F g−1 @ 15 A g−1). This supercapacitor stored more energy and operated at a higher power at all rates studied when compared with cells using a commonly studied ILs.
