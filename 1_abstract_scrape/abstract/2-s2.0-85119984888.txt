Supercapacitors have the advantages of fast charging and discharging speed and high power density, and they have broad application prospects in the power system of new energy vehicles. However, the aging process of vehicle supercapacitors is closely related to service conditions and driving conditions, the actual life may be inconsistent with the nominal life measured in the laboratory under the influence of complex coupling factors. This paper proposed a method to estimate the life of supercapacitor modules based on the monitoring data of buses under service conditions. First, because of the low sampling frequency and accuracy of monitoring data, the limited memory least square method was used to perform parameter identification on the service conditions data to obtain the capacitance value and internal resistance as life characteristics parameters. It was found that it has had the characteristics of time series and seasonality. Secondly, based on the change of capacitance and internal resistance, a life prediction method based on Prophet algorithm was proposed. Finally, the results were are verified by the Rolling Origin Evaluation, which showed shows the error was is in line with expectations. Prophet can introduce background knowledge to adjust the forecast results and has advantages in forecasting seasonal and periodic time series data.
