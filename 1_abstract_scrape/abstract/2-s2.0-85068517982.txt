Regenerative braking technology can effectively recover vehicle braking energy, and it is an effective method to increase the mileage of electric vehicles. A super capacitor has the characteristics of high power density and high efficiency; therefore, using a battery and super capacitor to form a composite power supply as an energy storage device of the electric vehicle can improve the working state, service life, and reliability of the battery and the efficiency of energy recovery. Currently, electric vehicles often use compound power supply (battery-super capacitor) in parallel for regenerative braking. In this study, the regenerative braking system was designed based on the passive series compound power supply structure (battery-super capacitor), comprising primarily the motor, super capacitor group, rectifier, and controller. Compared with the active compound power supply, the proposed system does not need the DC/DC converter and has a simple structure and control. Pulse width modulation (PWM) control, according to the electric vehicle speed and super capacitor terminal voltage, was used to adjust the duty cycle of PWM to realize constant current in the braking process. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy was verified by modeling the system on the MATLAB/Simulink platform. An electric vehicle was used to test the system, and the results show that the system can recover braking energy at a high rate and can be used to realize constant current braking.
