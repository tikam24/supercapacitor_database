Low-cost, abundant, simple, and facile approaches to exhibit bio-waste-based porous carbon are needed to enhance the high performance of electrode materials as energy storage devices. Here, the bio-waste-based activated carbon with a low-cost and easy-toprepare approach was studied via chemical impregnation of ZnCl2at single-stage integrated high-temperature pyrolysis. Furthermore, the activated carbon is prepared in the form of a monolith by optimizing the self-adhesive properties of the precursor. The application of different chemical concentrations can significantly improve the material properties with relatively good amorphous carbon structures. Furthermore, the maximum surface area was found to be 1129 m2g-1. Moreover, it exhibits high electrochemical behavior with a specific capacitance of 145 Fg-1 at a constant current density of 1.0 Ag-1. In addition, the highest energy density was found at 16.25 Whkg-1 with a maximum power density of 82.70 Wkg-1in 1 M H2SO4aqueous electrolyte. These results confirm a low-cost and simple strategy for the synthesis of bio-waste-based activated carbon as an electrode material to enhance the capacitive properties of supercapacitors.
