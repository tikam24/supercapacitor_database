This paper describes a methodology to control a multi-source battery-capacitor hybrid EV incorporating a dynamic power splitting strategy. Considering the requirement for precise speed control characteristics of the EV and the non-linear behavior of traction motor with system disturbances, a non-linear state feedback controller (NLSFC) with a disturbance observer is suggested as the speed control technique for the EV traction motor. To interface a parallel configured multi-source system, a non-inverted buck-boost H-bridge is proposed as the source side converter for effective recovery of the braking energy. Detailed control design for traction motor and converter is also presented for efficient control of EV. Besides, an adaptive energy management strategy considering power profile and dynamic source characteristics is incorporated into the overall control system. The simulation results from various case studies indicate that the proposed system can follow the required vehicle speed and torque despite the sudden change in EV load torque. Furthermore, the comparative analysis between NLSFC and PI controller shows improvement with steady-state error reduction from 0.43 to 0.0014 and peak overshoot drop from 12.07% to 3.51% during acceleration of the system when proposed NLSFC is adopted. The proposed solutions will be implemented in a prototype EV system in the future.
