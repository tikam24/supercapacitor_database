The magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized via the hydrothermal process in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactants. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. The electrochemical study of these products as advanced electrodes for supercapacitors was done using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. The specific capacity values deduced from the cyclic voltammetry experiments were found to increase in the following order: Fe3O4/without surfactant (34 F g−1) < Fe3O4/CTAB (44 F g−1 < Fe3O4/SDS (63 F g−1). The latter exhibited a specific discharge capacitance of 60 F g−1 that remained stable after 500 charge/discharge cycles. The improved electrochemical performance of Fe3O4/SDS may be due to the particle size and shape effects. As a result of the enhanced electrochemical performance, Fe3O4/SDS hybrids could be regarded as a promising electrode for Li/Na-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
