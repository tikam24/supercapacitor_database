Vertically aligned graphene/graphitic petal (VGN) arrays hold great promise for energy storage applications due to their unique morphology, high surface area, and availability of a large number of electrochemically active sites. Herein, we report the facile synthesis approach to grow 2D MoSSe sheets on plasma-treated VGN to achieve high-performance electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The defect-rich VGN arrays favored the uniform growth of MoSSe and provided more active sites. Further, we fabricated a solid-state supercapacitor device based on the VGN, MoSSe, and MoSSe@VGN arrays. Among the three, MoSSe@VGN showed an exceptional specific capacitance of 252 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.3 mA cm−2 with a high energy density of 11.2 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 130 mW cm−2 and good cycling stability of 80% after 4000 charge-discharge cycles.
