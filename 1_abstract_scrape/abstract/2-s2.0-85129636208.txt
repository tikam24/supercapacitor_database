Bio-waste, coco peat is utilized to produce high performance, hard carbon supercapacitor electrodes. Combined pyrolysis and activation methods are adopted to produce coco peat derived porous hard carbon. Structural analysis confirms the formation of hard carbon. Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurements and microscopy images reveals the presence of micro and mesoporous structure with the pore size and pore volume of 10 nm and of 0.4226 cm3 g-1. The synthesized material produces excellent capacitance and stability and exhibits the specific capacitance of 422 F g-1 and 332 F g-1 at the scan rate of 1 mV s-1 and current density of 1 A g-1. The capacity retention after 5000 cycles is 96.02%. The porous structure increases the electrolyte penetration and the large surface area facilitates electron transfer and charge diffusion kinetics.
