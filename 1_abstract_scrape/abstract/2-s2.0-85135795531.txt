A review of the current developments in the synthesis of graphene fragments of porous carbon material by utilizing green precursors in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and their applications in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells is presented in this study. Two different approaches, including top-down and bottom-up, are discussed. The experimental approaches include hydrothermal or solvothermal method, microwave-assisted method, electrochemical oxidation, controllable synthesis, oxidative cleavage, and carbonization from small molecules or polymers. The advantages and disadvantages of the green synthesis of GQDs are discussed. Current challenges and prospective applications of GQDs in energy-related areas are presented. A brief outlook is provided for addressing the problems for further advancement of GQDs. It is anticipated that the results discussed in this study will lead to a better understanding of GQDs as well as their significant roles in developing innovative strategies and applications.
