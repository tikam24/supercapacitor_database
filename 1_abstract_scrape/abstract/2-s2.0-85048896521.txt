This paper presents a method to generate the references trajectories of the flat outputs for the controlled hybrid power source with the one- loop control flatness-based control approach. This hybrid system uses a fuel cell (FC) and a bank of supercapacitor (SC) as main and additional sources, respectively. The two-phase bidirectional interleaved boost DC-DC converters are used to transfer energies between the sources and load. This control method allows operating with high bandwidth control loop. The simulation results are provided to highlight the effectiveness of the control technique.
