Polyaniline and its composites at different wt. % of Cobalt oxide nano (PDC1, PDC2 and PDC5) were prepared by in-situ chemical reaction method The optical property was carried out using UV-Vis. Absorption Spectroscopy. The electrochemical property like cyclic voltammetry and galvonostatic charging-discharging was carried out for PANI and PDC nanocomposite electrode materials. A specific capacitance of 212.08 F/g and 336.41 F/g with scan rates 100 and 200 mV/s at 0.4 A/g current density respectively. These results are suggesting PDC composite is a prominent candidate for supercapacitor properties applications.
