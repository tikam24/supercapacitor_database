Activated carbon was fabricated by using phenolic resin as carbon source, tween-80 as organic template, KOH as activator. The samples were analyzed by N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge were used to characterize the electrochemical performance of the samples. The results showed that specific surface area of the prepared sample was 1935.99 m2/g, pore size was mainly in the range of 1.0∼4.0 nm and showed typical capacitance characteristics in cyclic voltammetry. At a current density of 15mA/cm 2, a specific capacitance of 246.18F/g was achieved and the resistance was 1.11Ω. Supercapacitors based on the sample had low ESR and excellent power property. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
