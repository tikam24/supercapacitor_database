The great challenge in front of the twenty-first century is steady and smooth green energy supply for automobiles, optoelectronics, and recently invented IoT devices. To overcome these challenges, different kinds of energy storage mechanisms were propounded. The fuel cells, electrochemical supercapacitors, and Li-ion batteries were investigated extensively for high energy and power density. Various nanostructures have been reported with several merits. But still, no metal oxide has attained the required characteristics. Among them, Tungsten trioxide (WO3) has fascinated the research people due to its excellent novel properties such as tunable optical band gap and interesting structures and morphology. Indeed, the electrochemical performance of hybrid nanocomposites of WO3 reveals the practical application of supercapacitor. In this chapter, we briefly introduced the general synthesizing methods and recent developments in WO3 based supercapacitor electrode materials have been discussed.
