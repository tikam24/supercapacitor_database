The present study details about the Sol-gel synthesis of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles that could be utilized as an ideal electrode material for modern supercapacitor energy storage devices. The as-prepared NiCo2O4 nanoparticles structure, morphology, chemical and electrical properties with supreme assets were characterized by X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Field Dependent dark and photo conductivity studies. Further, the superior power capacitance performance of the sample was characterized by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The studies reveal betterspecific capacitance, high redox activity and excellent ion exchange capability for the optimized sample which shall be a potential electrode material for energy storage applications especially in pseudocapacitive electrode based supercapacitors.
