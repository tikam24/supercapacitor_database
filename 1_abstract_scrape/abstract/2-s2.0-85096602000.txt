Mixed metal sulphides are the latest trend in electrode materials. They deliver a superior electrochemical performance compared to the individual components. Copper incorporated nickel sulphide nanostructures were synthesized for various molar ratios of copper and nickel via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. The structural, morphological and electrochemical performance of the samples were analyzed towards supercapacitor applications. The CNS2 sample achieved a high specific capacitance of 1101 F g-1 at a specific current of 5 A g-1 with an extremely small charge transfer resistance of 3 Î©. The remarkable electrochemical results of CNS2 indicate it to be a suitable candidate for supercapacitor applications.
