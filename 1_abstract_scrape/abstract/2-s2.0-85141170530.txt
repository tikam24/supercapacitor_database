A DC microgrid composed of photovoltaic (PV) units, LiFePO4 battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) and loads has become an essential part of new energy generation (NEG). This paper proposes a coordinated control strategy for the DC microgrid, which is accomplished by utilizing the LiFePO4 battery/SC HESS as the master unit and the PV/gas turbine (GT) as the slave units. The HESS coordinates PV and GT by employing state of charge (SOC) to prevent the system from overcharging or over-discharging. Specifically, this paper presents an adaptive SOC-based droop control strategy for HESS to adjust the bus voltage and charging and discharging rates. The designed droop factors change adaptively based on the SOC. Then a coordinated operation scheme is developed for the DC microgrid based on the state of DC bus voltage and the setting of upper and lower limits of SOC for HESS, where the PV unit switches between the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control pattern and the constant voltage control (CVC) one. Also, the small-signal stability analysis is conducted for HESS. Simulation tests validate the effectiveness of the presented strategy.
