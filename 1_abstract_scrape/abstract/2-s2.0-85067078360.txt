A 3D Ni3S2@Mn-Co-OH/NF cross-linked nanosheet heterostructure composite electrode has been successfully fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared Ni3S2@Mn-Co-OH/NF composite electrode exhibits a high capacitance (3163 F g−1 at a current density of 3 mA cm−2), a superior rate performance (2071 F g−1 at a current rate of 30 mA cm−2), and stable cycling property (maintaining 96.6% of the initial capacitance after 4000 cycles at a current rate of 10 mA cm−2). This excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the unique cross-linked nanosheet heterostructure formed directly on Ni foam current collector and the synergistic effect between Mn-Co-OH and Ni3S2 of the composite electrode.
