In this paper, we propose the use of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy technique for state diagnosis of electric double-layer ultracapacitors. Ultracapacitors under investigation are Maxwell BCAP 0350 and they were stressed in several ways for our study. The analyzed stress conditions include accelerated aging tests, overvoltage, and over temperature tests. Chemical and physical effects on supercapacitor materials are pointed out through a morphologic analysis implemented by means of an environmental scanning electron microscope and a chemical composition analysis obtained by means of an energy dispersive spectrometer. Consequent degradation effects are described in terms of frequency behavior of equivalent circuital parameters.
