Specific capacitance and energy storage mechanism of Zinc-based metal-organic frameworks in 6 mol•L-1 KOH aqueous solutions, consisting of the secondary building units Zn4O(BDC)3 synthesized in a solvothermal process, were studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The results demonstrated that the prepared Zn4O(BDC)3 grains with cubic hexahedron structure were 0.5-1 μm in size. The results for the capacitive performance from cyclic voltammetry revealed that Zn4O(BDC)3 samples had gravimetric capacitance up to 217.39 F•g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV•s-1. The electrode materials retained about 82.58 F•g-1 capacitance, and CV curves kept their initial redox shape unchanged even at high scan rate of 200 mV•s-1, indicating pseudocapacitor energy storage mechanism and excellent rate capability for Zn4O(BDC)3 electrode. From Nyquist plot of Zn4O(BDC)3 materials, the smaller semicircle in the high-frequency region revealed the lower internal resistance of electrode materials, and the incomplete larger semicircle in the middle- and low-frequency region represented the higher charge-transfer resistance values during the charge-discharge process of active Zn2+ species, both of which implied that Zn4O(BDC)3 materials produced a better capacitance property.
