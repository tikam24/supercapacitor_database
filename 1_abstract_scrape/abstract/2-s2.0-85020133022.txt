Great progress has been made in developing nanostructured metal oxides and metal sulfides as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Poor electrical conductivities of these materials, however, limit their supercapacitive performance. In this work, a facile synthesis strategy is developed to prepare Bi2S3/graphene composites with Bi2S3 nanoparticles anchored on graphene nanosheets. The Bi2S3/graphene composite electrodes exhibit promising electrochemical performance in a negative potential window of −0.9–0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. A large specific capacitance of about 400 F/g can be achieved by the Bi2S3/graphene composite electrode with good rate capability and cycle performance. The present work indicates that the Bi2S3/graphene composites are promising anode materials for developing high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors.
