Carbon cloth supported lamellar nickel-cobalt-molybdenum ternary phosphide (donated as NCMP) nanoarrays are prepared by a simple method including a hydrothermal and subsequent phosphorization process. The NCMP nanosheets are grown vertically on carbon cloth fibers (CC) to form a three-dimensional (3D) thin-wall cell structure with open pores (donated as NCMP@CC), which can be directly acted as working electrode without other binders or conductive additions, and achieves a specific capacitance as high as 433 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Meanwhile, in order to match the capacitive behaviors of NCMP@CC in the two-electrode systems, hierarchically porous, nitrogen-doped, and interconnected carbon nanosheets (donated as HPN-CNS) are also prepared from agaric through a one-step method. An asymmetric supercapacitor device (ASC) is assembled successfully by employing the self-supported thin-wall cell structure NCMP@CC as positive electrode and the HPN-CNS as the negative electrodes, respectively. More importantly, the device exhibits not only high energy density of 43.83 W h kg−1 along with power density of 0.89 kW kg−1, but also an excellent cycle stability (82.4% after 10 000 cycles) under a cell voltage of 1.8 V.
