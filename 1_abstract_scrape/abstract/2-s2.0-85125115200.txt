Co3O4–Ni3S4 (CN) and Co3O4–Ni3S4-rGO (CNR) nanohybrids were synthesized by hydrothermal method. In this paper, the synergistic effect of hybridization of cobalt oxide (Co3O4), nickel sulfide (Ni3S4), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as supercapacitor electrode materials was investigated. The electrochemical tests such as galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed. The results showed that CN and CNR materials with specific capacitance values of 523 and 899 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and 89 and 94% cyclic stability after 5000 consecutive GCD cycles can be considered as cheap and attractive options for application in supercapacitor electrodes. The presence of rGO in the electrode material structure by increasing the electrical conductivity and the active surface area improves cyclic stability, enhances capacitance, and decreases the charge transfer resistance.
