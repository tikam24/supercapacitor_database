Sustainable energy is currently limited by the ability of materials to store energy and deliver it on demand. Allotropes of carbon are attractive for their potential for use in energy storage due to low weight, high chemical stability and low production cost. Carbon nanotubes and graphene can be combined to provide an effective three-dimensional material with high conductivity and high surface area. We demonstrate the use of block copolymers to obtain patterned arrays of iron nanoparticles which give rise to ordered carbon nanotubes with good size distribution. A one-step chemical vapor deposition process for large-area fabrication of the graphene and carbon nanotube hybrid structure is described. Following chemical vapor deposition the hybrid material is demonstrated in a supercapacitor device. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibits high electrical conductivity, and has potential for extremely high energy storage capability. Â© 2012 Materials Research Society.
