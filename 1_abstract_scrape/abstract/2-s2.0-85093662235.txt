Constructing 3D graphene frameworks with ultra-thickness and rich ion transport paths is of great significance for the practical application of graphene supercapacitors. Herein, 3D porous graphene frameworks, with thickness up to 320 μm, are directly grown by laser induction on the synthesized polyimide by optimizing the thermal sensitivity of polyimide to increase laser penetration depth. Simultaneously, hierarchical pores are obtained due to fast liberation of gaseous products during laser radiation, which facilitates fast ion transport. Coupled with its conductive interconnection network, the as-prepared 3D graphene delivers a high specific capacitance of 132.2 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2, which is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of most reported laser induced graphene electrodes. Pseudocapacitive polypyrrole is further introduced into the graphene frameworks to prepare composite electrodes, which show specific capacitances as high as 2412.2 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2. Accordingly, ﬂexible solid-state micro-supercapacitors are constructed, with a high energy density of 134.4 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 325 μW cm−2. Furthermore, 95.6% of initial capacitance is retained after 10,000 cycles, indicating superior cycling stability. These results suggest that the ultra-thick hierarchical porous graphene frameworks have promising prospects for high-performance flexible micro-supercapacitors.
