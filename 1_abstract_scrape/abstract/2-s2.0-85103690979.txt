In this article, we report an electrode of uniform and ultrathin nanosheets of silver-doped manganese oxide (Ag2-MnO2) synthesized on carbon cloth through a hydrothermal method with an outstanding specific capacitance for the high-performance aqueous asymmetrical supercapacitor. The Ag2-MnO2 electrode bears the highest specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 280 F g−1 at a current density of 40 A g−1. Besides, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (Ag2-MnO2//AC) assembled with Ag2-MnO2 as a positive electrode exhibits a wide potential window of 0–2.0 V and a remarkable energy density of 54 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2000 W kg−1. Energy density of 26 Wh kg−1 is retained even at a higher power density of 19500 W kg−1. This device offers excellent cycling stability and capacitance retention of 80% after 10,000 GCD cycles.
