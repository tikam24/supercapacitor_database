Abstract: MnO2/NiCo2O4@N-MWCNT hybrid nanocomposite was synthesized by the hydrothermal route using ammonia and urea as catalysts. The structural, morphological and compositional properties of the hybrid composites were analyzed using XRD, SEM, HR-TEM SEM-EDAX, XPS, FTIR, and Raman measurements. The electrochemical properties of the prepared hybrid composite were studied by cyclic voltammetry analysis. The outcome of the electrochemical studies revealed a specific capacitance of ~543 Fg−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density in the KOH (6 M) electrolyte, with a stability of ~88% up to 5000 cycles. The obtained results clearly demonstrated the significance of the nanostructured MnO2/NiCo2O4@N-MWCNT hybrid composite in supercapacitor applications. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
