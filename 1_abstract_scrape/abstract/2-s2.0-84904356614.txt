Perovskites oxide materials such as BaTiO3 (BTO) open opportunities for potential applications in integrated capacitors. In this work, highly regulated BT thin films were deposited on conductive carbon fiber by rf magnetron sputtering for supercapacitor application. The charge storage mechanism in this functional fiber was investigated by analyzing the impedance data. The specific capacitance of the BT shell layer coated on carbon fiber could reach as high as 9610μF/m-2, which is much higher than that of films coated on metal substrate (like gold, 760ìF/m-2). The significantly improved capacitance could be largely attributed to the increase of oxygen vacancies original from the asymmetric diffusion of electric field during the deposition process, which facilitates the electron conduction between the electrodes and films.
