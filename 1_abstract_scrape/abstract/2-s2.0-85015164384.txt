This work focuses on micro-grid, containing various alternative energy resources (wind and photovoltaic) and super-capacitor energy storage system which performs in stand-Alone as well as in grid-connected modes. Various non-isolated converters are used to control the proposed micro-grid. A classical-based supervisory control scheme is designed to perform energy management in order to satisfy the load demands under different weather conditions. According to strategy, both wind and photovoltaic have the priority to supply power. The super-capacitor is added as an energy storage system during surplus power and/or backup device during demand. The proposed system used real record of weather pattern and load conditions for a small community at Islamabad, Pakistan. MATLAB simulation results indicate the effectiveness of proposed model in terms of load tracking, network stability, and power quality.
