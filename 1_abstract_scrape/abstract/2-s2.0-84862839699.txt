Figure Persented: The high performance of a pseudocapacitor electrode relies largely on a scrupulous design of nanoarchitectures and smart hybridization of bespoke active materials. We present a powerful two-step solution-based method for the fabrication of transition metal oxide core/shell nanostructure arrays on various conductive substrates. Demonstrated examples include Co 3O 4 or ZnO nanowire core and NiO nanoflake shells with a hierarchical and porous morphology. The "oriented attachment" and "self-assembly" crystal growth mechanisms are proposed to explain the formation of the NiO nanoflake shell. Supercapacitor electrodes based on the Co 3O 4/NiO nanowire arrays on 3D macroporous nickel foam are thoroughly characterized. The electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance of 853 F/g at 2 A/g after 6000 cycles and an excellent cycling stability, owing to the unique porous core/shell nanowire array architecture, and a rational combination of two electrochemically active materials. Our growth approach offers a new technique for the design and synthesis of transition metal oxide or hydroxide hierarchical nanoarrays that are promising for electrochemical energy storage, catalysis, and gas sensing applications.
