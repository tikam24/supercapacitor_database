Porous NiO nanosheets are successfully grown on nickel foam substrate through an in situ anodization by using molten KOH as the electrolyte. High-purity NiO is directly obtained by this one-step method without any subsequent treatment. The obtained NiO supported on nickel foam is used as a binder-free electrode for a supercapacitor and its pseudocapacitive behavior has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests in a 6 M aqueous solution of KOH. Electrochemical data demonstrates that this binder-free electrode possesses ultrahigh capacitance (4.74 F cm -2 at 4 mA cm-2), excellent rate capability, and cycling stability. After 1000 cycles, the areal capacitance value is 9.4 % lower than the initial value and maintains 85.4 % of the maximum capacitance value. Packing a punch! Hierarchically porous NiO nanosheets grown on nickel foam are prepared by a one-step in situ anodization process with molten KOH as the electrolyte. The obtained NiO nanosheets are in direct contact with the conductive substrate and can be used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitors (see picture). Â© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
