MoO3-graphene composite have been successfully synthesized via facile, effective and scalable solvothermal process as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Highly pristine graphene synthesized from mild treatment of raw highly pyrolytic graphite in proper ratio of ethanol and water. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) revealed that the formation of MoO3particles from ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate precursor and ethylene glycol as reducing agent during solvothermal treatment. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) showed that MoO3-graphene composite electrodes exhibited capacitive performance of 148 F/g in the presence of mild 1 M Na2SO3aqueous electrolyte. The enhanced electrochemical performance of the composite electrodes can be ascribed to the high electrical conductivity of the synthesized graphene and the good pseudocapacitance of MoO3.
