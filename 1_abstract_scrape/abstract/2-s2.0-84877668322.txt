A sodiothermic reduction method has been developed for the preparation of porous silicon using aluminosilicate zeolite NaY as a precursor. The porous silicon with a specific surface area of approximately 570 m2 g−1 shows distinct capacitive behavior when used as an electrode material for supercapacitors. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
