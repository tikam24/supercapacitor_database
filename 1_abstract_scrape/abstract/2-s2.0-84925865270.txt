Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline coordination-based compounds in which metal ions (or metal clusters) are bridged via multitopic organic ligands to form infinite network structures. The organic ligands and metal clusters in the structures of MOFs could be served as carbon source and metal source, respectively. Fabrication of advanced functional materials from MOF precursors becomes one of the most popular research topics in MOFs chemistry and functional materials field. In this paper, the research progress of advanced functional materials derived from MOFs in recent years is reviewed. Synthesis methods of carbon materials (e. g. nanoporous carbon, carbon nanodots, carbon nanotubes), metal oxide nanomaterials (e. g. monometal oxide: Fe2O3, ZnO, Co3O4, MgO, In2O3, multimetal oxide nanocomposites: Gd2O3/Eu2O3, Fe2O3@TiO2), and metal oxide/carbon nanocomposites (e. g. Fe2O3/C, ZnO/C) derived from MOFs are introduced. The applications of these advanced functional materials in the fields such as supercapacitor, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst, hydrogen storage, CO2 capture and photocatalyst of photocatalytic hydrogen production are presented. Besides, an outlook for future development of advanced functional materials derived from MOFs is given.
