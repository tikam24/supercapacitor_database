The pure NiMoO4 and sphere-shaped NiMoO4@rGO nanostructure were obtained by one step hydrothermal process. The sphere-shaped NiMoO4@rGO nanostructure showed higher significantly specific capacitance value than pure NiMoO4. The enhanced capacitive performance of the as-prepared sphere-shaped NiMoO4@rGO nanostructure was attributed to the mesoporous structure, large surface area of rGO nanosheets and higher electrical conductivity. These mesoporous structures could provide more electroactive sites which promoted the electrodeâ€“electrolyte contact and enhanced ion and electron transport during the chemical reaction. Moreover, high specific capacitance also could be attributed to the positive synergistic effect between rGO and NiMoO4.
