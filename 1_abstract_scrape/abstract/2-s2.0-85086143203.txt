The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is one of the most crucial goals in the field of energy conversion devices such as fuel cells or metal-air batteries. Until now, the platinum-based catalyst has been considered the gold standard electrocatalyst and is widely used for ORR. In recent times, transition metal-nitrogen (N)- carbon (C)-based electrocatalysts have verified ORR performances comparable to novel metal-based catalysts. However, due to the complex production methods and low yield, their high price is their one major disadvantage compared to platinum-based catalysts. Herein, we present a transition metal-N-C electrochemical catalyst prepared by simple electrospinning and heat treatment. The metal- and nitrogen-embedded carbon nanofiber represents considerably enhanced activity for oxygen reduction reactions compared to pristine carbon nanofiber.
