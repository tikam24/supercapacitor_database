To maximize the performance of power batteries and supercapacitors in a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) and to resolve the conflict between the high power demands of electric vehicles and the limitations of high-current charging and discharging of the power battery, a vehicle power demand model incorporating road slope information has been constructed. This paper takes a HESS composed of power battery and supercapacitor as the object, and a rule-based energy management strategy (EMS) based on road slope information is proposed to realize the reasonable distribution and management of energy under the slope condition. According to the slope information of the road ahead, the energy consumption in the next period was predicted, and the supercapacitor is charged and discharged in advance to meet the energy demand of uphill and the energy recovery capacity of downhill to avoid the high current charge and discharge of the battery. Subsequently, the improved EMS performance was simulated under the New York City Cycle (NYCC) driving conditions with additional slope driving conditions. The simulated results indicate that compared to the existing EMS, the proposed EMS based on slope information can effectively distribute the power demand between the power battery and the supercapacitor, can reduce the discharge current and the duration of high-power discharge, and has a 20.4% higher energy recovery efficiency, effectively increasing the cruising range.
