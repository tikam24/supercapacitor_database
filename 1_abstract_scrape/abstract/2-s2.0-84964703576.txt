Three-dimensional heterostructured NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 nanocolumn arrays (NCAs) on Ni foam were first fabricated through an improved two-step hydrothermal process associated with a successive annealing treatment. The hybrid NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 electrode exhibited remarkable pseudocapacitor property with high initial mass specific capacitance of 1705.3 F g-1 at 5 mA cm-2, and retained 92.6% after 5000 cycles, compared to the bare NiCo2O4 electrode with 839.1 F g-1 and 90.9%. The excellent capacitive property of the NiCo2O4@MnMoO4 hydrid was attributed to its high-electron/ion-transfer rate, large electrolyte infiltrate area, and more electroactive reaction sites.
