High-performance electrode materials are required for next-generation supercapacitors to satisfy the growing request for higher energy density and cycling stability. In this work, Mn2+ ions are doped into CoSnO3 nanocubes by facile ion-exchange method to achieve enhanced pseudocapacitive performance. The doping amount of Mn2+ ions is controlled by using different reaction times. Compared with pure CoSnO3, the resultant Mn2+-doped CoSnO3 exhibits about 3-fold growth in specific capacitance (from 191 F g−1 to 564 F g−1) and significantly elevated cycling stability (from 84.1% to 104.7% in terms of capacitance retention). Furthermore, symmetric supercapacitors (SSCs) based on CoSnO3 and Mn2+-doped CoSnO3 with multifarious patterns are fabricated by cost-effective screen printing method. Mn2+-doped CoSnO3 SSC shows boosted areal capacitance, enlarged energy density and better cycling stability compared with CoSnO3 SSC, which can be series connected to power a red light emitting diode (1.9 V). These results prove the feasibility of Mn2+ doping with ion-exchange method to enhance the pseudocapacitive performance of the supercapacitor electrode materials.
