The demand for high-performance, safe, and sustainable biobased materials currently exists in many market sectors. Nanotechnology offers new opportunities to use some of these materials in energy applications and to improve their performance and necessary tools to modernize both conventional and renewable energy resources, such as geothermal, sun, wind, water, tides, or biomass, to make them cleaner, cheaper, more efficient, and more reliable. In this context, an increased application of nanotechnology across the energy sector is highly desirable. Energy production, storage, and distribution are becoming a necessity due to the depletion of fossil fuel reserves and the growing importance of environmentally friendly, reliable, and alternative renewable energy sources. The latest trends in energy-related applications are the use of biologically inspired or natural-derived polymers as well as (bio)degradable polymers. This review will focus on the role of biobased and/or (bio)degradable polymer nanomaterials that meet the sustainability requirements and their applications in the energy sector. It will cover a wide range of research areas: polymer-based nanomaterials, their design, synthesis, characterization, and recycling, as well as providing a great insight into future trends in renewable energy.
