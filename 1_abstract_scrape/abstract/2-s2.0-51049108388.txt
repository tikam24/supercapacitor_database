Three activated carbons (ACs) for the electrodes of supercapacitor were prepared from cationic starch using KOH, ZnCl2 and ZnCl2/CO2 activation. The BET surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution of the ACs were evaluated using density functional theory method, based on N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K. The surface morphology was characterized with SEM. Their electrochemical performance in prototype capacitors was determined by galvanostatic charge/discharge characteristics and cyclic voltammetry, and compared with that of a commercial AC, which was especially prepared for use in supercapacitors. The KOH-activated starch AC presented higher BET surface area (3332 m2 g-1) and larger pore volume (1.585 cm3 g-1) than those of the others, and had a different surface morphology. When used for the electrodes of supercapacitors, it exhibited excellent capacitance characteristics in 30 wt% KOH aqueous electrolytes and showed a high specific capacitance of 238 F g-1 at 370 mA g-1, which was nearly twice that of the commercial AC.
