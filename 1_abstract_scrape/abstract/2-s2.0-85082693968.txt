The environment-friendly transportation has been greatly promoted by governments. Because of non-polluting and being operated without nets, fuel cell hybrid tramway has attracted much attention. In order to improve the fuel economy and system durability of fuel cell/supercapacitor/power battery high-power hybrid electric vehicles, a multi-objective optimization method of energy management strategy for tramway is proposed. Firstly, the multi-objective cost function is established by using the hydrogen fuel consumption and the performance degradation rate of each energy source as performance indices. These two performance indeces are difficult to evaluate in one equation, so a Pareto multi-objective optimization method based on the state machine and non-dominated sorting is designed. The Pareto non-inferior solution set of the energy management strategy is obtained, and the influence law of the target power parameters of the energy management strategy on the performance index is revealed, and then the comprehensive optimal solution considering both fuel economy and system durability is selected. The results show that the fuel economy of the energy management optimization method is improved by 29.4 % and 2.4 % respectively, compared with the power following strategy and the genetic algorithm based optimization strategy.
