Much attention has been paid to electric vehicles recently due to environmental concerns. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) consisting of both electricity storage and gasoline tank is welcome to electric vehicle market. In the PHEV system, the electric machine drive is one of the key issues. The ideal tendency is to use the drive machine over the entire torque/speed range with high starting torque and wide constant power range. The proposed PHEV drive system in this paper has only one electric machine which functions as either a motor or generator at a time and a supercapacitor bank for fast charging and discharging during the regenerative braking and fast acceleration. The drive machine must be designed for frequent start or stop, high acceleration or deceleration, high torque or power density, and good transient performance at all speed range. This paper analyzes the new PHEV resistance power and the driving traits. The drive system is modeled and analyzed by the powertrain system analysis toolkit (PSAT) encoded in Matlab/Simulink toolbox. It compares the different driving performances between the new PHEV and one traditional vehicle in urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS). Â© 2009 IEEE.
