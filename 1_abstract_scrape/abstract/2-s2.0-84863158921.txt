High surface area mesoporous manganese dioxide (MnO 2) with α-phase crystalline structure has been synthesized by the reduction of potassium permanganate with ethylene glycol under acidic conditions. Nitrogen sorption analyses show that MnO 2 synthesized under acidic conditions exhibits a type IV isotherm, indicating a mesoporous character. Electrochemical performances of MnO 2 samples as supercapacitor electrode materials have been studied in a three-electrode system. A hybrid supercapacitor based on using a composite material (MnO 2&Activated Carbon) as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode has been fabricated. The hybrid supercapacitor fabricated using MnO 2 synthesized under acidic conditions has excellent large current charge-discharge performance, and shows a practical cell voltage of 1.8 V and a capacitance of 22.1 F g -1 after 1500 cycles even in the presence of the dissolved oxygen. MnO 2 synthesized in the absence of acid shows poor cycle performance and a low capacitance. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
