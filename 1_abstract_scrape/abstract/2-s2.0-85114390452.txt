The proceedings contain 67 papers. The topics discussed include: ionic liquids, superionic glasses, quasi-ionic liquids, quasi-liquid ionics, all with high conductivities but some with little fluidity. where does the paradigm end?; quest for ether-coordinated superoxide ionic liquids; lithium based ionogel as solid state electrolyte: dynamics of confined ionic liquid, a neutron diffusion study; double salt ionic liquids prepared by mixing partially miscible ionic liquids: tuning the solubility of lipophilic molecules; interfacial phenomena of alkalimetal carbonate on Sm-doped ceria for composite electrolytes; binary ionic liquid mixtures for supercapacitor applications; and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane as a model silylamine reversible ionic liquid used as a reversible electrolyte.
