Abstract: The ZnCo2O4/MnO2 nanosheets composite is prepared through a facile solvothermal method. It is shown that the ZnCo2O4/MnO2 electrode can exhibit a higher capacity of 286 F/g in three-electrode systems. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is fabricated, in which the as-prepared ZnCo2O4/MnO2 and active carbon are used as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, delivering a maximum energy density of 16.94 W h/kg (based on the total materials’ mass of two electrodes, at a power density of 750 W/kg) and an excellent specific capacity of 54.2 F/g. The exceptional retention of 98.5% initial capacitance is obtained after 1500 cycles. This ASC’s practical energy-storage is demonstrated by light a LED belt when two such setups are charged. Thus, these excellent electrochemical performances make the composite hold great potential for next-generation supercapacitor applications. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
