A comparative study on the ionic conductivity of carbonate- and ether-based electrolytes was performed, which showed that the ionic conductivity was strongly affected by the dielectric constant of the organic solvent. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of a liquid electrolyte and the cycling performance of sodium-ion hybrid capacitors (SICs) was assessed by comparing the electrochemical characteristics of SICs assembled with a negative activated carbon electrode and a positive Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 electrode. Cyclic voltammetry, leakage current measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results demonstrated that the good cycling performance of SICs with carbonate-based electrolytes can be ascribed to their superior electrochemical stability, large amounts of free ions, and favorable electrochemical reaction kinetics. An SIC employing an electrolyte consisting of 1.0 M NaClO 4 in ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate exhibited a good rate capability and delivered a high initial discharge capacity of 98.7 mAh g −1 with a capacity retention of 90.8 % after 1000 cycles at a constant current density of 500 mA g −1 .
