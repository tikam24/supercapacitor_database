New and emerging telecommunications access networks may require network termination units (NTUs) to be back-up powered, especially for telephony service provision. The multiplicity of NTUs, located at or near customers' premises, dictates the need for both low capital and operational costs. Powering an NTU with photovoltaic cells and supercapacitors is expected to achieve a low life-cycle cost. This paper introduces the requirements for NTU powering, then develops photovoltaic cell and supercapacitor component models and investigates their application to powering an NTU.
