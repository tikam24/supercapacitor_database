Conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have performed well in the fields of energy and catalysis, among which two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) MOFs are well-known. Here, we have synthesized a one-dimensional (1D) conductive metal-organic framework (MOF) in which hexacoordinated 1,5-Diamino-4,8-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraceneedione (DDA) ligands are connected by double Cu ions, resulting in nanoribbon layers with 1D π-d conjugated nanoribbon plane and out-of-plane π-π stacking, which facilitates charge transport along two dimensions. The DDA-Cu as a highly conductive n-type MOF has high crystalline quality with a conductivity of ~ 9.4 S·m−1, which is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional 1D MOFs. Its electrical band gap (Eg) and exciton binding energy (Eb) are approximately 0.49 eV and 0.3 eV, respectively. When utilized as electrode material in a supercapacitor, the DDA-Cu exhibits good charge storage capacity and cycle stability. Meanwhile, as thse active semiconductor layer, it successfully simulates the artificial visual perception system with excellent bending resistance and air stability as a MOF-based flexible optoelectronic synaptic case. The controllable preparation of high-quality 1D DDA-Cu MOF may enable new architectural designs and various applications in the future.
