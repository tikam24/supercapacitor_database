Active materials and special structures of the electrode have decisive influence on the electrochemical properties of supercapacitors. Herein, three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical NixCo1-xO/NiyCo2-yP@C (denoted as NiCoOP@C) hybrids have been successfully prepared by a phosphorization treatment of hierarchical NixCo1-xO@C grown on nickel foam. The resulting NiCoOP@C hybrids exhibit an outstanding specific capacitance and cycle performance because they couple the merits of the superior cycling stability of NixCo1-xO, the high specific capacitance of NiyCo2-yP, the mechanical stability of carbon layer, and the 3D hierarchical structure. The specific capacitance of 2638 F g-1 can be obtained at the current density of 1 A g-1, and even at the current density of 20 A g-1, the NiCoOP@C electrode still possesses a specific capacitance of 1144 F g-1. After 3000 cycles at 10 A g-1, 84% of the initial specific capacitance is still remained. In addition, an asymmetric ultracapacitor (ASC) is assembled through using NiCoOP@C hybrids as anode and activated carbon as cathode. The as-prepared ASC obtains a maximum energy density of 39.4 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 394 W kg-1 and still holds 21 Wh kg-1 at 7500 W kg-1
