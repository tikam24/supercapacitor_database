The mitigation of the switching overvoltages on microgrid systems is investigated in this paper using the supercapacitor. A comparison between a traditional switching overvoltages mitigation method, such as surge arrester, and the proposed supercapacitor-based mitigation method is studied. The microgrid two operational modes, grid connected mode and isolated mode, are taken into consideration in this study. A small hydro generation unit and three variable speed wind turbines based on doubly-fed induction generators are the main renewable power generation units in the investigated system. Alternating Transient Program (ATP/ATPDraw) is used in this study for simulating the investigated microgrid.
