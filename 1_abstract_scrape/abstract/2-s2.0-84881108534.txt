Ordered mesoporous carbon materials with high microporosity were synthesized by a low temperature autoclaving of citric acid-catalyzed polymerized resorcinol/formaldehyde in the presence of the triblock copolymer F127 and were activated by nitric acid oxidation. The materials were used as electrode materials in electrochemical supercapacitors. A bimodal pore size distribution of 2.1-2.3 and 5.3 nm with a surface area of 465-578 m2 g-1 and pore volume of 0.44-0.54 cm3 g-1 was obtained with the retention of an ordered mesoporous structure after nitric acid (2 M) treatment. The introduced functional groups produced a pseudocapacitance, which resulted in an increase in the specific capacitance. The electrochemical capacitance of the resulting mesoporous carbons showed a marked increase after 3 h of nitric acid activation, exhibiting a high value of 295 F g-1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous solution and good cycling stability with specific capacitance retention over 500 cycles.
