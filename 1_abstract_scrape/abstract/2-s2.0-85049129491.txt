In view of the renewable energy sources such as wind power, high permeability of wide time scale power fluctuations inhibition of the hot issues, this paper presents a super capacitor charge and discharge power regulation of voltage state feedback control strategy for wind power active power fluctuation in two-way quickly and accurately adjust, effectively control the output power fluctuations in short time scales; Is analyzed. Studying control combined with super capacitor voltage state, by reducing load control to set aside more than power, when the super capacitor voltage is too low or too high for auxiliary power regulation, optimization of super capacitor energy management, and realize the wide time scale inhibition of power fluctuations. Articles in by establishing consists of DFIG, dc double l/buck converter, the super capacitor energy storage unit model, on the basis of by a three doubly-fed wind power generator (DFIG) wind farm.
