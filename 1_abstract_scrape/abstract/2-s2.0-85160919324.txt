While asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) have huge potential as efficient, durable, and cost-effective energy storage devices, they fail to meet expectations because of the unoptimized architecture and composition of their electrode materials. Herein, PPy/PANI@MoS2 (PPMS) ternary composites with a dual-channel structure are obtained by facile hydrothermal and in situ polymerization methods. These dual conductive channels synergistically improve the electrodeâ€™s electrical conductivity, facilitate ion diffusion, enlarge the interlayer distance, and increase the accessible surface area. Taking advantage of such a favorable architecture, PPMS composites exhibit outstanding electrochemical properties, including a huge specific capacitance (1171 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and rate capability (861 F g-1 at 20 A g-1) in three-electrode systems. Based on charge storage mechanism analyses, we demonstrate that the kinetic behavior of PPMS electrodes is dominated by the surface capacitance (95.9% at 100 mV s-1). Besides, PPMS-based ASCs (PPMS//activated carbon) operate in a broad voltage window (1.8 V), delivering an ultrahigh energy density of 93.4 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 884.8 W kg-1. They also show a superior cycling stability of 90.4% and a remarkable Coulombic efficiency of 99.2% for 10,000 cycles. This work affords an inspiration for rational structural optimization of PANI-based electrode materials with great prospects in the development of next-generation high energy density ASCs.
