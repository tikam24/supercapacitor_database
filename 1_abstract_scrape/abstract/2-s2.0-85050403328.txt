Mesoporous structures of α-Co(OH)2 have been selectively synthesized by a simple one-pot sol-gel process using propylene oxide as gelation agent. Synthesized material is investigated for its crystal structure (crystallinity, phase), morphology (shape, size, surface area, porosity), and electrochemical performance. The specific capacity of the as-synthesized α-Co(OH)2 is 430 C/g, when the electrodes underwent charge/discharge cycling in 6 M potassium hydroxide at 1 A/g specific current. Enthrallingly, capacity retentions of up to 86 and 80% were found over 2000 and 3000 cycles, respectively, at a relatively high specific current of 10 A/g. The as-synthesized material is studied as full cells or complete devices, wherein it delivered capacities of about 80 and 25 C/g in symmetric and asymmetric modes, respectively, at a current of 1 A/g. High capacity is ascribed to the uniform porous nature of the material with considerable surface area. With an extraordinary cycle life and charge-storage capacity, the material prepared is an able contender for supercapacitor electrodes.
