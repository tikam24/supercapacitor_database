In order to promote the application of fiber supercapacitors in the field of flexible energy storage, supercapacitors made from high performance fibers (i.e. carbon nanotube fiber, graphene fiber), natural fibers and man-made fibers were reviewed. The performance of supercapacitors using different types of fibers were analyzed and compared, and the advantages and disadvantages of various fiber supercapacitors were summarized. The results show that the structure, electron transfer resistor, and ion diffusion rate of high-performance fibers determine the specific energy and cycle life of the fibers supercapacitor. However, this type of fiber supercapacitor is limited by the mechanical properties of material, resulting in difficulties for subsequent weaving. Natural and man-made fibers used for making supercapacitors are easily processed with textile technologies, because the mechanical properties of the fibers meet the needs of the subsequent textile processing. The energy storage is affected by the effect of active material structure, density, and electron transfer. Finally, the research directions for flexible fiber supercapacitors are put forward, and difficult problems that need to be overcome in the future are analyzed and prospected.
