In recent, nanostructured transition metal oxides as a new class of energy storage materials have widely attracted attention due to its excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. The MnO2 based transition metal oxides and their composite electrode materials were focused in the review for supercapacitor applications. The researches on different nanostructures of manganese oxides such as Nano rods, Nano sheets, nanowires, nanotubes and so on have been discovered in recent years, together with brief explanations of their properties. Research on enhancing materials' properties by designing combination of different materials on the micron or Nano scale is too limited, and therefore we discuss the effects of different components' sizes and their synergy on the performance. Moreover, the low-cost and large-scale fabrication of flexible supercapacitors with high performance (high energy density and cycle stability) have been pointed out and studied.
