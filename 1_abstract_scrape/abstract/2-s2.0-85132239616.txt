Provide more active sites and concise preparation is an effective technology in renewable energy storage sets. A soluble graphitic carbon nitride (SCN) nanosheets promoted two-dimensional nano electrochemical activity flake NiFe-LDH is successfully fabricated through electrostatic self-assembly, as a layer by layer high performance electrode (NiFe-LDH@SCN) for supercapacitor. The g-C3N4 guarantees the effectiveness of the combination through the ζ-potential of g-C3N4 flake (−19.5 mV) and NiFe-LDH flake (+15.6 mV), moreover, ensures the exposure of more active sites of NiFe-LDH. The optimized electrode shows an impressive specific capacitance of 1060.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and remains 770.8 F g-1 at 10 A g-1. The fabricated hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) exhibits a magnificent energy density (up to 68.7 Wh kg-1) along with the power density of 827.5 W kg-1 in the wide voltage window of 1.7 V and a prominent long-term stability (83.3 % of capacitance retention even after 8000 cycles). Finally, two HSCs in series can light 40 LEDs. Hence, this work demonstrates the great potential of g-C3N4 in developing high-performance LDH-based energy storage devices.
