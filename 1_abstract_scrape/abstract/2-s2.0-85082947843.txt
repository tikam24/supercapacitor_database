Supercapacitor utilizes the nano-scaled pores to increase the surface area indefinitely and shortens the distance between the positive and negative plate, on the account that some larger particles cannot fit into the pores. According to the capacitance equation “capacitance = εrε0 (area/distance),” as the distance decreasing and area increasing, the magnitude of the capacitance is tremendously magnified. A transparent supercapacitor describes a supercapacitor that has a high optical transmittance. If the intensity of light that transmits across the substance is higher than the rate that it is blocked or reflected. The substance possesses a transparency. The flexibility of transparent supercapacitors is another important area of studies. It generalizes a combination of stretchability, bendability, twistibility, or compressibility. In real life, it’s important to obtain the optimal optical transmittance, flexibility, and electrical conductivity for future devices such as smart glasses. These characteristics enable us to develop something more complex and advanced in the future.
