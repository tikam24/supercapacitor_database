A quasi-solid-state micro-supercapacitor with cellular graphene film as the active material and polyvinyl alcohol/H3PO4 as the gel electrolyte is demonstrated as a new type of flexible energy storage device. The 3D porous graphene films not only serve as high performance supercapacitor electrodes, but also provide an abundant ion reservoir for the gel electrolyte. The quasi-solid-state micro-supercapacitor exhibits excellent electrochemical performance.
