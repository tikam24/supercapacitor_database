This paper describes a management energy source supplied by a polymer-electrolyte-membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) as a main power source and secondary power source with reversible storage energy devices: battery and supercapacitor system, for modern distributed generation energy system, and particularly for future fuel cell applications. The energy system in hybrid system is balanced by optimization and regulation algorithm in dependence of the driving conditions - drive cycle. A supercapacitor system (module) is a high dynamic and high power density device and supercapacitor system. Function of supercapacitor system is supplying energy traction system in extremely short power demand requirements. A battery module, as a high energy density device, operates for supplying energy traction system for long time. The aim is the real-time control management of the power distribution between the fuel cell and its associated energy storage to optimize the global hydrogen consumption and energy consumption of each energy storage system in vehicle - Unmanned Ground Vehicle during dynamic loads in the drive cycle.
