Mesoporous CeO2-α-MnO2-reduced graphene oxide (CeO2-α-MnO2-rGO) was prepared by hydrothermal method, which was further used as electrode material for supercapacitor. The electrochemical tests such as galvanostatic charge-discharge were carried out to explore the electrochemical performance of the as-prepared materials. The orthogonal test was designed to obtain the optimized experimental conditions. And the effect of CeO2 amount on the electrochemical performance of the composite was also considered. The electrochemical test showed that the specific capacitance of optimal CeO2-α-MnO2-rGO could reach 466 F g-1 at the current density of 1.0 A g-1 in 1.0 mol L-1 Na2SO4 solution, and the energy density and power density of CeO2-α-MnO2-rGO are 259 Wh kg-1 and 1008 W kg-1, respectively. After 10,000 cycles, the loss of specific capacitance was almost zero, indicating ultra-high cycle stability for CeO2-α-MnO2-rGO ternary composite. The results proved that CeO2-α-MnO2-rGO ternary composite is an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor.
