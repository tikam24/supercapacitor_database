The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for dimensioning an energy storage system (ESS) to the generation data measured in an operating wave energy generation plant connected to the electric grid in the north of Spain. The selection criterion for the ESS is the compliance of the power injected into the grid with a specific active-power ramp-rate limit. Due to its electrical characteristics, supercapacitor (SC) technology is especially suitable for this application. The ESS dimensioning methodology is based on a mathematical model, which takes into account the power generation system, the chosen ramp-rate limit, the ESS efficiency maps and electrical characteristics. It allows one to evaluate the number of storage cabinets required to satisfy the needs described, considering a compromise between the number of units, which means cost, and the reliability of the storage system to ensure the grid codes compliance. Power and energy parameters for the ESS are obtained from the calculations and some tips regarding the most efficient operation of the SC cabinets, based on a stepped switching strategy, are also given. Finally, some conclusions about the technology selection will be updated after the detailed analysis accomplished.
