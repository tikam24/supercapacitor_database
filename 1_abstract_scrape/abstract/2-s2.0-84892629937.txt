A nanocomposite of Multi-walled Carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and Polypolypyrrole (PPy) is fabricated and characterized for supercapacitor application. PPy is uniformly coated on the MWCNT surface by mean of in-situ chemical polymerization. MWCNT content is varied to control the thickness of deposited Pyrrole layer. Ferric chloride solution (FeCl3.6H 2O) is used as oxidant to polymerize Pyrrole. Highly conductive nickel foam is used as a current collector for the electrode. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission Electron (TE) imaging were used in characterizing composite surface morphology. Electrochemical behavior is studied by mean of Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and AC Impedance Spectrometry. The effect of varying monomer to MWCNT weight ratio in composite electrical properties was studied in this paper. Copyright Â© 2012 by ASME.
