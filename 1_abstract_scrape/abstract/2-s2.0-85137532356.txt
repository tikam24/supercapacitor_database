The relatively short lifespan of the lithium-ion battery in electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) draws more and more attention and needs to be carefully addressed to improve the vehicle performance. As a potential solution, the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including both the battery and the supercapacitor, has been widely used in vehicle applications. The supercapacitor, which has high-power density and long lifespan, can be used to supply the high-power demand and therefore reduces the battery degradation. In this chapter, the energy management strategy and the supercapacitor size of HESS are simultaneously optimized using dynamic programming for EVs, based on a battery degradation model designed for the dynamic discharging/charging process. Then, this framework is extended for PHEVs to minimize the operation cost, including the electricity cost, the battery degradation cost, and the fuel cost. The decreasing battery price and various temperatures are considered in a case study to check the HESS effectiveness in the near future. The feasibility of adopting microsupercapacitor in vehicle applications is briefly examined.
