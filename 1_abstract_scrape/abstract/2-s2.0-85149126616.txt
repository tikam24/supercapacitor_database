In this paper, a filter design method for battery-supercapacitor (SC) distributed hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is proposed. This method is guided by the functions of energy source power distribution, DC bus voltage regulation, and the recoverability of SC's state-of-charge (SoC). The virtual impedance network in the control loop of each energy source is designed, and it is transformed into the filter that meets the function requirements, so as to divide and distribute the output power of different energy sources. The combined characteristics of passive components are employed in this method, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and can intuitively and clearly design filters that meet the corresponding conditions. The method could also be extended to the case of multiple energy sources. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed virtual impedance filter design method are validated by simulation results.
