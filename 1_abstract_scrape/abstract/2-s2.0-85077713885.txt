This paper presents the small signal modelling and Control of Battery- Supercapacitor energy storage system in DC microgrid. Growing interest in Renewable energy sources (RESs) and the introduction of new loads like electric vehicles leads to more investigation in DC systems. The main issue with RES is its intermittent nature and an attractive solution for the above issue is the use of additional storage devices. Battery storage is able to regulate the output for a long time however unable to discharge during sudden disturbances in the system. On the other hand, supercapacitors are higher power density devices that can supply energy for a short duration. System need to control both transients as well as a steady state power flow and single device cannot able to help. Hence hybrid energy storage systems are introduced to meet the requirements. This paper discuss the Battery - Supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system modelling and control in detail. The analysis is verified through simulation study.
