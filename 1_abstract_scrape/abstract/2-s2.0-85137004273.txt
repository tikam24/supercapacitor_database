Composite structural supercapacitors (SSC) are an attractive technology for aerospace vehicles; however, maintaining strength whilst adding energy storage to composite structures has been difficult. Here, SSCs were manufactured using aerospace-grade composite materials and CNT mat electrodes. A new design methodology was explored where the supercapacitor electrolyte was localised within the composite structure, achieving good electrochemical performance within the active region, whilst maintaining excellent mechanical performance elsewhere. The morphologies of these localised SSC designs were characterised with synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy and synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography and could be directly correlated with both electrochemical and mechanical performance. One configuration used an ionogel with an ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte, which assisted localisation and achieved 2640 mW h kg−1 at 8.37 W kg−1 with a corresponding short beam shear (SBS) strength of 71.5 MPa in the active area. A separate configuration with only IL electrolyte achieved 758 mW h kg−1 at 7.87 W kg−1 with SBS strength of 106 MPa in the active area. Both configurations provide a combined energy and strength superior to results previously reported in the literature for composite SSCs.
