Fabrication of single crystal hydrogen-terminated diamond MOSFET with dielectrics of LiF/Al2O3 has been successfully carried out. After patterning source and drain electrodes, 60nm LiF/ 20nm Al2O3 were deposited as dielectrics. The output and transfer characteristics were investigated, indicating the typical p-type channel MOSFET. The on/off ratio was âˆ¼ 109 , which was high enough for practical applications. The fixed and trapped charge in LiF/Al2O3 were also examined. Based on the capacitance-voltage curves, the dielectric constant of LiF/Al2O3 was calculated to be 36.1, which was ascribed to the LiF supercapacitor structure. To the best of our knowledge, this LiF supercapacitor structure was first used in hydrogen-terminated diamond MOSFET to improve the dielectric constant.
