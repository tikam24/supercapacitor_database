There have been numerous applications of supercapacitors in day-to-day life. Along with batteries and fuel cells, supercapacitors play an essential role in supplementary electrochemical energy storage technologies. They are used as power sources in portable electronics, automobiles, power backup, medical equipment, etc. Among various working electrode materials explored for supercapacitors, nanostructured transition metal oxides containing mixed metals are highly specific and special, because of their stability, variable oxidation states of the constituted metal ions, possibility to tune the mixed metal combinations, and existence of new battery types and extrinsic pseudocapacitance. This review presents the key features and recent developments in the direction of synthesis and electrochemical energy storage behavior of some of the recent morphology-oriented transition metal oxide and mixed transition metal oxide nanoparticles. We also targeted the studies on a few of the recently developed flexible and bendable supercapacitor devices based on these mixed transition metal oxides.
