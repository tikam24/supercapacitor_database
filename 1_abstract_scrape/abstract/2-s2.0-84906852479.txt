Three-dimensional (3D) multilayer porous MnO2/reduced graphene oxide composites are coated on a nickel foam substrate (denoted as MnO 2/R-GO@Ni-foam) by a facile and scalable spray method following by low temperature annealing. The composite electrodes are characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The content of MnO 2 in the MnO2/R-GO@Ni-foam composites is determined by thermal gravimetric analysis. The supercapacitive performance of the composite electroides is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the MnO2/R-GO@Ni-foam composite displays a high specific capacitance of 267 F g-1 at 0.25 A g-1 and excellent capacitance retention of 89.5% after 1000 cycles. This study provides a facile way for the preparation of composite electrodes for high-performance supercapacitor. Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
