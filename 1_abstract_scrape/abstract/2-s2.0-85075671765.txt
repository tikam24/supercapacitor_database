The research on graphene–nanocellulose-based electrodes in supercapacitors has attracted more and more attention. We have innovatively prepared a carbon–biomass–metal oxide ternary aerogel electrode using a green hydrothermal method, successfully combining a graphene–nanocellulose–manganese dioxide electrode (MCGA) by loading MnO2 metal particles into a three-dimensional porous aerogel composed of graphene and nanocellulose. It is found that when the mass ratio of graphene, nanocellulose and MnO2 is 1:1:4, the obtained aerogel electrode MCGA1:1:4 shows the best electrochemical performance. The MCGA1:1:4 electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 212.73 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 and extreme stability of 86.5% capacitance retention ratio after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This ternary hybrid electrode based on biomass, carbon and metal oxides may become a trend in the development of high-performance supercapacitors.
