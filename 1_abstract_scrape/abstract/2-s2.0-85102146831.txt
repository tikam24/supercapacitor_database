In recent years, energy depletion and environmental pollution have become increasingly serious, and the development of new sustainable energy sources and/or novel energy storage and conversion system is imminent for us. As an electrochemical energy storage device, supercapacitors have many advantages, such as large capacity, high power density, and long life, fast charging and discharging, and have gradually become a research focus. Cellulose is a kind of natural polymer compound widely existing in nature, including cellulose derived from plants and bacterial cellulose. It has the characteristics of green, rich, environmentally friendly, sustainable and low cost, and cellulose have been considered as important candidate for preparation of porous carbon due to unique advantages and high carbon content. Because of its unique pore structure and large specific surface area, the application of cellulose-based carbon materials and their composites in supercapacitors has become a major research main direction. The specific capacitance and energy density of the carbon material can be significantly improved by adjusting the pore structure and surface modification of the carbon material, or by combining carbon material with other materials with good electrochemical performance, so as to improve the supercapacitive performance of biomass carbon materials. In this paper, the preparation methods of cellulose based carbon materials, the properties regulation method of carbon materials and their applications in supercapacitors are summarized. Finally, the future research and development of cellulose-based carbon materials are prospected.
