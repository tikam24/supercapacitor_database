When the supercapacitor (SC) adopts electrolyte with solvent, the desolvation mechanism in the charging process is helpful for the electrode material to adsorb more electrolyte ions and improve the capacitance. However, the desolvation effect is temperature dependent, and it is difficult to achieve at low temperature. In this work, we find that the existence of a large number of submicropores (0.7–2 nm) in activated carbon greatly improves the SC performance at − 40 °C. The capacitance retention ratio can reach up to 90% compared with the value at 25 °C. We reveal both experimentally and theoretically a “gradual desolvation mechanism” from the thermal dynamic perspective. The solvent molecules energetically prefer to be removed from the solvated ion step by step in the submicropore. At the same time, we also found that the functionalized carbon nanosponge materials (FCNSs) with most of the submicro- and mesopore structure deliver a high specific capacitance of 131 F g−1, the capacitance retention ratio at − 40 °C can be about 100% at increased current densities of 1–10 A g−1. Moreover, the FCNSs also show excellent cycling performance at − 40 °C with no capacitance fading over 5000 cycles at 5 A g−1. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
