With the steady advancement of human civilization, energy lack and ecological contamination have become an ever-increasing number of critical difficulties in our reality, and they are issues that should be settled desperately. Perovskite, a potential material for sustainable ideal energy source, boundless, and clean energy. Perovskite with general formula ABX3 plays an important role in electrode and electrolyte for solar cells which is most ideal alternatives to silicon solar cells, supercapacitor, Bio fuel and solid oxide fuel etc. because of their stability, ferroelectric, supreme, catalytic, dielectric and high charge carrier mobility. In this paper the perovskite doped with rare earth Gd and Nd was synthesise by a solid reaction technique at high temperature. XRD confirms the tetragonal structure of single step. Dielectric behaviour of PVSK ceramics was studied using CIS technique within range of 9000C to 12500C and frequency range of 1 kHz and 1 MHz the existence of the ac conductivity variance indicates the electrical conductivity form of Arrhenius. The dielectric constant of the materials is very high which is needed for the energy storage device. The material's tangent loss is very low until the transition temperature is very high. The tolerance factor of PVSK material was found to be nearly 1.
