The state of health of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) has an important role on the determination of the performance and the safety of an electrical vehicle. The degradation of these components is usually correlated with the evolution of their internal resistance, and their capacitance. Therefore, the estimation of these two parameters is necessary to predict the state of health (SoH) of supercapacitors and to ensure their operational safety in vehicular application. This paper presents a comparative study of supercapacitor parameters estimation between High Gain Observer (HGO) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on the accuracy of solution and convergence speed through simulation and experimental results.
