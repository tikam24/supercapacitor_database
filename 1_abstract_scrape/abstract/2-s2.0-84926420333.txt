Summary: Sustainable development of renewable energy sources is one of the most important themes that humanity faces in this century. Wide use of renewable energy sources will require a drastically increased ability to store electrical energy. Electrochemical energy storage devices are expected to play a key role. With the increased demand in flexible energy resource for wearable electronic devices, great efforts have been devoted to developing high-quality flexible electrodes for advanced energy storage and conversion systems. Because of its high specific surface area, good chemical stability, high mechanical flexibility, and outstanding electrical properties, graphene, a special allotrope of carbon with two-dimensional mono-layered network of sp2 hybridized carbon, have been showing great potential in next-generation energy conversion and storage devices. This review presents the latest advances on the flexible graphene-based materials for the most vigorous electrochemical energy storage devices, that is, supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.
