In this work, novel rhombus-shaped cerium oxide sheets (RCOS) were prepared using a facile, soft-chemical approach that was low cost, scalable, eco-friendly, and industrially viable. The structural and surface chemical properties were studied using spectroscopic and electron microscopic techniques. The synthesized RCOSs were used for the methanol oxidation reaction and supercapacitor studies. The RCOSs showed a current density of ∼227 mA cm–2 with an onset potential of ∼0.37 V. The electrocatalyst activity retention was 92% of the initial activity after 500 CV cycles. A specific capacitance of 481 F g–1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s–1 was observed for supercapacitor application. The specific capacitance retention was ∼83% after 500 cycles. The huge specific surface area and conductivity associated with cerium oxide sheets were responsible for the enhanced electrochemical properties. This is the first report on the synthesis of rhombus-shaped cerium oxide sheets, which leads to new avenues for synthesizing novel cerium-based electrode materials.
