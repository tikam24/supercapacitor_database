Carbon materials with suitable pore size distribution, high specific surface area and good wettability are crucial for the capacitive deionization (CDI) electrode. Herein, the Mg-MOF-74 derived carbon (MMCK) is prepared by solvothermal synthesis, carbonization, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation method. The MMCK has super hydrophilicity and rich hierarchical porous structure composed of micropores, mesopores and macropores. The capacitive deionization of MMCK is investigated in NaCl aqueous solution. The MMCK has high oxygen doping amount, and has a high electrosorption capacity (16.82 mg·g−1) for 500 mg·L−1 NaCl. This indicates that MMCK is novel and potential material for capacitive deionization.
