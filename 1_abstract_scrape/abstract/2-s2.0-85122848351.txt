Unique and significant properties of layered two-dimensional titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2) triggered world for designing and fabricating nanoelectrode materials with maximum energy storage capacity employed in various electrochemical device applications such as supercapacitors (SCs). In the present study, novel MXene/CoCr2O4 synthesis to fabricate nanoelectrode material via chemical co-precipitation method with maximum stability and conductivity has been reported. Synthesized material shows reduction in c-lattice parameter for MXene/CoCr2O4 nanocomposite to 21.7 A° indicated by X-ray powder diffraction. Surface morphology reveals reduction in grain size up to 1.16 nm whereas elemental composition confirms presence of oxygen, titanium, chromium, and cobalt within nanocomposite. From Pl spectra, it is quite clear that peak intensity has been reduced whereas Raman spectra reveals both MXene and cobalt peaks presence within nanocomposite. Optimized nanocomposite reveals improved specific capacitance of 417 Fg−1 in IM KOH aqueous electrolyte. GCD analysis reveals power density increases from 603.2 to 1367.6 W/kg whereas energy density value decreases from 20.89 to 9.22 Wh/kg. Superior electrochemical performance of as-prepared nanocomposite nano-electrode material attributed to surface redox reaction supporting pseudocapacitance more strongly in basic electrolyte than acidic electrolyte. Thus, MXene/CoCr2O4 nanocomposite could serve as an excellent energy storage material especially in supercapacitors.
