A novel all-organic composite of covalent organic framework (COF) and polyaniline (PANI) was successfully designed and prepared. By combining the highly porous and redox active TpPa-COF and conductive PANI, TpPa-COF@PANI composite electrodes showed greatly improved performance in supercapacitor application. After 30,000 cycles, the capacity retention rate of the battery is as high as 83%, which indicates that the electrode has great cycling stability. The strategy reported in this work may shed light on the design of new redox active COFs based faradaic supercapacitors and have a great potential for other electrochemical devices.
