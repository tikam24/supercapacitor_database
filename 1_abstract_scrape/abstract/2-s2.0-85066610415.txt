Composite materials containing metal oxide and carbon with optimized structures have shown potential advantages in improving the supercapacitor performance. Herein, the cohesive porous Co3O4/C composites are synthesized via a two-step calcination of zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) single-source precursor. The results indicate that Co3O4 nanopaticles are in situ incorporated with partial graphitized carbon. As supercapacitor electrode material, the Co3O4/C composite exhibit higher specific capacitance (875.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and better cycling stability (capacitance retention of 87.8% after 1000 cycles at 6 A g−1) compared to pure Co3O4 (245.3 F g−1 and 78.4% at the same condition). In addition, it shows good cycling stability with capacitance retention of 82% after 1000 cycles at 6 A g−1 in the symmetric supercapacitor device. The better electrochemical performance can be attributed to the improvement of the conductivity, larger surface area for more active sites, and the ameliorative volume expansion of Co3O4 by the stable structure of Co3O4 nanopaticles well embedded in partial graphitized carbon matrix during long cycling process.
