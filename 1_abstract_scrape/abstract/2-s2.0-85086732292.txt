Textile-based supercapacitors having intrinsically mechanical flexibility are regarded as hopeful power sources for wearable electronics. Herein, four PANI/graphene/textile electrodes are successfully synthesized using a simple ‘dipping and drying’ procedure followed by in-situ polymerization of aniline. The effects of the acidic dopants on the morphological, structural and capacitive characteristics of the resultant electrodes are systematically investigated. The PANI/graphene/textile-HCl (PANI/G/T-HCl) depicts a maximum areal specific capacitance of 1601 mF cm−2 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2, which is apparently higher than numerous textile-electrodes reported so far, and an attractive cycling stability with a capacitance retention more than 75% after 10,000 cycles at 10 mA cm−2. The constructed all-solid-state supercapacitor device affords an outstanding energy density of 755 mWh m−2 at a power density of 1448 mW m−2. The capacitive performance of this device remains stable under bending degrees from 0 to 180° and exhibits a high capacity retention of 77% over 600 bending cycles, verifying a superior mechanical flexibility and capacitive stability with extensive prospects for practical applications.
