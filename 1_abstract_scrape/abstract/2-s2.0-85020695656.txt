Currently parameters dynamic recognition of super capacitor and parameters measurement of super capacitor are difficult with poor adaptability and limited accuracy. To cope, the paper puts forward a dynamic estimate method for dynamic capacitance of super capacitor, which suggests measurement model of dynamic capacitance, establishes and deduces measurement formula set of dynamic capacitance through charge conservation relation and energy conservation relation to get dynamic parameters of super capacitor, and uses time domain simulation to test the suggested method. The simulation result shows that the capacitance value measurement and parameter recognition method put forward by this paper are applicable to many different capacitance functions and can reflect dynamic capacitance of super capacitor.
