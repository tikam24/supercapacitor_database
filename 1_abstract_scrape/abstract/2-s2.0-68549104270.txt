The electrochemical performance of MnO2 nanorods prepared by a precipitation reaction was investigated in 0.5 mol/L Li2SO 2, Na2SO4, and K2SO4 aqueous electrolyte solutions. Results show that at the slow scan rates, the nanorods show the largest capacitance (201 F/g) in Li2SO4 electrolyte since the reversible intercalation/ deintercalation of Li + in the solid phase produces an additional capacitance besides the capacitance based on the absorption/desorption reaction. At fast scan rates they show the largest capacitance in the K2SO4 electrolyte due to the smallest hydration radius of K+, highest ionic conductivity, and lowest equivalent series resistance (ESR). An asymmetric activated carbon (AC)/K2SO4/MnO2 supercapacitor could be cycled reversibly between 0 and 1.8 V with an energy density of 17 Wh/kg at 2 kW/kg, much higher than those of the AC/K2SO4/AC supercapacitor and AC/Li2SO4/LiMn2O4 hybrid supercapacitor. Moreover, this supercapacitor exhibits excellent cycling behavior with no more than 6% capacitance loss after 23 000 cycles at 10C rate even when the dissolved oxygen is not removed.
