Transition metal compounds attract significant interest due to the promising application in energy storage devices. In this work, (Ni, Co)2(CO3)(OH)2 is prepared via a hydrothermal route. In this method, NH4F is utilized to tune the growth rate of hydroxycarbonates. The morphological and crystalline nature evolution process of hydroxycarbonates is investigated by examining different addition amount of NH4F. Results show that the growth rate and the morphology and crystalline nature of hydroxycarbonates could be tuned through adjusting addition amount of NH4F. When there is no or a trace of NH4F in the system, sea urchin-like (Ni, Co)2(CO3)(OH)2 with polycrystalline nature is synthesized, which shows high specific capacitance (1247 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1) and stable cycling (remaining 96.3% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles). The addition of NH4F lowers the synthesis rate of hydroxycarbonates. With the help of large quantities of NH4F, hierarchical (Ni, Co)2(CO3)(OH)2 with single-crystalline nature is fabricated, which shows moderate specific capacitance and long durability with 96.6% capacitance after 10,000 cycles, showing the promising application in supercapacitor. It is demonstrated that tuning of the morphology and crystalline nature of hydroxycarbonates is important in supercapacitor application.
