Fibrous supercapacitor (FSC) is of great attention in wearable electronics, but is challenged by low energy density, owing to disordered diffusion pathway and sluggish redox kinetics. Herein, using micro-reaction strategy, an anisotropic superstructure is developed by in situ anchoring ultrafine zinc sulfine (ZnS) nanoclusters on conductively ordered macro-microporous carbon skeleton via interfacial C-S-Zn bonds (ZnS/SOM-C). The anisotropic superstructure affords 3D ordered macro-microporous pathways, large accessible surfaces, and highly dispersed active sites, which exhibit enhanced electrolyte mass diffusion, rapid interfacial charge transfer, and large faradaic ions storage (capacitance of 1158 F g−1 in KOH aqueous solution). By microfluidic spinning, the ZnS/SOM-C is further assembled into fibrous electrode of FSC that delivers high capacitance (791 F g−1), commercial-level energy density (172 mWh g−1), and durable stability. As a result, the FSC can realize wearable self-powered applications (e.g., self-cleaning ventilatory mask, smartwatch, and display), exhibiting the superiority in new energy and wearable industry.
