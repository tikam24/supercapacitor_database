Two graphite rods from two empty mosquito repellent refills were employed for synthesis of few-layered graphene for material developments on batteries and supercapacitor applications. The graphene sheet is isolated from graphite rod via electrochemical exfoliation method. We exfoliate graphene by intercalating sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate at a constant concentration with constant DC power supply. The purified graphene is characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A newly promised approach in the production of energy source material by utilizing empty repellent rods has been explored.
