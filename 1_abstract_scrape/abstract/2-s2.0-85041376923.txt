We report on the in-situ chemical growth of unique core-shell quantum dots (QDs) with single layer graphene on the surface of CuO QDs and their structural, optical and electrical properties. The CuO/graphene QDs were synthesized through a simple and hydrothermal technique. In order to enhance performance electrochemical energy storages, we have developed core (active material)/shell (conductive material) type CuO/graphene QDs as electrode materials using the combined electrolytes (KOH + LiCl). As a result, the performance of electrochemical energy storages exhibits specific capacitance of 154 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1 and cycling stability with 84% capacitance retention after 3,000 cycles.
