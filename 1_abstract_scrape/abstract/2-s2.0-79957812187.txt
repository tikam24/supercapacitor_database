According to the poor performance about conductivity and cycle properties of conductive polyaniline (PANI) electrode material. The structure control techniques were used and the C/PANI compound electrod materials and fibrous PANI electrod materials were prepared.The electrochemical performance of PANI with different structure was examined .The examination results indicated: The structure control methods have obvious influnce on the electrochemical performance of PANI. The improvement of PANI structure may enhance the penetration of electrolyte and the intercalation of electrolyte ion. At the 2mA discharge current , the max capacitance of PANI-C and PANC-S is 435F/g and 387F/g, respectively .The capacitance retention rate of PANI-C and PANC-S after 500th cycle is 77% and 96%. The ion diffusion impedance of PANI-S material was lowest and show best capacitance and cycle performance. Â© (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
