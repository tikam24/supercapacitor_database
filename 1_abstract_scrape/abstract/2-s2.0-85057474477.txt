In this work, NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays are grown in suit on a Ni foam through a rapid microwave-assisted sulfidation process from analogous structure of Ni-Co precursors. This uniform nanotube array structure yields a high specific capacitance of 8.6 F cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2, and superb cycle property without loss of function after 48000 cycles at 50 mA cm−2. Benefitted by the nanotube structure and the unique triangular supporting system from the electrochemical activation, the cycling stability of ternary nickel cobalt sulfide is maintained at a high level with superior specific capacitance. Therefore, this novel structure has some reference significance for further research of supercapacitors.
