This paper aims to provide a comparative study on the hydrogen economy performance of fuel-cell hybrid trains (FHT) with energy storage devices (ESDs) to further investigate the suitability of each ESDs on a 1.8-km journey. By employing a time-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, the energy management strategy is optimized to minimize the total hydrogen consumption for FHTs with ESDs, i.e., supercapacitor (SC) and Li-ion battery (BAT). The results reveal that both SC and BAT can improve the average efficiency of FC and reduce the net hydrogen consumption. With the increase of budget, FHTsâ€™ performance on hydrogen economy and the corresponding FC average efficiency are improved. When the budget is 350 k$, SC has better hydrogen economy performance than that of BAT. As for FHTs with BAT, the corresponding FC average efficiency and net hydrogen consumption reach the optimal value until the budget reaches to 900 k$. Compared with pure FC trains, the reduction rates of hydrogen consumption of FHTs with SC and BAT are 58.31% and 32.88% respectively. In addition, under the same budget 350 k$, SC has better performance of recovering regenerative braking energy (RBE) than BAT and their RBE is 3.61 kWh and 1.93 kWh respectively.
