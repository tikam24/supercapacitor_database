We have engineered a metallic architecture with high surface area and ultralow density for applications related to electrochemical supercapacitors. This is achieved first by design and fabrication of new annular collector template for electrospinning process, then the extrusion of polystyrene (PS) nanofiber through the fabricated annulus collector template followed by electroless plating of nanofiber assembly with gold and silver. The resultant three dimensional structures were characterized by optical microscopy (OM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The OM images suggest that the fabrication process causes the electrospun fibers to be hinged to one another, maximizing contact junctions enhancing mechanical stability. The coated structure has a superior surface area, is robust, and is freestanding - making it an attractive architectural design for an electrode. The SEM images show interlocking of nanofibers to one another, further indicating the potential application for this system as a high surface area, low density charge collector ideal for nanostructured growths.
