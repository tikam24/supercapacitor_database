Energy storage applications demand for high surface area materials having moderate conducting nature along with redox behavior for increased energy density and power density. We report, development of hybrid material of dendritic Au structure coated with iron oxide with high surface area that combines both electric double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. One step electroless method is used for the rapid growth of gold dendritic microstructure followed by sputter coating of Fe2O3 to make hybrid material for supercapacitor application. Time dependent growth evolution reveals that the dendritic stem and lateral branches grow in length as a function of time. The lateral branches are found to be few tens of nm thick with sub 100 nm spacing among each other, providing high surface area as well as high catalytic activity. Electrochemical measurements confirm significant increase in supercapacitive performance including delayed discharging time and improved energy density (3.87 Î¼Whr/cm2). Dendritic Au-Fe2O3 hybrid materials can be a suitable candidate for energy storage material in normal and harsh operating conditions due to its microstructural stability and noble nature.
