Very recently, 2D nanomaterials such as graphene and inorganic 2D nanomaterials have attracted much attention owing to their high specific surface areas, high mechanical flexibility and extra electrochemical active sites that provide ideal material platforms for assembling the electrode materials of flexible supercapacitors. In this chapter, we focus on a different class of 2D nanomaterials for flexible supercapacitors. We also highlight the intrinsic merits of 2D nanomaterials for fabricating planar supercapacitors and the application of polymer gel electrolyte in 2D nanomaterials-based flexible supercapacitors.
