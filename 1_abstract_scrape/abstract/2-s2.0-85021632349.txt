Doping is an efficient method to promote the electronic conductivity and improve the capacitive performance of electrodes for further energy conversion. Herein, by doping heteroelement metal ions, an ultrathin Y (yttrium)-doped α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet electrode with a large surface area and hierarchical porous structure is fabricated via a facile approach. The Y-doped α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets exhibit a high specific capacitance of 1860 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 mainly due to the increased electronic conductivity of the increased Ni3+ species, as evidenced by density functional theory calculations. As a result, the asymmetric supercapacitor device based on the Y-doped α-Ni(OH)2 nanosheet electrode demonstrates both a remarkably high energy density (58.4 W h kg-1) and power density (754.56 W kg-1).
