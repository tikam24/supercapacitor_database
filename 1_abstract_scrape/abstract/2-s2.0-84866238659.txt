Energy storage has become a key issue for achieving goals connected with increasing the efficiency of both producers and users. In particular, supercapacitors currently seem to be interesting devices for many applications because they can supply high power for a significant amount of time and can be recharged more quickly than electrochemical batteries. In different applications, a combination of the two devices, batteries and supercapacitors, could be used to develop a high-efficiency storage system with a high dynamic performance. Because of the diffusion of supercapacitors, a good model is needed to represent their behavior in different applications. Some models have been proposed that characterize supercapacitors working at either low or high frequencies. In this paper, the authors present a full-frequency-range model that can be used to represent all of the phenomena that involve supercapacitors. Moreover, to realize a simple and useful tool, the authors present a simple procedure to identify the parameters of the model that can be used to characterize a supercapacitor before use.
