Supercapacitors are a new type of energy storage device, and their ageing characteristics are of great importance to quality evaluation, life evaluation, and maintenance. This paper focused on the degradation process of supercapacitors in their early life. High-temperature accelerated calendar ageing test of supercapacitors was carried out, parameters of RC model were calculated by domain characterization method. Experiment results showed that its ESR and C increase and decrease with ageing respectively, and the rate of change both gradually decrease. Simultaneously, a possible physical explanation was given.
