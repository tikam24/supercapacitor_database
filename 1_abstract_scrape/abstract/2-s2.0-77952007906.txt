AC motor variable frequency speed regulation system has been widely used in industrial and agricultural production. Unfortunately, most of them adopt energy consumption brake, which lead to large energy waste. Supercapacitor based energy saving system can absorb the braking energy when motor decelerate, which achieve energy saving. The rule based energy management strategy was presented. This energy management strategy decides the working state of the energy saving system by DC bus voltage of the variable frequency speed regulation system. The role of the supercapacitor based energy saving system in variable frequency speed regulation system had been analyzed by PSIM software. The actual load has been replaced by a programmed controllable machine in experiment. The simulation and experiment result verify the feasibility of the energy saving scheme and the validity of the rule based energy management strategy. Â©2010 Chin.Soc.for Elec.Eng.
