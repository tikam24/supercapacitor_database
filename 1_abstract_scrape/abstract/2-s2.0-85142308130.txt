In order to effectively improve the conductivity and flexibility of carbon nanofibers, eccentric core-shell nanofibers were prepared via coaxial electrospinning technique with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the core solution and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and PVP as the shell solution. And then, N-doped cross-linked carbon nanofibers were prepared due to the melting of the thermoplastic polymer PVP during the high-temperature carbonization process, resulting in the formation of cross-linking points between adjacent nanofibers. NiCo2O4 decorated N-doped cross-linked carbon nanofiber electrodes were obtained by growing NiCo2O4 nanoneedles on the surface of carbon nanofibers via hydrothermal synthesis reaction. Due to the structural advantages of electrode materials and the synergistic effect of carbon nanofibers and NiCo2O4 nanoneedles, the prepared NiCo2O4 modified N-doped cross-linked carbon nanofiber electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical behavior (specific capacitance is 1186.4 F·g-1 (197.5 mA·h·g-1) at the current density of 0.5 A·g-1, capacitance retention of 74.5% after 1×104 charge-discharge cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitors assembled by prepared electrode materials powered electronics successfully, which provides a new research idea for the development of flexible electrodes.
