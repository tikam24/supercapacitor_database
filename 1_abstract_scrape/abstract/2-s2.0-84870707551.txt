Honeycomb hierarchical porous carbon (HHPC) with interconnected meso/macropore and abundant micropore has been synthesized by an easy solvent evaporation method. The obtained HHPC as an electrode material exhibits good capacitive performances with a long cyclic life, a high specific capacitance of 292 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 in KOH aqueous electrolyte, and a low capacitance loss of 20% when the current density increased by 10 times.
