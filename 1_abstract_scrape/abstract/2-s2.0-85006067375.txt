Tendifferent supercapacitors were fabricated to see the influence of hybrid configuration on supercapacitor performances, the electrode configurations were set up using carbon electrode as anode and metal oxide electrode as cathode. In the cathode electrode a combination of two from these three different transition metals where used Cobalt (Co), Nickle (Ni)and Manganese (Mn). The different transition metal combinations obtained made it possible to see the effect it has on specific capacitances. The samples were labeled from sample 1 to sample 10. The obtained Cyclic Voltammetryplots were used to calculate specific capacitance of each cell and comparison of results were made with other samples. The highest specific capacitance value obtained was 78Fg-1 for sample 9 and the minimum value obtained was 5Fg-1 for sample 10.
