In this work, the 3D interconnected cobalt oxide nanoflakes (CON) were grown successfully on nickel foam (NF) at ambient conditions by the electrodeposition method, further followed by calcination. The deposition of Co3O4 was carried out for different deposition times of 10 min, 15 min, and 20 min and enumerated as CON-10, CON-15, and CON-20 respectively. The CON samples were characterized for their Physico-chemical studies by XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, and EDS. FE-SEM micrographs of CON nanostructures showed the uniform deposition of the 3D interconnected nanoflakes on NF. The sample CON-15 exhibited the highest specific capacitance (Cs) of 444 Fg−1 also the specific energy (SE) of 26.07 Whkg−1, specific power (SP) of 541.66 Wkg−1, and efficiency (ɳ) of 77 % at 1 mAg−1 with outstanding cycling stability of 86 % capacitance retention after 1000 cycles.
