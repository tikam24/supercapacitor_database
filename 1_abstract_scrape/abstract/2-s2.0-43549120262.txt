Recent developments in the field of supercapacitors have led to the achievement of high specific energy and high specific power devices which are suitable for energy storage in high power electronic applications, especially in the field of management of embarked electrical power. Equivalent serial resistance is put forward to estimate energy efficiency. Reducing the equivalent series resistance in a supercapacitor will gain a great appreciation. A supercapacitor energy storage system (SCESS) is also designed in this paper which is mainly composed of three parts: the electrical double-layer capacitors array that stores energy, the AC/DC-DC/AC power converter system and the integrated control system composed of microprocessors. This SCESS installed capacity is 0.235MJ; peak power is 5OkW; and generating efficiency is up to 97.94%. Â© 2006 IEEE.
