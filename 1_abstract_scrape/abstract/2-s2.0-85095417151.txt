Implantable, flexible and easily reconfigurable supercapacitors with high power and energy densities are considered necessary for the development of portable and wearable electronics. However, obtaining a fiber-incorporating high electrochemical performance and fracture elongation remains a huge challenge. Here, we prepare a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonic acid)/reduced graphene oxide (PEDOT:PSS/rGO) fiber (PGF) with high-quality electrodes for supercapacitors by easily-accessible hydrothermal confinement reaction. The optimized P3G7F exhibits improved electrochemical performance including a high specific capacitance (Cs) of 249.5 F g − 1 at 0.5 A g − 1 and good cycling stability. Moreover, after introducing the PEDOT:PSS, the elongation at break of the P3G7F is doubled to 13.9%. A symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) based on the P3G7F displays a high specific energy density of 10.68 Wh kg−1 at a specific power density of 81.25 W kg−1. The improved performance of the fabricated composite fiber is attributed to the unique structures of the rGO and PEDOT:PSS and their synergistic effect. This study introduces an opportunity for the development of next-generation flexible and wearable devices.
