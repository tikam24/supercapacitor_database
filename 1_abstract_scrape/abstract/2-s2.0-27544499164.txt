TiO2 and RuO2 have many applications in the field of photocatalysis, environmental protection, high charge storage capacity devices etc. In the present investigation, nanocrystalline TiO2 and RuO 2 thin films have been electrodeposited from aqueous baths. The morphological studies of these films have been carried out using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The morphology of these films and their device performance are closely related. The TiO 2 films showed a compact morphology, useful in covering CdSe semiconductor in photoelectrochemical cells. The porous morphology of RuO 2 film is useful in improving supercapacitor performance. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
