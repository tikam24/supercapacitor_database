High-surface-area Ni(OH)2-porous nitrogen-doped graphene (Ni(OH)2@p-NG) composite was electro-synthesized via a facile co-electrochemical/electrophoretic deposition method. The microscopic results revealed the formation of beta-nickel hydroxide nanoparticles uniformly grown onto porous N-doped graphene. BET findings indicated that the fabricated composite has high surface area of 289.3 m2 g−1 where the pristine hydroxide showed only 74.6 m2 g−1. The electrochemical data revealed that the composite/NF electrode is able to deliver specific capacity of 1642 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 and high-rate performance of 74.4% with increasing the applied load from 0.5 to 10 A g−1. While pristine Ni(OH)2/NF electrode exhibited lower capacity of 951 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 and weak capacity retention of 53.1% at high applied loads. Furthermore, composite electrode showed a remarkable cycling stability of 85.8% after 7000 cycles at 10 A g−1 vs 63% for the pristine Ni(OH)2/NF.
