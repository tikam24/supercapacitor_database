Transition metal oxides can introduce high pseudocapacitance to an electric double layer capacitor for storing more electrical charges. Their role can be more than that since they possess high dielectric constant. Here, we propose a self-sustainable bi-functional configuration by eliminating traditional separator of a metal oxide film supercapacitor that is capable of providing good energy storage performance. We take advantage of super-aligned electrospun carbon nanofibers (SA-ECNFs) as an interconnected scaffold, coupling with electrochemical deposition of α-MnO2 layers at different currents to introduce pseudocapacitance while providing dielectric layer functioning as a separator to assemble a state-of-the-art supercapacitor. The good electrochemical performance of galvanic charge-discharge specific capacitance at 141 F g−1 and energy density at 12.5 Wh kg−1 offers the promising applications in the energy storage field.
