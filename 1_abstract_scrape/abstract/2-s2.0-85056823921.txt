Energy storage devices that offer high energy storage capacity along with high electro-optical and mechanical performance is still a great challenge as a power source for transparent electronic gadgets. Here, we report the fabrication of an ultra-flexible, lightweight embedded PEDOT:PSS/AgNFs/NOA 63 hybrid transparent supercapacitor electrode (HTSE) film by using a peel-off transfer process technique. The HTSE film shows a good electro-optical performance, the sheet resistance of Rs ∼2.12 Ω/sq at 84.65% transmittance, along with excellent mechanical bending and flexibility characteristics. The HTSE film shows a negligible change in resistance, only a ∼1% increase in resistance is observed after 10,000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 2.0 mm. The HTSE film also exhibits good electrochemical performance with an areal capacitance of 3.64 mF/cm2 at 84.65% transmittance. The fabricated supercapacitor device also exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility, only <1.5% decrease in areal capacitance after 5000 repeated bending cycles at 2.0 mm bending radius. Owing to the high electro-optical, electrochemical and mechanical properties of the HTSE film, the fabricated solid-state supercapacitor device shows high transparency, good electrochemical performance, and long cyclic stability. The HTSE film will be a potential electrode for future transparent portable energy power source, and other flexible transparent electronic devices, an alternative to ITO.
