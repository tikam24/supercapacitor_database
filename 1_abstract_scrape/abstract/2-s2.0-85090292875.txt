In this paper, the carbon materials were prepared by high temperature heat treatment and KOH activation with three different kinds of mushrooms as precursors, the prepared carbon materials were used as electrochemical active substances and further used as electrodes and assemble supercapacitors. The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the structure of the mushroom carbon was bulk, and a large number of pore structures appeared on the surface after modification. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves and the pore size distribution further indicated the significant changes of specific surface area and the porosity. The electrochemical performances of the materials were analyzed by cyclic voltammograms (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte solution. All three carbon materials exhibited excellent electrochemical performance. The capacitance of the carbon material derived from pleurotus eryngii up to 427 F/g at the current density of 0.5 A/g. In addition, at a power density of 150 W/kg, the supercapacitor device delivers a high energy density of 7.8 Wh/kg.
