In recent times, impedance networks have been developed to overcome the limitations and problems of traditional VSI / CSI and various traditional dc-dc converter networks. From then on, impedance source converters replace the entire range of power electronic converters: dc-dc (converters), dc-ac (inverters), ac-dc (rectifiers), ac-ac frequency regulators (matrix converters). In addition, the impedance source networks are used in a wide range of applications like PV-Grid tied systems, wind energy systems, distributed generations, adjustable speed drives, UPS systems, battery/supercapacitor/flywheel energy storage systems, electric vehicles, electronic loads, and dc circuit breakers, etc. Several topological changes have occurred to improve the performance of conventional ZSIs. This paper provides a concise review of the state-of-the-art impedance source topologies. This paper categorized the impedance topologies based on their functionality, performance improvements, and switching configuration employed. This paper also demonstrates the fundamental structural similarities, advantages, and disadvantages of each topology, which helps the end-users in topology selection.
