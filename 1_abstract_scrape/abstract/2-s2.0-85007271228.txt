this paper presents a control of grid-connected photovoltaic installation with storage system (electrochemical batteries, Supercapacitors); the objective of this system is to supply prescribed active photovoltaic power to the grid in different atmospheric conditions (Temperature, illumination). The storage systems make it possible to ensure the desired active power injected to the grid in any time, so the continuation service is achieved. This presented work focuses on decupled active and reactive power strategy, which makes it possible to control the level of the active and reactive power injected to the electrical supply network. Simulation results illustrate the performances obtained.
