Natural bio mass derived active carbon from recycled jute is synthesized by simplistic hydrothermal approach and then chemically activated with KOH for further enhancement of electrochemical characteristics. The structural, chemical composition, morphological, and electrochemical measurements for jute carbon are explored in detail. The prepared active jute carbon exhibits high surface area of 1, 903.48 m2/g and high charge storage capacity with a specific capacitance of 346.00 F/g in 6 M KOH at a current density of 1.0 A/g; and shows excellent cyclic stability (the capacity retention ~96 %) over 10, 000 cycles, which authenticates excellent charge storage capacity of electrode material. Furthermore, a supercapacitor device is assembled by using jute carbon as both positive and negative electrode materials, which demonstrate the promising specific capacitance of 43.43 F/g in 1 M Na2SO4 at 0.5 A/g current density besides exhibits high specific energy of 15.44 Wh/kg at the specific power of 402.78 W/kg. Thus, from the explored results it can be concluded that, biomass derived active jute carbon could be used as a sustainable and novel electrode material for supercapacitors or batteries applications.
