The authors regret that the printed version of the above article contained some errors. (1) The SEM images of CSC and CSC@Ti3C2Tx electrode in Fig. 1 are corrected to reflect the originality of the images.(2) The unit of the scale in Fig. 2 should read “μm” instead of “mm”. This error was caused by not changing the font of “m” into “symbol” in the preparation of the scale unit.(3) There are errors in plotting Fig. 3( f).The following figures show their correct version. The unintended errors and corrections have no impact on the remainder of the manuscript, the interpretation of the data, or the conclusions reached. The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. We have taken measures to prevent similar errors in the future.
