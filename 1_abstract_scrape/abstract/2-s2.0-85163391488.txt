From this study, we get to know about the concentration effect of activating agent which is phosphoric acid (H3PO4) on the structural, and electrochemical behaviour of carbon produced from orange peel. We have taken various concentrations of H3PO4 (0.5 M, 1 M, 1.5 M) and activated the orange peel-derived carbon (OPC) followed by sintering in the furnace. The structural and chemical nature is analyzed by performing powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) tools. The electrochemical measurements are also done via cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. At scan rate of 20 mV s−1we discovered that sample named 1 M possess the greatest specific capacitance value of 5.55 F g−1. At the current density of 1 A g−1 specific energy is 0.189 Wh Kg−1 and specific power is 486.8 W Kg−1. As a result, raising the concentration of the solution from 0.5 to 1 M, there is a rise in electrochemical behavior but as we go from 1 to 1.5 M fall in the behavior is seen. The reason behind this is that in higher concentrations the specific area of the electrode for the ions to get accommodated decreases due to an increase in micropores. So, 1 M of 85% (w/v) H3PO4 will be a promising candidate for activating the orange peel-derived carbon (OPC) to obtain enhanced electrochemical performance for energy storage applications.
