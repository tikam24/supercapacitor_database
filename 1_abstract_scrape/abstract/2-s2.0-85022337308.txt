A simple cobalt catalyzed gasification strategy to synthesize drilled graphene sheets (DGNs) is performed, and 3D DGNs hydrogel is prepared at a relatively low temperature. Due to mesopore hydrogel structure that increases the charge transfer efficiency by providing pathways for ionic into the overlaps of DGNs hydrogel and hole density displays controllably, the resulting DGNs hydrogel electrode provides excellent rate capability with an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 264.1 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 compared to a value of 187.8 F g−1 for graphene sheets (GNs) pole. DGNs hydrogel expands the design space for developing high-performance energy storage devices.
