The motivation of the current study is to use the synthesized tri- and tetravalent boronate esters (C15H16BNO3.HCl (B1) and C40H42B2Cl2N4O4, (B2)), respectively, for the first time as electrodes in the presence of different electrolyte solutions in supercapacitor applications and to measure their specific capacitances. As a result of the electrochemical measurements, it is determined by experimental observations that the specific capacitance value of the tetravalent (B2) electrode is higher than that of trivalent (B1) in the presence of both different electrolyte solutions. Furthermore, when the morphological properties of both materials are examined, it is observed that tetravalent boronate ester (B2) has a more porous structure and its surface area is higher than trivalent boronate ester (B1) as a conclusion of the surface area measurement. As a consequence of this research, it has been demonstrated that tetravalent boronate ester (B2) can be employed as a promising material for future supercapacitor energy storage applications.
