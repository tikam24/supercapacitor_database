Nitrogen-rich microporous carbon spheres (NMCSs) have been prepared via thermal treatment of Schiff-base polymer monomers of melamine and terephthalaldehyde in the presence of a molten-salt ZnCl2/KCl system. The use of ZnCl2 and KCl in the reaction allows for NMCSs with a high specific surface area of 1929 m2 g-1 and pore volume of 0.85 cm3 g-1. More importantly, most of the pore volume is contributed to micropores, making it an ideal electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors. When tested as supercapacitor electrodes, NMCSs delivered an excellent specific capacitance of 365 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and still maintained 230 F g-1 even at 10 A g-1. Moreover, a very stable cycle life with 94% capacitance retention was observed after 10 000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 3 A g-1. With regard to the inexpensive precursors, simple and environmentally-friendly synthetic route, this novel molten salt strategy holds great potential for the industrial manufacture of NMCSs for use in energy storage and conversion.
