Demands for flexible electronic equipment such as wearable devices and wrap-round displays have motivated the development of flexible energy storage devices. Although cellulose paper is one of the most promising substrates for flexible devices, its intrinsic limitations, such as poor mechanical durability, hamper its practical use. In this study, we adopted the traditional Korean paper, Hanji, with superior mechanical robustness as a substrate for supercapacitor electrodes. The effective infiltration of activated carbons (ACs) as an electrode material into the dense network of Hanji cellulose fibers was performed by a simultaneous one-pot process of network formation and AC embedment. The fabricated symmetric supercapacitors based on the AC-embedded Hanji electrode exhibited a specific capacitance (Csp) of 16.0 F/g measured at a scan rate of 10 mV/s with excellent cycle stability, the Csp retention of 94.5%, over 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
