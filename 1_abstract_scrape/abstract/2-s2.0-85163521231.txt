Now a day, borophene and the related materials are of significant interest in scientific domain due to their distinguished properties. Borophene has been treated as most emerging and promising material in energy, sensor, biomedical and many other applications. Borophene has been implemented in storage applications for preparation of high performance supercapacitors (SCs) due to their better flexibility, higher capacitance, and conductivity characteristics which enable them challenging for use as electrodes superior to graphene in Scs. In view of such relevance of borophene in diversified sectors, the work in the present investigation is to survey the literature to know about synthesis, stability, characteristic properties of borophene and the related materials through the possible experimental methods so as to utilize them in the production of high performance supercapacitors. The information received from the survey reveals that the synthesis of borophene from sundry crystallographic structures of boron will impart new insights of borophene for its implementation in large scales. The Raman spectrum and zeta potential method are used for structural and stability analysis of borophene and the associated materials. In particular, Polyaniline (PANI): Î± borophene nano network electrode is found with high specific capacity and good stability for SCs.
