Hollow triple layered Ni-Al-Mn hydroxide nanocomposite is a promising electrode material with high capacitance value. Moreover, the material provides a high energy density with good cycling stability. Here we demonstrate the facile method for preparation of hollow layered triple hydroxide material in a combination of Nickel, Aluminium and Manganese with high surface area and mesoporous nature. Owing to its high electrode area and fast electron-ion transfer nature, the hollow Ni-Al-Mn hydroxide exhibits the high capacitance of 1756 F/g at 4 A/g and retains its capacitance value upto 89.5% of initial values after 4000 cycles. Additionally, it provides a higher energy density of 239.0795 Wh/kg at a power density of 1980 W/kg. HLTH of Ni-Al-Mn nanocomposite provides a better capacitance effect. Finally, this material provides a general approach for designing supercapacitor with tunable nanostructure and enhanced supercapacitor behaviour has a large application in energy storage and conversion devices.
