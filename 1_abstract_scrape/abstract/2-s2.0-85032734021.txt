One-dimensional (1D, wire- and fiber-shaped) supercapacitors have recently attracted interest due to their roll-up, micrometer size and potential applications in portable or wearable electronics. Herein, a 1D wireshaped electrode was developed based on Fe3O4 nanosheet arrays connected on the Fe wire, which was prepared via oxidation of Fe wire in 0.1 M KCl solution (pH 3) with O2-rich environment under 70 °C. The obtained Fe3O4 nanosheet arrays displayed a high specific capacitance (20.8 mF cm-1 at 10 mV s-1) and long cycling lifespan (91.7% retention after 2500 cycles). The excellent performance may attribute to the connected nanosheet structure with abundant open spaces and the intimate contact between the Fe3O4 and iron substrate. In addition, a wire-shaped asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated and had excellent capacitive properties with a high energy density (9 µWh cm-2) at power density of 532.7 lW cm-2 and remarkable long-term cycling performance (99% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles). Considering low cost and earth-abundant electrode material, as well as outstanding electrochemical properties, the assembled supercapacitor will possess enormous potential for practical applications in portable electronic device.
