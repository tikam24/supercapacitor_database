Herein, dual-aerogels of resorcinol-formaldehyde and polyvinyl alcohol (RF/PVA) with semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) structure are prepared and applied as precursors for preparing the hierarchical porous carbons. PVA serves as the critical skeletal template for macropores and supports the three-dimensional architecture, while KOH impels the increment of micropores and the formation of mesopores, both enlarging the specific surface area. More intriguing, the pore structure and surface area can be tailored by controlling the mass ratio of resorcinol to PVA, thus optimizing the electrochemical performance. As-obtained DAGC-1 with a large specific surface area of 2076 m2 g−1 and three-dimensional hierarchical porous structure exhibits a superior specific capacitance of 320 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in three-electrode system. Meanwhile, DAGC-1 assembled symmetrical supercapacitor delivers an elevated energy output of 59.8 Wh kg−1 at 350 W kg−1 in EMIMBF4 electrolyte with a wide potential range of 3.5 V. Our work provides a novel synthesis approach deriving hierarchical porous carbons from dual-aerogels with semi-IPN structure, serving as a new highlight for efficient energy storage.
