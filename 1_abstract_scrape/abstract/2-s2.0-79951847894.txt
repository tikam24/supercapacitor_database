The influences of electrolyte concentration and temperature on the capacitive behavior of activated carbon (AC) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. The performance of a symmetric capacitor was characterized in 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 6.0 mol · L-1 KOH solution. We found that the high electrolyte concentration led to high capacitance, low internal resistance, and a narrow voltage window. The capacitance and internal resistance were found to be linearly dependent on the logarithm of KOH concentration. AC supercapacitor performance was investigated at 20, 40 and 80 °C, respectively. We found that elevated temperatures are favorable for an increase in capacitance and for a decrease in internal resistance. However, elevated temperatures increase the capacitance fading rate during long charge/discharge cycling tests. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
