Charging times ranging from seconds to minutes with high power densities can be achieved by electrochemical capacitors in principle. Over the past few decades, the performance of supercapacitors has been greatly improved by the utilization of new materials, preparation of unique nanostructures, investigation of electrolytes, and so on. However, the discovery of the related basic theory is very limited. Herein, a new view of a supercapacitor called the “integrated supercapacitor” is proposed. The electrode of the integrated supercapacitor consists of certain positive and negative materials. With this design, a single integrated electrode can work in both the positive and negative potential windows simultaneously. Additionally, the integrated full supercapacitor device shows a much higher capacitance and wider potential window than traditional single symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors, which results from its multiple mechanisms, including the traditional positive//positive symmetric, positive//negative asymmetric, and negative//negative symmetric full supercapacitor mechanisms.
