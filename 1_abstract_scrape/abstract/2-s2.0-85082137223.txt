The emerging of aqueous battery-supercapacitor hybrid systems (BSH) promises the combination of the excellent rate performance of supercapacitors and the capacity superiority of batteries. However, the energy density of such systems is still limited by an unsatisfying electrochemical window and the absence of voltage plateaux. To address this point, we herein propose a “potential fringe” strategy, which features a kinetically widened stable potential window and a high voltage plateau. Under this strategy, we remarkably promote the energy density of BSH by utilizing two fast battery reactions at the potential nearly below the hydrogen evolution reaction in the anode and the potential nearly above the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode: reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel films act as the cathode and TiO2@rGO hydrogel films act as the anode with LiOH/K4Fe(CN)6 as the electrolytes. Through coupling the two fast potential-fringe reactions – a metal cation insertion/extraction in the TiO2 electrode and a reversible redox reaction of [Fe(CN)6]4−/[Fe(CN)6]3− in the cathode, the alkaline BSH reaches a high voltage of 2 V with a discharge voltage plateau of 1.55 V. Compared with the 6.2 Wh kg−1 and 20.3 Wh kg−1 for the rGO//rGO system at 1.2 V and TiO2@rGO//rGO system at 1.7 V in LiOH/KOH electrolyte, the system delivers a high energy density of 70.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 2.90 kW kg−1.
