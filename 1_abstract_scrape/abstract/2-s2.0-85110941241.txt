MXenes have potential applications in the field of supercapacitors. As a two-dimensional material, how its structure, properties, and surface chemistry facilitate energy storage is discussed. A detailed analysis of the synthesis of MXenes and factors affecting energy storage in supercapacitor grounds is explained in detail. Possibilities of anode architecture to improve supercapacitor performance on industrial standards are discussed. This review will aid in planning better MXene hybrid anodes to assemble supercapacitors with desired electrochemical performance. Ways to improve capacitance, energy density, and voltage window of electrodes are explained based on literature reports. Electrochemical performance is evaluated by the effect of hierarchical structures, heterostructures, transition metal oxides, carbon compounds, polymers, and so on. Anode fabrication methods for modern micro-supercapacitors are also incorporated in this study. A good selection of electrolytes and fabrication techniques adapted for MXene-based anode fabrication is emphasized. This review will help in future options of supercapacitor anode designing.
