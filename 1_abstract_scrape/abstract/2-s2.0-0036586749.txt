The properties of supercapacitors utilizing carbon nanotube electrodes are studied. The effects of modification treatment and adhesives on the properties of electrodes are investigated. The working mechanism of supercapacitor is also discussed. When carbon nanotubes modified by nitric acid are used as electrodes and 30% (wt) H2SO4 aqueous solution is used as the electrolyte, supercapacitors with specific capacitance of 69 F/g and good frequency response are obtained. For this type of supercapacitor, there is not only electric double-layer capacitance, but also pseudo capacitance.
