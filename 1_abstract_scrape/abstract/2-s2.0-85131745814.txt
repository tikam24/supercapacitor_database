In the paper, the cavitated nanoporous activated carbon made of β-cyclodextrin has been synthesized using combined KOH modification and doping with chromium chloride of different concentrations. The structure of the obtained carbons has been investigated by scanning electron microscopy with an analyzer of sample composition, X-ray diffraction, and small-angle X-ray scattering. The impedance dependences for supercapacitors made of synthesized carbon have been analyzed. The equivalent electrical circuits simulating Nyquist diagrams have been constructed. For this purpose, the de Levy model was used, modified by connecting a parallel RC link. It has been shown that doping β-cyclodextrin with chromium in the amount of 4% effectively modifies the energy spectrum of activated carbon and shifts the position of the Fermi level to the energy region characterized by increased density of states of delocalized electrons. As a result, the specific capacity of such carbon increases significantly and reaches 180 F/g in an aqueous electrolyte based on KOH.
