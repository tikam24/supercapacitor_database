A new class of ternary heterostructures consisting of a reduced graphene oxide, molybdenum disulfide, and tungsten disulfide (rGO-MoS2-WS2) is prepared through a simple chemical method. According to Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, a MoS2/WS2 heterostructure is uniformly formed on the conductive rGO support. Furthermore, rGO-MoS2-WS2 possesses s large surface area of 109 m2 g−1 and a hierarchical pore architecture. When serving as the electrode for supercapacitors, rGO-MoS2-WS2 exhibits pseudocapacitive behavior in a KOH solution. It is found that rGO-MoS2-WS2 displays a specific capacitance (Cs) of 365 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is much higher than those of single TMD (MoS2 or WS2)-based composites. The enhanced electrochemical performance of rGO-MoS2-WS2 is attributed to the lower internal resistance through heterostructure formation, the wide range of TMD oxidation states, and uniform distribution of the few-layered TMD nanosheets on the rGO surface. Furthermore, the optimal loading amount of MoS2/WS2 heterostructure in the composite is investigated. To demonstrate its practical application, rGO-MoS2-WS2 is used as a positive electrode for an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC). The maximum energy density of the ASC device is 15 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 373 W kg−1. Furthermore, the device remains approximately 70 % of the initial Cs value after 3000 cycles, which shows the excellent cycling stability.
