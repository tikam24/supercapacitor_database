Solvothermal reactions of V-shaped ligand 1,1′-(oxybis(1,4-phenylene))-bis(1H-1,2,4-triazole) (OPBT) with deprotonated phthalic acid (H2PA) or (1,1′-biphenyl)-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (H2BDA) in the presence of transition metal nitrates in N,N-dimethylformamide/water (DMF/H2O) solvent system yielded five new complexes: [Cu5(μ3-OH)2(OPBT)2(PA)4]n (1), [Cd2(OPBT)(PA)2]n (2), {[Zn(OPBT)(PA)]·H2O}n (3), [Cd(μ2-H2O)(OPBT)(BDA)]n (4), and [Co(OPBT)2(BDA)]n (5). Complexes 1 and 2 show two-dimensional (2D) layers based on one-dimensional (1D) infinite rod second building units (SBUs) of pentanuclear Cu(II) or tetranuclear Cd(II) clusters with OPBT ligands, which are further formed into three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular frameworks by interlayer hydrogen bonding or π⋯π stacking interactions, respectively. Complex 3 displays a 1D chain, which is further extended into a 3D supramolecular structure through C-H⋯π and hydrogen bonding interactions. Complex 4 features a 2D layer with the sql topology, which is further formed into a 3D supramolecular framework by interlayer hydrogen bonds. Complex 5 possesses a 2D 2-fold interpenetrating polyrotaxane structure (2D + 2D → 2D) with the sql topology, which is further extended into a 3D supramolecular framework through interlayer π⋯π stacking interactions. Furthermore, photoluminescent spectra of complexes 2-4 and UV-visible spectra of complex 5 have been studied. Subsequently, mesoporous Co3O4 is obtained by calcination of complex 5. The as-made mesoporous Co3O4 is investigated for its application as supercapacitor electrode and energy storage material in 1, 2, and 3 M KOH electrolytes, respectively. The electrochemical analyses show that mesoporous Co3O4 exhibits a relatively higher specific capacitance of 285.4 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A g-1 and retains 87% at 3 A g-1 after 3000 cycles in 3 M KOH electrolyte. The results demonstrate that mesoporous Co3O4 with specific morphology can act as a promising electrode candidate in supercapacitors.
