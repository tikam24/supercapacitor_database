This paper presents the design, synthesis and characterization of nano-structured manganese dioxides (MnO 2) and their composites as electrode materials for micro supercapacitors. An optimized composite containing nano-MnO 2 powder exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 160F/g in 0.2M K 2SO 4 aqueous solution, and is compatible with micro fabrication process. Then a micro supercapacitor with 3D interdigital structure using the composite material as electrodes is achieved by MEMS fabrication technology. The micro supercapacitor has well-performed capacitive behavior under various scanning rates and has a large specific capacitance of 30mF/cm 2, which indicates that the composite is a promising material for energy storage on chips.
