Synthesis of ordered mesoporous RuOx electrodes was conducted by electro-deposition using a lyotropic liquid crystal template method with Ti substrates and subsequent electro-oxidation. The obtained ordered mesoporous Ru metal was characterized by XRD, TEM and electrochemical measurements in 0.5 M H2SO4. After electro-oxidation by potential cycling, the ordered mesoporous RuOx afforded specific capacitance of ∼400 F (g-Ru)-1. A micro-supercapacitor with ordered mesoporous RuO x was fabricated by controlled electro-deposition of ordered mesoporous RuOx on an inter-digitated array electrode (IDA; 10 μm electrode width, 5 μm gap and 65 × 2 electrodes). This micro-supercapacitor exhibited good capacitive property with maximum specific capacitance of 12.6 mF cm-2 and specific energy of 12.5 Wh (kg-Ru)-1 based on the mass of the deposited material. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
