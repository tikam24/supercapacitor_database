To reduce impacts of the high rate current charge and discharge induced by frequent acceleration and deceleration of the vehicles to the battery in view of pure electric vehicles (EV), a hardware configuration, control algorithm design and an experiment study on battery+supercapacitor hybrid energy storage systems are addressed. At first, a topology structure with respect of the hybrid energy storage systems is introduced. Then, a key component of DC/DC converter is modeled, and its efficiency behavior is evaluation through experiment. A primary hard-ware configuration of the hybrid energy storage systems is completed, and a power splitting ratio (PSR) control algorithm is proposed. Hard-ware in loop experiments confirm that the supercapacitor has a function to smooth the power supplied by the battery and therefore the life time of the battery can be prolonged and improves EV's performance.
