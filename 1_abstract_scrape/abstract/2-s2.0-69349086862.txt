Hydrothermal decomposition of permanganate, conducted in a range of pH-controlled solutions (from strongly acidic to strongly basic), is used to prepare manganese dioxides that are well-suited for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. While permanganate is thermodynamically unstable, the kinetics of its decomposition in an aqueous environment are very slow, until the temperature is raised to ∼200 °C. Although the resultant materials are relatively crystalline and have low total pore volume, their prominent meso-porosity leads to good electrochemical performance. Best behaviour is obtained for material from permanganate decomposition in 0.01 M H2SO4 solution, for which composite electrodes (150 μm thick) yield ∼150 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 in a 9 M KOH electrolyte.
