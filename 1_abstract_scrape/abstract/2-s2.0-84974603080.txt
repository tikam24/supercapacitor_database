In this article, we report a facile and environmentally friendly glutamic acid-assisted hydrothermal strategy for the preparation of ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) Î²-Ni(OH)2 nanosheets with a thickness of about 2 nm, which exhibit a maximum specific capacitance of 2537.4 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, even at 10 A g-1, the specific capacitance is still maintained at 2290.0 F g-1 with 77.6% retention after 3000 cycles.
