Manganese dioxide nanoparticles were synthesized in a quaternary microemulsion using surfactant hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared manganese dioxide powders were characterized by means of powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The average size of nanoparticles, as well as the crystalline structure of manganese dioxide, can be controlled by the content of co-surfactant n-pentanol and water. The particle size decreased with adding the amount of n-pentanol or reducing water, and simultaneously manganese dioxide nanosheets were generated. Their electrochemical properties were investigated using cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared manganese dioxide powder with the surface area of 231.5 m2 g-1 was 140.5 F g-1 at scanning rate of 2 mV s-1. Â© 2013 by ESG.
