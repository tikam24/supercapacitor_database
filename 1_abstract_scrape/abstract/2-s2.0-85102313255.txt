After more than five decades of extensive research on conducting polymers (CPs) and three decades of extensive research on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), is there any further thing unsaid or unexplained? Synthesis, fundamental properties, and their suitability for energy storage application have previously been broadly discussed elsewhere. It is time, nevertheless, to focus on their existing problems in pristine form and find a way to prove their improved performance as electrode material when integrated with each other. Currently available reviews focus mainly on the use of CP based materials or on the MOF based materials and a very few comprehensively discuss the advantage and cutting-edge research that has been carried out implementing composites of MOFs and CPs in the field of energy storage. This survey aims to shove the boundaries a little further summarizing the state-of-the-art on the composite materials designed by integrating MOFs and CPs together as redox-active electrode material for energy storage. Ion-dynamics in an electrode material underpins the charge/discharge rates significantly determining the energy and power density in an energy storage device. This aspect is often overlooked, and study of ion-dynamics is seldom conducted. This review includes the prospects of Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in studying the ion-dynamics within an electrode material. Overall, this review covers broad discussion on accomplishments related MOFs@CPs as redox-active electrodes in supercapacitors, existing problems and their possible solutions, together with potential advanced approaches to design better performing electrode materials.
