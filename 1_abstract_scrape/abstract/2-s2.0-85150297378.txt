Supercapacitors are one of the most promising technologies to meet the requirements of human sustainable development, due to their benefits such as high capacitance and rate capability, long cycle life, and low processing cost. Electrode materials play a decisive role in the performance of supercapacitors, that's why many types of research on electrode materials are critical to supercapacitors. As we go forward toward highly flexible and bendable electronics. Conducting polymer (CP)-based materials are promising materials in supercapacitors because of their unique advantages including good conductivity, flexibility, relatively cheap, easy synthesis, and so on. This review summarizes recent research progress of CPs (including polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANI), and polythiophene (PTh)), the CP-based composites for supercapacitors in purpose and concentrating compositesâ€™ effect on supercapacitive parameters, beside diffusion mechanism with the calculations of supercapcitive parameters in every technique. Eventually, we give a brief outline of the development directions of CP-based supercapacitors with suggestions for the future of supercapacitors based on the last decade's research.
