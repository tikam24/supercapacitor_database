We demonstrate a general approach to the preparation of layered graphene oxide structures with sandwiched conducting polymers of different morphologies. The approach is conceptualized on the basis of the electrostatic interactions between negatively charged graphene oxide sheets and positively charged surfactant micelles. A graphene oxide-polypyrrole composite prepared from this approach exhibited an excellent electrocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance over 500 F g-1. Good rate performance and cycle ability were realized by the composite electrode. The simple method described here opens up a generalized route to making a wide range of graphene oxidebased and graphene-based composite materials for applications beyond electrochemical energy storage.
