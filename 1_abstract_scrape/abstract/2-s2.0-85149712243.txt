Two-dimensional transition metal sulfides (TMDs) possess various morphologies and microstructures, which are widely used in the field of supercapacitors. In this study, the MoS2/Ni3S2 composites are synthesized by a facile hydrothermal process. The electrochemical tests show that the obtained nanocomposites deliver higher theoretical capacity and superior cycling stability compared with single Ni3S2 or MoS2 counterparts. The capacitance of the MoS2/Ni3S2 sample reaches 810 C/g at 1 A/g. The assembled hybrid supercapacitor presents an energy density of 33.75 Wh/kg at 2700 W/kg. After 10,000 cycles, the device keeps 78.57% of the initial capacitance. It demonstrates the synthesized products present a great potential in future flexible micro/nano energy systems.
