NiMn2O4 (NMO) nanoparticles (NPs) with a cubic spinel structure have been synthesized via the sol–gel method. The surface morphology study explored the porous nature of the NMO NPs. The compositional analysis displayed the constituent elements Ni, Mn, and O in NMO NPs. Electrochemical properties of the electrodes prepared from NMO NPs are investigated in 1 M KOH, 1 M NaOH, and 1 M Na2SO4 electrolytes. At a scan rate of 5 mVs−1, a specific capacitance of 658 Fg−1is obtained for the NMO-Ni foam electrodes in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. At a current density of 0.5 mAcm−2, the determined values of specific energy and specific power for the NMO-Ni foam electrodes are 13.4 Whkg−1 and 523.8 Wkg−1, respectively, in 1 M NaOH electrolyte. The NMO-Ni foam electrodes showed 96.4 % capacitance retention in 1 M NaOH for 1000 cycles.
