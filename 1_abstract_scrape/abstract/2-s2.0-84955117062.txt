In this study, graphene sheets (G1) were prepared by thermal reduction of graphite oxide. The carbonaceous composites were prepared by blending the G1 with KOH activated mesophase carbon microbeads (MCMB) by various ratios and were used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The texture characteristics of carbonaceous composites were determined by using nitrogen adsorption and desorption analysis. The morphology and crystal structures of graphene were observed by XRD, FE-SEM, and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical characterizations are performed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and AC impedance in a three-electrode system. The specific capacitances of the activated MCMB (KM) and graphene composite (KM-G1-2) with 33% graphene were determined as 126 and 130 Fg-1, at a scan rate of 5 mVs-1 and current density of 0.5 Ag-1, respectively. At a high current density of 10 Ag-1, however, the specific capacitances of the composites with different mixing ratios are almost the same. This implies that the electrochemical reaction is only occurred in the surface layers of the electrode materials.
