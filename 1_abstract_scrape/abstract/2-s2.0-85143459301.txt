The electrochemical properties of metal oxides are very attractive and fascinating in general, making them a potential candidate for supercapacitor application. Vanadium oxide is of particular interest because it possesses a variety of valence states and is also cost effective with low toxicity and a wide voltage window. In the present study, vanadium oxide nanorods were synthesized using a modified sol–gel technique at low temperature. Surface morphology and crystallinity studies were carried out by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. To the best of our knowledge, the as-prepared nanorods were tested with magnesium ion based polymer gel electrolyte for the first time. The prepared supercapacitor cell exhibits high capacitance values of the order of ~ 141.8 F g−1 with power density of ~ 2.3 kW kg−1 and energy density of ~ 19.1 Wh kg−1. The cells show excellent rate capability and good cycling stability.
