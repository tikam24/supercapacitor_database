In this paper, we used a simple process of anodization fabrication TiO 2, TiO 2, TiO 2-MoO 3, and TiO 2-Ta 2O 5 nanotubes. Those high dielectric constant and large surface area of NT materials are suitable used for the ultracapacitors. Based on the nanotube structural characteristics such as pore diameter, porosity, and tube length, we also investigated and calculated the NT specific capacitance.
