Multifunctional structural energy storage composites have gained an increasing interest as they offer volume and weight savings in different military and civilian applications. Current engineering approach is to develop structural energy storage materials having ability to perform energy storage and load bearing functions simultaneously. Energy storage composites have ability to simultaneously store electrical energy and bear mechanical loads. We have successfully fabricated structural fiber reinforced polymer composites that can simultaneously store electrochemical energy and withstand structural loads. Structural supercapacitors are fabricated by using graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs)/aerogel composite modified carbon fibers as electrodes and reinforcement, filter paper as a separator and multifunctional epoxy resin as an electrolyte and matrix. The structural supercapacitors were prepared by using resin infusion under flexible tooling (RIFT) method. The increasing concentrations of graphene nanoplatelets in carbon aerogels boost the electrochemical and shear performance of structural supercapacitors. A structural supercapacitor with an energy density of 0.8 Wh. kg-1, power density of 108 W.kg-1 and a normalized shear modulus of 2.6 GPa has been displayed in the current study.
