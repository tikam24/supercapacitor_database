Supercapacitor activated carbon (SC-AC) is a novel activated carbon material that has super large specific surface area, mesopore-rich structure and high capacitance. In this text, this supercapacitor material was used to modify carbon cloth anode to enhance the performance of urine-powered microbial fuel cell (UMFC). The measurements showed that both the specific surface area and the electrical conductivity were increased significantly after modification. The synergistic reaction of high specific surface area and high capacitance made the number of microbes attached to carbon cloth modified with SC-AC (SC-AC/CC) was far larger that of the blank carbon cloth (CC). The maximum power densities of the UMFC assembled SC-AC/CC anode was 555.10 mWâ€¢m -2 which was 1.8 times higher than that of the blank anode. These findings demonstrate that these novel super capacitor materials modified anode can be used in UMFCs, and effectively improve their performance.
