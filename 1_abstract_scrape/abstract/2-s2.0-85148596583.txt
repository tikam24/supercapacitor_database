Polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most promising conducting polymers to be used in several applications, owing to its easily synthesized, high surface area, cost-effectiveness, and tremendous electrical conductivity. In this research, 1% toluene-4-sulfonic acid monohydrate (PTSA) doped PANI film was fabricated using twelve different concentrations from 0.5 to 6 wt % contents of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a solvent since the amount of NMP is still a vital aspect to recognize optimum combination. The chemical, optical, thermal, morphological, and electrical conductivity properties are investigated through Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, thermal gravity analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Breuneur–Emmet–Teller (BET), then the four-point probe method. The existence of a hydrogen (H) bonding association between the C=O functional group within NMP and the N–H functional group throughout the PANI films will be shown using FT-IR analysis. Bandgap and PL intensity decreased with increasing NMP concentrations. FE-SEM displays the high-quality morphology of PANI can be achieved by increasing NMP concentrations. The specific electrical conductivity of prepared samples did not significantly change. The 1% PTSA and 3% NMP doped PANI is introduced as optimized PANI film with a low bandgap value of 2.54 (eV), high PL intensity, high specific surface area value of 121.457 (m2/g), and stable conductivity value of 2.45 (Ω cm)−1 owing to the arranged design of benzenoid and quinoid parts in its structure which seems a proper candidate to improve PANI film properties for use in sensing and supercapacitor applications.
