Recently, electrochemical supercapacitor has drawn more attention because of its superior electrochemical properties including larger life cycle, higher specific capacitance, and larger specific power. The supercapacitor is also able to fill the energy and power gap between battery and traditional capacitor. The supercapacitor has been considered suitable as an energy storage device for next-generation higher power applications. The ultracapacitor design using nanostructure-based electrode materials has provided better electrochemical properties. This review article gives a brief overview about the latest research trends on metal oxides nanostructure-based electrode materials for ultracapacitors and, in addition, highlights the nanomaterial effect on the electrode properties of ultracapacitors, which gives guidance in developing high-performance next-generation ultracapacitors.
