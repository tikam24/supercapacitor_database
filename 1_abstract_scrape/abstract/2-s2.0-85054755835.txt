In this paper, the influence of unbalanced load on DC microgrid was analyzed firstly, then a super capacitor based DC bus voltage ripple suppression method was proposed under unbalanced load, and a current control strategy of the super capacitor was designed using the sliding mode control (SMC) to quickly and precisely track the reference current. Super-twisting algorithm of the second order SMC was employed to avoid chattering. And stability along with robustness of the proposed control system were analyzed. Furthermore, considering the most serious condition of unbalanced load, parameters design of the super capacitor based compensation device was given. Finally, real-time simulations were carried out based on RT-LAB to verify the theoretical analysis and the proposed control strategy.
