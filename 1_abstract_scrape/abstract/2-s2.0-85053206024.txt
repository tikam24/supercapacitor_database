Electrogenerated π-conjugated microporous polymer network (CMPN) thin films are potential materials for highly sensitive detection of harmful chemical species as they show fast response, high signal amplification, and easy fabrication of devices. In the last few years, several CMPN thin films from carbazolyl and thienyl monomer building blocks having a variety of aromatic cores have been reported for different applications including organic electronics, electrochemical supercapacitors, chemical sensors. This article reviews the approaches toward the preparation of electrogenerated CMPN thin films and their application in electrochemical and fluorescence quenching–based sensing of nitroaromatics, metal ions, etc.
