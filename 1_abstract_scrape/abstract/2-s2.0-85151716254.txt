Supercapacitors are energy storage devices that are designed on the mechanism of ion adsorption from an electrolyte due to its greater surface area of the electrode materials. Supercapacitor performance has significantly improved over last decade as electrode materials have been tailored at the nanometer scale and electrolytes have achieved a significant interest, supporting more effective storage mechanisms. Desolvation of the ions effects in remarkably high capacitances in carbon-based materials with nanopores. The pseudo-capacitive effect is caused by surface redox reactions in oxide materials. Understanding the storage mechanisms underlying charge storage in these materials is important for sustainable development of supercapacitors in the future. We summarize current progress in understanding the charge storage mechanism in carbon- and oxide-based supercapacitors, and also challenges that still need to be overcome in order to build better supercapacitors.
