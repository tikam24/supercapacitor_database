Nanoporous metal oxides (NMOs) have attracted a substantial research interest in energy storage applications. They have reported beneficial structural, morphological, and electronic properties along with high capacitance values for supercapacitor applications. Usually, porous materials are synthesized using traditional template methods, but they are high-cost and low-throughput methods, which cannot be scaled up for mass production. On the other side, the chemical methods like chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal, sol gel, and electrodeposition for the development of porous metal oxides emerged the field with enormous possibilities. Chemical methods provide atomic-level control for the reaction, and they can be commercialized for large-scale production. Further, to be an ideal candidate for supercapacitor applications, we need to design controlled synthesis to attain high surface area and useful porous structure. This chapter will briefly discuss traditional processing methodologies for porous materials, their limitations, and the development of various chemical methods with their advantages for developing efficient NMO for supercapacitor applications. The prospects and limitations of these methods for developing efficient porous materials will be discussed in detail.
