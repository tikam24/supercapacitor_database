Implementation of bio-waste as activated carbon precursor is the best strategy for preparation of low cost, ecofriendly and high performance supercapacitor electrode. Foregoing research work introduces simple physical activation for preparation of hierarchically porous activated carbon. The fish scale carbon shows enhanced specific capacitance of 195 Fg−1 at 0.25 Ag−1 with high cyclic stability of 25,000 cycles at 4 Ag1 followed by great capacitance retention. Additionally, two electrode pouch cell delivers maximum volumetric capacitance of 259 Fcm−3 at specific capacitance of 88 Fg−1 and shows excellent 100% capacitance retention over 10,000 cycles. Interestingly fabricated symmetric cell delivers highest energy density and power density of 15 Whkg−1 and 2200 Wkg−1 respectively. FSC exhibits attractive properties which are combination of plentiful porous structure, heteroatom self-doping and physicochemical stability, also in accordance of electrochemical performance fish scales are promising precursor for high performance carbon electrode material.
