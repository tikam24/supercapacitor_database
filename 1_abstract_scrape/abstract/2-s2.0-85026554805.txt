The activated carbon particles made of Kastanien nuts were applied to the EDLC electrodes by using an alkaline activation method. The capacitance and internal resistance of the assembled EDLC cell were measured with 34% KOH water Electrolyte. The density of capacitance of Kastanien nut cells was approximately 30F/cm3 (4.1Wh/L) in the EDLC cell. The density of capacitance of Kastanien nut cells achieved 1.8 times one of charcoal cells. The surface area per unit weight of activated Kastanien nut particles is also more than 2 times as wide as charcoal. It shows that the density of capacitance of EDLC cells is strongly dependent on the base material of activated carbon.
