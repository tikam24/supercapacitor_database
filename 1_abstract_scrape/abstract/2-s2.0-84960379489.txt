The ionic performances for the mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) were investigated for supercapacitor electrolyte. The usage of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethylcarbonate (DMC) as organic solvent could solve some problems of acetonitrile (AN). The general aim of present paper is compare to properties of electrochemical properties based on two mixed organic electrolytes. The ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical performances of EC/DMC+0.1 M TEABF4 mixtures were determined. The ionic conductivity of the electrolytes was measured by AC impedance, and the capacitative performances of the electrolytes were evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry.
