This paper prepared PANI-PPy/polyester fabric through surface modification on polyester fabric by using solution polymerization method, and the resultant fabric was used as the electrode material of supercapacitor. It systematically studied the influence law of monomer concentration change during copolymerization of aniline and pyrrole on the micro-morphology, crystallization, chemical structure and electrochemical properties of PANI-PPy/polyester fabric. The research shows that PANI-PPy copolymer can improve the electrochemical performance of the polymer fabric to some extent. When the monomer concentration ratio of aniline to pyrrole is 0.75:0.25, the specific surface area of the copolymer on polyester surface reaches the largest. When the current density is 2 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance of PANI-PPy/polyester fabric is up to 1 046.26 mF/cm2, and at this time the conductivity and electrochemical performance of the modified fabric are the best. This study indicates the resultant fabric is a good electrode material for supercapacitor with good application prospect.
