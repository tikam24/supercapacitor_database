MXene based composites are promising candidates with a broad range of potential applications, especially in electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of a novel MXene/N–CuMe2Pc (non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted copper (II) phthalocyanine) based composite as the electrode material in supercapacitors. The integration of highly redox-active N–CuMe2Pc into MXene leads to the large surface area, which enhances the active sites for electrochemical redox reactions. For instance, composite prepared with a weight ratio of 1:0.2 of MXene:N–CuMe2Pc (M10P2) exhibits remarkable maximum specific capacitance of 786.1 F g−1. The enhanced capacitance performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of water intercalated MXene layers and N–CuMe2Pc. The constructed M10P2 based symmetric supercapacitor shows excellent performance with a maximum energy density of 8.84 Wh kg−1 with a power density of 112.3 W kg−1. Additionally, the symmetric device exhibits outstanding cyclic stability (92.3%) even after 20,000 cycles with satisfactory Coulombic efficiency. This work proves the new insight of preparation of MXene/N–CuMe2Pc composites for high-performance next-generation supercapacitor sectors in the near future.
