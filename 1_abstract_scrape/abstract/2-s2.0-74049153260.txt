A nanocomposite electrode of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on gold was fabricated to improve the specific capacitance and power density of the conventional supercapacitor. The novel supercapacitor built from MWCNTs and gold electrode showed a very high specific capacitance of 92.74 F/g using cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 10 mV/s, and 96.43 F/g was measured at 100 Hz. This nanocomposite electrode greatly enhanced the utilization efficiency of supercapacitor electrode material, low material cost and provided both high capacitance and power density. It was shown that the nanocomposite electrode based on vertically aligned carbon nanotube electrode had the characteristics of high specific capacitance.
