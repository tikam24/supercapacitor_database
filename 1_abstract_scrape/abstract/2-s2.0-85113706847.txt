While significant advances have been made in the synthesis of core-/multi-shell materials, the synthetic process usually involves a soft/hard template and complicated procedures. In particular, it is extremely difficult to fabricate single-component core-shell structures for nickel sulfides (NSs) with a controlled phase. In this work, we demonstrate a novel facile method to synthesize a single-component β-NiS ball-in-ball microsphere. The ball-in-ball structure is easily obtained by uniquely employing 2-mercaptopropionic acid (2-MPA) as the sulfur source and ethanol as the solvent based on the Ostwald ripening process. In particular, our work demonstrates that the chemical structure of sulfur sources and solvents plays a key role in the formation of the pure β-NiS ball-in-ball structure. When used as an electrode active material, the β-NiS ball-in-ball microspheres exhibit two times stronger specific capacity and three times higher rate performance than NSs produced by a hydrothermal method. The fabricated NS-2//rGO asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) displays an energy density of 46.4 W h kg-1 at a power density of 799.0 W kg-1 and good cycling performance. Thus, this study provides a new method for controlling the phase and morphology of NSs.
