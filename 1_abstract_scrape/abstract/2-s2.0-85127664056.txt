In this paper, a hybrid energy management system (HEMS) based on an edge processing scheme is presented. This HEMS is considered for deployment in the electric transportation industry which is a major sector for energy management applications. This approach paves the way for the emerging convergence of energy management systems (EMS) and intelligent applications. In this proposed scheme, the HEMS is integrated with edge processing to realize its intelligent and sustainable deployment. The HEMS is tested on a designed simulation platform and is re-deployed on an edge device for model verification. The implemented HEMS utilizes a battery and ultra-capacitor pack as the source. The battery pack and the ultra-capacitor pack have a rated maximum voltage of 50.4 V each.
