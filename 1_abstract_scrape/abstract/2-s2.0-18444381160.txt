Researchers at the University of California, Davis (UCD), US are exploiting carbon nanotubes in order to develop supercapacitor electrodes with huge surface areas. It is believed that the development of carbon nanotubes will deliver a significant hike in power density. The researchers are using chemical vapor deposition to grow multi-wall nanotubes, after which hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid clean the nanotubes and remove the impurities. It is believed that this technique developed is suitable for mass production with high power delivery performance.
