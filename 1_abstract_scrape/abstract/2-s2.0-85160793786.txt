Due to resource depletion and growing environmental consciousness, the world’s economic system and ecology face major challenges as a result of the energy consumption’s complete reliance on fossil fuels. The creation of alternative energy conversion or storage technologies with high power and energy densities represents a practical energy storage option. The creation of energy storage technology may greatly benefit from the use of activated carbon (AC) made from residual biomass. The surface area and porosity of AC (P5002) produced from Citrullus lanatus with a 1:2 ratio of H3PO4 increased. Additionally, P5002 as a supercapacitor (SC) electrode showed good electrochemical performance in 1 M KOH, with a specific capacitance of 138 F g–1, which is higher than commercial AC (80 F g–1). According to the research, AC made from biomass may be used as a precursor to create high-performance, inexpensive AC electrode materials for SCs.
