This work reports a unique structure, CuOx@C bead-like nanowire array, which can be synthesized easily on Cu substrates by a two-step reaction. The unique structure can be described as a large number of small CuOx nanoparticles enwrapped inside the carbon nanowires, while some big bead-like CuOx nanoparticles coated by an approximately 2 nm carbon layer hung at the nanowires. A possible mechanism is proposed to explain the growth of the CuOx@C bead-like nanowire array. Furthermore, the CuOx@C bead-like nanowire array exhibited a good electrochemical performance and a good stability as supercapacitor electrode.
