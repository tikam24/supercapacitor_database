In the present times, researchers have established the use of nanomaterials for a variety of purposes. Whether it is engineering or biomedical or environmental science, they have proved to be of great utility and also have better performance than their macrosized counterparts. The extensive range of applications of these nanomaterials is mainly because of their easily tunable structure and combined properties. Properties such as conductivity, magnetism, and photocatalysis proved their applicability and utility at various levels in human life. The current chapter emphasizes such applications and the effectiveness of these nanomaterials for sustainable industrial applications. Some of the applications such as energy storage and conversion viz. Some of the applications like supercapacitor, batteries, fuel cell, solar cell, etc.; pollutant treatment and recycling of wastes are well-known will be discussed about nanomaterials. The chapter will also discuss the aspects of problems and plausible solutions during the application with a detailed analysis for future prospective.
