We have reported the synthesis of methyl cellulose-based biopolymer electrolyte incorporated with ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide varying from 10 to 100wt% with respect to biopolymer. Detailed studies like polarized optical microscopy (POM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dielectric constant, and impedance spectroscopy were analyzed in detail. The maximum ionic conductivity was attained at 60wt%. IL incorporated with MC polymer which shows maximum conductivity value of 1.93 × 10−2 S/cm. Finally, we have fabricated an EDLC and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using maximum IL-doped MC which shows high specific capacitance value of 38 F/g and efficiency of 0.46% at 1 sun condition, respectively.
