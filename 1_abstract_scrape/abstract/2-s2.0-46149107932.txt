New consumer requirements to modern cars have resulted in developing an integrated starter-generator. This multifunctional and multiconnected system is of great interest for commercial application. The results of this integrated starter-generator modeling in the starter and generator modes are given in this paper. The realization of the proposed control circuit is described on a mathematical model.
