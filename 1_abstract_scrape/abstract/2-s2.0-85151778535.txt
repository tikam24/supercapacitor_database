High performance Mn0.2Co0.8 layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based binder free supercapacitor symmetric electrode is fabricated via single step electrochemical deposition. The synthesized Mn0.2Co0.8 electrode shows specific capacitance of 370.58–141.17 F/g (315–120 C/g) at 2–40 A/g within potential range −0.45–0.4 V along with 172.72% capacitance retention for 9000 GCD cycles. Additionally, a symmetric supercapacitor is also made utilizing Mn0.2Co0.8 LDH both as cathode and anode. The high potential of synthesized electrode as a supercapacitor material is shown by achieving a specific capacitance of 106.91–34.57 F/g at 0.5–3 A/g within a cell voltage of 0 to 0.8 V, as well as outstanding cyclic stability over 5000 GCD cycles. Red LEDs are used to analyze the real world application of the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor for energy storage and it is assumed that the future portable electrical systems and gadgets might benefit from the device based on the reported material and synthesis technique.
