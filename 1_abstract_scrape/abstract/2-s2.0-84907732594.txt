A layered structure Ni-based MOF was synthesized and, for the first time, was used as the electrode material for a supercapacitor. It exhibited large specific capacitance, high rate capability and cycling stability. Capacitances of 1127 and 668 F g-1 can be achieved at rates of 0.5 and 10 A g-1, respectively. At the same time, over 90% performance was retained after 3000 cycles. These excellent electrochemical properties may be related to the intrinsic characteristics of Ni-based MOF materials.
