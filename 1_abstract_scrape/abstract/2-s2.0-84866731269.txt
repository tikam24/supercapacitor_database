This paper presents supercapacitor ageing as a function of voltage, temperature and charge/discharge cycling solicitations. To investigate their effects, a test bench of accelerated supercapacitor calendar and cycling ageing was carried out. Experimental tests are performed at constant temperature when the supercapacitors are polarized at the maximum voltage in the case of calendar ageing. In the case of cycling test, supercapacitors are charged and discharged at constant current. It can be noted that when the supercapacitors are charged and discharged at constant current the temperature of the supercapacitor increases and that the average voltage is not zero. To quantify the supercapacitor ageing, the equivalent series resistance (ESR) and the equivalent capacitance (C) are measured. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
