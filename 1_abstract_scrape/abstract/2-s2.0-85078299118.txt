The electrospinning and calcinations were employed to synthesis a series of GdxSr1-xNiO3 (x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1) porous nanofibers (GSN-x). In the issue, the morphologies of nanofibers intriguingly changed from tight fibrous (GSN-1 and 0.9) to rough porous (GSN-0.7 and 0.5) fibers and then brambles (GSN-0.3) as the ratio of Sr increased from 0 to 0.7. The obtained GSN-0.7 possesses the prominent performance as an electrode material in supercapacitor application which is positively influenced by the maximal surface area (15.73 m2 g−1) and rational pore diameter (3.68 nm). The GSN-0.7 reveals considerable voltage window (-1-1 V) and better specific capacitances than other GSN-x materials, which reach up to 928.82 F·g−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 and 764.06 F·g−1 in 1 M KOH at a current density of 1 A·g−1. In addition, the AC//GSN-0.7 device shows a high energy density of 53.8 Wh·kg−1 and the corresponding power density of 1 kW kg−1 at 1 A g−1, and a high power density of 20 kW kg−1 and the corresponding energy density of 19.4 Wh·kg−1 at 20 A g−1. Therefore, our study could be of great potential in synthesizing porous perovskite-type oxide nanofibers and electrode materials of supercapacitor.
