The high-purity precursor material Ti3AlC2 was prepared via in situ sintering technology with mixed powders of titanium, aluminum, graphite and a small amount of tin as raw material by changing the ratio of powders and sintering time. Then the precursor material Ti3AlC2 was subjected to selective etching with concentrated hydrofluoric acid, and finally massive material of layered Ti3C2 with adjustable layer spacing was prepared by changing the etching time. The microstructure and microscopic morphology of the layer spacing of Ti3AlC2 and Ti3C2 were characterized by X-ray diffractometer and field emission scanning electron microscopy and their electrochemical performance was comparatively assessed. Among others, the specific capacity of the present prepared electrode under the same condition is greatly improved, showing good performance of supercapacitor.
