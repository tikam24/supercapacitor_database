In today's erudite world, the energy demand is increasing each day. Hence, it is necessary to manufacture novel electrode materials to store electric energy. Nickel, and bismuth, are considered to be the best member of a group of anodes in energy storage applications. In this study, we have synthesized bismuth, nickel based oxide material by the simple and most versatile hydrothermal synthesis method. As prepared Bi12NiO19 is directly grown on nickel foam and tested its applicability for the supercapacitor. The prepared material was characterized using techniques viz TEM, XRD, EDS, FESEM, XPS, etc. whereas electrochemical characterization viz cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charging-discharging (GCD) were investigated using 1 M aqueous electrolyte (KOH). The areal capacitance of the prepared electrode at 1 mA/cm2 current density was 137.5 mF/cm2 achieved with the 347.18 × 10−3 W/cm2 power density and energy density of 22.7610−3 Wh/cm2. The 5000 charge-discharge cycles were performed with excellent capacitance retention.
