Optimization of mass loading and intrinsic structure of polypyrrole (PPy) materials plays decisive roles in the development of energy storage systems to meet the increasing requirements. A di-oxidant sandwich-type polymerization (designated as DOSP) method was developed to synthesize PPy on the surface of CNTs@wool felt to construct composites (CNTs/PPy-2@wool) by using FeCl3∙6H2O and MnO2 as di-oxidant. Under acidic conditions, MnO2 acts as both a sacrificial template and oxidant to initiate the polymerization of pyrrole (Py) monomers on its freshly activated surface to obtain CNTs/PPy-2@wool. Furthermore, MnO2 could effectively adsorb Py monomers, and the adsorbed Py monomers were oxidatived to PPy, resulting in the efficient adsorption and high mass loading of PPy (13.44 mg cm−2) on the CNTs@wool felt surface. As a result, the CNTs/PPy-2@wool electrode showed an areal capacitance of 2303.9 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.25 mA cm−2 in 1 M H2SO4 solution, delivering a max energy density of 204.79 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 457.93 μW cm−2. Moreover, the device exhibited good rate capability with capacitance retentions over 65% when the current density increased from 0.25 mA cm−2 to 2 mA cm−2 and a long-term life with 84.29% of initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The potential application of the proposed CNTs/PPy@wool felt as electrode materials for various integrated energy storage devices.
