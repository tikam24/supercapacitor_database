This work reports on a finding of mT magnetic field induced energy storage enhancement of MnO2-based supercapacitance electrodes (magneto-supercapacitor). Electrodes with MnO2 electrochemically deposited at electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNFs) film are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and life cycle stability tests in the presence/absence of milli-Tesla (mT) magnetic fields derived by Helmholtz coils. In the presence of a 1.34 mT magnetic field, MnO2/ECNFs shows a magneto-enhanced capacitance of 141.7 F g−1 vs. 119.2 F g−1 (∼19% increase) with absence of magnetic field at a voltage sweeping rate of 5 mV s−1. The mechanism of the magneto-supercapacitance is discussed and found that the magnetic susceptibility of the MnO2 significantly improves the electron transfer of a pseudo-redox reaction of Mn(IV)/Mn(III) at the electrode, along with the magnetic field induced impedance effect, which may greatly enhance the interface charge density, facilitate electrolyte transportation, and improve the efficiency of cation intercalation/de-intercalation of the pseudocapacitor under mT-magnetic field exposure, resulting in enhancement of energy storage capacitance and longer charge/discharge time of the MnO2/ECNFs electrode without sacrificing its life cycle stability.
