The conducting polypyrrole (PPy) spherical nanoparticles are synthesized by a facile electrochemical deposition method and the polymerization is carried out by potentiostatic methods using a two-electrode system (Au electrode) with a template-free method. The microstructure of the PPy spherical nanoparticles and their electrochemical properties can be tuned by controlling the electrodeposition time and anodic potential in the synthetic process. A maximum specific capacitance of 356 F/g is obtained for as-prepared PPy electrodes from cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, which is superior or close to some individual PPy nanostructure, PPy/metal, and PPy/carbon materials. Also, the stability of cycling can retain 89.3% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The capability of fabricating stable polymer electrodes is expected to make an important contribution to the promotion of supercapacitor technology.
