We report the easy synthesis of porous graphene nanosheets (PGNs) using the etching of graphene sheets by MnO2. An electrode made from PGNs exhibits a specific capacitance of 154 F g-1 at 500 mV s-1 in 6 M KOH compared to a value of 67 F g-1 for graphene nanosheets, and a low capacitance loss of 12% after 5000 cycles. Interestingly, PGN electrode material shows an excellent rate capability due to its open layered and mesopore structures that facilitate the efficient access of electrolytes to the electrode material and shorten the ion diffusion pathway through the porous sheets. This approach offers the potential for cost-effective, environmentally friendly and large-scale production of PGNs. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
