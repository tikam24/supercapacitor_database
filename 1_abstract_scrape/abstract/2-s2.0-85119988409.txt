The International Biochar Initiative classifies biochar as “a solid material derived from the carbonization of biomass.” Biochar is a solid substance produced during the thermochemical degradation of biomass. This paper describes several examinations that have been conducted to investigate novel utilization of biomass since biochar is affordable, environmentally beneficial, and can be utilized for diverse purposes, such as soil stabilization, wastewater treatment, greenhouse gas management and power generation. Biochar has also been applied in fuel cells and supercapacitors, according to the latest reports. Biochar has the potential to be new and tenable material for microbial fuel cell electrodes. Biochar MFCs made through pyrolysis and gasification, exhibited significant performance as compared to activated carbon and graphite granule. This paper emphasizes the use of biochar as electrodes in MFCs to facilitate the simultaneous treatment of wastewater and electricity generation while also providing additional commercial advantages. Applications of biochar in microbial fuel cells as separator membrane and cathode catalysts are also mentioned. Brief information on the future prospects of the use of biochar in microbial fuel cells is further summarized.
