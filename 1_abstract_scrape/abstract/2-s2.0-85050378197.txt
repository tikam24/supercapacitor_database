The thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRG) composites with various interlayer distances were synthesized. These TRG sheets are intercalated with anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to prevent the restacking between TRG sheets. A facile approach is employed to enlarge the interlayer distance between the TRG sheets by the Coulomb force interaction between the intercalated surfactants and the ionic liquids. A systematic investigation of the morphology and the electrical performances of these EDLC cells was carried out. It was found that the energy density of the cells is improved from 34.9 to 61.8 Wh/kg at 1 A/g suggesting that the increased interlayer distance could enlarge the accessible surface area for the ionic liquid electrolyte.
