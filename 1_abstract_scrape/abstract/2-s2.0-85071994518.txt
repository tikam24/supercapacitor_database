Nickel cobalt selenides derived from metal organic framework have allured a lot of attention in energy storage areas. Herein, Nickel cobalt selenides (H-Ni-Co-Se) nanoarrays with hollow structure from pentagon-like Ni/Co-ZIF are successfully assembled on Ni-foam by employing sequential chemical etching and selenylation strategy. The hollow configuration grown on Ni-foam could offer rich electroactive region, shorten charge/ion diffusion length and enhance mass/electrons transfer. The as-prepared H-Ni-Co-Se delivers a favorable specific capacitance of 1175 F/g at 1 A/g, fast charge/discharge rate and excellent long-term stability. This versatile strategy can be extended to construct other transition metal compounds with outstanding electrochemical performance.
