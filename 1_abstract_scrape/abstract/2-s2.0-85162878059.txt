Design of binder-free electrode with high performance exhibits great glamour for energy storage devices recently. Herein, nickel cobalt layered double hydroxide (NiCo LDH) has been directly grown on carbon fiber paper (CFP) by an electrodeposition method. Thanks to the porous nanosheet-like morphology of the deposits, the high conductivity of carbon fibers, as well as the strong connection between the deposits and the substrate, the optimized electrode, labeled as NiCo LDH-2/CFP can deliver a discharge specific capacitance of 878.4 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which can increase to 1080.0 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, exhibiting excellent rate performance. Moreover, after cycled at 5 A g−1 for 5000 cycles, the capacitance of the electrode can retain 96.1%, manifesting unique cyclic stability. This work provides a new strategy for preparing high performance binder-fee electrodes for supercapacitors, lithium batteries and catalytes.
