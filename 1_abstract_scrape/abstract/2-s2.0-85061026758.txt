In this contribution, we reported the preparation of a novel conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH) by a sol-gel method, which was subsequently employed to fabricate a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor device. Taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the different components in the conducting polymer hydrogel and the merits of the proposed synthesis strategies, the prepared supercapacitor device with CPH as electrode exhibited high area-normalized capacitance (2.2 F cm −2 ), high gravimetric capacitance (1573.6 F g −1 ) as well as high energy density of 0.18 mWh cm −2 (or 128.7 Wh Kg −1 ) at 0.08 mW cm −2 (or 55.1 W kg −1 ). This study did not only represent a novel all-solid-state, high performance, flexible supercapacitor with potential applications in flexible energy-related devices, but also developed a new method for enhancing capacitances and mechanical stability of all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor.
