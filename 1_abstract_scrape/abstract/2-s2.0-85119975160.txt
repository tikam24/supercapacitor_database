This work explores the synergistic advantage of the lignocellulose chemistry of oil palm fiber, empty fruit bunch, and oil palm shell as a composite in activated carbon preparation using physical and chemical activation methods. Using coin cell CR2032–3 V, supercapacitors were fabricated with the prepared activated carbon composite as electrode active material and H3PO4-based gel electrolyte. At a specific power density of 50 WKg−1, electric double-layer capacitors derived from chemically and physically activated carbon composite shows a specific energy density of 8.6 WhKg−1 and 5.8 WhKg−1, respectively. These results were observed to be better than the results of supercapacitors fabricated using liquid electrolytes. Apart from the better performance, the solid-state electric double layer capacitor is relatively lighter, allows miniaturization, flexibility, and mitigates liquid electrolyte leakage.
