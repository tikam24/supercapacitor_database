Improvement of the performance of renewable electronic devices is a crucial point for the consolidation of this emerging technology. Herein, we develop a supercapacitor based on cellulose, carbon nanotubes, and ionic liquids. A conductive paper prepared by simple acid hydrolysis of cellulose and carboxylated carbon nanotubes was used as an electrode. A cellulose sponge impregnated with 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide was used as a separator/electrolyte. Electrochemical tests were performed in a two-electrode cell that presented a specific capacitance of 34.37 F/g when considered the active mass and 97.9% of capacitance retention after 5000 charge/discharge cycles.
