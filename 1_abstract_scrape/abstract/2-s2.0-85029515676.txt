Herein we reported a novel routine to easily access graphene/polyaniline paper (GPp) as supercapacitor electrodes through controlled in-situ polymerization followed by roll coating. According to this routine, the load fraction of PANI can be easily controlled by feed ratio of aniline to GO. In the resulting GPp, PANI nanoarrays anchored graphene nanosheets and PANI nanofibers throughout the bulk coexist, and the former construct a three-dimensional network. As a result, the GPp as a freestanding electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. It can deliver a high capacitance up to 838 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g, while keeps high retention of 93.7% at 10 A/g over 5000 cycles. Kinetics analysis shows that the GPp stores both surface capacitance and diffusion capacitance, but the former dominates the latter.
