The starting and acceleration of the mine electric locomotive requires instantaneous high-power output of the power supply. The power density of lead-acid battery is low, which cannot meet the high-power demand of the mine electric locomotive. In order to make up for the shortage of the battery as a single power supply for the mine electric locomotive, A battery-supercapacitor hybrid storage system (HES) with lead-acid battery as main power supply and supercapacitor as auxiliary power supply is proposed. A multi-input DC/DC converter is adopted to control the output of the HES under different working conditions of the electric locomotive, and the bidirectional power control of the HES is realized. The simulation results show that the HES scheme plays a good role in driving and energy feedback of the mine electric locomotive.
