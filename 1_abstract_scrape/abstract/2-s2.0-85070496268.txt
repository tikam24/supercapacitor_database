MoO2 nanospheres are successfully synthesized by a simple ethylene glycol-assisted hydrothermal route. The formation process is associated with the dissolution-recrystallization mechanism under the ethylene glycol reduction, resulting in a unique structure of that solid MoO2 nanospheres assembled by many ultrafine primary nanoparticles. Benefiting from the hierarchical structural features, the MoO2 nanospheres electrode displays a higher specific capacitance (204.7 and 197.4 Fg-1 at 1 and 6 A g-1, respectively) and exhibits a significant superior cycling stability (the specific capacitance maintains 90.6% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g-1).
