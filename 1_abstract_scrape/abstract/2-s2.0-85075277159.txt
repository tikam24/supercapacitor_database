Since the discovery of Ti3C2 MXene in 2011, continuous research has been progressed in developing new MAX phases and extracting MXenes from them. The surface terminations such as -O, -OH, -F groups present on the MXene influence their properties to a wide extent. By controlling the inter-layer spacing between the MXene sheets and the number of MXene layers, their properties can be tuned greatly. Their 2D structure with unique compositions has helped them obtain properties that are useful in various fields of applications such as batteries, supercapacitors, photo and electrocatalysts, bio-sensors, gas-sensors, water purification, water splitting, lubricants, electronics, electromagnetic interference shielding and so on. This review focuses on the synthesis, properties and applications of MXenes outlining the current challenges and scope for future research.
