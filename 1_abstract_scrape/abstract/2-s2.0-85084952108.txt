Fast charge/discharge cycles are necessary for supercapacitors applied in vehicles including, buses, cars and elevators. Nanocomposites of graphene oxide with lanthanide oxides show better supercapacitive performance in comparison to any of them alone. Herein, Eu2O3nanorods (EuNRs) were prepared through the hydrothermal method and anchored onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by utilizing a sonochemical procedure (in an ultrasonic bath) through a self-assembly methodology. The morphologies of EuNRs and EuNR-RGO were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and IR spectroscopy. Then, we used EuNRs and EuNR-RGO as electrode materials to investigate their supercapacitive behavior using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. In a 3.0 M KCl electrolyte and with a scan rate of 2 mV s-1, EuNR-RGO exhibited a specific capacity of 403 F g-1. Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments demonstrated a specific capacity of 345.9 F g-1at a current density of 2 A g-1. The synergy between RGO's flexibility and EuNR's high charge mobility caused these noticeable properties.
