In order to increase the specific capacitance of carbon nanotubes (CNT), chemical polymerization method was used to prepare carbon nanotube-polyaniline (CNT-PANI) nanocomposite by coating polyaniline on the surface of the CNT. The product was characterized by transmission electron microscopy and infrared spectra. Cyclic voltammetry was also used to investigate its electrochemical properties. The performance of supercapacitors equipped with the CNT-PANI nanocomposite electrodes in 1 mol/L H2SO4 was evaluated by galvanostatic charge/discharge. A comparative analysis of the CNT was also conducted under similar conditions. At a current density of 10 mA/cm 2, the CNT-PANI nanocomposite exhibits high specific capacitance of 201 F/g, in comparison with a value of 52 F/g for the CNT. And supercapacitors based on the CNT-PANI nanocomposite have an energy density of 6.97 Wh/kg and an outstanding power performance.
