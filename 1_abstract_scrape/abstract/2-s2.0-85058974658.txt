A belt-like MnO2 nanomaterials is designed as cathode material to enable neutral aqueous, high energy density and ultra-long life asymmetric supercapacitor. The energy density and power density can reach as high as 33.8 Wh kg−1 and 5000 W kg−1 respectively even in the high-voltage region of 0–2 V. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits 91% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles indicating outstanding cycling property. The ultra-stability of the belt-like MnO2//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor makes it a promising device for large-scale applications.
