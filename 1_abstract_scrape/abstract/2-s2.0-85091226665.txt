In the present study, Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 electrode materials were prepared by CTAB assisted hydrothermal method. Thermal, crystalline and bonding properties of freshly prepared samples were confirmed by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), x-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman analyses. The surface morphological features of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 electrode materials were observed via Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The concentration of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) template has much influenced in nanomaterial formation and the high concentration (3 mM) of CTAB provides nanorod structures. The electrochemical analysis of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 electrodes were demonstrated via cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and cyclic stability analyses. The electrochemical investigations of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 electrode provide remarkable specific capacitance of 532 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and good cyclic stability of 98 % retention even after 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with good rate capability. These outcomes prompted to assign a probable application for the synthesized Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 to utilize as a capable electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
