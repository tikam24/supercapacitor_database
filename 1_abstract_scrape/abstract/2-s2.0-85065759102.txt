In the present work, nickel-trisubstituted imidazole complex, bis(2-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)phenoxy)nickel complex, abbreviated as NDIP was prepared by chemical method and its application as an electrode for supercapacitor was demonstrated. The structure and composition of the as-synthesized NDIP was confirmed by various spectral and analytical tools and further it was examined for its sensing and supercapacitor applications. NDIP coated working electrode delivered the specific capacitance of 712 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and capacitance retention of 87% upto 2000 GCD cycles. The developed sensor was explored to detect Uric Acid. The response for amperometric detection of UA on NDIP displayed a wide linear range (0.1 nm – 1031 μM)with low detection limit (0.412 μM). Furthermore, NDIP@GCE electrode showed a high selectivity and good responsiveness towards UA detection.
