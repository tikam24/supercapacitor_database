The proceedings contain 46 papers. The topics discussed include: a reliable energy management and generation scheduling model in microgrids using modified cuckoo search algorithm; synthesis of antenna arrays with flat-top pattern using conventional and random drift particle swarm optimization algorithms; implementation and study of high speed multimode digital modulator using ternary logic; a novel technique to detect the number of ground vehicles along with respective speed of each vehicle from a given video; a semi circular shaped UWB body area network antenna with C-band and WLAN band rejection; a new improved algorithm for optimal sizing of battery-supercapacitor based hybrid energy storage systems; techno economic feasibility analysis of hybrid energy system; and realization of adaptive beamforming in smart antennas on a reconfigurable architecture.
