Herein, we describe the synthesis of two highly crystalline, robust, hydrophilic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that display intrinsic proton conduction by the Grotthuss mechanism. The enriched redox-active azo groups in the COFs can undergo a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction for energy storage, making the COFs ideal candidates for pseudocapacitance electrode materials. After in situ hybridization with carbon nanotubes, the composite exhibited a high three-electrode specific capacitance of 440 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, among the highest for COF-based supercapacitors, and can retain 90 % capacitance even after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles. This is the first example using Grotthuss proton-conductive organic materials to create pseudocapacitors that exhibited both high power density and energy density. The assembled asymmetric two-electrode supercapacitor showed a maximum energy density of 71 Wh kg−1 with a maximum power density of 42 kW kg−1, surpassing that of all reported COF-based systems.
