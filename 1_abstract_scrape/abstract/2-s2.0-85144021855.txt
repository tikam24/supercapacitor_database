The demand of the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles that are highly used around the world has produced and continues to cause major environmental and human health concerns. This issue of transportation section needs to be addressed through shifting the use of fossil fuel for vehicles to green energy. Fuel cell is an appealing candidate for electric vehicle (EV), this is due to its high efficiency and the use of a clean input source such as hydrogen. The implementation of hybrid system like coupling between fuel cell and battery or supercapacitor for a drive application, affects on the system positively by enhancing its efficiency as well as improving the regenerative braking activity. Nevertheless, the hybridization of energy sources allows the benefit from the advantages of each source separately. The open-end winding induction motor (OEWIM) looks more attractive for the use of hybrid sources since it produces more switching redundancies as well as the induction motor receives its power from both terminals of the stator winding and not only from one end. The power distribution is not easy be managed the between these two sources, especially that the fuel cell is a unidirectional DC source, and the battery or supercapacitor are bidirectional sources which permit the charging and discharging activity. This paper will implement the power sharing algorithm that is able to control the activity of the charging and discharging between the sources. This will be investigated through a dual inverter fed an OEWIM using MATLAB-Simulink software.
