The capacitance performance exhibited by Graphene oxide/Tungsten Oxide substances is quite high in terms of potential supercapacitor applications. This study involves the synthesize of GO through Hummers Method and coating it on the substrates. Accordingly, thin film supercapacitor structures of GO/WO3 on ITO, FTO, PMMA and Glass substrates were successfully produced through CBD (Chemical Bath Deposition) method. Structural properties were characterized by XRD, SEM, AFM, ATR, and UV. I–V and C–V curves were investigated in the determined voltage range (from −0.2–1.2 V) at 25, 50, 75 and 100 mV/s various scanning potential. Regarding the maximum capacitance and energy intensity of the thin films, the maximum capacitance was 268.5 F/g and the energy intensity was calculated as 52.2 Wh/kg for glass/GO/WO3 thin film; the maximum capacitance was 259.7 F/g, and the energy intensity was calculated as 50.4 Wh/kg for PMMA/GO/WO3, the maximum capacitance was 158.5 F/g, and the energy intensity was calculated as 30.8 Wh/kg for FTO/GO/WO3, and finally the maximum capacitance was 106 F/g, and the energy intensity was calculated as 20.6 Wh/kg for ITO/GO/WO3.
