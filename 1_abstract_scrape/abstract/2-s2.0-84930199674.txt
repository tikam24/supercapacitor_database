Highly porous carbon microflakes (CMFs) with oxygen and nitrogen dual-doping were prepared from willow catkins by pyrolysis at 500 Â°C in nitrogen, followed by KOH activation and were used as a high-performance supercapacitor electrode material. The as-prepared CMFs with a thickness of 350 nm possess an incredibly high specific surface area of 3510 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and a large pore volume of 2.1 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. The CMFs exhibit a high specific capacitance (for a three-electrode system) of 372, 344 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> in 2 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> and 6 M KOH, respectively. The specific capacitance is 278 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> in a two-electrode system (2 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte). The CMFs electrode demonstrates good rate capability with retention of 79.6% (from 1 A g<sup>-1</sup> to 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and excellent cycling stability with 95% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. The CMFs symmetric device shows a high energy density of 9.5 W h kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 500 W kg<sup>-1</sup> in H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>.
