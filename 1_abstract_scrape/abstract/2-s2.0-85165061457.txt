Doping of graphene with variety of heteroatoms is presently focused for electrochemical supercapacitor applications because it functions as a hybrid supercapacitor. Herewith, we report the fabrication of Se-doped graphene with selenium dioxide using a supercritical fluid technique. Both the existence as well as the quantity of Se-doping in graphene are established using XPS and EDAX techniques. The Se-doped graphene derived from the weight ratio of selenium dioxide and graphene oxide of 1 : 3 resulted in an enriched gravimetric capacitance achieving 581 F g−1 (1 M H2SO4). The specific capacity of the optimised Se-doped graphene based symmetric supercapacitor in 0.01 M solution of ammonium metavanadate in 1 M H2SO4 solution is found to be 420 C g−1 and attained an improved capacitance retention of 85% over 50000 cycles along with 94% coulombic efficiency. The energy density of the Se-doped graphene symmetric supercapacitor is found to be 23.33 Wh kg−1 in 0.01 M solution of ammonium metavanadate in 1 M H2SO4 solution.
