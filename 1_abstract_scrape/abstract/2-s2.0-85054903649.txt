Nature-inspired strategies are extensively proposed as novel and effective routines to address challenges for eco-friendly and high-performance energy storage devices with high energy/power density and long cycling life. Inspired by synergistic functions and integrated form of a geologic architecture system (i.e., ground–mountain–vegetation), here a novel and hierarchical cellulose-supported Co@Co(OH)2 heterostructure based on a facile combined method of magnetron sputtering and electrooxidation is created. Thanks to the synergistic effects of this multiscale structure (i.e., the storage capacity of cellulose substrate (ground) for electrolyte ions, electron superhighway supplied by interlayered metallic Co (mountain), and ultrahigh electrochemical activity and mechanical stability of in situ grown and quasi-honeycomb Co(OH)2 (vegetation) with large surface area), the composite displays a high specific capacitance (642 mF cm−2/958 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2), excellent rate performance, and outstanding cycling stability (only 2.1% loss after 10 000 cycles), which are significantly superior to those of other microstructure designs of Co(OH)2-based electrodes. Also, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits highly competitive energy/power density (166 µW h cm−2 at 1.5 mW cm−2) and excellent cycling stability. Combined with the outstanding electrochemical properties, facile synthesis technology, environmental friendliness, and low cost, this ingenious nature-inspired composite holds great promise for green high-performance energy storage devices.
