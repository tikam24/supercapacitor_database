3D CoNi2S4-graphene-2D-MoSe2 (CoNi2S4-G-MoSe2) nanocomposite is designed and prepared using a facile ultrasonication and hydrothermal method for supercapacitor (SC) applications. Because of the novel nanocomposite structures and resultant maximized synergistic effect among ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets, highly conductive graphene and CoNi2S4 nanoparticles, the electrode exhibits rapid electron and ion transport rate and large electroactive surface area, resulting in its amazing electrochemical properties. The CoNi2S4-G-MoSe2 electrode demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 1141 F g−1, with capacitance retention of ≈108% after 2000 cycles at a high charge–discharge current density of 20 A g−1. As to its symmetric device, 109 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 is exhibited. This pioneering work should be helpful in enhancing the capacitive performance of SC materials by designing nanostructures with efficient synergetic effects.
