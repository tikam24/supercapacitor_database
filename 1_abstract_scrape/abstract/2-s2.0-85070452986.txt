this paper presents analysis of voltage active balancing method for energy storage system (ESS). It is studied power resonant DC-DC converter with voltage doubler synchronous rectifier (VDSR), used to equalize the voltage across series connected supercapacitor cells, which are part from ESS. In this application, high frequency transformer is used for galvanic isolation. The proposed converter ensures turn the primary side power MOSFET on in both zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS) modes and turns it off in ZVS mode. This will reduce the switching losses and improve the converter efficiency. The secondary side implemented VDSR is soft switched on and off (ZCS mode). Any known voltage balancing methods could be used to drive this resonant converter. For verification the simulations results, experimental research was done.
