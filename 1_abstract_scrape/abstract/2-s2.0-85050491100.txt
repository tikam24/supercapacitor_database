Porous activated carbon was successfully fabricated from bio waste-mango stone via a two-step chemical etching strategy. The optimized carbon material (denoted as MGKZ-2) displayed a high specific capacitance of 353.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a satisfactory rate capability in the three-electrode supercapacitor system. Moreover, MGKZ-2-based symmetric cell presented a high energy density of 27.6 Wh kg−1 at 159.9 W kg−1, as well as long-term cycling stability due to its hierarchical pores to offer large ion-accessible surface area, efficient ion diffusion and electron transport pathways.
