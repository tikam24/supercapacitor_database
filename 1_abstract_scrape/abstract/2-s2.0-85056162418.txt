Developing economical, highly active nonprecious metal electrocatalysts with good durability to substitute noble metal materials is critical for the application of energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, N, P co-doped porous carbon spheres (NPCS) derived from sepia were fabricated through the simple process of pyrolysis and activation in the presence of poly(bisphenoxy)phosphazene. The NPCS showed the preferable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in KOH solution with a half-wave potential of 0.90 V (vs RHE) and limiting current density of 6.05 mA cm-2, a longer stability, and better tolerance to methanol poison compared with a Pt/C catalyst. Efficient ORR activity in alkaline condition can be attributed to not only the abundant N, P dispersion but also the hierarchical porous morphology of the carbon spheres. Moreover, as supercapacitor electrode, the NPCS also displayed a high specific capacitance of 465.2 F g-1 with a robust durability up to 10 000 cycles. The method proposed here is expected to inspire the design and preparation of advanced electrode materials due to reasonable electrochemical performance, highly cost-effective, which highlights their promising applications in electrochemical energy technologies.
