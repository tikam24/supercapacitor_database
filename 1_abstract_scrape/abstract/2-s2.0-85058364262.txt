Here we demonstrate the scalable modulation of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) properties by regulating graphite oxide (GtO) precursors. Our findings show the thickness and loose degree of GtO precursors act as key roles in flame activation process. Interestingly, the looser GtO transforms into RGO with a lower specific surface area (SSA); RGO from the thinner GtO paper shows a higher SSA. By regulating GtO precursors, SSA from 1030.5 to 335.3 m2 g−1, defect degree, oxidation degree, and pore volume from 4.61 to 1.36 cm3 g−1 can be tuned. The corresponding structural properties are translated into unique supercapacitor (SC) performances such as high specific capacitance (the highest value of 576 F g−1) and coulombic efficiency. Additionally, this method indicates great potential to prepare RGO-based metal oxide composites with good homogeneity and good SC behaviors.
