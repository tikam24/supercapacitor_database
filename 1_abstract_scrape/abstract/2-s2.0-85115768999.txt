In view of the difficulty of traditional fibers in meeting the demand of current intelligent wearable devices, most existing composite fibers do not offer the appropriate electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, or energy storage capacity, this paper reviews the research progress in new two-dimensional transitional metal carbon/nitrogen compound (MXene) composite fibers used for intelligent wearables. Various preparation methods of MXene composite fibers (coating, double roll, electrospinning and wet spinning) were introduced, and the advantages as well as disadvantages of each method were analyzed. The applications of MXene composite fibers in electromagnetic shielding, supercapacitors, flexible sensors and other fields were systematically summarized. This paper also prospected the future development of MXene fibers in the field of intelligent wearable devices, providing new ideas for the research new generation of composite fibers with high electrical conductivity, excellent mechanical properties and high energy storage.
