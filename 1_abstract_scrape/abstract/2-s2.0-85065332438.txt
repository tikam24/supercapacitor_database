Extended range electric vehicle (EREV) as one type of new energy vehicle (NEV) can reduce emission compared to the traditional fuel vehicle, and also can increase the driving range compared to the pure electric vehicle (PEV), so it has recently become the focus of considerable attention among vehicle manufacturing companies and research institutions. This paper mainly explores the latest applications of various energy storage technologies for EREV, such as battery, ultra-capacitor (UC), flywheel, fuel cell, solar and hybrid power source (HPS). The characteristics of these energy storage technologies are also presented. It is obvious that the power source for EREV should have simultaneously high energy density and power density through comparative analysis, therefore, the HPS will have a good application prospect. Moreover, several common energy storage systems for EREV are deeply discussed. It is observed that power distribution is difficult to meet the high-efficiency requirements for all multiple operating conditions of vehicle and energy utilization ratio is still in a very low level for the conventional energy storage systems for EREV. In view of their shortcomings, a novel energy storage system for EREV is proposed, and several working modes of this novel energy storage system are described in detail. It can be seen that the novel energy storage system can meet the requirements of energy conversion and storage with high efficiency bi-directional power flow in motor driving system of EREV. Finally, the future development of EREV is forecasted and proposed, we think the future development of EREV will need to focus on low-power, low-emission and even zero-emission, highefficiency HPS.
