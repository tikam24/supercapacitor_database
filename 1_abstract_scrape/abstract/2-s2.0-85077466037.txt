In this work, a simple phosphating process was proposed to modify cellulose-acetate (CA) and lignin for a novel energy storage precursor material. The prepared precursor fibers exhibited good thermal stability of lignin and flexibility of CA. Subsequently, the precursor fibers undergo a short preoxidation and carbonization treatment process to obtain the biomass-based carbon fibers (CFs) with complete fibrous morphology, uniform fiber diameter, high surface areas, good flexibility, and excellent power storage capacity. The specific capacitance of 346.6 F/g was obtained by using CFs-5 (prepared with 40% H3PO4 content) as a supercapacitor. Simultaneously, the biomass-based CF supercapacitor device delivers a high-energy density of 31.5 Wh/kg at the power density of 400 W/kg. These results indicate that the introduction of H3PO4 can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the preoxidation treatment process for the preparation of the biomass-based CFs, while increasing the energy storage properties significantly. This novel strategy showed a successful route for the preparation of high-quality and low-consumption biomass-based CFs.
