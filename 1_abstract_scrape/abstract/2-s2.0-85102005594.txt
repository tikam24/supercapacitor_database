With the renewable energy broadly integrated into power grid, Energy Storage System (ESS) has become more and more indispensable. In this paper, a novel Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) based on Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) is proposed, which integrates both Super Capacitor (SC) and battery. Different from other topologies, batteries and SCs are allocated respectively at the sub-module (SM) and the DC side. The proposed HESS can be connected directly to the medium voltage AC bus without any transformer. Moreover, both high energy density and high power density are achieved in the single system, with flexible coordinated power regulating capability. Power control strategy and State of charge (SOC) balancing strategy for battery are also proposed for HESS, which are verified by PSCAD simulations in the results.
