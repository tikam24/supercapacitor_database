The nanostructure of metal oxides attracts great attention in the field of supercapacitors because of fast charge transport process. The hydrothermal method is used for development of NiCo2O4 nanostructure on carbon cloth as current collector backbone. The stepwise study of various structural, morphological and electrochemical properties of NiCo2O4 electrode is studied. The ultrasonic treatment is used to obtain nanowire-like morphology of NiCo2O4 which exhibits hierarchical nanostructure, which provides surface properties such as high surface area and appropriate pore capacity. NiCo2O4 nanostructure with specific capacitance of 1460 F g−1 with high electrochemical stability of 84% after 3000 cycles in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at 100 mV s−1. The electrochemical property shows NiCo2O4 is one of the potential candidates for energy storage application. The specific capacitance and energy density for NiCo2O4@CC//NiCo2O4@CC symmetric supercapacitor device is of 124 F g−1 and 16.18 Wh.kg−1, respectively at current density of 5 mA.
