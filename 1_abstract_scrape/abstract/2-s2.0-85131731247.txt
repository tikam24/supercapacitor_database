FeCo2O4 nanosheets were synthesized on nickel foam by hydrothermal + annealing method, and their structural and electrochemical properties were studied, systematically. As the cathode material for supercapacitors, FeCo2O4 nanosheets demonstrated the specific capacitance of 544 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g in 6 M KOH solution. The asymmetric supercapacitor composed of FeCo2O4 nanosheets and activated carbon exhibited good electrochemical performances (energy density of 66.8 Wh/kg at 0.5 A/g) and long cycle life (76.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Especially, all solid-state supercapacitors in series and parallels displayed the typical voltage extendtion capability for series devices and the great increase capacitance for parallels devices. In addition, FeCo2O4 nanosheets presented excellent catalytic performances in urea electrolysis in KOH + urea solution for H2 production. Therefore, FeCo2O4 nanosheets not only exhibit excellent performances in energy storage, but also show the prospects in energy-saving hydrogen production.
