Developing safe, efficient and environment-friendly energy storage systems continues to inspire researchers to synthesize new electrode materials. Doping or substituting host material by some guest elements has been regarded as an effective way to improve the performance of supercapacitors. In this work, single-phase CuCo2−xNixS4 materials were synthesized by a facile two-step hydrothermal method, where Co in CuCo2S4 was substituted by Ni. Cobalt could be easily substituted with Ni in a rational range to keep its constant phase. But, a high content of Ni resulted in a multi-phase composite. Among a series of CuCo2−xNixS4 materials with different Ni/Co mole ratios, CuCo1.25Ni0.75S4 material presented a significantly high specific capacitance (647 F g−1 or 272 C g−1 at 1 A g−1) and the best cycling stability (∼98% specific capacitance retention after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles), which was mainly due to the modified composition, specific single phase, higher electroconductivity, more electroactive sites and the synergistic effect between Ni and Co. Moreover, the assembled asymmetric capacitor using CuCo1.25Ni0.75S4 as a positive electrode and activated carbon as a negative electrode delivered a high energy density of 31.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 412.5 W kg−1. These results demonstrated that ternary metal sulfides of CuCo2−xNixS4 are promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
