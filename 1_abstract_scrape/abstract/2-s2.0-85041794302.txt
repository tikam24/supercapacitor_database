Supercapacitors represent a major technology to store energy for many applications including electronics, automobiles, military, and space. Despite their high power density, the energy density in supercapacitors is presently inferior to that of the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries owing to the limited electrochemical performance exhibited by the conventional electrode materials. The advent of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials has spurred enormous research interest as supercapacitor electrode materials due to their fascinating electrochemical and mechanical properties. This Review discusses cutting-edge research on some of the key 2D supercapacitor electrode materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, transition metal oxides and hydroxides, MXenes, and phosphorene. Various synthetic approaches, novel electrode designs, and microstructure tuning of these 2D materials for achieving high energy and power densities are discussed.
