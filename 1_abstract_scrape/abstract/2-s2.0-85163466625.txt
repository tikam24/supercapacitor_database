The discussion in this chapter on supercapacitor-assisted (SCA) techniques is to demonstrate how a long-time constant formed by a supercapacitor and a resistive load opens up uniquely new avenues to develop new power conversion and protection techniques (discussed in Chapters 10–14 10 11 12 13 14). The overarching concept of supercapacitor assisted loss management (SCALoM) can be considered as a unique new. Supercapacitors are rapidly advancing into useful energy storage devices, competing with the power density and the life cycle count of the rechargeable batteries. In addition to this progress, if a circuit designer treats a supercapacitor as a 5–6 order larger capacitor for the same can size, a new generation of power converters and protection systems could be developed. These SCA techniques are summarized in this chapter.
