Cobalt silicate (Co2SiO4) have been received increasing attention as the electrode for energy storage devices recently, however, its specific capacitance achieved is far from being desired for supercapacitor electrode. Herein, nickel hydroxide coated on Co2SiO4 nanobelts [denoted as Co2SiO4@Ni(OH)2] core–shell structure was synthesized using Co2SiO4 nanobelts as the template to improve electrochemical properties of Co2SiO4. The as-synthesized Co2SiO4@Ni(OH)2 displays surface area with 270 m2 g−1. As the supercapacitor electrode, at 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of Co2SiO4@Ni(OH)2 is achieved to be 1101 F g−1, which is superior to that of Co2SiO4 (193 F g−1) and Ni(OH)2 (380 F g−1). This work demonstrates that Co2SiO4@Ni(OH)2 core–shell structure can improve the specific capacitance of Co2SiO4 and it can be considered as a promising candidate for supercapacitor electrode.
