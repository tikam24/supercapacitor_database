The newest achievement in the synthesis of cobalt oxide nanoparticles are considered. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles have attracted a great attention due to their uncommon properties and application in a supercapacitor, optoelectronic device, Li-ion battery gas sensor and electrochromic devices. Recently, nanostructured transition metal oxides with valuable properties have become a new class of materials for many technological fields. Cobalt oxide nanoparticles obtained from various precursors show different size distribution as well as different optical, electrical, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. A reduction in particle size to nanometer-scale leads to changes in properties compared to bulk ones due to quantum size effects. Depending on the application area, the choice of an appropriate synthesis method for nanoparticles with desirable properties is a crucial factor. This work aims to provide additional information on the synthesis methods and properties of cobalt oxide nanoparticles.
