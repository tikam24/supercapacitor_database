To support many power management applications in wireless sensor networks, a previously developed model ismodified to predict the terminal behaviour of a supercapacitor under a dynamic charging/discharging power profile. Inaddition, a robust model parameter identification method based on the genetic algorithm is developed to determinethe model parameters using a dynamic test and a self-discharge experiment. On the basis of the supercapacitor powerinput model, charge redistribution related figures of merit are derived and used to evaluate the significance of chargeredistribution for supercapacitors with various rated capacitance. The results show that supercapacitors with differentsizes share similar charge redistribution phenomenon. Furthermore, the charge redistribution significance is studiedfrom several perspectives to provide guidelines for designing power management techniques that can achieve fullpotential of the energy stored in the supercapacitors.
