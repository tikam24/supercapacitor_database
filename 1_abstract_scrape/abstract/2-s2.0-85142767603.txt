The design and construction of nanostructured electrode materials are regarded as a key factor for the supercapacitor. In this paper, we demonstrated a self-templated method which hollow structure with different morphologies derived from ZIF-67 (Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67) as electrode materials can be synthesized. By the assistance of surfactant and proper sulfurization, the hollow cobalt sulfides with dodecahedron, cube, and plate-like morphologies can be obtained. The optimized hollow cobalt sulfide dodecahedron electrode displayed a high specific capacitance of 684.08 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, while the hollow cobalt sulfide nanoplate, in contrast, showed a highest capacitive retention. Also, they were further employed as the positive electrode in asymmetric supercapacitors. The assembled hollow cobalt sulfide dodecahedron//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibited a maximum operating potential window of 1.5 V, high volumetric capacitance of 3511 mF cm−3, the maximum energy density of 1.17 Wh cm−3 and the maximum power density of 0.697 W cm−3. This part of the result revealed the relationship of different morphologies-hollow metal−organic framework structures with the electrochemical performance in supercapacitor application.
