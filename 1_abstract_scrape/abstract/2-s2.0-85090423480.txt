A novel supercapacitor material was synthesized from SiO2-coated Co3O4 and CuO nanoparticles. These nanocapsules provided large specific surface area, fast electron transport, good mechanical stability and high electrochemical activity. The specific capacitance at 1 A g-1 was 835.4 F g-1, and it had excellent cycling performance. This journal is
