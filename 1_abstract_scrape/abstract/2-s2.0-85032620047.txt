Two dimensional MXene materials have demonstrated attractive electrical and electrochemical properties for various applications, particularly in energy storage, benefiting from their intrinsic 2D atomic thick topological structures. However, assembling MXene into macroscopic fibers with regular alignment still remains a huge challenge, inherently due to the insufficient interlaminar interaction between MXene sheets and the lack of well-developed assembling techniques. Herein, we report a wet-spinning assembly strategy for the continuous fabrication of MXene-based fibers through a synergistic effect between graphene oxides liquid crystals and MXene sheets. MXene sheets are orderly aligned between graphene oxides liquid crystalline templates and assembled into hybrid fibers with the highest MXene mass ratio achieving 95 w/w%. An excellent overall fiber electrical conductivity (2.9 Ã— 104 S m-1) and superior volumetric capacitance (586.4 F cm-3) of the integrated fiber-constructed supercapacitor exceeding those of neat reduced graphene fibers were achieved.
