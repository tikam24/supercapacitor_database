The synthesis of three-dimensional porous biomass carbons from the abundant peanut shells is investigated employing K2CO3, KCl, KOH, and NaOH as the activators for the application as low-cost electrode materials for supercapacitors. The results show that KCl-AC and K2CO3-AC are mainly composed of microporous structures, while KOH-AC and NaOH-AC show a well-developed porous structure consisting of both micropores and mesopores, and NaOH activation is more inclined to form mesopores than KOH. KOH-AC achieves the highest specific surface area of 2936.8 m2 g−1 and a relatively higher graphitization degree among these samples. At 1 A g−1, the gravimetric specific capacitances of K2CO3-AC, KCl-AC, NaOH-AC and KOH-AC are 250, 210, 284, and 339 F g−1 in the three-electrode system. The gravimetric specific capacitance of KOH-AC reaches 440 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and retains 286 F g−1 at 10 A g−1. In a two-electrode system, KOH-AC exhibits a high specific energy of 39.1 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 2495.5 W kg−1. KOH-AC also shows low internal resistance and good charge and discharge performance, and high cycle stability of 80% capacitance retention is achieved for 10000 cycles at 5 A g−1.
