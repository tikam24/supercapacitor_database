Herein, we report the preparation of Pongam seed shells-derived activated carbon and cobalt oxide (âˆ¼2-10 nm) nanocomposite (PSAC/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>) by using a general and facile synthesis strategy. The as-synthesized PSAC/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> samples were characterized by a variety of physicochemical techniques. The PSAC/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>-modified electrode is employed in two different applications such as high performance nonenzymatic glucose sensor and supercapacitor. Remarkably, the fabricated glucose sensor is exhibited an ultrahigh sensitivity of 34.2 mA mM<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> with a very low detection limit (21 nM) and long-term durability. The PSAC/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> modified stainless steel electrode possesses an appreciable specific capacitance and remarkable long-term cycling stability. The obtained results suggest the as-synthesized PSAC/Co<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf> is more suitable for the nonenzymatic glucose sensor and supercapacitor applications outperforming the related carbon based modified electrodes, rendering practical industrial applications.
