Hierarchical architectures realized via rational coupling of several components not only boast synergy driven raised functionality compared to their structural constituents also exhibit noble interface phenomena, thus made them significantly pertinent from research and technological point of view. Here in, geometrically intricate hierarchical nanoform constituting MoS2 nanoflakes anchored on TiO2 sphere was realized via two steps hydrothermal protocol. Initially TiO2 sphere was synthesized using titanium isopropoxide assisted hydrothermal route followed by which the sphere was used as scaffold for secondary growth of MoS2. As synthesized hybrid sample displayed much improved electrochemical behavior than pristine TiO2 sphere. Assessed value of specific capacitance for the hybrid is found to 152.22 F/g at current density of 0.1A/g which is 30 fold than TiO2 sphere. This electrochemical performance enhancement can be accredited to high surface area of the hybrid sample.
