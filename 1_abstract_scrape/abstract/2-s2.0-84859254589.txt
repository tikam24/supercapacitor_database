MnO 2 nanoparticles uniformly distributed and tightly anchored on graphene are prepared using an ethanol-assisted graphene-sacrifice reduction method, producing composite electrodes with tunable energy density (up to 12.6 Wh kg -1) and power density (up to 171 kW kg -1) via rational design of the oxide/graphene ratio.
