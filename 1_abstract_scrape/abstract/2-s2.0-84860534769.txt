A core-shell nanowires of SnO 2 and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SnO 2/SWCNTs) was synthesized by electrodeposited technique. The morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared composites were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Raman microscope, and X-ray diffraction. The characterizations indicate that SnO 2 successfully deposited on SWCNTs surfaces. The electrochemical performance of the core-shell structures as electrode materials of supercapacitor was investigated. The results showed that SnO 2/SWCNTs core-shell nanowires have much higher specific capacitance of 320F.g -1, at a scan rate of 6mV.s -1 and excellent cycling capability. Our results demonstrate that these core-shell nanowires are very promising for supercapacitors application. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V..
