The paper is devoted to the application of composite electrochemical coatings with cadmium nanopowder as anode material for alkaline electrolyte supercapacitors. It is shown that composite coatings with cadmium nanopowder are a promising anode material for alkaline electrolyte supercapacitors having specific capacitance of 140-180 F/g. The cadmium powder-cadmium composite coating has a higher specific capacitance than the nickel powder-cadmium composite. The electrode processes enabling the operation of the electrodes are cadmium oxidation to cadmium hydroxide and cadmium hydroxide reduction. In the case of nickel-powder cadmium composites there is also a double-layer component of the specific capacitance, which can be established by analysis of Ragon√© diagrams.
