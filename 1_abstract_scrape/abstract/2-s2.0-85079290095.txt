The cobalt (II) coordinated PANI (PANI-Co) was synthesized via a facile electropolymerization and hydrothermal process and applied for energy storage electrode material. The coordination bonding is formed between Co (II) ion and nitrogen of quinonediimine of PANI. PANI-Co achieves higher capacitance of 653 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 than PANI of 459 F g−1, and maintains high capacitance retention of 85.60% when the current density increases from 1 to 10 A g−1. The first-principles calculations result shows the protonated PANI-Co (H-PANI-Co) has much larger Fermi energy (N(E)) than the protonated PANI (H-PANI) and bare PANI, indicating its improved conductivity. The electrostatic potential of H-PANI-Co reveals the enhanced carrier transport behavior. The HOMO−LUMO energy gap decreases from 0.901 eV of PANI to 0.265 eV of H-PANI-Co. Moreover, H-PANI-Co shows less than half deprotonation energy of H-PANI, indicating more feasible protonic acid doping/dedoping process. All-solid-state supercapacitor constructed with PANI-Co electrode and gel electrolyte achieves energy density of 60.1 W h kg−1 at high power density of 900 W kg−1 and exhibits long cycle life with high capacitance retention of 83.8% after 1000 cycles. So, PANI-Co could act as an appropriate energy-storage electrode material. The first-principles calculations provide an alternative theoretical strategy to study the electrical properties of conducting polymer.
