The synthesis and characterization of MnCo2O4 nanoflake/graphene nanoplatelets composite is reported here for high performance supercapacitor electrode applications. The MnCo2O4 nanoflakes with different morphologies were synthesized successfully via a hydrothermal technique by changing the amount of NH4F. The MnCo2O4 nanoflakes in combination with the graphene nanoplatelets was deposited on Ni foam using an electrophoretic deposition technique. The as prepared composite electrode showed superior performance in terms of specific capacitance and cycling stability, as compared to the pristine MnCo2O4 system, due to the enhanced electronic conductivity resulted from bond formation between carbon and MnCo2O4. A high specific capacitance of ∼1268 F g−1 was observed at 1 mV s−1 scan rate. Noteworthy cycling stability was observed even at the end of 10,000 cycles of consecutive charging and discharging at a current density of 7.81Ag−1.
