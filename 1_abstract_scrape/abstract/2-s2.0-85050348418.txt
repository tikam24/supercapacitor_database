In order to optimize the operation status of hybrid energy storage system in electric vehicles, a novel fuzzy logic control strategy is proposed. This strategy adopts Kalman filtering algorithm to estimates state of charge (SOC) and state of power (SOP), which can calculate the optimum power and alleviate the errors of SOC effectively. Besides, the framework of the strategy and the model of both battery and supercapacitor are introduced. The proposed control strategy will help to deal with energy storage system problem of relatively short lifespan and poor limited range in electric vehicles. So stability and efficiency of hybrid energy storage system (HESS) improve greatly.
