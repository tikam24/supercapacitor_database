The current paper focuses on standalone supercapacitors (SCs) for round-trip electric vehicle (EV) propulsion for reasonable distances and can be used around the clock without hours of charging. Supercapacitors instead of batteries are a form of the fast-charging energy storage system. And can be charged during braking or slowing down. The capacity design of the supercapacitor can drive a four-seater electric vehicle. The advantage of a supercapacitor is its high-power density, high efficiency, fast charging and discharging, long service life, wide operating temperature range, and being environmentally friendly. The benefits are that it can drive an electric vehicle that uses supercapacitors, with a total weight of 405 kg, a driving distance of 1,150 meters in 6 minutes and 21 seconds, an average speed of 10.86 km/h, and a maximum efficiency of 97.06%. In addition, this system offers efficient use of renewable energy resources of the future.
