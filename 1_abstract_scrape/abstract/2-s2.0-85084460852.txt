Effective electrode design is necessary to drastically improve the performance and efficiency of sustainable energy conversion and storage devices. In this study, carbon decorated three-dimensional (3D) yolk-shelled nickel cobalt sulfide (NiCo2S4/C) hollow cages structure was synthesized by a simple one-pot method under solvothermal conditions in an ethylene glycol (EG) solution. The as-fabricated NiCo2S4/C hollow cages with unique porous features, a large surface area, and robust connection to electrolyte ions at the entire electrochemically active surfaces display superior performances for both charge storage and urea electrocatalysis. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the composite shows a high specific capacitance of 2362 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and maintains around 1250 F g−1 at 50 A g−1, confirming its excellent rate capability. The established asymmetric capacitor device achieves a maximum energy density of 60.2 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 375 W kg−1 with a remarkable cycling stability over 10,000 cycles of continuous charge-discharge processes (about 87.9% capacity retention). Impressively, the NiCo2S4/C composite reveals a good capability for catalyzing urea with an improved anodic current density and long-term durability for 1000 consecutive cycles. These results indicate that the hierarchical NiCo2S4/C hybrid may hold a potential to be a practical candidate for efficient power generation.
