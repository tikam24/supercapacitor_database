Of all the novel electrode materials that can be used to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors, the most promising one is ordered nanoarray structures, which can be used as binder-free electrodes. Honeycomb-like metallic nickel selenide (Ni0.85Se) nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foams were successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal approach. Characterization results reveal that the as-obtained Ni0.85Se nanosheets belong to the hexagonal crystal phase with a thickness of âˆ¼15 nm. By virtue of their intrinsic metallicity, super-hydrophilic surface and unique honeycomb-like structure composed of interconnected ultrathin nanosheets, the Ni0.85Se nanosheet arrays exhibit splendid electrochemical properties, e.g. higher specific capacitance (3105 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 1460 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), outstanding cycling stability (90.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), and remarkable conductivity. More importantly, hybrid asymmetric supercapacitors are assembled with Ni0.85Se nanosheet arrays as the binder-free positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, and show remarkable energy-storage characteristics, including an energy density of 65.02 W h kg-1 at a power density of 103.33 W kg-1, only 6.3% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles, and a wider voltage window of 0-1.6 V. In addition, two asymmetric supercapacitors based on Ni0.85Se nanoarrays connected in series can be charged and easily drive two light emitting diodes or a mini fan. Such excellent performance evidently proves that Ni0.85Se nanosheet arrays are a promising electrode material for energy storage applications.
