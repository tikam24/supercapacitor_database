A fast, simple, and highly efficient method is reported to develop large area nanostructured carbon electrodes by spin-on nanoprinting using carbon precursor polymer, polyacrylonitrile. Supercapacitors developed using these carbon electrodes exhibit an order of magnitude improvement in energy and power density compared to planar carbon electrodes. Even without a metal current collector, performance of these electrodes is comparable to other state-of-the-art materials.
