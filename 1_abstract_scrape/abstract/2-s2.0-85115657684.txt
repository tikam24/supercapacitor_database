A series of flexible asymmetric supercapacitors were constructed by using carbonized melamine foam as flexible substrate, which was decorated by high-ordered nickel cobalt oxide/sulfide/selenide nanorods arrays and bismuth oxide nanosheets and used as positive and negative electrode respectively. The performance of Ni-Co selenide is better than those of oxide and sulfide, hence the as-obtained asymmetric supercapacitor shows a high area capacitance of 620.9 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2, the power density and energy density are 3.75 mW/cm3 and 0.97 mWh/cm3, respectively, and the capacity retention rate of 6 000 cycles is 91.2%. After bending for 200 times, the device still maintains 88.6% of its initial capacitance. Therefore, the asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni-Co selenide and bismuth oxide has great potential in the field of high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
