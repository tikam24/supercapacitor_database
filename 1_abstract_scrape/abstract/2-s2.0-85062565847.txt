The construction of heteroatom sulfur-doped graphene aerogel (HSG), with an interconnected structure, by a facile ice-template method, combined with a thermal annealing treatment at 800 °C, is reported. The morphology and chemical nature of HSG are confirmed by several microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. The sulfur-containing functional groups act as the electro-active sites for the fast surface redox reaction. The specific capacitance of HSG is reached up to 367 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , whereas the specific capacitance of 272 F g −1 is maintained at a current density of 20 A g −1 with a capacitance retention rate of 74.1%. Particularly, the cyclic stability of HSG is close to 92% after 20 000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g −1 . These excellent electrochemical behaviors of HSG can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the hierarchical structure and the formation of additional “pseudocapacitance” by heteroatom doping.
