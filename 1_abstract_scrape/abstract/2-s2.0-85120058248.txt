Low-carbon society is calling for advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems and techniques, in which functional electrode materials are a core factor. As a new member of the material family, two-dimensional amorphous nanomaterials (2D ANMs) are booming gradually and show promising application prospects in electrochemical fields for extended specific surface area, abundant active sites, tunable electron states, and faster ion transport capacity. Specifically, their flexible structures provide significant adjustment room that allows readily and desirable modification. Recent advances have witnessed omnifarious manipulation means on 2D ANMs for enhanced electrochemical performance. Here, this review is devoted to collecting and summarizing the manipulation strategies of 2D ANMs in terms of component interaction and geometric configuration design, expecting to promote the controllable development of such a new class of nanomaterial. Our view covers the 2D ANMs applied in electrochemical fields, including battery, supercapacitor, and electrocatalysis, meanwhile we also clarify the relationship between manipulation manner and beneficial effect on electrochemical properties. Finally, we conclude the review with our personal insights and provide an outlook for more effective manipulation ways on functional and practical 2D ANMs.
