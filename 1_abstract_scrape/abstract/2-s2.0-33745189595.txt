The Ru/C nanocomposites with Ru loadings of 20∼60 wt.% were prepared by the polyol process in the presence of XC-72 carbon. TEM observations indicated that Ru nanoparticles were uniform with the average size of about 3.1∼3.5 nm, and highly dispersed on the carbon surface. After electrochemically oxidization from Ru nanoparticles to the pseudocapacitive oxide-hydroxide form, the specific capacitances of these composites were calculated by cyclic voltammetry. It was found that these composites exhibited much higher specific capacitances in comparison with the XC-72 carbon. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
