There have been extensive demands for eco-friendly, lightweight, flexible, and high performance supercapacitors for advanced applications like wearable electronics, hybrid electric vehicles, and industrial grid storage. In this work, a metalless nanocellulose-based PANI/RGO electrode with excellent flexibility, mechanical strength, and conductivity was developed and assembled into sandwich-like supercapacitors. Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was mixed into aniline during the in situ polymerization of PANI to improve conductivity of the composite electrode. This eco-friendly metalless nanocellulose based electrode was fabricated via filtrations driven by a vacuum and assembled into sandwich structures. The ratios between nanocellulose, PANI, and RGO were optimized to achieve both high electrochemical performance and good mechanical properties. The composite electrode has a large active materials mass loading ratio of 16.5 mg/cm 2 , and the assembled supercapacitor gives small impedance at 3.90 Î©, suggesting an excellent conductivity. This work shows the great potential of developed flexible and lightweight nanocellulose composites in the fabrication of supercapacitors that can be used in a variety of biomedical applications including e-skins.
