Ionic liquids have attracted much more attentions for its wide application in catalyst, green solvents and carbon precursors. Herein, N/P co-doped porous carbon materials with developed pore structure were facilely prepared from the phosphoric acid protic ionic liquid of arginine (Arg[H2PO4]2) and (NH4)2HPO4. The former acted as the carbon precursor, heteroatom source and mesopore generator, while the latter worked as the activator which had great impact on the pore distribution and microstructure. The porous carbon materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman and N2 adsorption analysis in system, indicating that Arg-2â€“900 was promising electrode materials for supercapacitors. It exhibited high specific capacitance retention of 94% after 10000 cycles with stable electric double layer capacitors. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitors exhibited a wide voltage window in alkaline electrolyte and neutral aqueous electrolyte, displaying high energy density and power density, respectively. In addition, the solid-state supercapacitors were prepared and showed good flexibility after bending the flexible supercapacitor cell at different angles. The results demonstrated the successful synthesis of N/P co-doped porous carbon materials form Arg[H2PO4]2 and broad application in wearable storage device.
