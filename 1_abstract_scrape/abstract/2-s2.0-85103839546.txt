Biochar has been made by carbonization of spent coffee grounds without further activation and has been characterized by several techniques revealing a material with a satisfactory balance of microporosity with meso and macroporosity. The material was fairly pure with 96% of its mass made of carbon and oxygen, 2.2% of K and the rest of unidentified minerals. This biochar was used to make a supercapacitor electrode combined with a photocatalytic fuel cell as an electric power source. It has been shown that the present biochar does apply as material to make a supercapacitor with specific capacitance mounting up to 200 Fgâˆ’1. Its combination with a photocatalytic fuel cell can be designed into a very simple system which provides several functions in one single device: solar energy conversion, photocatalytic degradation of an organic substance and storing of electric energy in a supercapacitor.
