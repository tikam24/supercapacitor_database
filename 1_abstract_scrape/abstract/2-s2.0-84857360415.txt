Opportunities of storing energy recovered from an electro-hydraulic forklift truck are studied. The lifting system is controlled directly with an electric servo motor drive and a hydraulic pump capable of operating also as a hydraulic motor during potential energy recovery. The paper describes some of the energy storage devices available, and the analysis results for the proposed systems are compared from the energy efficiency point of view. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.
