The aluminum doped SrFe12O19 hexaferrite samples were prepared via co-precipitation method using cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a surfactant. The effects of CTAB content (x = 0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 wt. %) on the structure, morphology, and electrocapacitive behavior of the SrFe10Al2O19 nanoparticles were investigated. The use of CTAB was observed to be effective in eliminating Î±-Fe2O3 phase from samples. Morphological changes including grain and crystallite size was noticed with the increase in the CTAB content. With the increase in CTAB, powder particles grew in size and thickness. A concomitant increase in magnetization due to crystal growth was observed. Electrochemical performance of supercapacitors was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Highest power density of 368.09 WKg-1 and energy density of 0.916 WhKg-1 was observed for 3% and 1% CTAB samples, respectively.
