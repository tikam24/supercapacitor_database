The present manuscript reports one-pot greener in situ synthesis of nanohybrids (N-GZO320) consisting of nitrogen-doped ZnO (N-ZO) particles (with an average size of 16 nm) coated on nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) nanosheets. The simultaneous reduction of GO and doping of nitrogen in both the components of nanohybrids has been performed by employing an environmentally benign biomolecule, glycine, as a reducing agent, to produce N-ZO/N-rGO (N-GZO320) nanohybrids. The formation of N-GZO320 nanohybrids involved chemical interactions between their components by making Zn-C/Zn-O-C/O-Zn-N bonds as confirmed by Raman, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. The as-synthesized nanohybrid-based symmetric supercapacitor in a "water-in-salt"(17 m NaClO4) electrolyte demonstrated fairly high capacitance with a relatively much higher energy density of 140.2 Wh/kg at 638 W/kg as compared to bare N-ZO (19 Wh/kg at 500 W/kg), which is attributed to the enhanced intrinsic electrical conductivity and wettability of the former. The integration of both N-ZO and N-rGO through Zn-C/Zn-O-C/O-Zn-N bonds in the nanohybrids thus contributes to attaining the novel electrochemical features of a high cyclic stability of 101% after 10,000 cycles for a high cell voltage of 2.7 V. Their high energy storage capabilities are evidently revealed by the lighting of green (90), yellow (74), and white (54) light-emitting diodes. The presence of different N centers along with oxygen vacancies at the interface of nanohybrids, as confirmed by XPS and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses, respectively, assisted in the nonenzymatic simultaneous detection of the mixture of biomolecules involved in human metabolic activity (ascorbic acid, dopamine, and uric acid) with limits of detection at 10 nM, 200 nM, and 10 Î¼M, respectively, in contrast to that of bare N-ZO (which was ineffective to bring their separation).
