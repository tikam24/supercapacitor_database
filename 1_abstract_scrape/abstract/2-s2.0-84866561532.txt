This study describes the formation of composites of polyaniline (PANI)-Carbon Nanotube (CNT) using in situ chemical oxidative polymerization of the monomer aniline. The PANI-CNT composites were characterized by FTIR and UV-Visible spectroscopy and XRD method. The surface morphology of the composites was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pseudo-capacitive behavior of deposited PANI over the surface of CNT was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. The composite was mixed with activated carbon for making the electrode. The specific capacitance of the prepared electrode was tested by means of a half cell test. The PANI-CNT composite with 0.02 M aniline in initial polymerization solution had the thinnest layer and highest specific capacitance of 597.82 F/g in 1 M H2SO4..
