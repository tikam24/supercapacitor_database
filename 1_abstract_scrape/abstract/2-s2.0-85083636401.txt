Pseudocapacitive materials are used for supercapacitor applications due to their exceptionally high capacitance and low cost. Good capacitive performance of the pseudocapacitive materials at high active mass loadings is vital for the development of the next generation of supercapacitor devices. This review describes recent advances in materials and nanotechnologies, which allows the development of advanced pseudocapacitive devices with high active mass. An important breakthrough is the discovery of novel dispersing and capping agents for the colloidal processing of nanoparticles. Particularly important are novel co-dispersants that exhibit enhanced adsorption on materials of different types, such as inorganic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and graphene. Conceptually new strategies are designed to fabricate coated particles. Recent innovations pave the way for the development of multifunctional redox-active dopants-dispersants and dopants-oxidants to manufacture conductive polymer composites. Among the most important advances in nanotechnology is the development of template methods and heterocoagulation techniques for composite manufacturing. The progress in the design of novel surface modification techniques and materials, discovery of advanced anchoring groups, and development of liquidâ€“liquid extraction allows agglomerate-free processing of nanomaterials and composites. This review describes fundamental aspects of novel technologies and their applications in the manufacturing of pseudocapacitive devices for energy storage.
