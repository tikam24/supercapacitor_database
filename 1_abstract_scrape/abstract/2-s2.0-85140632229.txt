For the first time, nanorods of nickel zincate (NiZnO2) have been synthesized by the hydrothermal method and used in supercapacitor electrode fabrication. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction study elucidated the preferred oxidation states of Ni and Zn ions in the cubic crystal of NiZnO2 as well as revealed the bonding parameters in the unit cell. The scanning electron micrograph and transmission electron micrograph study established nanorod structure synthesized by hydrothermal method. The specific capacitance performance was revealed by NiZnO2 materials based on the existence of electroactive species, like Ni2+ (d8) and Zn2+ (d10). The obtained specific capacitance from the charge–discharge curve is 984 F/g at 0.4 A/g current density in 1 M Na2SO4. The calculated specific energy and specific power are 68.32 Wh kg−1 and 210 W kg−1, respectively. The cyclic stability test showed 84% capacitance retention and 99% Coulombic efficiency after 10,000 cycles, indicating its remarkable stability. The excellent rate performance of NiZnO2 nanorod-based supercapacitor is reflected by 0.84 s relaxation time which infers that the cell can deliver energy within a second.
