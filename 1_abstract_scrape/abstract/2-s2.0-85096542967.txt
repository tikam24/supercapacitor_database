Transition metal chalcogenides are widely explored in electrochemical energy storage application due to their rich redox chemistry and variable oxidation states. Bismuth sulfide one of the metal chalcogenides, which is rarely explored in this field. Here we successfully prepared Bi2S3 nanorods through hydrothermal synthesis. This nanorod offers large voids between each other, which offers better ion/electron intercalation and facilitate high electrochemical performance. Because of this unique structure of the as prepared Bi2S3 exhibits the high specific capacity of 134.66 C/g at 1 A/g current density and a long cycle life over 5000 cycles.
