The controlled synthesis of Fe2O3@N-MWCNT and cellulose nanocrystal composites were followed by hydrothermal reduction process. The composite samples were examined by analytical methods. The Fe2O3@N-MWCNT and Fe2O3@N-MWCNT/CNC composite samples were studied by CV, GCD, and EIS. The Fe2O3@N-MWCNT and Fe2O3@N-MWCNT/CNC composite showed a specific capacitance of 162 F g−1 and 562 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1 and 5000 cycle's compromises and increases the active sites to facilitate ion transfer for electrochemical capacitor applications.
