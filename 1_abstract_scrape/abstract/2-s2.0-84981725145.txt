Ni3(HCOO)6/rGO electrode materials with sandwich structure were obtained via a facile synergistic self-assembly solvothermal route. As a electrode material for supercapacitor, the composites exhibited large specific capacitance and good cycling stability. The rGO loading is important factors in determining the phase, morphology and electrochemical property of as-prepared Ni3(HCOO)6/rGO composites. The optimum conditions were achieved as follows: the synthesis temperature of 100 â„ƒ, reaction time of 24 h and 8 mg/mL of graphene oxide addition. Ni3(HCOO)6/rGO composite delivered a large specific capacitance of 940 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s in 1 mol/L KOH electrolyte. Also, it displayed good electrochemical stability with 96.28% of the initial capacitance over consecutive 500 cycles at 4 A/g.
