Biomass materials are renewable sources that abundant worldwide due to natural plants and living organisms. Lignocellulosic biomass can be categorized as hardwood, softwood, agricultural wastes, and grasses. Agricultural residues those which of them have importance due to being produced in huge amounts in the worldwide annually. Food wastes and agricultural wastes are utilized either alternative use such as generating energy, fuels or disposal. However, disposal of these residues is follow out either scraping or burning way. This study aims to convert industrial agricultural origin biomass by using hydrothermal carbonization method to carbon-based material having high conductivity for use in supercapacitor production by using different activating chemicals. Hydrothermal carbonization was applied to different biomass samples such as nutshell, hazelnut shell, and corn cob. The elemental analysis of the obtained biochar was carried out and it was determined that the highest source of biomass was corn cob. The selected biochar has been chemically activated with different chemicals such as KOH, NaOH, H3PO4 and, ZnCl2. Advanced carbonization of activated biochar was carried out at 500, 600, 700 and 800 °C with 1, 1.5 and 2-h retention times. The resulting carbon-based products were mixed with KBr and identical pellets were prepared and their electrical conductivity values were measured. Electrical conductivity results, NaOH-800 °C-2h and ZnCl2-700 °C-1.5 h obtained from the process prepared from the biocidal pellets were determined to have the highest conductivity value. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analyses of the samples with the highest conductivity values were performed and surface morphologies were examined.
