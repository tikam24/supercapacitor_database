Samples of lanthanum-doped nickel hydroxide were prepared by electrodeposition method. The structure and electrochemical properties of the samples were studied by X-ray diffraction and a home-made open three-electrode cell system, respectively. The results show that the deposition process of Ni(OH) 2 and La(OH) 3 is mainly controlled by electrochemical polarization, which makes it easy to form uniform fine crystals. In addition, La(OH) 3 is not a separate phase and lanthanum ions are doped into Ni(OH) 2 crystal lattices. When V(0.5 mol/L Ni(NO 3) 2)/V(0.25 mol/L La(NO 3) 3) was 9:1, the lanthanum-doped nickel hydroxide reached the highest discharge capability of 840 F/g with a good cyclic reversibility. The capability still retains 670 F/g when the discharge current reaches 1000 mA/g.
