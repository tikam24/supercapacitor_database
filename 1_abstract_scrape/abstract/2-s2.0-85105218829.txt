Oxygen defects and hollow structures positively impact pseudocapacitive properties of diffusion/surface-controlled processes, a component of critical importance when building high-performance supercapacitors. Hence, we fabricated hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O-defects (D−H−NiMoO4@CoMoO4) through a soft-template and partial reduction method, enhancing D−H−NiMoO4@CoMoO4’s electrochemical performance, yielding a specific capacitance of 1329 F g−1, and demonstrating excellent durability with 95.8 % capacity retention after 3000 cycles. D−H−NiMoO4@CoMoO4 was used as the positive electrode to construct an asymmetric supercapacitor, displaying an energy density of up to 34.13 Wh kg−1 and demonstrating good predisposition towards practical applications. This work presents an effective approach to fabricate and use hollow nickel/cobalt molybdate rods with O-defects as pseudocapacitor material for high-performance capacitive energy storage devices.
