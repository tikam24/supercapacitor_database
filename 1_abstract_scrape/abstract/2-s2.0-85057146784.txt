In a small standalone power supply system containing renewable energy, the frequency response is usually supported during frequency excursion by the conventional generators only. This may result in a less effective recovery of the system frequency in a wind energy dominant standalone system. The support from the wind turbine in the frequency regulation will significantly improve the recovery performance. However, the natural inertia of the variable speed wind turbine is very small compared to that of the conventional generators. Therefore, a fast responding energy storage can significantly improve the frequency response capability. In this paper, a control technique has been proposed to utilize the superconducting magnetic energy storage to be integrated with the permanent magnet synchronous generator based wind turbine to improve the power system frequency regulation and the results are found to be promising.
