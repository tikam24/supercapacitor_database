As an emerging two-dimensional material, MXene has excellent conductivity and wide applications in flexible electronics, such as forcing- sensitive material, electromagnetic shielding material, supercapacitor and so on. As MXene has a layered structure, the sheets will slip between each other under strain. And the MXene sheets are easy break under stress due to the high modulus of MXene. In order to construct flexible force- sensitive materials, MXene usually combines with flexible matrix or cell structure like sponge to achieve flexibility and large deformation. The distribution of MXene, structure of conductive network and mechanism of forcing- sensitive materials were decided by preparation methods. Thus, the fabrication of MXene based flexible force- sensitive materials that could resist large deformation with simple and efficiency methods are the key factors to broaden MXene applications. This review summarized the methods, including dipping method, spraying method, vacuum filtration method, ice-template and some other methods and their effects on performance of flexible MXene forcing- sensitive materials. Meanwhile, the applications of flexible sensors in monitoring physiological signals, subtle human movements, joint movement signals and signal display were also summarized.
