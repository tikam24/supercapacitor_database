The demand for energy storage devices with high energy and power densities has increased tremendously in this rapidly growing world. Conventional capacitors, fuel cells, and lithium-ion batteries have been used as energy storage devices for the long term. However, supercapacitors are one of the most promising energy storage devices because of their high specific capacitance, high power density, and longer cycle life. Recent research has focused on synthesizing transition-metal oxides/hydroxides, carbon materials, and conducting polymers as supercapacitor electrode materials. The performance of supercapacitors can be improved by altering electrolytes, electrode materials, current collectors, experimental temperatures, and film thickness. Thousands of papers on supercapacitors have already been published, reflecting the significance and elucidating how much demanding such energy storage devices for this fast-growing generation. This review aims to illustrate the electrode materials loaded on various conductive substrates by electrochemical deposition employed for supercapacitors to provide broad knowledge on synthetic pathways, which will pave the way for future research. We also discussed the basic parameters involved in supercapacitor studies and the advantages of the electrochemical deposition techniques through literature analysis. Finally, future trends and directions on exploring metals/metal composites toward designing and constructing viable, high-class, and even newly featured flexible energy storage materials, electrodes, and systems are presented.
