According to the islanding operation mode structure of photovoltaic-hybrid DC microgrid, this paper proposes a photovoltaic-hybrid DC microgrid energy distribution control strategy to solve the current problems of insufficient battery output and slow short-Term high-power tracking. The instantaneous response capability of the energy storage system is improved, the battery capacity configuration is reduced, and the battery life is extended.The DC microgrid operation modes are listed in the form of digital coding, and the switching design of each operation mode is carried out, so as to realize the optimal dispatch of each power supply unit.
