The current worldwide energy directives are oriented toward reducing energy consumption and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The exponential increase in the production of electrified vehicles in the last decade are an important part of meeting global goals on the climate change. However, while no greenhouse gas emissions directly come from the operations of the electrical vehicles, the electrical vehicle production process results in much higher energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions than in the case of a classical internal combustion vehicle; thus, to reduce the environment impact of electrified vehicles, they should be used for as long as possible. Using only batteries for electric vehicles can lead to a shorter battery life for certain applications, such as in the case of those with many stops and starts but not only in these cases. To increase the lifespan of the batteries, couplings between the batteries and the supercapacitors for the new electrical vehicles in the form of the hybrid energy storage systems seems to be the most appropriate way. For this, there are four different types of converters, including rectifiers, inverters, AC-AC converters, and DC-DC converters. For a hybrid energy storage system to operate consistently, effectively, and safely, an appropriate realistic controller technique must be used; at the moment, a few techniques are being used on the market.
