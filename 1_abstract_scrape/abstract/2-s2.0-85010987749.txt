The graphene/polyaniline nanofibers (RGO/PANI) composite could be prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in acid solution, followed by reduction of GO with hydrazine in the presence of well-dispersed graphene oxide (GO) and re-oxidation of PANI by strong oxidant. The microscope images indicated that the PANI nanofibers could adsorb on the surface of graphene sheets through a large van der Waal force and hydrogen bonding force. The maximum specific capacitance of RGO/PANI composite achieved 596 F g−1, which was much higher than that of PANI (256 F g−1). Moreover, the RGO/PANI composite also showed a good cycling stability, retaining over 85% of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The good electrochemical performances of RGO/PANI composite were contributed to the modification of RGO sheets surface, the network structure and the synergic effects of the two components. Therefore, this study demonstrates the promising application of RGO/PANI composite as electrode materials for energy storage.
