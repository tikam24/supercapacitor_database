Rational optimization of electrolytes is of great concern for the improvement of Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. Polyacrylamide hydrogels as gel electrolytes, usually suffer from slow electromigration of the hydrated Zn2+ ions limited by the complexation of acylamino groups with the hydrated Zn2+ ions. We propose a new strategy of adding hydrosoluble diacetone acrylamide (DAAM) as an electrolyte additive into the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte to boost the electrochemical performances of the MnO2//AC Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. Theoretically, the formation of double hydrogen bonds between DAAM and H2O can induce the structural transformation of the hydrated Zn2+ ion from [Zn(H2O)6]2+ to [Zn(H2O)5]2+, which can reduce the thickness of the electric double layer to boost the electric double layer capacitance. The theoretical calculation on the Gibbs free energy change can confirm the formation of DAAM/H2O and [Zn(H2O)5]2+ from DAAM and [Zn(H2O)6]2+, indicating the effect of DAAM on the structural transformation of the hydrated Zn2+ ion. The MnO2//AC Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitor with the Zn(CF3SO3)2/DAAM (1 M) electrolyte shows the higher specific capacitances at 0.4 A g−1 and 0.5 A g−1 than the supercapacitor with the Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte, probably due to the effect of DAAM on the structural transformation of the hydrated Zn2+ ion. This supercapacitor can provide the cycling stability of 80.2% (after 10,000 cycles) and the energy density of 35.6 Wh kg−1 (at 0.44 kW kg−1). The wise utilization of DAAM as an electrolyte additive, opens up new avenues for developing high-capacity Zn-foil-free Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors.
