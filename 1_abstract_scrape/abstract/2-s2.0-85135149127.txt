Developing efficient materials for generating and storing renewable energy is now a pressing test for future energy demand. The advent of (2D) two-dimensional materials has attracted much research interest as electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their intriguing mechanical and electrochemical properties. This report used a facile one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize MoS2@CoS2 Composite as electrode materials for supercapacitors with good energy storage performance and explore energy generation and storage applications. The structure and morphology were investigated by X-ray diffraction pattern, field emission scanning electron microscope consisting of square-shaped CoS2 and flower-like MoS2, and characterization; meanwhile, their electrochemical properties were evaluated by CV, GCD, and EIS measurements. The electrochemical performance of symmetric MoS2@CoS2 binary Composite was examined in 1 M H2SO4 in a two-electrode assembly. The as-prepared MoS2@CoS2 electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 199F/g at a current density of 2A/g, while its counterpart MoS2 electrode exhibited only 127F/g at 2 A/g current density. The MoS2@CoS2 composite attains specific energy and power densities of 27.74 WhKg−1 and 494.46 Wkg−1, respectively, due to the unique morphology of the MoS2-flowery shape and CoS2 square. CoS2 squares effectively prevent the agglomeration and restacking of MoS2 sheets, facilitating smother ion dynamics. Technological demonstration of MoS2@CoS2 cell is presented by illuminating commercially available light-emitting diode for more than 3 min.
