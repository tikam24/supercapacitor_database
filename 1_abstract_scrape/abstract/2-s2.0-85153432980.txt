Energy demand is increasing due to the development of modern society. The use of electronic devices including portable ones is increasing gradually. Thus it is influencing the development of supercapacitors for energy storage due to their 10-100 times higher energy storage capacity. At the same time, the implication of biobased material is being considered as environmentally friendly. Cellulose is the most abundant natural renewable biomaterial. Nanocellulose obtained from cellulose possesses special mechanical and electrochemical properties that are being applied for the fabrication of supercapacitors, such as their low-cost and high conductivity and their inexpensive and environment-friendly natures. The development strategy and performance are discussed for better understanding. The work undertaken on improving the fabrication of supercapacitors from cellulose-based nanocomposites will also be summarized.
