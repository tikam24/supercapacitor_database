Non-stoichiometric mixed-valent molybdenum oxide film was grown on a glassy carbon (GC) substrate by the electrodeposition method. The specific capacitance of this deposit was studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and impedance spectroscopy. This non-stoichiometric hydrous oxide exhibits capacitive behaviour between -0.5 and -1.0 V (vs. Ag, AgCl|3 M KCl) in 0.1 M K2SO4. The specific capacitance of studied deposit achieves the value of 160 FÂ·g-1.
