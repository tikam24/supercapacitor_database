The demand for energy storage devices capable of operating at high temperatures is increasing. In order to operate at high temperatures, a device must have excellent thermal stability and no risk of explosion. Ionic liquids are electrolytes that satisfy the above conditions, and studies on improving their performance have attracted great interest. Here, we report the results of a study on the fabrication of a supercapacitor that has a composite electrolyte prepared by dispersing fumed silica in an ionic liquid. The fumed silica filler exhibits improved ionic conductivity and lower interfacial resistance. In particular, the silica nanoparticles with diameters of 10 nm exhibit better electrochemical properties than fillers of other diameters and have excellent device performance of 33 times higher than the pristine ionic liquid at high temperatures. This study can be used to improve the electrolytes of electrochemical devices, such as the next generation battery or lithium ion battery.
