The sonication processing was added in front of the freeze-drying as an intermediate processing before the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) aerogel was synthesized. It is distinguishing with the traditional hydrothermal reaction to combine the sonication processing and freeze-drying in our method. The structure, morphology, specific surface area and pore size distribution were characterized, and the electrochemical performances were measured in 0.5M Na2SO4 electrolyte for the MoS2 aerogel and flower-like MoS2. As for comparison, they are of porous structure and microsphere structure, and their specific surface areas are 55.14m2g-1 and 38.12m2g-1. The specific capacitances are 166.7Fg-1 and 119.2Fg-1 at the scan rate of 5mVs-1, and the capacity retentions are 87.7% and 81.6% after 3000 charge/discharge cycles. For the enhanced mechanism, the high specific surface of the MoS2 aerogel causes high specific capacitance, and the unique porous structure could buffer volume expansion to improve retention ability during charge/discharge processes. The MoS2 aerogel may thus be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
