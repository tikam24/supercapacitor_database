Two-dimensional transition metal carbonitrides (MXene) have demonstrated great potential in many fields. However, the serious aggregation and poor thermodynamic stability of MXene greatly hinder their applications. Here, an interface-induced self-assembly strategy to synthesize ordered mesoporous carbon/Ti3C2Tx heterostructures (OMCTs) was developed. In this method, the composite monomicelles formed by Pluronic F127 and low-molecular-weight phenolic resol self-assembled on the surface of Ti3C2Tx to prevent the restacking of Ti3C2Tx and maintain its thermostability. The obtained OMCTs possessed high specific surface areas (259–544 m2 g−1), large pore volumes (0.296–0.481 cm3 g−1), and excellent thermodynamic stability (up to 600 °C). Benefiting from these advantages, OMCTs serving as the electrode materials for supercapacitor exhibited superior supercapacitor performances, including high capacitance of 247 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, satisfactory rate performance of 190 F g−1 at 5 A g−1, and cyclability.
