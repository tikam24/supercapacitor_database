Polyaniline/carbon doped TiO2 composite nanotube arrays (PANI/C-TiO2 NTAs) have been prepared successfully by electrodepositing PANI in C-TiO2 NTAs which were prepared by directly annealing the as-anodized TiO2 NTAs under Ar atmosphere. The organic residual in the TiO2 NTAs during the process of anodization acts as carbon source and is carbonized in Ar atmosphere to manufacture the C-TiO2 NTAs. The specific capacitance of the PANI/C-TiO2 electrode is 120.8 mF cm-2 at a current density of 0.1 mA cm-2 and remains 104.3 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2 with the calculated rate performance of 86.3%. After 5000 times of charge-discharge cycling at a current density of 0.2 mA cm-2, the specific capacitance retains 88.7% compared to the first cycle. All these outstanding performances of the as-prepared PANI/C-TiO2 NTAs indicate it will be a promising electrode for supercapacitor.
