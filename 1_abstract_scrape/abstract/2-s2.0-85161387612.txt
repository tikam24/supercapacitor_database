This paper presents a strategy for charging the combined energy storage (CES) system that contains supercapacitor and battery. When battery suddenly charges or discharges very quickly within a few seconds, reduction in the life of the battery occurs. To enhance the battery life, supercapacitor is used along with the battery. Whenever the hybrid storage system is connected to the load, it should give power to the load only if it has enough energy. When the battery-state of charge is below a defined level it has to be charged. Likewise, whenever the voltage across the supercapacitor is below the certain level, it has to be charged in order to supply the load. So, here charging strategy is based on battery-state of charge (SOC) and voltage across the supercapacitor.
