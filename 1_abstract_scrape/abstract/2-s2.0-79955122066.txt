This paper proposes a new configuration of UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner) that consists of the DC/DC converter and the super-capacitors for compensating the voltage interruption. The proposed UPQC can compensate the reactive power, harmonic current, voltage sag and swell, voltage unbalance, and the voltage interruption. The performance of proposed system was analyzed through simulations with MATLAB\SIMULINK software. The proposed system can improve the power quality at the common connection point of the non-linear load and the sensitive load.
