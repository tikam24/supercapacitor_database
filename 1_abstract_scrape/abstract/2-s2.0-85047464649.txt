Sulfur-doped microporous carbons have been fabricated through a facile pyrolyzing method using the raw coal as the carbon precursor and K2S as porogen and the sulfur source. Benefiting from the characteristics of appropriate BET surface area, abundant microporous structure and sulfur functionality, the sample Coal-K2S-750 exhibited a high specific capacitance of 188.9 F/g at 0.5 A/g and 123.0 F/g at 10 A/g as well as the excellent cycling stability with the capacitance fading of 3.6% over 5000 cycles at 5.0 A/g.
