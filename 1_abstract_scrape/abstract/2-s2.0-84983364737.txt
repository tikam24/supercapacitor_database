A microgrid operator should strictly manage the distributed energy resources considering their characteristics. This paper proposes a power balancing algorithm among the distributed energy resources according to their characteristics in a microgrid. In this algorithm, a battery energy storage system is originally operated in feeder flow control mode to control the power from the utility. A supercapacitor operates through a P-f droop control to improve the power quality. Considering the low energy capacity of the super-capacitor, the battery energy storage system also restores the frequency during island operation. A distributed generator balances the energy through the microgrid central controller. The analyses of the proposed algorithm are presented and verified by PSCAD/EMTDC simulations.
