High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a novel class of materials with a stable single-phase structure that is often entropy stabilized and possess many interesting functional properties. In this work, we report a nanocrystalline spinel-based high entropy oxide (SP-HEO) - (Al0.2Co0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.2)3O4 and present an assessment of its electrochemical performance. A reverse co-precipitation (RCP) method was used for synthesis, followed by a suitable heat-treatment/calcination step that was adjusted to form a single-phase nanocrystalline powder. Structural characterisation revealed that the single-phase system was stable upto 850 °C. Nitrogen adsorption studies showed a large specific surface area of 90 m2 g−1 in the case of the SP-HEO calcined at 550 °C. The SP-HEO powders were investigated as electrodes for battery-like supercapacitor behaviour in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte - KOH. The SP-HEO powder calcined at 550 °C exhibited the highest specific capacity of 318 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The high electrochemical performance of the mesoporous SP-HEO makes it a promising electrode material for energy storage devices.
