A design of DC operating power supply system with supercapacitor (electric double-layer capacitor) instead of conventional battery is introduced. Supercapacitor is used to provide electricity for impact-load and fault-load. Its capacity can be adjusted according to the load, which is normally 1 F/300 V, single or parallel group. As its energy density is lower than battery, the system adopts hot-standby redundancy design with two chargers, which increases the system MTBF (Mean Time Between Failure) by 1.5 times according to system reliability analysis. Practices show that applying supercapacitor instead of sealed lead-acid battery in DC operating power supply is an excellent improvement.
