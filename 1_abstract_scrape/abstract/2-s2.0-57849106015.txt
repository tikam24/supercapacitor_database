Based on the characters of city bus, series hybrid powertrain featuring 'Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) + Super capacitor (SC)' is recommended. With the proposed powertrain configuration, this paper develops a dual-power system for hybrid city bus. The constitution, working principle and relevant control strategies of the system are introduced in details. A novel dual-power structural system was synthesized with gear-box as integrative mechanical design to improve dynamic performance relating to maximum speeds, acceleration, climbing etc. Examples of experimental data based on the dynamometer platform under the given urban cycle condition and actual road testing are illustrated. The results show the on-off control strategy is feasible and the adopted powertrain of this hybrid city bus can meet the design target and requirement. Â© 2008 IEEE.
