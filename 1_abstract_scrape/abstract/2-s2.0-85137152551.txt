We systematically evaluate the influence of graphene and MnCl2 contents on the structure and capacity of γ-cyclodextrin/graphene-based carbon nanofibers and MnO2(PCMG). The PCMG electrodes are stable long-term and had good capacitances, e.g., up to 236 Fg−1 at 1 mA cm−2 and 25.5 Wh kg−1 at 400Wkg−1. The electrochemical performance is maximized by the synergistic effect between the pseudocapacity of MnO2 well-embedded in the fiber and the electric double layer capacity induced by the well-developed surface pores.
