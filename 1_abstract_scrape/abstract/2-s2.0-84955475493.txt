A N-doped graphene (NG) was synthesized in hexamethylenetetramine flame from graphite oxide (GO) powder within a few seconds. Results indicate that hexamethylenetetramine acts not only as the fuel of flame, but also as the nitrogen source and reduction agent. And the exfoliation, reduction and nitrogen doping are achieved simultaneously in the nitrogen-rich flame plasma. The as-prepared NG has a large surface area of up to 595 m2/g, and a nitrogen content of 2.95 at% with pyridinic, pyrrolic, quaternary and amino types configurations. The NG was evaluated as electrode material for supercapacitor and exhibits a high specific capacitance of 205.3F/g in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte with low internal resistance and good stability, which is attributed to the combination of high specific surface area, abundant mesopores, and reversible redox nitrogen sites. The method features high efficiency, cost-effective and facile operation, and shed a light for the synthesis of nitrogen doped carbons in gram-scale towards energy storage applications.
