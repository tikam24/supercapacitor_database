The present work exhibits experimental results obtained from the analysis of porous nano carbon synthesized from agriculture waste for the evaluation of high-performance supercapacitors. The material has been prepared by pyrolysis at different temperatures. All the synthesized materials were characterized using EDS, FE-SEM, TEM, FTIR, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. Porous nature was determined from N2 sorption experiments. The electrochemical studies were done in three and two electrode setups. The maximum specific capacitance obtained was 174 F/g at 0.1 A/g in 4.0 M KOH electrolyte. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibited a specific capacitance of 119.2 F/g at 0.1 A/g and a specific energy of 32.6 Wh/kg. The device exhibited impeccable stability for 25,000 charge-discharge cycles, with 97.8% coulombic efficiency. Capacitance retention of 93% was observed even at the end of 10000th cycles, suggesting the huge capacity of biomass-derived non-activated carbon nanomaterials for efficient, stable high-performance electrodes in electrochemical energy storage applications.
