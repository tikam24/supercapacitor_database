NiO spherical nanoparticles, NiO/graphite nanosheets (NiO/GNS) and NiO/GNS/Ag composites were synthesized by a facile ultrasonic process. In NiO/GNS and NiO/GNS/Ag composites,GNS acts as flexible template to disperse NiO and Ag nanoparticles, which can not only prevent the aggregation of NiO and Ag nanoparticles, but also improve the electrochemical properties of the composites. The composition, morphology and microstructure of the as-prepared samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results showed that NiO/GNS/Ag composite electrode (GNS and Ag contents are 0.5 wt% and 3 wt% in NiO/GNS/Ag composites, respectively) exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. At 1 A/g current density, the initial specific capacitance of NiO/GNS/Ag composite was 501.66 F/g. After 2000 cycles, the capacitance was reduced to 440.45 F/g. Thus, the as-prepared composite has practical application in supercapacitors.
