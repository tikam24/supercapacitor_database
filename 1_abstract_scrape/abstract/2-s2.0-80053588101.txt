In this paper, a facile solution method was employed to synthesize the graphene-NiO composite. SEM and XRD results indicated the graphene sheets were covered by the NiO nanoplates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to measure the electrochemical properties of the composite. The specific capacitance reached 1292F/g at a scan rate of 5mV/s. The results show that this composite is a promising material for supercapacitor electrode.
