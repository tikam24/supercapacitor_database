In recent years, extensive efforts have been devoted to electronic miniaturization and integration. Accordingly, heating up of electronics has become a critical problem that needs to be urgently solved by efficient and reliable thermal management. Electronic device substrates made of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) exhibit outstanding flexibility, mechanical properties, and optical properties. Combining CNFs with high-thermal-conductivly fillers is an effective thermal management technique. This paper focuses on the thermal management of electronic devices and highlights the potential of CNF-based materials for efficient thermal management of energy storage electronic such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells. A high-thermal-conductivity composite material for electronic devices can be obtained by combining CNFs as the framework material with carbon nanotubes, graphene, and inorganic nitrides. Moreover, The research progress in the application of CNFs-based materials for supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries and solar cells is highlighted, and the emerging challenges of different CNFs-based energy storage devices are discussed.
