Renewable energy technologies have the potential to replace fossil fuels as the main energy source in the world, but this will need to be hand in hand with compatible and practical energy storage solutions. This manuscript aims to provide the state of the art of graphene-based materials, their synthesis and applications, and how can they used to improve the performance and durability in two of the most promising energy storage solutions, namely fuel cells and supercapacitors. The application of different graphene structures in supercapacitors, namely 0D, 1D and 2D, were reviewed. As for the fuel cell, the graphene usage for the electrodes, the bipolar plates and the membranes, were stated. In conclusion, it is expected that these graphene - based metal and metal oxides have the potential to transform the energy industry in terms of energy storage (Supercapacitors), energy conversion (fuel cells) and energy generation.
