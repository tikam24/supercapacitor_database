Rational design of appropriate negative electrode materials with high rates and long cycle life is essential to construct advanced lithium-ion capacitors (LICs). Herein, we solvothermally synthesize the bimetallic (Ni, Co) organic framework (NiCo-MOF) microspheres by using the polyvinylpyrrolidone as a structure-directing agent towards advanced LICs as a battery-type negative electrode. Benefiting from its rigid structure stability, high crystallinity, rich electroactive sites and high-content mesopores, the NiCo-MOF electrode obtains a large reversible capacity of ~557.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1. Furthermore, the NiCo-MOF based LICs display a high SC of ~58.2 F g−1 at ~1.0 A g−1, along with an exceptional capacitance retention over 8500 cycles at 1.0 A g−1. More significantly, the contribution here will stimulate extensive development of versatile MOF microspheres for next-generation LICs and beyond.
