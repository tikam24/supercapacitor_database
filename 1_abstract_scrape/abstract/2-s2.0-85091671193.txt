Symmetric and hybrid supercapacitors were developed and investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Activated nanoporous carbon (commercial product, TDA Research, USA) and electrochemically active iron oxides - Fe2O3 (hematite) and Fe3O4 (magnetite) were laboratory synthesized and used as electrode materials for assembling of supercapacitor cells. LiBF4 with an organic solvent mixture of ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate (1:1) was served as an electrolyte. The results from EIS measurements show the possibility of application of magnetite and hematite as electrochemically active materials for hybrid lithium batteryâ€“supercapacitor systems and can provide guidance in selection the most suitable metal oxides, as composite electrode materials in supercapacitors.
