Pure and Mn doped CdO nanoparticles were synthesized by simple precipitation method calcined at 400 Â°C. The calcined samples were characterized through XRD, SEM, FTIR and CV techniques. From the XRD pattern, the diffraction peaks are exhibits the cubic phased CdO nanoparticles without any impurity peaks. SEM images show the cubic shaped CdO nanoparticles with some Mn particles are decorated the CdO cube surface. The CV analysis shows all the electrodes are exhibits the psudocapacitance behaviour. The Mn doped CdO electrode exhibits the superiour capacitance value than pure CdO electrode which indicated that Mn doped CdO electrode has the good electrode material for the high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
