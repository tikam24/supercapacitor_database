In the paper, the electromagnetic compatibility of a frequency converter with a power supply is investigated. Comparison of the variants of the electric drive with conventional capacitors and supercapacitors, which are connected directly to the DC link of the frequency converter, is given. The simulation results in the MATLAB package and the experimental study of the electric drive with using the power quality analyzer are presented. The paper presents the forms of currents and voltages at the input of the frequency converter, as well as their harmonics composition. Conclusions about the influence of the supercapacitor block on the electromagnetic compatibility of electric drive to the mains are made.
