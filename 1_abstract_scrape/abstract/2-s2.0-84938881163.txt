In this work, the design of a hybrid DC power system for pulse load applications is considered. In micro grid power systems, pulse loads are particularly problematic since the load short-time power demands are very high and the total system inertia is finite. The requirements of the system in terms of power and energy were described. Also, the design aspects of the two commonly used configurations of the hybrid energy storage system, passive hybrid and active hybrid, are explained in detail. A 320-V laboratory scale hybrid DC micro grid incorporating different types of loads is developed for this study. This micro grid is controlled through a three level control and energy management system. A detailed model of the hybrid dc micro grid including different energy storage systems for transient and dynamic study is presented. The micro grid is experimentally tested and its performances are compared with the simulation model under normal and transient fault conditions. The results successfully validate both the experimental design of the system and the accuracy of the grid simulation model.
