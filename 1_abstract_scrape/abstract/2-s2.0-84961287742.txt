Pine needle β-Co(OH)2 grown on Ni foam (β-Co(OH)2/NF) substrate was fabricated via a simple hydrothermal process for improved electrochemical properties. The sample has been characterized by FTIR, XRD, TG, SEM, TEM, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance study. It exhibits high specific capacitance of 1215 F/g and 790 F/g at current density of 5 and 50 A/g, respectively. The capacitance can retain about 91.4% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 50 A/g. The β-Co(OH)2/NF has high specific capacitance and long cycle stability, which makes it suitable for supercapacitor application.
