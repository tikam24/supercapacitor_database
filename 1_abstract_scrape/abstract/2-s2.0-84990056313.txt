A novel biomorphic heteroatom-doped porous carbon with 2.86% of nitrogen and 12.36% of oxygen is synthesized by using a mold (Rhizoctonia Solani Kuhn) as the precursor. The biomorphic porous carbon electrode material exhibits an ultra-high volumetric capacitance of up to 655 F cm−3 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and superior cycle stability of 100% after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1. This work provides a new approach to obtain biomass with low cost, no pollution, short production cycle and high yield. Furthermore, the genetic stability is more beneficial for the formation of the uniform architecture and composition.
