A novel polyaniline nanorod (PAniNR) three-dimensional structure was successfully grown on flexible polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofiber substrate as the electrode material for electrochemical capacitors (ECs), constructed via self-stabilized dispersion polymerization process. The electrode offered desired mechanical properties such as flexibility and bendability, whereas it maintained optimal electrochemical characteristics. The electrode and the assembled EC cell also achieved intrinsic piezoresistive sensing properties, leading to real-time monitoring of excess mechanical pressure and bending during cell operations. The PAniNR@PAN electrodes show an average diameter of 173.6 nm, with the PAniNR growth of 50.7 nm in length. Compared to the electrodes made from pristine PAni, the gravimetric capacitance increased by 39.8% to 629.6 F/g with aqueous acidic electrolyte. The electrode and the assembled EC cell with gel electrolyte were responsive to tensile, compressive, and bending stresses with a sensitivity of 0.95 MPa-1.
