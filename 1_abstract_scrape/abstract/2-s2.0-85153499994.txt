Two covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a subgroup of porous organic polymers, based on diamine and trialdehyde monomers were synthesized to explore the effect of the building block structure on final electrochemical energy storage properties. One was synthesized from azodianiline (AZO) and tris (4-formyl phenyl) amine (TFPA) precursors and the other was prepared from AZO and 1,3,5-tris (p-formyl phenyl) benzene (TFPB). The former COF (TFPA-AZO-COF) and the latter one (TFPB-AZO-COF) were then evaluated by various characterization techniques. Specific surface area of 987 m2g−1 was found for TFPB-AZO-COF, while 425 m2g−1 was estimated for TFPA-AZO-COF. Specific capacity of 450 Fg−1, energy density of 24.6 W hkg−1, and power density of 8500 Wkg−1 were measured for TFPB-AZO-COF, while 160 Fg−1, 9.8 Whkg−1, and 8600 Wkg−1 were obtained for TFPA-AZO-COF. Stronger resonance in TFPB-AZO-COF accounted for better performance in terms of electrochemical energy storage.
