This paper deals with a hybrid generation system consisted with fuelcell, solarcell and supercapacitor. The supercapacitor is used to compensate the slow response of a fuelcell in case of abrupt load power variation. A bidirectional DC-DC converter provides the necessary power demand for the supercapacitor. The turn-ratio of a high-frequency transformer effects on the efficiency of the converter, therefore the turn-ratio is considered in the design of the converter. The converter efficiency and control method is analysed. Â© 2012 IEEE.
