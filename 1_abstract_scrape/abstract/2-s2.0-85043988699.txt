Cell voltage equalizers are important for the batteries of electric vehicles and other energy storage systems in order not to be reduced their capacity. The authors have proposed a cell voltage equalizer using an LC series circuit; however, the equalizer requires a lot of bi-directional and multi-stage connected switching elements to equalize the voltage across each battery cell. This paper proposed a novel gate drive circuit configuration and a control method which has compatibly with high performance and low costs using 'MOS-FETs' and verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by the simulations and experiments.
