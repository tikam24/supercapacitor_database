A large-area network of polyaniline nanowires was potentiostatically deposited on a stainless steel electrode at the potential of 0.75 V and characterized in 1 M H 2SO 4 electrolyte for a redox supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of 742 F g -1 and specific power of 16 kW kg -1 was obtained at the charge-discharge current density of 6 mA cm -2. A long charge-discharge cyclic stability of the polyaniline nanowires is observed. Â© 2005 The Electrochemical Society.
