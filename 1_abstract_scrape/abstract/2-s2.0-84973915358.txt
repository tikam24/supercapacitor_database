We report the fabrication of self-organized TiO2 nanotubes employing potentiostatic and galvanostatic anodization. A comparative study is carried out to evaluate the influence of the synthetic modes on the structural and electrochemical behaviors of the samples. Structural and morphological characteristics are investigated using X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical properties are studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The sample prepared by galvanostatic approach demonstrates better capacitive performance than the sample prepared by potentiostatic mode. The enhanced electrochemical behavior is owing to tubular structure with higher accessible surface area of TiO2 nanotubes.
