Energy storage materials are a key to the development of electrochemical energy storage technologies for meeting the higher requestor of novel paradigms in energy revolution. In recent years, high-entropy materials are developed as electrochemical energy storage materials based on the high entropy aspect as an emerging strategy of material design. In this review, high-entropy materials used in lithium ion battery, sodium ion battery and supercapacitor were represented. First, the basic concepts of high-entropy materials were briefly introduced, including the definition of high entropy and related effects. The structure and performance of high-entropy materials used as electrochemical energy storage materialswere comprehensively summarized. Some challenges arising from the development of high-entropy electrochemical energy storage materials were discussed. This review could provide a reference for rationally designing high-entropy electrode materials towards advanced energy storage and conversion.
