This paper describes the characteristics of a hybrid supercapacitor module for power quality stabilization. Hybrid supercapacitor is an promising energy storage device that positioned between conventional EDLC and Li-ion battery. A cylindrical 7500F hybrid supercapacitor (60 Ã— 138 mm) was assembled by using the Li4Ti5O12 electrode as an anode and activated carbon as a cathode. Considering the ESR and efficiency has been designed to module with 41.6F 480V design results in 180 series combination. In order to determine the characteristics of the hybrid supercapacitor module for power system, hybrid supercapacitor cells were connected in series with active balancing circuit. As a result of measuring the 50kw UPS, it was discharged at the current of 104A~143A during the discharge in the voltage range of 350V~480V, and the compensation time at discharge was measured to be about 30s. These results can be used to stabilization of power quality by applying hybrid supercapacitor module.
