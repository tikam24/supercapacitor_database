Cobalt hydroxide with or without adding urea was potentiodynamically synthesized from a nitrate bath, and the resultant hydroxides were examined as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The deposited hydroxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy. With urea in the nitrate bath, the specific capacitance of Co(OH)2 could be tuned from 700 F g-1 to 1200 F g-1 at a current of 0.5 mA. It was shown that the addition of just 2 wt% urea in the nitrate bath had a strong influence on the supercapacitor performance, exhibiting the highest specific capacitance of 1200 F g-1. The high-performance of the urea-doped Co(OH)2 was attributed to the better access of electrolyte due to well-stabilized basal length. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
