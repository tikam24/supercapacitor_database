Many studies have shown that conductive materials can accelerate the direct interspecific electron transfer (DIET) process of anaerobic biological system to improve the methane production performance. The different conductive materials were compared for efficiency of improving the methane production from the anaerobic wastewater treatment in this study. Magnetite (Fe3O4) could make anaerobic microorganisms reduce the COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) from 3000 mg/L to 54.88 mg/L. The activated carbon had advantages over other materials for enhancing the methane production. The methane production rate could peak at 21.41, 20.47 19.90 and 15.16 mL/h for added activated carbon, Fe3O4, Polyaniline (PANI) and Polypyrrole (PPy), respectively. All the materials could promote the production of electrons for enhance methane production by anaerobic microorganisms that degrade organic matter in the wastewater.
