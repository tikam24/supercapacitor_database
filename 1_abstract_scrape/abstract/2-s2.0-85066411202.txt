Oxygen vacancy-enriched MoO3-x nanobelts with oxygen vacancies up to 20% (equal to MoO2.4) were synthesized and demonstrated fast reaction kinetics. An asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with active carbon (AC) as the anode and the as-prepared MoO3-x nanobelts as the cathode. A new aqueous electrolyte of H2SO4/ethylene glycol (EG) was investigated and found to work appropriately at low temperatures, even at -25 °C. The MoO3-x nanobelts electrode possesses excellent specific capacitance, rate capacity (1230 F g-1 and 1220 F g-1 at 5 A g-1 and 50 A g-1, respectively) and cycle performance (100% after 38 000 cycles). Its energy and power densities reached 111 W h kg-1 and 803 W kg-1 or 50 W h kg-1 and 27 321 W kg-1 and maintained 80 W h kg-1 and 794 W kg-1 or 17 W h kg-1 and 23 565 W kg-1 at -25 °C. It is hypothesized that the coexistence of oxygen vacancies and low valence Mo ions enhanced both mass and charge transport kinetics and catalyzed the redox reactions.
