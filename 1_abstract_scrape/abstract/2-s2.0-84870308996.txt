The proceedings contain 29 papers. The topics discussed include: on the unzipping mechanisms of carbon nanotubes: insights from reactive molecular dynamics simulations; redesign of carbon materials for novel storage, mechanical and optical properties; when small is different: the case of membranes inside tubes; simulation of nanoscale etching for nanotube and graphene devices; growth of CVD graphene on copper by rapid thermal processing; sputter oriented nickel and defect inhibitors in graphene; thermo-chemical metastability of multilayer epitaxial graphene oxide: experiments and density functional theory calculations; large-area metrology of CVD-grown graphene layers on copper foil substrates; graphene metrology using fluorescence quenching of different fluorescent dyes; effects of process tube position on properties of graphene layers; and MnO 2 decorated three dimensional graphene heterostructures for supercapacitor electrodes.
