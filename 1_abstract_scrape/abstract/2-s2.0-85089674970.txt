Heterogeneity can be used as a promising method to improve the electrochemical performance of electrode materials; thus, ZnCo2O4@PPy samples were prepared using a facile hydrothermal route and an electrochemical deposition process. The as-prepared products possess a specific capacitance of 605 C g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) possesses an energy density of 141.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 2700.5 W kg-1 and capacity retention of 88.1% after 10 000 cycles, indicating its promising potential for energy devices. ZnCo2O4@PPy-50 exhibited an excellent OER performance and outstanding HER performance in alkaline media. As an advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, a voltage of 1.61 V at a current density of 50 mA cm-2 outperforms the majority of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts.
