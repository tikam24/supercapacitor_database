Inspired by the structure of pomegranates, an intriguing pomegranate-like microflower (PM-Ni x S y ) confining core-shell binary nickel sulfide (β-NiS/Ni 3 S 4 ) nanobeads has been constructed for the first time, which contributes to breaking through the bottleneck of poor cycle performance for nickel sulfide-based supercapacitors (SCs). The PM-Ni x S y microflowers possess an open nano-micro-structure, in which the core-shell binary Ni x S y nanobeads are well confined in the compartment of three-dimensional (3D) graphene flowers, endowing them with robust structural integrity. Profiting from the unique structure, the PM-Ni x S y microflowers deliver a high specific capacity of 323.8 mA h g −1 at 2 A g −1 and maintain a capacity retention up to 98.9% even after 100 000 cycles. PM-Ni x S y //PG asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are assembled and achieve an attractive energy density of 88 W h kg −1 at a power density of 810 W kg −1 . More importantly, 97.6% of the initial capacitance is still retained even after 100 000 cycles at 5 A g −1 for PM-Ni x S y //PG ASCs, displaying their unprecedented durable cycling life. On this basis, ASCs can be recharged by sustainable solar energy and repeatedly supply power to various electronics without a decline of electrochemical performance. Therefore, this work presents a facile route to design a pomegranate-like microflower for SCs with durable cycling performance that can be applied to store sustainable energy.
