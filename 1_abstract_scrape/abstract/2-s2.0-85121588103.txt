A nickel nanocone-modified NiMoO4 hybrid (NiMoO4/NNC) on Ni foam (NF) substrate is engineered to enhance the capacitance performance of NiMoO4 via facile and convenient electrodeposition strategy, followed by hydrothermal method. The presence of nickel nanocone (NNC) increases the density of reaction active sites of NiMoO4/NNC/NF, which can shorten the charge diffusion pathway and boost ionic/electronic conductivities. As expected, the NiMoO4/NNC/NF, as a prospective electrode material, presents appreciable electrochemical properties. Remarkably, the NiMoO4/NNC/NF electrode demonstrates a high specific capacitance of 2813 F g−1 at 3 A g−1 and manifests considerable cycling durability with a retention of 94% of the initial capacitance over consecutive 5000 cycles. Furthermore, a NiMoO4/NNC/NF//AC/NF asymmetric supercapacitor displays a great electrochemical performance by delivering high energy density (43 Wh kg−1) and power density (821 W kg−1) as well as notable durableness (10% decay after 5000 cycles). The presented results suggest that NiMoO4/NNC/NF can be considered as a binder-free electrode for highly stable supercapacitors.
