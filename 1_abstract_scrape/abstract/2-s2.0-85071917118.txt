A three-level boost-buck converter is proposed for ultracapacitor charging in vessel medium voltage direct current (MVDC) integrated power system (IPS). The topology, filters design, and control aspects are analyzed and discussed. A constant current control combining constant power control scheme is proposed to charge the ultracapacitor. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified by the simulation and hardware in the loop (HIL) experimental results.
