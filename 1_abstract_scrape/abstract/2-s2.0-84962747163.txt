Energy and power-storage capability of supercapacitors are associated with the physical and chemical characteristics of carbon-based electrodes. Herein, we report the structural characteristics and electrochemical performance of carbon aerogels (C-aerogels) prepared via a simple sol-gel method without any activation process. The synthesized C-aerogel possesses a 3-D interconnected network structure, and was tested as the active electrode material in a symmetrical supercapacitor with an organic electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements demonstrate the good electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. A specific capacitance of 21.8 F·g-1 at 2 A·g-1 and cycle durability of 87% over 10,000 cycles was observed due to the presence of dual mesopores. These dual mesopores result in an enhanced access to reaction sites and facilitate electrolyte ion transport. Furthermore, they can afford a high energy density of 22.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 2.4 kW·kg-1.
