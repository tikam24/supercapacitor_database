Hybrid storage solutions have been proposed so to take advantage of the specific characteristic and performances of individual energy storage technologies. In this paper we analyze how the use of a supercapacitor in parallel with a traditional lithium battery can affect the cycle life of the battery itself. The simulation results show that the ratio between super capacitor capacity and battery capacity along with the shape of the load profile change the obtained battery life extension. The analysis performed in this paper is intended to support an economical convenient design of hybrid storage solutions for micro-grid applications.
