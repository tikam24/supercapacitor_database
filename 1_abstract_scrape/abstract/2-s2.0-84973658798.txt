Co9S8/Ni3S2 nanoflakes have been successfully designed and constructed on a nickel foam substrate via a simple one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. The as-prepared Co9S8/Ni3S2 active electrode exhibited superior supercapacitor performance with an area capacitance of 8.95 F cm-2 at a current density of 6 mA cm-2, and 7.80 F cm-2 even at a high power density of 12 mA cm-2. By applying Co9S8/Ni3S2 as the positive electrode and porous carbon as the negative electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor device was fabricated and has shown promising energy densities of 81.7 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.35 kW kg-1. The stupendous specific capacitance, enhanced cycle stability, elevated energy density and power density as an asymmetric supercapacitor device of these electrode materials indicate that they could be a potential candidate in the field of supercapacitors.
