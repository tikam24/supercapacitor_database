In this study, sodium metal hybrid capacitors (SMHCs) composed of a metal anode and capacitive cathode are reported for the first time. The sodium metal anode was designed using catalytic carbon nanotemplates (C-CNTPs) and exhibited highly reversible sodium metal plating/stripping behaviors with an average Coulombic efficiency of ∼100% over 1000 galvanostatic cycles and significantly low cell-to-cell variations. Further, nanoporous pyroproteins (N-PPts) with a specific surface area of ∼4216 m2 g−1 and pore volume of 1.937 cm3 g−1 were fabricated as the capacitive cathode, exhibiting a high specific capacity of 168 mA h g−1, high rate capability of 0.5–10 A g−1, and stable cycling performance over 1000 cycles. The SMHCs based on C-CNTPs/N-PPts were operated in a voltage window of 1.0–4.0 V, delivering a high specific energy of ∼237.7 Wh kg−1 at ∼462 W kg−1 and a maximum power of ∼4800 W kg−1 at ∼66.7 Wh kg−1. In addition, stable cycling performance was maintained during 500 cycles, with a capacity retention of ∼82%.
