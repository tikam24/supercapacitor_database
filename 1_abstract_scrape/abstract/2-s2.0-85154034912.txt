Energy storage has played a very important role in the development of any electrical technology. Since energy storage has been extensively studied, battery and capacitor technology has taken a paramount leap. A lot of development has also been seen in the field of fuel cells and supercapacitors. But now it is time to see beyond these pre-existing electrical energy storage devices. Asymmetrical supercapacitors can be new device in the electrical energy storage sector, in the near future. Comparative study of symmetrical and asymmetrical supercapacitors is carried out and presented in this paper. In various modern applications, there is need for hybrid energy storage mechanisms. These mechanisms could be a combina-tion of conventional battery and supercapacitor or fuel cell or hybrid supercapacitor. Work related to such device is also carried out and presented in this paper. Three types of supercapacitor devices with variation in the electrode material are compared with respect to capacitance, pulse current, inter-nal resistance, power density and energy density. Asymmetrical supercapacitor with negative electrode of activated car-bon and positive electrode of activated carbon/ metal oxide which is referred as hybrid supercapacitor is found to be the most suitable combination among the other types of supercapacitor devices that are studied. New hybrid energy storage mechanism using hybrid asymmetrical supercapacitor is presented.
