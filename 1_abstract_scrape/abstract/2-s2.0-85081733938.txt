Oscillating water column wave energy converter arrays can be arranged to enhance the energy production and quality of power delivered to the grid. This study investigates four different array configurations of vented oscillating water columns and their effect on power quality and capacity of the energy storage systems required to absorb power fluctuation. Configuring the array of vented oscillating water columns as a nearshore detached breakwater allows combining the benefits of their complementary features. This increases the economic optimization of wave energy converters, paving the path to the energy market. The operations of the integration schemes are evaluated using the results obtained from simulations carried out using MATLAB/Simulink software. Simulation results show that the array of vented oscillating water columns and array of vented oscillating water columns as nearshore detached breakwater configurations increase the quality of power delivered to the grid and reduce the capacity of the energy storage systems required.
