In this study, a series of soybean protein isolate (SPI) membranes were prepared with triethanolamine (TEA) as plasticizer. The supercapacitor single cells (SSCs) were fabricated with the SPI membranes and commercial membrane as separators, activated carbon (AC) as electrode materials and Li 2 SO 4 as neutral aqueous electrolyte. The performance of each SSC was investigated systematically. The SSC exhibits excellent double layer capacitance characteristics in a 0~1.5 V operating potential. The SSC EDLC-1.6 with TEA/SPI-1.6 membrane shows the highest single electrode specific capacitance of 113.44 F/g and the energy density reaches up to 8.86 (W•h)/kg and the power density reaches 7.84×10 2 W/kg at the current density of 1.0 A/g. Electrochemical properties of SSC EDLC-1.6 with TEA/SPI-1.6 membrane are far higher EDLC-C with commercial composite membrane. The comprehensive performance of the SPI membranes was investigated as well. The SPI membranes show a well thermal stability and a high ionic conductivity.
