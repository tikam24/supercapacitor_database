Developing advanced carbon materials by utilizing biomass waste has attracted much attention. However, porous carbon electrodes based on the electronic-double-layer-capacitor (EDLC) charge storage mechanism generally presents unsatisfactory capacitance and energy density. Herein, an N-doped carbon material (RSM-0.33-550) was prepared by directly pyrolyzing reed straw and melamine. The micro- and meso-porous structure and the rich active nitrogen functional group offered more ion transfer and faradaic capacitance. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) measurements were used to characterize the biomass-derived carbon materials. The prepared RSM-0.33-550 possessed an N content of 6.02% and a specific surface area of 547.1 m2 g−1. Compared with the RSM-0-550 without melamine addition, the RSM-0.33-550 possessed a higher content of active nitrogen (pyridinic-N) in the carbon network, thus presenting an increased number of active sites for charge storage. As the anode for supercapacitors (SCs) in 6 M KOH, RSM-0.33-550 exhibited a capacitance of 202.8 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. At a higher current density of 20 A g−1, it still retained a capacitance of 158 F g−1. Notably, it delivered excellent stability with capacity retention of 96.3% at 20 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. This work not only offers a new electrode material for SCs, but also gives a new insight into rationally utilizing biomass waste for energy storage.
