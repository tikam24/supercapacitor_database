Battery or accumulator is a general electrical energy storage media. The main disadvantage of the battery is the long duration during charging process, short lifetime and less environment friendly. This is one of the obstacles in the development of electric vehicles. Recently, it has been found an electrical energy storage media that uses capacitor technology. The basic principle of capacitors is similar to a battery, which can store electrical charges. The charging process of capacitor is relatively faster than battery, but the discharging process is also very fast. The advantages of capacitor are not using chemical process, cheap maintenance and longer lifetime than battery. Therefore, the researcher developed supercapacitor. The supercapacitor has bigger and larger capacity than common capacitor. This study aims to find out the performance of some types of supercapacitor circuits during the charging and discharging process.
