The reliability and durability of lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are severely hindered by the kinetic imbalance between capacitive and Faradaic electrodes. Efficient charge storage in LICs is still a huge challenge, particularly for thick electrodes with high mass loading, fast charge delivery, and harsh working conditions. Here, a unique thermally durable, stable LIC with high energy density from all-inorganic hydroxyapatite nanowire (HAP NW)-enabled electrodes and separators is reported. Namely, the LIC device is designed and constructed with the electron/ion dual highly conductive and fire-resistant composite Li4Ti5O12-based anode and activated carbon-based cathode, together with a thermal-tolerant HAP NW separator. Despite the thick-electrode configuration, the as-fabricated all HAP NW-enabled LIC exhibits much enhanced electrochemical kinetics and performance, especially at high current rates and temperatures. Long cycling lifetime and state-of-the-art areal energy density (1.58 mWh cm−2) at a high mass loading of 30 mg cm−2 are achieved. Benefiting from the excellent fire resistance of HAP NWs, such an unusual LIC exhibits high thermal durability and can work over a wide range of temperatures from room temperature to 150 °C. Taking full advantage of synergistic configuration design, this work sets the stage for designing advanced LICs beyond the research of active materials.
