One-dimensional (1D) MoO2 nanorods were prepared by thermal decomposition of tetrabutylammonium hexamolybdate (((C4H9)4N)2Mo6O19) in an inert atmosphere. The synthesized nanorods have been characterized by XRD, TEM and HRTEM. The capacitive behaviour of 1D MoO2 nanorods was studied by galvanostatic charge-discharge studies in 1 M H2SO4 solution at different current densities. The results indicate that the MoO2 nanorods show good capacitive behaviour with a specific capacitance of 140 Fg-1. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
