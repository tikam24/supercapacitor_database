Our subordinate to fossil fuels has caused critical problems like environmental pollution and climate change. Harvesting, processing, and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns. These reasons determine the need for alternative energy sources to meet the growing demand. Among the alternative energy storage devices, supercapacitor (SC) is a promising one due to superior power density, fast charge/discharge rate, and long cycle life, allowing them to be utilized in many applications. Herein, electrode materials play a vital decisive role in the working performance of SCs. Therefore, the research on electrode materials acquires special attention. Although the performance of capacitors has been significantly improved in recent years, the challenge of developing high-performance materials remains relevant. One of the leading research directions is developing composite electrode materials that should combine the advantages of their components. Conductive polymers (CPs) play an important role in these types of electrodes, as their presence increases the electrical conductivity, and capacitance of SCs. This is due to CP's set of CPs properties: combining the electrical conductivity of metals and semiconductors while maintaining the advantages of polymers such as low cost, lightweight, flexibility, and simple processing. This chapter summarizes recent research and future directions into the use of CPs to develop hybrid electrode materials for SCs.
