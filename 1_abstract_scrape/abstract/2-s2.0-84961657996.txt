Ni(OH)2/graphene foam (GF) electrode was synthesized for electrochemical application by a facile hydrothermal reflux technique. The results obtained from the scanning electron microscopy showed that the Ni(OH)2 spheres successfully coated the entire surface area of the GF. Specific capacitance of 2420 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 was obtained for Ni(OH)2/GF composite electrode, as well as a capacitance retention of ~93 % after 1000 charge–discharge cycles, demonstrating excellent cycle stability in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. These results suggest that the composite could be a potential active material for high-performance electrochemical applications.
