In this work, we report the synthesis of silicon carbide (SiC) thin film on silicon by modified chemical vapour deposition technique using boron-doped liquid polycarbosilane as a precursor. Subsequent microscopic and physical characterizations of this film show the presence of SiC nanocrystal along with boron in the SiC thin film. The electrochemical characterizations of the film shows a highest capacitance of 232F/g at 2.2A/g current density from Galvanostatic chargingâ€“discharging method with good cyclic stability upto 2000 cycles. The high capacitance value is attributed to the surface defect states and amorphous carbon which acts as the charge active sites. The result further infers that the (B)SiC/Si is a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage application.
