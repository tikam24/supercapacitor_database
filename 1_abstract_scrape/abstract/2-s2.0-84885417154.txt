New porous materials are of great importance in many technological applications. Here, the direct synthesis of multi-layer graphene and porous carbon woven composite films by chemical vapor deposition on Ni gauze templates is reported. The composite films integrate the dual advantages of graphene and porous carbon, having not only the excellent electrical properties and flexibility of graphene but also the porous characteristics of amorphous carbon. The multi-layer graphene/porous carbon woven fabric film creates a new platform for a variety of applications, such as fiber supercapacitors. The designed composite film has a capacitance of 20 μF/cm2, which is close to the theoretical value and a device areal capacitance of 44 mF/cm2.
