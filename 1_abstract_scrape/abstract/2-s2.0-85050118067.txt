We adopted an Ultracapacitor (UC) for improving the fuel efficiency of a series hybrid electric bus. By utilizing the driving characteristics of the series hybrid electric bus with UC, we were able to achieve better fuel efficiency than the series hybrid electric bus without UC. In this paper, we introduce the model which added the UC to the existing hybrid vehicle. Further, the operation of UC is determined by the running speed of the vehicle.
