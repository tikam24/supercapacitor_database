Supercapacitors store electrical energy by ion adsorption at the interface of the electrode-electrolyte (electric double layer capacitance, EDLC) or through faradaic process involving direct transfer of electrons via oxidation/reduction reactions at one electrode to the other (pseudocapacitance). The present minireview describes the recent developments and progress of carbon-transition metal oxides (C-TMO) hybrid materials that show great promise as an efficient electrode towards supercapacitors among various material types. The review describes the synthetic methods and electrode preparation techniques along with the changes in the physical and chemical properties of each component in the hybrid materials. The critical factors in deriving both EDLC and pseudocapacitance storage mechanisms are also identified in the hope of pointing to the successful hybrid design principles. For example, a robust carbon-metal oxide interaction was identified as most important in facilitating the charge transfer process and activating high energy storage mechanism, and thus methodologies to establish a strong carbon-metal oxide contact are discussed. Finally, this article concludes with suggestions for the future development of the fabrication of high-performance C-TMO hybrid supercapacitor electrodes.
