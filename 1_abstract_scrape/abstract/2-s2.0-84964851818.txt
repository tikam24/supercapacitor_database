Nanoparticulate transition metal nitride based supercapacitor electrodes have recently gained considerable attention as high capacity energy storage materials. In particular, vanadium nitride has been shown to be an excellent pseudocapacitor on account of surface reactions occurring at an oxide exo-shell. However, there is limited understanding into the exact nature of charge storage behavior and its dependence on synthesis and processing route. In the present work, we explore the effect of materials processing and electrode properties on capacitive charge storage in vanadium nitride based supercapacitor electrodes. Dependence of capacitance on particle properties and electrode properties are evaluated and reported here-in.
