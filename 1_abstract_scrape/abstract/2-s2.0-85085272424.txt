Biomass-derived carbon materials have received intensive attention, particularly in energy storage areas. A facile method for synthesis of “cheese-shaped” porous carbon using Juncus effuses. L. (JEL) as raw material was reported in this work. The JEL was activated by K2CO3 for 24h and then carbonized in N2 atmosphere at 800 °C for 2h. By this means, a porous bio-carbon with a large specific surface area (2338 m2 g−1) was obtained. When evaluated in a three-electrode system with 6M KOH solution as electrolyte, the as-prepared sample exhibited a high specific capacitance of 357 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a good rate performance with a capacitance of 280 F g−1 at 20 A g−1. It is expected that this green and facile technique could serve as an effective and scalable method to prepare porous structures from biomass for electrochemical energy storage applications.
