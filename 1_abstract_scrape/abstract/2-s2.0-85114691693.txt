Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs), also called supercapattery, which can substitute for low power density batteries have attracted extensive interest. However, when HSCs comes to commercial applications, there is still space for improvement in energy density. It seems that designing of electrode with high capacity is an effective measure. Herein, amorphous–crystalline MoO3-Ni3S2/NF-0.5 nanosheet arrays are developed as battery-type electrodes. Specifically, the sheet-like structure of crystalline Ni3S2 can achieve rich structural nanocrystallization, improving the redox reaction efficiency. Meanwhile, the disordered structure and irregular surface of the amorphous MoO3 are conducive to maximize the contact between the electrode and electrolyte, slowing down the volume change caused by the continuous charge–discharge process. As a result, it displays an ultrahigh areal specific capacity of 8.52 C cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, and superior lifespan up to 7500 cycles with 90.0% retention. Further, when assembled into HSCs, the specific capacity reaches 1.47 C cm−2, corresponding to an energy density of 4.18 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.34 mW cm−2. Totally, the design of the unique structure displays a valuable measure for rational development of high energy density hybrid energy storage devices that are not limited to supercapacitors.
