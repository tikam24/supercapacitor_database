This paper presents an energy management strategy for a multi-source system composed of a fuel cell (FC) as the primary source and supercapacitors (SC) as secondary source. Isolated LLC resonant converter is used to connect the fuel cell to the DC-link, while the supercapacitors are connected through a bidirectional resonant converter. The resonant operation ensures high efficiency and high power density by means of soft switching and high frequency operation. The aim of this paper is the control of the DC-DC resonant converters to share the requested power between the SC and FC according to their dynamic response. So, the Fuel cell supplies the nominal power, while the supercapacitors ensure the mitigation of the fluctuations from the load power. The performances of the proposed topology are evaluated through some simulations.
