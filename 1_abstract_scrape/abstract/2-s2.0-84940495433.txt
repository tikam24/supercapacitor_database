In this work, copper-bismuth oxide (CuBi2O4) nanoparticles were supported on nanoporous stainless steel by a simple electrochemical deposition method and then was employed as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor application. The structure and surface morphologies of the nanoparticles-supported on nanoporous stainless steel were investigated using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical properties of the proposed electrode were examined using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge techniques in different electrolytes. The results showed that the proposed electrode exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 144 mA h g-1 or 647 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1 in 6.0 mol L-1 KOH with excellent long-term cycling stability (80% capacitance remained after 500 charge-discharge cycles). The proposed nanostructure is a suitable candidate for electrode material in energy storage devices.
