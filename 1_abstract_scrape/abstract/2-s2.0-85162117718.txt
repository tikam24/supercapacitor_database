Oxygen vacancy-doped WO3-δ thin film electrode with improved conductivity and high areal capacitance was synthesized via mild electrochemical oxygen de-intercalation of electrodeposited WO3 thin film. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the presence of monoclinic phase W18O49 of the doped thin film electrode. Raman spectroscopy analysis confirmed the presence of lower valence W5+ in the WO3-δ film. Electrical characterizations of doped WO3-δ and undoped WO3 films show that the doped electrode exhibits far lower sheet resistance and resistivity than the undoped WO3 sample. Mott-Schottky analysis of the samples shows that the vacancy-doped WO3-x possesses a higher donor concentration than the stoichiometric WO3. Electrochemical characterizations by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD,) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the superior pseudocapacitive charge storage metrics via its improved volumetric capacitance of 366.12 F·cm−3 (16.0 mF·cm−2) and reduced equivalent series as well as charge transfer resistance over WO3 thin film. This study demonstrated the synthesis of oxygen vacancy-doped WO3-δ thin film using a homemade two-electrode cell facility instead of the popular energy-consuming vacuum-assisted film deposition under controlled-atmosphere conditions. Besides, the vacancy-doped WO3-δ electrode shows a strong charge storage capability in the far negative operating potential range, indicating its suitability as an anode electrode for fabricating high-energy asymmetric supercapacitors.
