Infested ash tree residues were carbonized at 600, 700 and 900 °C. The carbonization product—biochar (BC) was investigated as a potential active material for supercapacitor electrodes in its original (o-BC) and activated (a-BC) forms. The electrodes were formed with o-BC or a-BC and a water based composite binder. The correlation between the physical properties of BC and electrochemical properties of these electrodes were carefully investigated in H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> and aqueous LiN(SO<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf> electrolytes. The results obtained from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry and charge/discharge measurements showed approximately a tenfold increase in the capacitance of the electrodes with the a-BC. Further analysis of the BC samples identified functional groups on the carbon surface of the a-BC which could be responsible for such a dramatic increase in the performance of the electrodes. The highest specific capacitances of 470 F g<sup>−1</sup> in 0.75 M H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> and 335 F g<sup>−1</sup> in 3 M LiN(SO<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf> were achieved. The cycle life of electrodes with a-BC in LiN(SO<inf>2</inf>CF<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf> electrolyte is stable and shows a very insignificant decrease in capacitive performance after 1500 cycles. These results indicate that the BC derived from infested ash trees is a promising material for use in supercapacitor electrodes.
