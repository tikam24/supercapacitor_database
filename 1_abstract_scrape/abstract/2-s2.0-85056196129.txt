In this work, ZnMn2O4 (hetarolite) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by a newly adopted hydrothermal method. The structure and phase purity of the developed material was confirmed by Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD) studies. Presence of various functional groups in the synthesized material was identified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The optical properties were studied by UVâ€“Vis spectroscopy. The size and surface morphology of the synthesized material was studied by using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis. The electrochemical behavior of modified ZnMn2O4 electrode material was tested in three electrode employing electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical performances of prepared ZnMn2O NPs were studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, galvanostatic charge discharge, cycle stability and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical studies were revealed the pseudocapacitive nature with high specific capacitance about 675 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s in 1 M KCl electrolyte solution and excellent cyclic stability after prolonged cycles (1000 cycles). The efficiency of 61.7% was obtained and moreover it possesses constant efficiency rate from 100th cycle to 1000th cycle, which shows the ZnM2O4 acts as a promising material for high energy storage for supercapacitor applications.
