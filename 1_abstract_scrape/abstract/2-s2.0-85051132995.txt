Supercapacitors are a promising high-power energy storage device due to highly reversible charge-storage process and long cyclic stability. However, the major limitation of supercapacitors lies in their energy density. Here, a high voltage carbon-based supercapacitor is built by using 2 M CH3COONa aqueous solution as electrolyte. In three-electrode system, this paper uses the potentiostatic polarization curves to study the 1.8 V high operating voltage window with the nitrogen-self-doped mesoporous carbon materials (FBNC-700) as electrode materials. In two-electrode system, the FBNC-700 displayed a specific capacitance of 111 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M CH3COONa aqueous electrolyte. The 2 M CH3COONa aqueous electrolytes which can improve the energy density to 3.8 times than the 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte exhibits an excellent performance. Also, following 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1, the FBNC-700 had good stability with 74.2% capacitance retention. As an aqueous electrolyte, 2 M CH3COONa which has the 1.8 V high operating voltage window can improve the energy density in carbon-based supercapactor.
