Hierarchical molybdenum disulfide microspheres have been successfully prepared through a zinc ion-assisted hydrothermal route followed by an acid corrosion strategy. It is found that the MoS2 microspheres comprised of numerous nanosheets with few-layered feature exhibit a 3D flower-like morphology. It is believed that the MoS2/ZnS composites can act as a precursor for the formation of hierarchical MoS2 microspheres. Additionally, the electrochemical properties of the as-prepared MoS2 microspheres as an electrode material for supercapacitors have also been investigated. Compared with the MoS2 nanosheet, the resultant MoS2 microsphere demonstrates superior pseudcapacitive properties including high specific capacitance, good cycling and rate capability, which could be credited to its novel hierarchical architecture feature.
