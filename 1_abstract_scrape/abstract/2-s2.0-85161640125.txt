Nb4N5 has received much attention in supercapacitors applications due to its high-valence states, metallic conductivity and environmental friendliness. However, the energy storage performance of individual Nb4N5 electrodes is still not satisfactory. In this work, Fe-Co-Ni (oxy)nitrides/Nb4N5/Nb2O5 heterostructured electrode material was prepared with impregnation method followed by high-temperature nitridation and oxidation treatment. The prepared electrode exhibits excellent specific capacitance (1322.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and cycling stability (capacitance retention rate of 99.11 % after 5000 cycles). The improved electrochemical performance could be attributed to the synergetic effect of local multi-heterojunction formed between Fe, Co, Ni (oxy)nitrides, Nb2O5 and Nb4N5, which accelerate the charge transfer kinetics. Interestingly, Ni-based (oxy)nitrides made greater contribution to specific capacitance. Co-based (oxy)nitrides mainly contributed to increase the capacitance retention rate with different current densities. Fe-based (oxy)nitrides reinforced the contribution of cycling stability. Specially, after the tri-modifying, increased Nb3+-N significantly enhanced redox couples with Nb5+-N in Nb4N5, then increasing the specific capacitance. The Fe-Co-Ni-Nb4N5/Nb2O5//active carbon hybrid supercapacitor delivers a high energy density of 69 Wh kg−1 and a maximum power density of 856.6 W kg−1. Our work demonstrates a new routine for the design of high-performance electrode materials, which offers great potential for high energy density supercapacitors.
