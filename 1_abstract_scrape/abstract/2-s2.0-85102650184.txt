CrSmxFe1-xO3 pervoskite nanoparticles, (x = 0, 0.035, 0.07, 0.1 and 0.15) were prepared via auto-compassion strategy. XRD plots proved the complete emersion of the solitary-phase orthorhombic Nano-pervoskites. Samples' crystallite size R surged with x. FTIR confirmed the evolution of Orthorhombic Pervoskite phase. HTEM images showed relatively large particle size for all samples giving the whole picture of the nanoparticles. DTA/TGA showed decrease in sample weight giving largest weight loss around ≈31%. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements were adopted to investigate the electrochemical merits of CrSm0.15Fe0.85O3 pervoskite nanoparticles in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. CrSm0.15Fe0.85O3 pervoskite nanoparticles exhibited specific capacitance of 1840 mF/g at 50 mV/s. Nearly, rectangular shape of cyclic voltammetry curve revealed that electric double layer capacitance was dominated. The study presents a promising application of CrSm0.15Fe0.85O3 pervoskite nanoparticles as electrode materials for energy storage. Nyquist plots for CrSm0.15Fe0.85O3 pervoskite nanoparticles appeared in the frequency range from 1.0 Hz to 20 kHz. CrSm0.15Fe0.85O3 pervoskite nanoparticles retains low value of solution resistance (Rs) as 50 Ω.
