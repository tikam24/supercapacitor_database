Co3O4/Ni foam composite material is prepared by directly growing Co3O4 on the current collector of nickel foam through hydrothermal method combined with calcination, which is then used as the electrode material for supercapacitor. The effect of structural morphology on the electrochemical properties is studied. X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Chen Huadian workstations are used to characterize the chemical structure and properties of the obtained Co3O4/Ni foam composite material. The results show that the Co3O4/Ni foam composite material formed by directly growing Co3O4 on the current collector of nickel foam exhibits excellent specific capacitance (332.5 F/g) and good electrochemical stability (maintaining 85% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles). It has broad application prospects in terms of high performance electrochemical storage device.
