An alternative optimized nanostructure design of electrode materials for high-power and high-energy lithium batteries by combining the advantages of nanoporous carbon and nanometer-sized active LiFePO4 particles was proposed. Superior electrode materials were obtained by dispersing nanometer-sized particles of active materials into a nanoporous carbon matrix. Microscopic images show that a nanocomposite consisting of nanometer-sized LiFePO4 particles of about 60-100nm in diameter embedded in a nanoporous carbon matrix with pore size of about 3-10nm is obtained. The results also show that the nanocomposite can be fully charged or discharged within a very short period, delivering both a high power density and a high energy density. A supercapacitor of LiFePO4-AC achieved longer charge/discharge times than the AC-AC supercapacitor under the same current density of about 6.8 A g-1.
