This paper proposed an inverter control scheme for wind energy system under weak grid conditions. Wind-based hybrid energy system (HES) is often having the issue of poor transients and slow dynamic response due to the unpredictable nature of the wind speed and inertia of the generator who cannot respond the changes instantly. The proposed control scheme is designed to improve the transients and dynamic responses of the wind energy system. The control scheme introduces super-capacitor (SC) fast charging/discharging characteristics in the inverter control using a bidirectional buckâ€“boost converter to improve the transients and the frequency response of the system. The inverter control scheme under the weak grid conditions is designed and analysed. The proposed control can be applied in the marine electrical system where wind system is installed in the marine to reduce fuel consumption and improve electric power quality. Wind-based HES is modelled and simulated in the MATLAB to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different conditions. The results are presented and compared to the conventional control scheme to justify the improvement in the power quality and the frequency response of the system.
