Pure silicon-carbon films and the films doped with manganese or nickel were deposited on a copper foil by the electrochemical method from a methanol / hexamethyldisilazane solution. Scanning electron microscopy studies of silicon-carbon films showed a complex structure due to the presence of three-dimensional agglomerates and “leafy” structures. Raman spectroscopy showed that the silicon-carbon films were highly defective. The porosity study revealed that all samples mostly contained mesopores with sizes of 10 – 50 nm. The nickel-containing samples showed a more stable bimodal distribution of the mesopores. The highest specific surface area was observed for the manganese-containing silicon carbon films.
