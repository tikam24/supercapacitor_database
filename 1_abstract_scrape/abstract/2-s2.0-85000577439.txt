Electric field enhanced approach has been used to synthesize different copper hydroxide morphologies as high-performance supercapacitors electrode materials. Employing this efficient, simple and low cost method, various shapes such as rod, flower and cube with an average grain size of 30nm to 1Î¼m were obtained on the copper substrate. The results revealed that applied electric field considerably accelerates the formation time of nanostructures from several days to close to 1min, where some of the desired nanostructures were obtained even in 1s. The electrochemical properties of different morphologies were compared using cyclic voltammograms and charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The obtained results demonstrated that the two types of fabricated structures showed high maximum areal and specific capacitance of 42mF/cm2 and 178F/g at scan rate of 20mVs-1, respectively, which make them excellent and promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
