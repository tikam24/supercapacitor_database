The paper considers the problem of energy-saving technologies in urban electric transport. The possibility of upgrading the rolling stock by installing a storage device is considered. This article analyzes the common energy storage devices used in the electric transport system. It is shown that one of the main ways to increase the energy efficiency of a vehicle is the use of a storage device. It has been revealed that the most promising and satisfying basic requirements for the electric transport system are a supercapacitor-based storage device.
