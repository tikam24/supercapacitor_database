A one-step electrochemical exfoliation method was appliled to electrolyze a graphite rod in the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim][BF4]), and the exfoliation product was thermal-treated to obtain graphene/ionic liquid composite (GNs/[Bmim][BF4]). Then, the composite was characterized by methods of infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. The plenty porous structure which can facilitates the retention of the electrode structure and the transfer of charge during charge and discharge was found in the composite of GNs/[Bmim][BF4]. When the composite was used in supercapacitor electrode, the performence was found to be superior to graphite. At 0.2 A/g current density, the specific capacitance can reach 221.32 F/g, and when the power density was 456.32 W/kg, the energy density was up to 83.51 (Wâ€¢h)/kg.
