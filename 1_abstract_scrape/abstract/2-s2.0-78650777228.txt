A novel method to fabricate sulfonated graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite (SGEP) was developed by liquid/liquid interfacial polymerization. Sulfonic acid functional group was grafted to graphene sheets as a macromolecular doping acid for the polymerization of PANI, consequently forming a SGEP nanocomposite. The component, structure and properties of SGEP were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscope and electrochemical test techniques. The electrochemical tests showed that the highest specific capacitance reached 763 F/g. Â© (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
