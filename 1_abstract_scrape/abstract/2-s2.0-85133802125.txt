Globally, Internal combustion (IC) engine-based vehicles are being replaced by electric vehicles to decrease fossil fuel depletion, pollution, and the effects of global warming. But in electric vehicles, the primary concerns are battery power consumption and battery life, which affects the range of the electric vehicle (EV). In this paper, a hybrid storage system comprising a battery and a supercapacitor is simulated in MATLAB software to enhance the range, duration, and performance of the EV by controlling the charging and discharging of the supercapacitor and battery and control logic is used to integrate a li-ion battery with a supercapacitor based on the state of charging of the battery and supercapacitor. with the use of a hybrid energy storage system, the range and performance of EVs has improved.
