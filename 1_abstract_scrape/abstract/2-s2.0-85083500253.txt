High-surface area carbon with porous structure can provide a large electrical-double layer as energy storage in supercapacitors. Herein, porous graphene-like materials with high-surface area were prepared from renewable coconut shell charcoal via KOH activation followed by oxidation in a harsh environment using a modified-Hummer method. Using the method, the surface area of the treated coconut shell charcoal increased significantly from about 189.97 m2/g to 642.45 m2/g with a pore diameter of approximately 5 nm. As expected, the increase in surface area increased the capacitance significantly, by up to 46-fold, from 3.22 to 148.20 F/g. These results demonstrated that the low cost renewable porous graphene-like material prepared from coconut shell charcoals is promising for use as electrode material for supercapacitor.
