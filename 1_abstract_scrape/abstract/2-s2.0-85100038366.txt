In this manuscript, we provided a new synthetic method to conveniently synthesize the mesoporous carbon platelets of high surface area (>1,000 m2/g), large pore size (â‰ˆ8.0 nm), and short channel length (<100 nm) for the application in high-power supercapacitor. A co-assembly approach to prepare the phenol formaldehyde-Pluronic F127-calcium phosphate composite was proposed. In such composites, the PF-F127 organic parts occluded within the Ca3(PO4)2 crystals can be converted to mesoporous carbon platelets and the calcium phosphate is easily removed in an acidic aqueous solution rather than using a highly corrosive HF solution for silica removal. In practice, the platelets of relatively large mesopores, short pore channels, high specific surface area, and good electronic conductivity to meet the high power demands. It shows that the mesoporous carbon can have a rectangle-like shape i-E curve measured at a very high scan rate of 4,000 mV/s in 4.0 M H2SO4. The novel mesoporous carbon platelets electrode exhibits only 29% loss when the scan rate is varied from 100 to 4,000 mV/s. The above perfect capacitive performances confirm the promising applicability of this novel mesoporous carbon for supercapacitors of ultrahigh power.
