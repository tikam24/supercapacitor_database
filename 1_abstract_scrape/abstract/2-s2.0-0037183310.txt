Nickel oxide films were synthesized by electrochemical precipitation of Ni(OH)2 followed by heat-treatment in air at various temperatures (200-600 °C). Their structure and electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XRD results showed that the nickel oxide obtained at 250 °C or above has a crystalline NiO structure. The specific capacitance of the oxide depends on the heat-treatment temperature, showing a maximum value at 300 °C. XAS results revealed that the non-stoichiometric nickel oxide (Ni1-xO) approached the stoichiometric NiO structure with increasing heat-treatment temperature due to the defect healing effect. The defective nature of the nickel oxide could be utilized to improve its specific capacitance for supercapacitor application. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
