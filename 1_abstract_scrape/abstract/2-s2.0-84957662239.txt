Highly porous 3D nickel cobaltite nanoparticles were synthesized by combustion technique. X-ray diffraction study reveals the changes in phase, crystallinity, and particle size of the prepared samples with respect to calcination temperature. Typical porous 3D foam like morphology of the materials was identified from the FESEM and HRTEM images. BET measurement further confirms the mesoporous nature of the samples with high-surface area. Mixed valence state of ions was identified from XPS measurements. Electrochemical studies disclose the impact of calcination temperature on the electrodes capacitive performance. 3D porous morphology of the material allows the complete utilization of active material available for the electrolyte ions. NiCo2O4 calcined at 400 °C exhibited the maximum specific capacitance of 908 Fg−1 at 5 mV/s scan rate among the prepared samples and 90 % capacitance retention at the end of 1000 cycles. Impedance study demonstrates the low resistance and facile diffusion of electrolyte ions within the material.
