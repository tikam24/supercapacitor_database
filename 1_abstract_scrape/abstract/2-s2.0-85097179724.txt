With the development of extreme fast charging technology, charging stations need to use energy storage stations to reduce the rising peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is a chemical power source that uses both Faraday process and non-Faraday process to store energy. Because of its attractive performance in terms of rate characteristics and chemical stability, it is suitable for some energy storage stations that consider both power density and energy density. It is important to describe the current-voltage characteristics of LIC to predict the charge and discharge efficiency in the early design of energy storage power stations. During the test, however, a full discharge or charge results in a high temperature rise, and the electrical model parameters near a specific temperature point cannot be accurately obtained. The short current pulses cannot stabilize the polarization. In this paper, a high-accuracy parameters identification method based on an improved Butler-Volmer-Equation-Based electrical model is used to summarize the phenomena caused by the rate of change of high-energy LIC. The accuracy of the method is tested under the dynamic stress condition test. The maximum voltage error is less than 2%. Energy efficiency calculation based on the used model is simulated by the design condition from the energy storage station of the Haizhu line in Guangzhou. The maximum error is less than 0.2%.
