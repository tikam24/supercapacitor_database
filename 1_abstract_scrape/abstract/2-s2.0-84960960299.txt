SrWO4 is a promising candidate as not only photocatalyst for the removal of organic pollutants from water, but also electrode material for energy storage devices. However, the drawbacks of its poor adsorptive performance, low electrical conductivity, and high recombination rate of photogenerated electron-hole pair impede its practical applications. In this work, we have developed a new graphene/SrWO4 nanocomposite synthesized via a facile chemical precipitation method. Characterizations show that SrWO4 nanoparticles with 80 nm or so deposited on the surface of graphene nanosheets. Graphene nanosheets in the graphene-SrWO4 hybrid could increase adsorptive property, improve the electrical conductivity of hybrid, and reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs. As a kind of photocatalyst or electrode material for supercapacitor, the binary graphene-SrWO4 hybrid presents enhanced photocatalytic activity and electrochemical property compared to pure SrWO4.
