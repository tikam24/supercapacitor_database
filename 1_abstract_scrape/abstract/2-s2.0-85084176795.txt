We report a facile synthesis of Ni(OH)2@xRF with excellent electrochemical properties through a sol–gel process. With the help of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide modifying, resorcinol–formaldehyde (RF) resin is easily coated on the surface of Ni(OH)2. We have demonstrated that the thickness of RF layer can be tuned by adjusting the amount of RF solution. And the electrochemical performance of the synthesized materials is dependent on the thickness of RF layer. Due to the good mechanical properties and conductivity of RF, Ni(OH)2@xRF show a superior electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of Ni(OH)2@2RF is 672F/g at 5 A/g, which is higher than that of Ni(OH)2. The strategy promises a useful method for designing electrode materials with enhanced specific capacitance and stability.
