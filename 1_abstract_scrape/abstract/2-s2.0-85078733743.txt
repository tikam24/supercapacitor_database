This work focuses on hybrid balancing systems, a recently-proposed concept that enables balancing of battery cells and hybridization with supercapacitors. To control this system, a model predictive control framework is developed. In addition to distributing the supercapacitor power among the balancing circuits, this framework is also able to minimize state-of-charge and thermal imbalances in the battery cells, as well as energy losses in the balancing circuits. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified via numerical simulations. It is shown that, in comparison with state-of-art balancing solutions, the proposed control approach is able to decrease battery stress in up to 9% and the maximum temperature in up to 4.5%.
