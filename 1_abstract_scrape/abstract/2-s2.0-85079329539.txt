The energy crisis is something that is vastly overlooked but will cause major issues in the near future for humankind. This paper outlines the methodology of designing and implementation of a solar powered system, which can be used to supply energy for high power appliances with the use of Supercapacitors. Using a supercapacitor bank to ensure the constant supply during shading, the system mainly relies on MOSFET's, controlled through an Arduino Nano. The microcontroller will switch between the four working phases depending on the voltages of the supercapacitor bank and PV array. The system will be running on either the PV supply, the PV supply while charging the Supercapacitor bank, the Supercapacitor bank alone, or failing which the main grid. The Supercapacitor bank is charged by the PV supply.
