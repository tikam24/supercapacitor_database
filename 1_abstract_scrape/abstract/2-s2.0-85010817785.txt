One dimension (1D) MgCo2O4 was successfully prepared by a facile one-step route and their structural, optical and electrochemical properties have been investigated. The field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images illustrates rod like nanostructures with length ranges around 120 nm. The optical band gap of MgCo2O4 was estimated around 4 eV. Then the synthesized product was utilized for electrochemical performance to modify the glassy carbon electrode. Electrochemical tests exhibit high specific capacitance ~752 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−1. The enhanced electrochemical performance is mainly due to the rod like nanostructures, which allows rapid transportation of electrolyte ions which is in favor of developing rate capability of the electrodes. It was believed that, the 1D MgCo2O4 nanostructures may be promising potential product for energy storage device application in supercapacitor.
