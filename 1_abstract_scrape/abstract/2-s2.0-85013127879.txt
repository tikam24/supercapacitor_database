Here we report on the synthesis of binary transition metal nitride electrodes based on titanium vanadium nitride (TiVN) thin films. These films were deposited by a method compatible with micro-electronic processes which consists of DC co-sputtering of vanadium (V) and titanium (Ti) targets. TiVN films with different Ti/V ratio were deposited. A dependence of the capacitance and the cycling stability with the Ti/V atomic ratio in the films was established. While V rich sample exhibits a Faradic behavior that limits its cycling ability despite a high areal and volumetric capacity, the addition of Ti in the film drastically improves the cycling ability with virtually no fade in capacitance after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, a 1.1 Ti/V ratio leads to an areal capacitance up to 15 mF·cm− 2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. Such electrodes shed light on the use of binary transition metal nitrides as candidate electrodes for micro-supercapacitor.
