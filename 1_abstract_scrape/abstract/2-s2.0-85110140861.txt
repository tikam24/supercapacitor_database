All electrical and electronic devices require access to a suitable energy source. In a portable electronic product, such as a cell phone, an energy storage unit drives a complex array of power conversion stages to generate multiple DC voltage rails required. To optimize the overall end-to-end efficiency, these internal power conversions should waste minimal energy and deliver more to the electronic modules. Capacitors are one of the main component families used in electronics, to store and deliver electric charges. Supercapacitors, so called because they provide over a million-fold increase in capacitance relative to a traditional capacitor of the same volume, are enabling a paradigm shift in the design of power electronic converter circuits. Here we show that supercapac-itors could function as a lossless voltage-dropping element in the power conversion stages, thereby significantly increasing the power conversion stage efficiency. This approach has numerous second-ary benefits: it improves continuity of the supply, suppresses voltage surges, allows the voltage regulation to be electromagnetically silent, and simplifies the design of voltage regulators. The use of supercapacitors allows the development of a novel loss-circumvention theory with applicability to a wide range of supercapacitor-assisted (SCA) techniques. These include low-dropout regulators, transient surge absorbers, LED lighting for DC microgrids, and rapid energy transfer for water heat-ing.
