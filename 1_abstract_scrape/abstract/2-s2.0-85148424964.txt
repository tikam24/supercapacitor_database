High-performance fiber-shaped power sources are anticipated to considerably contribute to the continuous development of smart wearable devices. As one-/two-dimensional (1D/2D) frameworks constructed from graphene sheets, graphene fibers and fabrics inherit the merits of graphene, including its lightweight nature, high electrical conductivity, and exceptional mechanical strength. The as-fabricated graphene fiber/fabric flexible supercapacitor (FSC) is, therefore, regarded as a promising candidate for next-generation wearable energy storage devices owing to its high energy/power density, adequate safety, satisfactory flexibility, and extended cycle life. The gap between practical applications and experimental demonstrations of FSC is drastically reduced as a result of technological advancements. To this end, herein, recent advancements of FSCs in fiber element regulation, fiber/fabric construction, and practical applications are methodically reviewed and a forecast of their growth is presented.
