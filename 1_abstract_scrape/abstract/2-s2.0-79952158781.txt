Fluorine makes the difference! Bis(2,2′-biphenoxy)borates decorated with fluorine substituents have been synthesized and studied in supercapacitor test cells (see scheme). A clear trend towards higher electrochemical stability with the increase of the fluorine content has been observed. For a maximum performance, only two fluorine substituents per benzene moiety are required. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
