ZnWO4 nanoparticles (NPs) that are assembled and aggregated together as chain-like morphology have been synthesized via the reaction of Zn(II) salt solution with sodium tungstate in the presence of the DNA scaffold under 5 min of microwave heating. The reaction parameters have been tuned to control the size of the individual particles and diameter of the chains. The significance of different reaction parameters and specific growth mechanism for the formation of particles is elaborated. The DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies have been used in two potential applications for the first time, namely, supercapacitor and catalysis studies. Supercapacitor study revealed that DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies exhibited good electrochemical properties having high specific capacitance value âˆ¼72 F/g at 5 mV s-1, and electrodes possessed a good cyclic stability with more than 1000 consecutive times of cycling. Catalysis studies have been done for benzyl alcohol oxidation, and it was observed that DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies having smaller diameter gives better catalytic efficiency compared to other morphology. This is further authenticated from their BET surface area analysis. In the future, the self-assembled DNA-ZnWO4 nanoassemblies could be a promising candidate for the synthesis of other mixed metal oxides and should be applicable in various emerging fields like Li ion batteries or photocatalysis, or as luminescent materials.
