The nickel phosphate molecular sieve VSB-5 as an electrode material for supercapacitors is investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry in alkaline media. The VSB-5 shows high specific capacitance and excellent cycling stability. The specific capacitance of VSB-5 is 2740 F g-1 at a current density of 3 A g-1 and there is no significant reduction in Coulombic efficiency after 3000 cycles at 30 A g -1. In comparison with mesoporous nickel phosphate NiPO, porous nickel hydroxide and mesoporous nickel oxide, this remarkable electrochemical performance of VSB-5 will make nickel phosphate material a promising new electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
