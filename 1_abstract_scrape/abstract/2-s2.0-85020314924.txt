Porous carbons were successfully prepared from nitrogen containing microalgae by the carbonization and KOH activation processes. The materials thus synthesized showed surface areas ranging from 1210 to 2433 m2/g and nitrogen contents ranging from 21.8 to 1.40 wt.% due to the use of N-rich microalgae as a carbon precursor. The samples synthesized at 700 Â°C with char: hydroxide = 1: 5 exhibited excellent endurance, with specific capacitances of 117 F/g at 0.5 A/g.
