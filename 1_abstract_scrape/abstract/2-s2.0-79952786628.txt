We report a high-performance supercapacitor incorporating a poly(ionic liquid)-modified reduced graphene oxide (PIL:RG-O) electrode and an ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte (specifically, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide or EMIM-NTf2). PIL:RG-O provides enhanced compatibility with the IL electrolyte, thereby increasing the effective electrode surface area accessible to electrolyte ions. The supercapacitor assembled with PIL:RG-O electrode and EMIM-NTf2 electrolyte showed a stable electrochemical response up to 3.5 V operating voltage and was capable of yielding a maximum energy density of 6.5 W · h/kg with a power density of 2.4 kW/kg. These results demonstrate the potential of the PIL:RG-O material as an electrode in high-performance supercapacitors. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
