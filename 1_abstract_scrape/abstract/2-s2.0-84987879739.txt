A hybrid compressed air energy storage (CAES) system combined with super capacitor has been proposed to meet power demand rapidly and increase the quality of power grid. In order to achieve the generator power tracking rapidly and smoothly, the state feedback linearization controller is designed for the boost converter as the main control part of the super capacitor based on the optimal tracking technology with the exact linearization theory of nonlinear control system. The simulation experiments results show that the optimal tracking controller of the new hybrid air energy storage system with super capacitor energy storage is useful to track the power demand curve of 24 hours somewhere.
