We report here the chemical synthesis, electrochemical polymerization, characterization and application of novel 2-(6-(5-oxo-4-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)-4,5-dihydrooxazol-2-yl)naphthalen-2-yl)-4-(thiophen-2-ylmethylene)oxazol-5(4 H)-one (ThNapOx), for the first time. Electrode active material for supercapacitor applications was formed by electrochemically polymerized of a novel thiophene based monomer on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) via cyclic voltammetry (CV). The obtained polymer film (PThNapOx) on PGE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to confirm the morphology of PThNapOx on PGE (PGE/PThNapOx). CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) methods in three or two-electrode system were used to analyze the properties of PGE/PThNapOx in acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4. All electrochemical measurements show that PGE/PThNapOx has better capacitive property than uncoated PGE. PGE/PThNapOx has the highest specific capacitance of 240.08 F g−1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1 by cyclic voltammetry and excellent cycling stability of above 85% after 1000 cycles. Our results demonstrate the potential of PGE/PThNapOx as a promising active material for supercapacitor applications.
