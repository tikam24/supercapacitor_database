Lignin was blended with polyacrylonitrile (PAN) in different ratios and fabricated into carbon nanofiber electrodes by electrospinning followed by thermal stabilization, carbonization and subsequent activation by CO2 of the carbonized mats. These carbon fiber electrodes exhibit high surface area, high mesoporosity, high graphitic content and high electrical conductivity. Activated carbon nanofiber mats derived from PAN:Lignin 70:30 blends display a surface area of 2370 m2g-1 with 0.635 cm3g-1 mesopore volume. These results are due to the selective partial removal of carbonized lignin during the activation step. Coin cell supercapacitors employing these electrodes exhibit 128 Fg-1 specific capacitance, 59 Wh kg-1 energy density and a 15 kW kg-1 power density when operated at 3.5 V using an ionic liquid electrolyte. Since lignin is an inexpensive, abundant, and green polymer, incorporating it into carbon blends enhances the scalability of such materials in energy storage applications.
