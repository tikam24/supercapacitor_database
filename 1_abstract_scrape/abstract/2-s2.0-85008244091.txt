This paper presents a study on a hybrid electric vehicle for mines and other industrial sectors. The power supply system of the vehicle is designed by combining two sources of power: a battery and super-capacitor banks. The benefit of batteries is in sustained energy delivery to enhance energy delivery time, whereas the super-capacitors offer the benefit of short bursts of energy to overcome high power demanding situations. The run-time and maximum performance capabilities of the vehicle were tested in rough terrain conditions typically found in the mining industry. Test results led to conclusions and recommendations which can be valuable for the future research in this area.
