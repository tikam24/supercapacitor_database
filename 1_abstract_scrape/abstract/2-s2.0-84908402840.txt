To solve two critical issues of poor conductivity and low mass loading in pseudocapacitor research, reciprocal multilayer metal oxide/CNT electrodes (MnO2 and MoO3 as examples) are designed through a novel, general alternate deposition strategy. Multilayer metal oxide/CNT electrodes demonstrated significantly larger areal capacitances than those of the control groups. An assembled MnO2/CNT//MoO3/CNT asymmetric supercapacitor operating within an expanded potential window of 1.6V exhibited a very high energy density of 1.7mWh/cm3. These results suggest that the reciprocal alternate deposition strategy has promising potential applications in designing and fabricating positive and negative electrodes for the high-performance supercapacitors and other energy storage devices.
