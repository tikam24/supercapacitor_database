A nanostructured manganese dioxide electrode material was prepared using a solid-reaction route starting with MnCl2·4H2O and NH4HCO3, and its electrochemical performance as a positive electrode for MnO2/activated carbon hybrid supercapacitor with 1 mol·L-1 LiOH electrolyte was reported. The material was proved to be a mixture of nanostructured γ-MnO2 and α-MnO 2 containing some bound water in the structure, which was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, infrared spectrum analysis, and transmission electron microscope observation. Electrochemical properties of the MnO2 electrode and the MnO2/AC capacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance and galvanostatic charge/discharge methods. Experimental results showed that the MnO2 electrode exhibited faradaic pseudocapacitance behavior and higher specific capacitance in 1 mol·L-1 LiOH electrolyte. The MnO2/AC hybrid capacitor with 1 mol·L-1 LiOH electrolyte presented excellent rate charge/discharge ability and cyclic stability. © 2008 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.
