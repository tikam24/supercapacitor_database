Abstract: 2D nanostructured Co 2+ -doped β-Ni(OH) 2 as electrode material for application in redox-type supercapacitors was synthesized by a strategy of nickel complex template. The 2D Co 2+ -doped β-Ni(OH) 2 was produced by the in situ reaction of 2D Co 2+ -doped template in strong alkaline electrolyte solution during electrochemical measurement. Due to the large interface and the promoted conductivity induced by Co 2+ doping, the Co 2+ -doped β-Ni(OH) 2 exhibited high electrochemical performance. It had high specific capacitance of about 2100 F g –1 at low current density of ~2 A g −1 . It also exhibited excellent high rate performance (1259 F g –1 at high current density of 41.7 A g −1 ), much higher than the undoped sample. The results in this work indicated that the Co 2+ -doped β-Ni(OH) 2 could be used as an effective electrode material in redox supercapacitors. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
