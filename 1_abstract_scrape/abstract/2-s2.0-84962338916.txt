In this study, a new type of all-solid-state flexible supercapacitor on chips is fabricated by directly arranging carbon nanotube fibers as interdigital electrodes on polymer substrates. The as-fabricated supercapacitors exhibited excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance of 11.23 F/g at a current density of 0.075 A/g and superior charge/discharge rate performance of up to 20 V/s. The supercapacitors on-chips also showed outstanding flexibility with stable electrochemical functions. The flexible supercapacitor on chips provides real possibilities to the applications of supercapacitors as energy storage units in portable, flexible and wearable electronic devices.
