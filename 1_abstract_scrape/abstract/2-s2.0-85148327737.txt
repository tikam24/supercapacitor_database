Graphene oxide (GO), a fantastic graphene derivative and two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotrope, has many different oxygen-containing groups (-OH, -COOH). Its wide specific surface, high optical transmittance, and high carrier mobility were thought to make it an excellent catalytic support and promoter. Due to its distinct physical and chemical features, researchers from several fields gave it a great deal of attention. Moreover, cellulose is a popular alternative for supporting material not only in the field of wastewater treatment but also in the administration of drugs due to its renewability, wide availability, low cost, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Furthermore, the abundance of hydroxyl groups at the C2, C3, and C6 locations, together with their high reactivity, offer opportunities for chemical modification reactions, making cellulose an excellent candidate for modification for future usage. Additionally, GO and cellulose are hydrophilic because of the abundance of oxygen-containing groups, which enables them to disperse easily in water and organic solvents. The well-integrated GO/cellulose-based composites would be produced by homogeneous mixing of graphene oxide and cellulose in one pot via hydrogen bonds and intermolecular interactions. In this review, we recapitulate the present state-of-the-art production methods for GO/cellulose based hybrid composites, with a specific focus on the properties and the research development in the application of GO/cellulose based hybrid composites for photodegradation of dyes, metal adsorption, sensors, supercapacitors, and biomedical applications. Finally, in light of the current developments, the upcoming challenges are emphasized and discussed. The GO/cellulose based hybrid composites' high performance and versatility open up a wide range of new possibilities for future application research.
