Porous carbon, one of the characteristic materials for electrochemical energy storage devices, has been paid wide-ranging attention. However, balancing the reconcilable mesopore volume with a large specific surface area (SSA) was still a challenge. Herein, a dual-salt-induced activation strategy was developed to obtain a porous carbon sheet with ultrahigh SSA (3082 m2 g-1), desirable mesopore volume (0.66 cm3 g-1), nanosheet morphology, and high surface O (7.87%) and S (4.0%) content. Hence, as a supercapacitor electrode, the optimal sample possessed a high specific capacitance (351 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and excellent rate performance (holding capacitance up to 72.2% at 50 A g-1). Furthermore, the assembled zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor also exhibited superior reversible capacity (142.7 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1) and highly stable cycling (71.2 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 10,000 cycles with retention of 98.9%). This work was delivered a new possibility for the development of coal resources for the preparation of high performance porous carbon materials.
