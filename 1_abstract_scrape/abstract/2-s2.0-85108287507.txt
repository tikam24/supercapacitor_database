In order to meet the load demand of power system, BP based on genetic algorithm is applied to the typical daily load forecasting in summer. The demand change of summer load is analysed. Simulation results show the accuracy of the algorithm. In terms of power supply, the reserves of fossil energy are drying up. According to the prediction of authoritative organizations, the world's coal can be mined for 216 years. As a renewable energy, wind power has no carbon emissions compared with traditional fossil energy. At present, it is generally believed that wind energy and solar energy are green power in the full sense, and they are inexhaustible clean power. The model of wind power solar hydrogen hybrid energy system is established. The control strategy of battery power compensation for delayed power of hydrogen production is adopted, and different operation modes are divided. The simulation results show that the system considering the control strategy can well meet the load demand. Battery energy storage system is difficult to respond to short-term peak power fluctuations. Super capacitor is used to suppress it. This paper studies the battery supercapacitor complementary energy storage system and its control strategy. When the line impedance of each generation unit in power grid is not equal, its output reactive power will be affected by the line impedance and distributed unevenly. A droop coefficient selection method of reactive power sharing is proposed. Energy storage device is needed to balance power and maintain DC voltage stability in the DC side of microgrid. Therefore, a new droop control strategy is proposed. By detecting the DC voltage, dynamically translating the droop characteristic curve, adjusting the output power, maintaining the DC voltage in a reasonable range, reducing the capacity of the DC side energy storage device. Photovoltaic grid connected inverter chooses the new droop control strategy.
