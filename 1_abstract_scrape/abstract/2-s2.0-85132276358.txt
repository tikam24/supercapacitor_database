The excellent electronic conductivity, mechanical properties, superior chemistries, and unique morphologies enable MXene to be a potential candidate for a plethora of applications ranging from sensors and electronic devices to biomedical and electrochemical energy storage. The surfaces functional groups in MXenes lead to high hydrophilicity and are able to react with various species to generate stable colloidal solutions in water. MXenes are widely employed for energy storage applications, including metal ion batteries and electrochemical capacitors (supercapacitors). In this chapter, the application of MXenes in metal-ion batteries and supercapacitors is provided with detailed examples.
