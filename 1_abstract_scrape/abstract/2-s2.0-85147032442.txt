Micro supercapacitors (MSCs) have been a suitable substitute for electrolytic capacitors with higher energy density and potential for integration. However, the microfabrication incompatibility between electrochemical and semiconductor devices hinders further development. Herein, we report an on-chip micro supercapacitor with the porous Ti structure and pseudocapacitive effect, featured by the customizable nanostructure and CMOS-compatible microfabrication processes. The porous electrodes are achieved by sputtering of Ti-Al alloy and selective etching techniques, which offers fast transport paths for ions/electrons and considerable chemical sites of pseudocapacitive material. The thermal oxidation creates an ultra-thin TiO2 pseudocapacitance layer to increase the capacitance density of the MSC. As a result, the device has a specific capacitance of 466 Î¼F/cm2 at a high scan rate of 1 V/s and the potential for mass production and integration in standard foundries.
