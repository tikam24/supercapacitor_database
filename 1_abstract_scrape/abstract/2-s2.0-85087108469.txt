Hierarchical architecture hybrid materials with excellent synergistic effect have been paid close attention for their potential applications in energy storage devices. Herein, we reported an electrode of Co[sbnd]Ni layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanosheets electrodeposited on Co3O4 nanoneedles derived from 2D Co-based metal-organic frameworks (Co-MOFs) combined with flexible carbon cloth (Co[sbnd]Ni LDH@Co3O4@CC) for asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). The Co3O4 nanoneedles served not only as a good pseudocapacitive material but also as an excellent porous skeleton for electrodepositing Co[sbnd]Ni LDH nanosheets. The combination of hierarchical core-branch architecture and heterogeneous structure endowed the Co[sbnd]Ni LDH@Co3O4@CC electrode with superior electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (1021.7 F g−1 at 10 A g−1) and good rate capability. Furthermore, the ASC composed of the Co[sbnd]Ni LDH@Co3O4@CC as a cathode and N-doped porous carbon nanosheets grown on the carbon cloth (NC@CC) as an anode achieved a superior energy density of 33.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 1600 W kg−1 and a long cycle life (93.46% after 10,000 cycles at 4 A g−1). As a result, this work demonstrated an efficient method for rational design and preparation of the hierarchical core-branch architecture hybrid electrodes for supercapacitors.
