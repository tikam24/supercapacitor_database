In this work, implementation of supercapacitor powered electric city bus based mass transit system (Capabus) in Guwahati city has been analysed. Vanadium Redox Batteries (VRBs) are placed at the bus stops and the charging of the super capacitors is done via VRBs whenever a bus stops at the bus stop. The capabuses will be used on a ring road for transportation in Guwahati city. A 33kV or 11kV power line is used to charge these VRBs during off peak hours of the grid. Besides transportation (which will be eco-friendly), these VRBs would also be used to support the grid during peak hours. Hence, Capabus will work in harmony with the distribution network of the city and will serve two purposes: transportation of people and the grid support. In this paper, analysis of implementing the Capabuses and their utilization for the grid support is demonstrated. Â© 2012 IEEE.
