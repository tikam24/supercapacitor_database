In this study, we fabricated a bicontinuous carbon structure (BCS) with high porosity and a loosely connected framework structure. The role of the BCS is to support a concrete supercapacitor active electrode structure. Poly(acrylonitrile) was used as a precursor for the BCS material, which was a porous polymer monolith carbonized by heat treatment (at 1100 °C). The BCS was prepared by mixing with an active material, graphene or an activated carbon. The mixed materials were used as an electrode material in a supercapacitor. The BCS13 + AC sample (∼107.5 F/g) showed a higher specific capacitance than the commercial activated carbon cell (∼76 F/g). The BCS13 + graphene sample (∼75 F/g) also exhibited a higher specific capacitance than the graphene cell (∼49 F/g). This BCS monolith had many macro- and micropores in its structure, enabling fast electrolyte ion movement and excellent electrochemical performance with a low equivalent series resistance (ESR).
