Owing to its low cost, easy fabrication process, and good ionic properties, aqueous supercapacitors are under strong consideration as next-generation energy storage devices. However, the limitation of the current collector is its poor electrochemical stability, leading to low energy storage performance. Therefore, a reasonable design of the current collector and the acidic electrolyte is a necessary, as well as interfacial engineering to enhance the electrochemical performance. In the present study, graphite foil, with excellent electrochemical stability and good electrical properties, is suggested as a current collector of aqueous supercapacitors. This strategy results in excellent electrochemical performance, including a high specific capacitance of 215 F g−1at a current density of 0.1 A g−1, a superior high-rate performance (104 F g−1at a current density of 20.0 A g−1), and a remarkable cycling stability of 98 % at a current density of 10.0 A g−1after 9,000 cycles. The superior energy storage performance is mainly ascribed to the improved ionic diffusion ability during cycling.
