The design and synthesis of innovative materials with a specific architecture are necessary to advance the supercapacitor industry. Recently, transition metal selenides have been identified as an auspicious type of material for energy storage devices due to their enormous electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacitance. Consequently, mono- and diselenides have been extensively investigated. Trimetallic selenides, however, are infrequently reported, and their charge storage mechanism is still not fully understood. Herein, earth-abundant trimetallic Mn-V-Fe selenide (MVF-Se) is successfully fabricated via a two-step hydrothermal approach. The chemical composition, structure, and morphology of the as-synthesized material have been thoroughly characterized. The electrochemical tests revealed that the MVF-Se electrode possesses a high areal capacitance of 16,212.88 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 in the three-electrode configuration. In addition, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor device by coupling MVF-Se and activated carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, demonstrates a desirable 0.56 mWh cm-2 energy density at a 1.0 mW cm-2 power density. After 17,000 charge/discharge cycles, the device exhibits robust cyclic stability with a 95% capacitance retention.
