The development of novel nanostructured electrode materials with high performance and based on abundant elements is a key element in the societal pursuit of sustainable energy. Graphene-based structures with rich macroporosity and high conductive networks are promising components to develop novel electrode materials. Herein, we described a facile procedure to confine Ni(OH)2 particles in a graphene film, leading to a new sandwich-like hybrid structure. The hybrid film offers simultaneously ordered ion diffusion channels and high electrical conductivity, which facilitate the improvement of both electrode kinetics and electrochemical stability, thus leading to high capacitance, fast rate capability, and stable cycle life as supercapacitor materials. This work provides a facile pathway for optimized structures for electrode materials, and represents a benefit for the global issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution. Sandwich-like structures: Confinement of Ni(OH)2 particles in a graphene film has resulted in a new sandwich-like structure with excellent electrode kinetics and electrochemical stability. This system is a promising candidate for supercapacitor materials (see figure). Copyright Â© 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
