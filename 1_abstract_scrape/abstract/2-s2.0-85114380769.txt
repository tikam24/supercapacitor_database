To meet the market demand for supercapacitors with large capacitance and high stability, we successfully prepared a new type of composit material of N−C@Zn0.76Co0.24S with a hierarchical structure utilizing solvothermal and calcination. The nanostructures and electrochemical properties of the samples were tested and analyzed. By adjusting the mass ratio of the N-doped carbon microsphere during the process of synthesizing composite materials, a series of comparative materials were obtained. The result of research shows that, when the mass ratio of the N-doped carbon microsphere in the composite was 55 %, the nanocomposite demonstrated excellent specific capacitance (2033.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1) and strong cycle performance (retain 88.4 % after 5000 charge-discharge cycles), far superior to that of the single metal sulfide coating on N-doped carbon microsphere. When assembled into N−C@ZCS//AC asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), the ASC exhibits a large energy density of 79.6 Wh kg−1 while the power density is 799.7 W kg−1, proving the composite materials have positive significance in the application of supercapacitors.
