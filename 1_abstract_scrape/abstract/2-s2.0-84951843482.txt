A new hybrid system of a tracked bulldozer is designed, which primarily consists of an engine-generator set, a battery pack, and a supercapacitor. According to the power requirements of typical working conditions and the output feature of three power sources, a fuzzy control and wavelet transform-based energy management strategy is proposed. Models of the hybrid system are built in Matlab/Simulink and are then transformed into C codes, which are sent to dSPACE. The energy management strategy is verified through HILS (hardware in loop simulation), which demonstrates that the designed strategy is good for increasing the fuel efficiency of the engine and prolonging the working life of the battery pack, which can be used in the real-time control of the hybrid tracked bulldozer.
