Metalloids [Boron (B), Silicon (Si)] and Non -metals [Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulfur (S)] doped graphene nanosheets were considered for alternative lightweight electrode materials in energy storage device applications. The density functional theory studies were performed to investigate the structural stability, charge density distribution, excessive surface charge density, and quantum capacitance of doped graphene nanosheets. It is found that the structures are stable with negative formation energy, and the graphene nanosheet doped with P and S shows protrusion forming a pyramidal shape along the planar graphene nanosheet to maintain stability. Further, the doping of atoms into the graphene nanosheet introduced a minimal bandgap with a shift in the Fermi level, either into the conduction band or valence band, depending on the dopant type. This appearance of bandgap is attributed to the breaking of the symmetry in the graphene sublattice. Meanwhile, based on the type and concentration of dopant, localized and delocalized states are formed near the Fermi level. It is also found that the formation of a localized state near the Fermi level has profoundly improved the excessive surface charge density and quantum capacitance. The S – doped graphene nanosheet was observed to exhibit an excellent quantum capacitance of 38.88 μFcm−2 compared to all other structures and it can be used as a suitable light-weight electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors.
