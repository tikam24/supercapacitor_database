Although Fe3O4has high capacity, its low conductivity and poor cycling stability have limited its application in supercapacitors. To address this issue, the core-shell structured Fe3O4@polypyrrole (Fe3O4@PPy) composite materials could be selectively prepared to improve the conductivity of hybrid materials. When used as an electrode material for supercapacitors, the resulting Fe3O4@PPy composite material shows a high specific capacitance of 290.2 F g−1at a current density of 1 A g−1. To further improve the energy density, the asymmetric coin supercapacitor (Fe3O4@PPy//MoO3) has been assembled and it exhibits a high energy density of 26.6 W h kg−1as well as a power density of 700 W kg−1, which are much higher than those of the traditional capacitor. Moreover, the asymmetric coin supercapacitor presents excellent cycling stability with 84% of capacity retention after 5000 cycles. Therefore, the present method provides a promising strategy for the production of advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors.
