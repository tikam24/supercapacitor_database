A novel top-down approach for ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) MnO2 nanosheets preparation in stirred media mill as an active electrode material for supercapacitors is reported in this work. The milling behavior with time was analyzed, followed by the electrochemical analysis of a milled sample. The XRD peak shows that crystallinity of prepared 2D MnO2 nanosheets decreased. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) depicted a plate-like structure of a few hundred-nanometer lateral dimension. High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HR-TEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) further confirmed the formation of 2D MnO2 nanosheets. The cyclic voltammetry gave the specific capacitance of 356.11 F/g.
