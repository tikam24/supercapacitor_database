Activated carbon is widely used for supercapacitor electrode material due to its large specific surface area and low cost. However,precursors often need to be pre-carbonized / oxidized to improve the stability in the preparation of activated carbon. Thus,the high preparation cost and process complexity inhibits the practical application. Herein,we proposed a one-step chemical activation method to prepare activated carbon with high specific surface area and conductivity using a highly cross-linked phenolic resin as the precursor. At the optimized KOH to carbon mass ratio of 3 âˆ¶ 1,the specific surface area of the activated carbon was as high as 2 656 m2.g-1. When used as the electrode materials for supercapaci-tors,it showed a high capacitance of 305. 5 F.g-1 at 1 A.g-1 and an outstanding rate performance of 63. 8% capacitance retention at 50 A.g-1 in 6 mol.L-1 KOH electrolyte,which were much higher than the commercial activated carbon. In addition,it still remains good capacitance,rate performance and cycle stability at high electrode mass loadings,showing great potential for practical application.
