A freestanding carbonized wood (CW)-based electrode (CW@CoNiP-C) is fabricated by phosphating a CoNi-metal organic framework on the CW channels. The obtained composite has CoNiP nanoparticles and hierarchical pores and as a result it exhibits an areal capacitance of 2630 mF/cm2 at 5 mA/cm2. More importantly, due to the porous CW and carbon wrapping on CoNiP, CW@CoNiP-C shows a good rate capacitive performance and an excellent cycling performance (the capacitance retention is 87.5% after 5000 cycles). This work provides some designing knowledge for the synthesis of high-performance electrodes using natural woods and metal organic frameworks.
