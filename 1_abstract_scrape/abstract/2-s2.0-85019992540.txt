In this work, a facile one-pot solvothermal route has been employed in preparing the clustered network-like Ni3S2-Co9S8 on Ni foam substrate (Ni3S2-Co9S8/NF) worked as electrode of supercapacitor. Ni3S2-Co9S8/Ni foam obtained showed a high specific capacitance of 5.37 F cm2 at a current density of 5 mA cm2. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor has been assembled using Ni3S2-Co9S8/NF as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The resulting Ni3S2-Co9S8/NF//AC device exhibited a high energy density of 17 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.4 kW kg−1 with good cycling performance (80% of the initial capacitance retention after 1000 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance can be attributed to the combined contribution of both component and unique clustered network-like. The results demonstrate that the Ni3S2-Co9S8/NF is promising as electrode material for supercapacitors in energy storage.
