Super capacitor energy storage system(SCESS) with high power, long life, wide operating temperature range, is widely used in industrial applications. The balancing system is needed to ensure the operation safety of the SCESS. In this paper, the balancing system based on active clamped forward converter is designed. The active clamped forward converter is based on synchronous rectifier technology with peak current control strategy which can output low voltage, high current with high efficiency. The converter with 2.5V output voltage, 20A output current is designed and realized, the efficiency of which can reach 90% Then the designed converter is used in super capacitor balancing system, and the control strategy of the balancing system is studied. The experimental results show that the proposed super capacitor balancing system can achieve the balancing of super capacitors.
