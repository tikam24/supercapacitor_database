Solid solutions from (1 - x) ZnMn 2O 4/ (x) MgFe 2O 4 (x = 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0) were obtained by a simple sol–gel procedure. A single-phase tetragonal spinel zinc manganite was identified by X-ray phase analysis for the samples x = 0.0 and 0.1, whereas a single-phase cubic spinel magnesium ferrite was identified for x = 0.5, 0.9, and 1.0. The formation of these phases was confirmed by the analysis of FTIR absorption spectra measured for the obtained samples. A scanning electron microscope was used to identify the different elements in the formed solid solution. Transmission electron microscope together with Rietveld profile method emphasized the nano-nature of the obtained samples. The influence of the composition parameter (x) on the optical properties of the solid solutions was explored utilizing UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The magnetic measurements revealed the conversion of the paramagnetic nature of ZnMn2O4 samples into ferromagnetic nature as it couples with MgFe2O4 sample in (1 - x) ZnMn 2O 4/ (x) MgFe 2O 4 solid solution. The supercapacitor performance of all samples was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies.
