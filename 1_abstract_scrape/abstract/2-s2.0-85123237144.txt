Hybrid nano-arrays with 3D porous interconnected structures are attractive for application in electrode materials to effectively improve electrochemical performance, but the fine structure with excellent electrochemical performance is very challenging. Herein, through using abutilon leaves with a natural biomimetic structure, a highly interconnected 3D dual-activated porous carbon (CeO2/ANPC) is designed. Benefiting from the co-doping of N, P, and Ce, the prepared CeO2/ANPC hybrid material exhibits an outstanding specific capacitance of 550 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, and excellent cycle stability (after 10,000 cycles, loss rate is 7.2%). More importantly, the symmetrical supercapacitor assembled with CeO2/ANPC hybrid material shows a remarkable high energy density of 63 Wh kg−1 at 311 W kg−1due to the vacancy defect effect activated by pre-embedded N, P, and CeO2. The result indicates the simple sequential multi-step strategy provides an opportunity to manufacture biomimetic porous nanomaterials, which have an immeasurable role in the domain of energy storage and conversion.
