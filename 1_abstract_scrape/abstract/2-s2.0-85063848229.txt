Novel Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles were synthesized using eggshell membrane as a template. The prepared nanoparticles were calcined at 800 Â°C and subjected to XRD measurement that reveals the formation of cubic structure with average grain size of 67 nm. From FTIR study, the lower vibrational band appearing in the range of 560-680 cm -1 confirms the presence of Mn 2 O 3 in the synthesized samples. The morphology analysis of the synthesized nanoparticles shows the presence of pores inside the grain boundaries. Electrochemical performances of the synthesized nanoparticles were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and AC impedance analysis. From the results, the prepared nanoparticles show pseudocapacitive characteristics. The maximum specific capacitance of Mn 2 O 3 nanoparticles was found to be 394 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV s -1 . Nyquist plot shows lower value of charge transfer resistance, indicating the good electrical conductivity of the Mn 2 O 3 electrode which accounts for the improved electrochemical performance of the supercapacitors.
