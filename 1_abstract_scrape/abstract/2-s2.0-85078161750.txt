In the present work, TiO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized using the sol-gel method and further being annealed at different temperatures to study the influence of temperature on structural, morphological and dielectric properties of TiO2. Owing to its peculiar physical properties, it has found various applications and been an interactive material for research in the field of semiconductor physics. To study crystallographic nature of prepared TiO2 nano-particles x-ray diffraction study was done. The result shows that on increasing the annealing temperature, the structure of TiO2 nanoparticles changes from anatase phase to the mixed anatase-rutile phase. The spectroscopic study done using FTIR reveals tetragonal arrangement of Ti and O ions in the TiO2 nanoparticles. The morphological study of samples was done by SEM technique. The SEM images show that the particle size of TiO2 nanocrystals increased as a result of increasing annealing temperature. In addition, EDS study confirmed that no impurities were present in the samples. Dielectrics properties were measured at different frequencies ranging from 20 Hz to 5 MHz at room temperature. It is found that the TiO2 nanoparticles possess a higher value of dielectric constant and lower dielectric loss at 1 kHz. The novelty in this work is that the modified preparative conditions of TiO2 nanoparticles yield better and optimized properties related to the crystal structure, morphology, and dielectric behavior for application in optoelectronic devices, super-capacitors, spintronics, and other dielectric applications.
