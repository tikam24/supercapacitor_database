A concise description of density functional theory (DFT) and its application to study the properties of materials used as electrodes in the lithium-ion battery (LIB) is reported in this chapter. DFT is based on the assumption that the material properties of a many-particle system can be obtained from the information of ground-state electronic density derived from the wave function representing the system. Among material properties, the structural stability of the transfer of ions through/from the material can be studied. Simulation of electronic structure would indicate (i) electronic bandgap, (ii) redox-active ion, (iii) atomic orbital responsible for electronic conductivity, etc. Electrochemical property, namely, voltage appeared on Li-ion intercalation/de-intercalation can be studied. The diffusion path of Li-ion and the corresponding diffusion barrier can also be estimated. Apart from LIB, a brief description of supercapacitors is also documented. Supercapacitors are of two types: (i) electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and (ii) pseudocapacitor. EDLC stores energy by creating a double layer of positive and negative ions at both the interface of electrode and electrolyte, whereas pseudocapacitor stores energy by Faradic mass transfer. Properties of EDLC and pseudocapacitor can be estimated by using classical DFT and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.
