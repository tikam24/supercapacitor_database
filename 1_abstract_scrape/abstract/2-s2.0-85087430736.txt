Porous carbon materials have become one research hotspot due to their excellent electrical conductivity, superior stability and low cost. Using phenol, formaldehyde and melamine as raw materials, a high concentration of zinc chloride was used to provide a super-salt environment. After solvothermal reaction, a nitrogen-containing carbon aerogel(NCA) was obtained by pyrolysis at 800℃ in nitrogen. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) results demonstrate that the NCA sample has hierarchically honeycomb-like structure and its specific surface area reaches 729.6 m²/g. The as-prepared NCA, when tested in three-electrode system as supercapacitor electrode, exhibits a high specific capacitance of 350.7 F/g at 1 A/g and outstanding cycling stability with 97.8 % of the initial capacitance retained after 10000 cycles at 20 A/g in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4. Moreover, symmetric supercapacitor based on the NCA electrodes could deliver an impressively high energy density of 26.8 (W•h)/kg at a power density of 800 W/kg. Therefore, NCA is one promising material that can be used in supercapacitors.
