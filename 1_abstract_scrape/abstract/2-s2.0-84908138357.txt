A quasi-cubic Fe3O4@rGO composite (CFGC) was facily fabricated to investigate its supercapacitor performance, based on a colloid electrostatic self-assembly process between positively charged Fe(OH)3 colloid nanoparticles and negatively charged GO sheets. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that quasi-cubic Fe3O4 nanoparticles with diameters of about 10-20 nm were loaded onto the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO), which was also characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Interestingly, CFGC exhibited an admirable rate property with a high capacitance of 216.7 F g-1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte that could be used as electrode material for superior supercapacitors.
