Newly defect-regulating superstructured carbon intrinsically possesses distinct morphologies and stable properties at the nano/microscale. However, realizing the efficient controllable construction of self-assembled superstructured carbon at the atomic level is still a major challenge because of its unprecedented architectural complexity. In this study, we report a self-assembly defect-regulating platform to efficiently fabricate hierarchically defect-regulating superstructured carbon (DRSC) with a higher degree of structural order and abundant internal channels using a self-defected ramie precursor and self-assembled Mg atoms synergistically. Such hierarchically ordered superstructured carbon guarantees an accessible specific surface area (SSA) for improving ion transfer efficiency. For energy storage applications, the as-developed supercapacitors delivered a high energy density of 72.7 Wh⋅kg–1 at a power density of 1.75 kW⋅kg–1. Even at an elevated temperature of 100 °C, DRSC-based supercapacitors simultaneously delivered a high power density of 175 kW⋅kg–1 and a high energy density of 47.6 Wh⋅kg–1. This work is a vital step toward complex superstructured carbon from simple low-dimensional nanocarbons, promoting their extended application in electrochemistry and catalysis.
