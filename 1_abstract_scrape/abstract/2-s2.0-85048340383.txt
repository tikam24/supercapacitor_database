We develop a fast and cost effective method for the fabrication of a nanocomposite supercapacitor electrode. In this study aluminum foils were decorated with vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNT) via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, which was followed by the electrodeposition of polyaniline (PANI) layer on top of the VACNTs. Electrochemical behavior of the fabricated nanocomposite electrodes were evaluated through cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge discharge cycles and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy method. Fabricated VACNT/PANI nanocomposite electrodes through 15 electrodeposition cycles showed significant electrochemical performance. The specific capacity of these electrodes was calculated as 16.17 mF/cm2 at a current density of 0.25 mA/cm2.
