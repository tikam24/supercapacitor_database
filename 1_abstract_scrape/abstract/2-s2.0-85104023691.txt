Carbonyl-functionalized carbon porous leaves modifying carbon channels have been reportedviasingle-step wood carbonization. A redox reaction between carbonyl and cupric chloride endows the freestanding electrode with an ultrahigh area specific capacitance of 13.1 F cm−2(30 mA cm−2) and over 99.6% retention after 45 000 cycles in supercapacitors.
