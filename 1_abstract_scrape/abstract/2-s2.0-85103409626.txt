Today, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been increasingly used in many technological and industrial sectors, as well as in the textile industry; In fact, the application of these anionic clays with lamellar structure and their composites in the textile industry offers consumers and manufacturers new opportunities. The objective of the current paper is to give a concise overview about recent researches considering the application of LDH in the textile industry as well as in nanofibers. In this review, firstly, the recent applications of LDHs and their composites as promising adsorbents and/or efficient photocatalyst in the textile dyeing wastewater treatment have been reviewed. Since LDHs have been playing an important role in the design of wearable electronics, the applications of different fibers for creating and developing textile energy storage devices have been presented. In the following, the applications of LDHs for creating textiles with other special features such as UV protection, flame retardancy, and On-demand personal thermal management and also the applications of metal oxide/LDH composite in the textile industry are mentioned. In addition, since nanofibers can be considered as attractive aspects in textile academic circles, new opportunities provided by the synchronous application of LDHs and nanofibers in different areas including medical applications, environmental applications, the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, and high-performance supercapacitor electrode have been introduced. Finally, future trends and prospects are provided.
