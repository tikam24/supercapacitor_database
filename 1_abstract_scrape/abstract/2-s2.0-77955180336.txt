Functionalized graphene sheets were produced by microwave-induced exfoliation of graphene oxide. Exfoliation happens when the oxygen-containing groups decomposed into CO2 and H2O by microwave-heal, thus yielding pressures that exceed the Van der Waals attraction between the layers. X-ray diffraction, FTIR, SEM, TEM and nitrogen adsorption-desorption were used to characterize the samples. Scanning electron microscopy images show that the sample possesses nanoporous structures. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy characterization proves the existence of a few functional groups on the surface of graphene sheets. The results of nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis indicate that the sample has high BET surface area (412.9 m2·; g-1) and large pore volume (1.91 cm3·-1) . The electrochemical tests show that the sample has good electrochemical capacitive behavior and high specific capacitance values about 207.5 F·-I in aqueous KOH.
