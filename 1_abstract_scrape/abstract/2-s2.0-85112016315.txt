Graphene oxide was derived from Lagenaria Siceraria peel and the ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized using the green synthesis method. Zn1â€“xO-rGOx was synthesized with different concentrations (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3) that were referred as S1, S2, and S3, respectively. The rGO-ZnO nanoparticles have been characterized with XRD, DLS, zeta potential, FTIR, FT-Raman, UV, SEM, TEM, EDAX and mapping analysis. The charge storage, cycle stability of the rGO-ZnO nanoparticles were explored using cyclic voltammetry. The highest specific capacitance for nanoparticles was determined to be 371, 382 and 398 F/g for S1, S2, and S3 at the scan rate close to 10 mV/s.
