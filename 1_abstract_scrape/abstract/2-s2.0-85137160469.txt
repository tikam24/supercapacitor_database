This paper reports an electrochemical supercapacitor with CdSe electrode synthesized by a simple and economical electrodeposition method. The purpose of setting the deposition time from 20 to 50 min is to study the influence of deposition time on the electrochemical performance of CdSe electrodes. The synthesis of CdSe was confirmed by a few characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The electrochemical properties of the CdSe were estimated by galvanostatic charge-discharge, electrochemical impedance and cyclic voltammetry. It was proved that the best electrochemical performance of the CdSe electrode deposited for 40 min. The as-prepared CdSe electrodes (40 min) exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1542 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2. The capacitance retention of CdSe (40 min) after 1000 cycles remains 78.9 % at 3 mA/cm2. Moreover, the symmetrical aqueous supercapacitor and a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor were assembled with CdSe (40 min) electrodes, respectively. The two capacitors of the same type in series can light up the LED, indicating that CdSe has a certain practical application in energy storage.
