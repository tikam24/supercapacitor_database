A series of spinels Li1+xMn2-xO4 (0≤x≤0.33) was prepared by the wet chemistry technique using succinic acid as a chelating agent. Precursors were decomposed at 400°C and formation of the spinel structure was completed upon annealing in air at about 750°C SEM revealed well crystallized grains of average size about 70 nm, in agreement with crystallite size calculated from broadening of the X-ray reflections. Impedance spectra measured with sputtered gold electrodes were analyzed by the least-squares fitting of a complex function representing conductivity and dielectric properties of the spinels. Temperature dependence of the electrical parameters confirmed that charge carriers are small polarons. In the case of LiMn2O4, effects of charge ordering on conductivity and dielectric relaxation were studied. Magnetization measurements on a SQUID and electron spin resonance spectra provided information about magnetic ordering and impurities. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
