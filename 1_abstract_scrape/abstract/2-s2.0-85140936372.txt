Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as one-dimensional nanomaterials with lightweight and perfect connections in their hexagon structure are excellent candidates for a wide range of applications due to their unique properties. These properties include a very large surface area to volume ratios and large aspect ratios, excellent electrical conductivities, high chemical stability, and so on. Therefore, CNTs have become one of the most widely employed nanomaterials and there is a great deal of attention focused on CNTs in many fields. One field of specific interest is their application in electrical devices. This chapter, firstly, reviews the structure, advantages, and disadvantages for a general understanding of CNT and then focuses on the application of CNTs in a variety of electronic devices such as lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and solar cells.
