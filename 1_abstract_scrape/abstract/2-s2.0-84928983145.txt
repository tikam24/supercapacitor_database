A dynamically stretchable solid state supercapacitor using graphene woven fabric (GWF) as electrode materials is designed and evaluated. The electrode is developed after GWF film is transferred onto a pre-stretched polymer substrate. Polyaniline is deposited covering the GWF film through in-situ electropolymerization to improve the electrochemical properties of the electrode. The supercapacitor is assembled in sandwich structure and packaged in polymer and its electrochemical performance is investigated under both static and dynamic stretching modes. The stretchable supercapacitors possess excellent static and dynamic stretchability. The dynamic strain can be up to 30% with excellent galvanic stability even under high strain rates (up to 60%/s).
