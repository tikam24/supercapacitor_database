In this paper, a DCM DC-DC buck converter for charging supercapacitor is proposed. The buck converter consists of compensator for gain and frequency compensation, pulsewidth modulation(PWM) control logic for switch control, clock generator, and soft start-up to reduce the inrush current of an inductor during the initial operation of the converter. The DCM DC-DC buck converter is designed with 0.18um BCDMOS process. Output voltage is set to be 1.8V for the input voltage of 2.8âˆ¼ 5V. For the switching frequency of 1MHz, measured maximum efficiency is 92.6% for 1mF load capacitor and 100mA load current.
