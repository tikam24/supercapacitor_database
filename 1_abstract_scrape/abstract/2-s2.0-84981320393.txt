A nanocomposite containing α-Fe2O3nanoparticles entangled with reduced graphene oxide nanosheets have been synthesized via simple hydrothermal and ultra-sonication method. It is observed that graphene nanosheets enhanced the electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity of α-Fe2O3nanoparticles. The superior electrical conductivity of α- Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite was confirmed by two probe current-voltage (I-V) measurements. The enhanced electrochemical activity of α- Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite was confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and cyclic voltammetry experiments. It is observed that as-prepared α- Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite has superior charge-transfer resistance and higher specific capacitance than bare α-Fe2O3nanoparticles. Moreover, nanocomposite retained 75% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. Due to tremendous electrochemical performance, the α- Fe2O3/rGO nanocomposite have potential applications in energy storage devices.
