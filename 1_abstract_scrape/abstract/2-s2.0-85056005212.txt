Metal nitrides have great potential for electrochemical energy storage, but are relatively scarcely investigated. Herein, a novel metal nitride, Co 3 N, is prepared by nitridation using a Co 3 O 4 precursor heated at 500 Â°C for 2 h in flowing NH 3 , and characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) methods. Besides, the electrochemical properties of Co 3 N are investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The as-prepared Co 3 N demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 112.3 F g -1 at a current density of 0.5 A g -1 , good rate capability (72.4%, from 0.5 to 5 A g -1 ) and superior cycling stability (109.7% retention over 10,000 cycles at a current density of 2 A g -1 ). Finally, a Co 3 N//activated carbon (AC) asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is successfully assembled by using Co 3 N and AC as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively. The as-fabricated ASC device can achieve a maximum energy density of 12.1 W h kg -1 at a power density of 204.6 W kg -1 , which shows that the Co 3 N material should be a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
