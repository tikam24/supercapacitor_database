In this study, a facile one-step carbonization was developed for producing B and N co-doped carbon through waterborne polyurethane, phenolic resin, and graphene oxide composite (nWPGC) used as electrode materials in supercapacitors. Furthermore, nitrogen-enriched carbon also had repetitive urethane bond (-NHCOO) in waterborne polyurethane (nWPU). Moreover, we used the ferric chloride treatment and washing method to remove the B–N bonds. The fabricated B/N co-doped carbon had a high specific capacitance of 356.3 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, with the surface area, and pore volume (611 m2 g−1 and 0.3 cm3 g−1). The assembled nWPGC-Fe-B//nWPGC-Fe-B symmetric supercapacitor exhibited an energy density of 10.35 Wh kg−1 was achieved at a power density of 493.2 W kg−1. On top of that, the capacitor also maintained a well rate capability and brilliant cyclic stability of 89.78% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles.
