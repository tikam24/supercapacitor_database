Porous structure of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) plays an important role in developing flexible graphene-based devices. In this work, we report a novel methodology for reduction of freestanding graphite oxide (GO) sheet by picosecond pulse laser direct writing in liquid nitrogen. Non-agglomerate and porous structure of rGO is fabricated successfully due to frozen effect during laser processing. Compared with laser-irradiated rGO developed in N 2 gas at ambient environment, the frozen rGO developed in liquid N 2 shows better ordered structure with less defects, crack-free morphology as well as better electron supercapacitor performance including 50-60
