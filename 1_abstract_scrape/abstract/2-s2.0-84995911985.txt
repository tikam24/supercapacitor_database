A three-dimensional (3D) graphene/Nickel oxide (ERGO/NiO) composite electrode have been fabricated directly on a Nickel foam substrate via a one-step electrochemical co-deposition in an aqueous solution containing Nickel nitrate and GO. By using this simple and one-step electrochemical deposition, it is possible to produce binder-free composite electrodes with improved electrochemical properties using a low-cost, facile and scalable technique. It is observed from FE-SEM images that graphene oxide sheets affect the electrodeposition of nickel oxide. The optimized ErGO/NiO electrode developed in this work exhibits high charge storage capacity with a specific capacitance of 1715.5 F g−1 at current density 2 A g−1 and hierarchical morphological structure which facilitates electrolyte diffusion to the electrode surface. A good cycling stability was observed for the modified electrodes in alkaline media. EIS measurements showed low values of internal resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) for the modified electrodes, indicating that the prepared nanocomposite is appropriate for supercapacitor applications in comparison to NiO/NF electrode.
