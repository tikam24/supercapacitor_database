This work adopts the colloidal nanoparticles as a model for research due to the prominent specific surface area of colloidal nanoparticles. There was a hypothesis that cations uniformly distributed in the conductive carbon and binder. Electrolyte ion can interact with cations to form reactive colloidal clusters in situ. Herein, the electro- chemical method was adapted to synthesize different iron based electrode materials by the changes of electrolyte. Fe- based electrodes exhibited specific capacitances of 1 113, 927 and 755 F.g-1in KOH, NaOH and LiOH aqueous electrolyte, respectively. A novel type of colloid systems with adjustable structure was built, achieving multiscale controllable regulation of colloid structure and material performance. By extending the colloid model, a novel meth- od of in situ composition adjustment to cross-scale control of material properties was provided.
