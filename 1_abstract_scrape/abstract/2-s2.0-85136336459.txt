This paper illustrates the behavior and analysis of charging and discharging of a supercapacitor connected to a photovoltaic system. Here, a quasi Z-source DC to DC power converter is used as the interfacing power circuit to condition the PV power. The mathematical and SIMULINK models of the supercapacitor, PV, and converter are presented. The SIMULINK model of the MPPT algorithm is also explained. Perturb and Observe technique is used to arrive the maximum power region. The simulation results are presented and examined to evidence that the maximum power is harvested. It also showed that the energy storage is achieved with supercapacitor.
