This paper presents a simplified nonlinear estimation technique based on the differential flatness control strategy combined with a single-loop feedback control. An experiment setting that is hybridized between two power sources, namely, a 500-W fuel cell (FC) emulator and a 165-F supercapacitor (SC) module, was used to validate the proposed technique. Each power source was connected to a two-phase interleaved boost converter, which distributes voltage-regulated dc supplied by the hybrid power source. A dSPACE 1103 controller card interfaced the hybrid system and the control algorithm with the mathematical environment of MATLAB-Simulink. The experimental results showed the rapid response of the proposed system to the dynamic load requirement. This confirmed that the single-loop fullflatness feedback control is a potential algorithm that offers stabilization of the hybrid system sourced by FC and SC.
