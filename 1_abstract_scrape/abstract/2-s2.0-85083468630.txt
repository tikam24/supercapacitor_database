Carbon materials have widely been used to enhance the performance of a plethora of supercapacitor electrode materials. In this regard, it is crucial to identify carbon materials that function over a wide pH range while enjoying a wide potential window. Herein, the DFT calculations were used to elucidate the electronic performance of C76 and the C76/electrolyte interface. The electronic investigation revealed the nature of the conductivity and charge storage mechanism of C76 based on the bandgap and quantum capacitance calculations. Also, the electrochemical and electronic properties of fullerene C76 have been extensively investigated over a wide pH range; acidic H2SO4, basic KOH, and neutral Na2SO4. The results showed a promising performance in the three electrolytes. Moreover, C76 electrodes exhibited a potential window of 1.9 V in Na2SO4 electrolyte, resulting in capacitances of 171 F/g and 142 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s in the positive and negative potential windows, respectively. The material showed a pseudocapacitance performance of 65 % in Na2SO4 electrolyte in the positive potential window. We believe higher fullerenes provide a new class of materials for developing versatile supercapacitor devices for efficient energy storage.
