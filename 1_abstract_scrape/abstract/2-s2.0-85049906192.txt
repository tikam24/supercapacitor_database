To solve the problem of power allocation of battery and super capacitor in the composite energy storage system of electric vehicles, we propose the logic threshold and fuzzy control strategy to arrange battery and super capacitor to supply the average and peak power to the load, respectively. Based on the simulation software of electric vehicles, we perform simulation modelling to analyse the current of the battery, the SOC of battery and the current of the super capacitor. For verifying the feasibility of the control strategy, we set up an experimental platform to study pure electric vehicles during driving and braking. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the composite energy storage system can reduce the charging and discharging times and the current amplitude of the battery, and improve the utilisation ratio of regenerative braking energy and the mileage of electric vehicles.
