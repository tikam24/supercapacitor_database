Two types of homogeneous NiCo2O4 nanosheet@NiCo 2O4 nanorod and heterogeneous NiCo2O 4 nanosheet@NiO nanoflake hierarchical core-shell arrays are synthesized via facile solution methods in combination with a simple thermal treatment. In both cases, the NiCo2O4 nanosheets serve as the core backbone for anchoring the shell materials. The two as-prepared hierarchical nanoarrays are evaluated as supercapacitor electrodes and demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance (1925 and 2210 F g-1 for NiCo2O4@NiCo 2O4 and NiCo2O4@NiO at 0.5 A g -1, respectively), good rate capability, and superior cycling stability. The superior capacitive performance is mainly due to the unique hierarchical core-shell architecture with faster ion/electron transfer, improved reactivity, and enhanced structural stability. Our work can allow for the fabrication of various NiCo2O4 nanosheet supported hierarchical nanostructures for applications in energy storage, catalysis, and sensing.
