A hybrid aerogel, composed of MoS2 sheets of 1T (distorted octahedral) and 2H (trigonal prismatic) phases, finely mixed with few layers of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and obtained by means of a facile environment-friendly hydrothermal cosynthesis, is proposed as electrode material for supercapacitors. By electrochemical characterizations in three- and two-electrode configurations and symmetric planar devices, unique results have been obtained, with specific capacitance values up to 416 F g-1 and a highly stable capacitance behavior over 50000 charge-discharge cycles. The in-depth morphological and structural characterizations through field emission scanning electron microscopy, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, and transmission electron microscopy analysis provides the proofs of the unique assembly of such 3D structured matrix. The unpacked MoS2 structure exhibits an excellent distribution of 1T and 2H phase sheets that are highly exposed to interaction with the electrolyte, and so available for surface/near-surface redox reactions, notwithstanding the quite low overall content of MoS2 embedded in the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) matrix. A comparison with other "more conventional" hybrid rGO-MoX2 electrochemically active materials, synthesized in the same conditions, is provided to support the outstanding behavior of the cosynthesized rGO-MoS2.
