This paper addresses DC microgrid stability by deploying a PV system with integrated energy storage. The integrated energy storage contains battery and supercapacitors for which the battery satisfies the normal load requirement and supercapacitor to fulfill the requirement of a transient load by saving battery life from unwanted charging and discharging cycles. In the conventional design method, a supercapacitor is observed only at the rated voltage. Generally, the supercapacitor voltage decreases because of self-discharge and it is observed that the typical controller design strategy will make microgrid unstable at low supercapacitor voltage. Proposed system is working on a low voltage of supercapacitors and observes the stability of DC microgrid under this condition. Also, this system works in all the designed operating modes. So, the complete performance of microgrids is investigated and adequate system operating conditions with stability are verified. Finally, the structure is verified through simulation and test results..
