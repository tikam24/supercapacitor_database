We report here a versatile fabrication approach of graphene foam (GF) with three dimensional (3D) porous conductive networks which reveal great potential for application in energy storage devices. This facile fabrication technique is believed to be favorable for supercapacitor application as the 3DGF comprises conductive continuous porous networks with large active surface area. Supercapacitors utilize this high surface area electrode to attain improved capacitance. The resulting graphene foam exhibited satisfactory double layer capacitive behavior with improved electrochemical performance having good electrochemical cycling stability and high specific capacitance of 310 F g-1 at current density of 5 A g-1 and 160 F g-1 at current density of 20 A g-1.
