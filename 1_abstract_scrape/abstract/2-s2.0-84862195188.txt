One pot run mass-production of polyaniline (PANI) nanorice is carried out using a simple room temperature ingenious low temperature wet-chemical method. Different bondings are identified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Crystalline structure, due to presence of well-defined rings in selected area electron diffraction pattern, and nanorice morphology, from the scanning electorn miscropy photoimages, of as-prepared PANI are confirmed. Using high-resolution trasmission electron microscopy digital photoimage 0.46 nm and 0.37 nm fringe widths are monitored. Surface area of 41.06 m 2g -1 is justified from the adsorption-desorption isotherms. The PANI nanorice electrode reveals 17.33 W h kg -1 energy density and the 480 W kg -1 power density due to significant inner charge contribution (68.28 C g -1) compared to outer charge.
