Ultrathin nanorods self-assembled porous nanoflowers to form hierarchical mesoporous beta-manganese dioxide (β-MnO2) with extremely high specific surface areas of >400 m2 g−1 are fabricated in high yield at room temperature in a simple 1,2-butanediol/KMnO4 system. As supercapacitor electrodes, specific capacitances of as-prepared β-MnO2 nanoflowers can reach 500-430 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolytes. And greatly enhanced rate capability of 66.4% at 20 A g−1 with a good cycling stability of 95.5% (10 A g−1, after 5000 cycles) is obtained by reducing the particle size of β-MnO2 nanoflowers with well-defined morphologies, which can be achieved by regulating the molar ratios of the reactants. In view of its easy preparation, the as-prepared β-MnO2 is considered as a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitor electrode material.
