In this study, high-performance Li-ion hybrid supercapacitors (LIHSs) were realized by the sophisticated design of nanostructured electrode pairs demonstrating both energy and kinetic balance. Microporous pyroprotein nanoplates (M-PNPs) were fabricated by a controlled pyrolysis process using potassium hydroxide, to achieve high electrochemical performance in the cathodic voltage region of 2.0–4.5 V vs. Li+/Li. M-PNP/T-Nb2O5 nanocomposites obtained by introducing niobium oxide (T-Nb2O5) nanoparticles on the surface of M-PNP also showed outstanding Li-ion storage kinetics in the anodic voltage range of 1.0–2.0 vs. Li+/Li. The LIHSs based on M-PNP and M-PNP/T-Nb2O5 nanocomposite samples used as the cathode and anode pair, respectively, exhibited a high specific energy of ∼47.5 W h kg−1 at ∼280.0 W kg−1 and a high specific power of ∼10,000 W kg−1 at ∼22.3 W h kg−1 with excellent cycling stability over 30,000 cycles.
