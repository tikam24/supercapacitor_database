Recently, as a new type of energy storage material, conducting polymer has attracted much attention due to its excellent electrochemical properties. We summarize research on polymer based composite electrode materials and supercapacitors. The conducting mechanism, advantages and disadvantages in supercapacitor electrodes were reasoned through extensive based on the extensive analysis of the literatures., and new trends based on conducting polymers material and capacitor development are reviewed.
