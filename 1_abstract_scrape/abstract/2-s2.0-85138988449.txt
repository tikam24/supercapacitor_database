The design and construction of electrochemical energy storage devices with higher energy and power density for multifunctional electronic devices, transport vehicles, and industrial equipment are of great importance. Within this agenda, the battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) systems comprising of high-rate capacitive and high-capacity battery electrodes have received extensive attention due to their exceptional performance as compared to conventional supercapacitors and batteries. With the appropriate and adept design, BSH systems have inimitable benefits such as high productivity, low cost, security, and an eco-friendly process. This chapter briefly introduces the basic scientific principles, materials, and technology aspects of the hybrid battery-supercapacitor system and its promising applications.
