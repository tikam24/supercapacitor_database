Self-assembled Ni(OH) 2 nanosheet-decorated hierarchical flower-like MnCo 2 O 4.5 nanoneedles were synthesized via a cost-effective and facile hydrothermal strategy, aiming to realize a high-capacity advanced electrode of a battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) device. It is demonstrated that the as-synthesized hierarchical flower-like MnCo 2 O 4.5 @Ni(OH) 2 -nanosheet electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 318 mAh g -1 at a current density of 3 A g -1 and still maintains a capacity of 263.5 mAh g -1 at a higher current density of 20 A g -1 , with an extremely long cycle lifespan of 87.7% capacity retention after 5000 cycles. Moreover, using the unique core-shell structure as the cathode and hollow Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles/reduced graphene oxide as the anode, the BSH device delivers a high energy density of 56.53 Wh kg -1 when the power density reaches 1.9 kW kg -1 , and there is an extraordinarily good cycling stability with the capacity retention rate of 90.4% after 3000 cycles. It is believed that the superior properties originate from desirable core-shell structures alleviating the impact of volume changes as well as the existence of two-dimensional Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets with more active sites, thereby improving the cycle stability and achieving ultrahigh capacity. These results will provide more access to the rational material design of diverse nanostructures toward high-performance energy storage devices.
