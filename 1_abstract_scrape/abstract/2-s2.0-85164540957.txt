Activated carbon-based supercapacitor research is currently in the spotlight due to its promising future with outstanding properties such as pore structures, high surface area, low cost, cyclic stability, and higher capacitance. As a result, numerous studies are being conducted to produce activated carbon from various sources of biomass. Furthermore, a prime research focus is the physical activation of carbon using carbon dioxide (CO) and the direct utilization of CO to prepare activated carbon. On the other hand, activated carbon has a high potential as a supercapacitor electrode material due to its high electrical conductivity and capacitance. So, this chapter aims to provide a critical analysis on the fabrication of CO to prepare activated carbon.
