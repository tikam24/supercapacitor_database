In this work, the NiCoP nanoarrays were synthesized on Ni foam through the hydrothermal method and phosphating process. As an electrode material of supercapacitor, NiCoP/NF nanoarrays show excellent performance with a high specific capacitance of 2564 F g−1 at 2 A g−1, unexpected charge-discharge rate performance, and slow self-discharge behavior, which are superior to those of single metal phosphides (CoP/NF and NiP/NF). More importantly, the hybrid supercapacitor NiCoP/NF//graphene possesses a specific energy of 22.8 Wh kg−1 and good cycle stability that the capacitance remains 68.33% of the initial specific capacitance after 4000 cycles. The improvement in electrochemical performance mostly stems from the three-dimensional heterostructure, the positive synergistic combination of Ni and Co metal elements in the electrochemical process, and the high conductivity of phosphides. Therefore, this work demonstrates the potential of NiCoP/NF electrodes in supercapacitor energy storage.
