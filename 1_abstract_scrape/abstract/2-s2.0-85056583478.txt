Due to the broad application prospect, flexible and transparent electronic device has been widely used in portable wearable devices, energy storage smart window and other fields, which owns many advantages such as portable, foldable, small-quality, low-cost, good transparency, high performance and so on. All these electronic devices are inseparable from the support of energy storage device. Energy storage device, like lithium-ion battery and super capacitor, also require strict flexibility and transparency as the energy supply equipment of electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate the development and applications of flexible and transparent lithium-ion battery and super capacitor. In particular, carbon nanomaterials are widely used in flexible and transparent electronic device, due to their excellent optical and electrical properties and good mechanical properties. For example, carbon nanotubes with high electrical conductivity and low density have been widely reported by researchers. Otherwise, graphene as an emerging two-dimensional material with electrical conductivity and carrier mobility attracts comparatively more attention than that of other carbon nanomaterials. Substantial effort has been put on the research for graphene-based energy storage system by researchers from all over the world. But, there is still a long way to accomplish this goal of improving the performance for stretchable and transparent electronic device due to the existing technical conditions.
