Advanced microfabrication on small and curved fiber surfaces remains a critical challenge and an urgent need to develop high-performance fiber-shaped electronics and advance the next generation of wearable electronics technology. In this study, we propose the preparation of 1D stretchable fiber-shaped electronics via inkjet printing technology for wearable applications. Utilizing self-built precision rotary inkjet printing equipment and a surface chemical modification process, we achieve high-precision and customizable microfabrication onto ultra-low diameter fiber surfaces (minimum printing line width of 133 µm and a printable fiber diameter as low as 500 µm with a large curvature of 4000 m−1). More importantly, this fabricating method is non-destructive and can prepare 1D stretchable conductors by printing conductive inks with stretchable structures and optimizing various synthetic fibers, which exhibit remarkable conductivity, mechanical stability, and strain-insensitive properties in practical applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of several 1D stretchable electronics applications, including a fiber-shaped electrothermal device, triboelectric strain sensor, and supercapacitor. Our work will greatly promote the development of 1D fiber-shaped electronics and smart textiles with wearability, high performance, functional diversification, and low cost.
