H+ and Al3+ co-doped Polyaniline thin films have been synthesized by electropolymerization method with the variation of aluminium nitrate salt (Al2(NO3)3, 9H2O) into the electrolyte. FESEM, atomic force microscopy and UVâ€“Vis-NIR spectrophotometry were used to characterize the nanostructured polyaniline thin films. FESEM showed nanowire like structures of the thin films. AFM study indicated an enhancement of surface roughness with increase in Al3+ concentration. Enhancement in photoluminescent emission was also observed with the increase of Al3+ amount into the electrolyte solutions. Supercapacitive behaviour of the films was investigated using cyclic voltammetry; areal capacitance showed an increasing trend with increase of Al3+ concentration. Electropolymerized PAni doped with Al3+ can be used as electrode materials for supercapacitor application.
