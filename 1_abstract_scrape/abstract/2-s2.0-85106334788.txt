In this work, the ferric cobalt sulfide/aminated graphene quantum dots (FeCo2S4/NH2-GQDs) nanoflowers grown on Ni foam substrate have been successfully fabricated via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The as-prepared FeCo2S4/NH2-GQDs nanoflowers can expose plenty of electroactive sites, provide fast charge transfer paths and buffer the drastic volume change during long-term charge–discharge cycles. Therefore, the FeCo2S4/NH2-GQDs nanoflowers exhibit excellent supercapacitive performance, including high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability and cycling stability. The specific capacitance of FeCo2S4/NH2-GQDs composite electrode reaches 2314.8 and 1802.5 F g−1 at the current density of 1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, while maintaining superior cycling stability with 95.1% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. This study proves that NH2-GQDs are promising materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of bimetallic sulfides, providing a new insight for the design and fabrication of novel electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
