In present work, three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels (NGAs) are prepared through an efficient and facile strategy by using urea and ammonia, which serves as reducing and doping agents of graphene oxide (GO) in an aqueous solution. The transformation of GO suspension to NGAs was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The NGAs with 3D porous network were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and N2 sorption experiment. Benefiting from the abundant porous architectures, the prepared NGAs exhibited a high specific capacitance, good electrochemical stability and high degree of reversibility in supercapacitor. More interestingly, the superhydrophobic carbonized nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels (CNGAs) showed outstanding absorption capacity and recycling performance for various oils and organic solvents.
