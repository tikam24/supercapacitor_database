In this paper, a two-stage three-port isolated bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) for hybrid energy storage system (HESS) applications in DC microgrids is proposed. It has an enlarged zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) region and reduced power circulation loss. A front-end three-phase interleaved BDC is introduced to the supercapacitor (SC) channel to compensate voltage variations of SC. Consequently, wide ZVS range and reduced circulation power loss for SC and DC bus ports are achieved under large-scale fluctuating SC voltage. Furthermore, a novel modified pulse-width-modulation (PWM) and phase-shift (PHS) hybrid control method with two phase-shift angles is proposed for BA port. And it contributes to an increasing number of switches operating in ZVS mode with varying battery (BA) voltage. Phase shift control with fixed driving frequency is applied to manage power flow. The ZVS range as well as the current stress of resonant tanks under varying port voltages is analyzed in detail. Finally, a 1 kW prototype with peak efficiency of 94.9% is built, and the theoretical analysis and control method are verified by experiments.
