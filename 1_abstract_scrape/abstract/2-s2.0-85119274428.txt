Biomass converted into activated carbon (AC) by using physical activation method can form micro-meso pore structure and maintain the interconnected natural pore network of biomass. AC is prepared from the biomass of Parsea Americana seeds (PAS) through a process of pre-carbonization, chemical activation, carbonization and physical activation which is activated at temperatures of 700°C, 800°C, and 900°C. Characterization of physical properties of AC electrodes consisted of X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope-Energy Dispersive X-ray and characterization of electrochemical properties of supercapacitor cells using Cyclic Voltametry. The results showed that the microstructure of the AC electrode has a semicrystalline structure characterized by the presence of two sloping peaks at an angle of 2θ around 24° and 44° which corresponded to the hkl (002) and (100) planes, where the lowest Lc value was produced by the PAS-900 sample. The PAS-900 sample had aggregates or lumps with smaller size in small amounts in the presence of micro-mesopores and had the highest carbon content of 94.50% with the highest capacitance value of 203.12 F/g. The temperature of 900°C is the best activation temperature in the process of manufacture AC electrodes from Parsea Americana seeds biomass for supercapacitor cell applications.
