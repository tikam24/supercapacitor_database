A new subway traction system has been proposed without supply rail. The on-board energy is stored in a supercapacitor bank. This energy storage system is charged at each station in order to have enough energy to reach the next station. In-station supercapacitors are also used to ensure a fast charge of the on-board supercapacitors. Before implementation of this new supply system, a reduce-scale experimental set-up is developed in order to test the different energy flows in real time. First experimental results are provided.
