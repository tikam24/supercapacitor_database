Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of crystalline porous materials, can be applied in many fields as adsorbents, supercapacitors, catalysts, and so on because of, among others, their superior properties of large surface area, tunable pore size, diverse structures. However, the low stability and selectivity of traditional MOFs indicate that they are not the best configuration for the applications outlined above. In this case, a type of composite made from an assembly of graphene-based materials and MOFs that exhibits the advantages of the parent materials has attracted widespread attention in recent years. This review provides an overview of the recent developments of MOF/graphene-based materials, focusing on their applications in gas separation/storage, water purification, chemical sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, and catalysts, as well as their preparation methods.
