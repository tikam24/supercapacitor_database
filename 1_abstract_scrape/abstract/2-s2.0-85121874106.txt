Parasitic helminths are usually known as undesired pathogens, causing various diseases in both human and animal species. In this study, we explore supercapacitance/resistance behaviors as a novel probe for rapid identification and direct differentiation of Fasciola hepatica, Parascaris equorum (with and without larvae), Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Taenia multiceps, and Moniezia expansa eggs. This claim is attributed to some characteristics, such as grave supercapacitance/area, high-energy storage/area, large power/egg, huge permittivity, and great electrical break-down potential, respectively (Fasciola hepatica: 2,158, 0.485, 2.7 × 10–3, 267, 52.6, Parascaris equorum without larvae: 2,825, 0.574, 3.0 × 10–3, 351, 68.4, Parascaris equorum with larvae: 4,519, 0.716, 2.4 × 10–3, 1.96, 97.6, Dicrocoelium dendriticum: 1,581, 0.219, 2.8 × 10–3, 1.96, 48.8, Moniezia expansa: 714, 0.149, 2.2 × 10–3, 0.88, 35.2, Taenia multiceps: 3,738, 0.619, 4.7 × 10–3, 4.63, 84.4), and durable capacitance up to at least 15,000 sequential cycles at different scan rates (between 2.0 × 10−4 and 120.0 V s−1) as well as highly differentiated resistance between 400 and 600 Ω. These traits are measured by the “Blind Patch-Clamp” method, at the giga ohm sealed condition (6.18 ± 0.12 GΩ cm−1, n = 5). Significant detection ranges are detected for each capacitance and resistance with gradient limits as large as at least 880 to 1,000 mF and 400 to 600 Ω depending on the type of helminth egg. The effect of water in the structure of helminth eggs has also been investigated with acceptable reproducibility (RSD 7%–10%, n = 5). These intrinsic characteristics would provide novel facilitators for direct helminth egg identification in comparison with several methods, such as ELISA, PCR, and microscopic methods.
