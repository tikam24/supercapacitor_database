Supercapacitors based on activated carbon prepared from various pollens show good specific capacitance (207 F g-1) and large gravimetric and volumetric energy density (∼88 Wh kg-1 and ∼44 Wh L -1, respectively) in ionic liquid electrolytes, which are much better than those of RP20 (commercial activated carbon) or graphene-based supercapacitors.
