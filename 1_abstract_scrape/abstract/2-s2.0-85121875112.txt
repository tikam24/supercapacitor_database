Graphene containing Co and Mn co-doped NiOnanocrystallinematerials (with composition graphene-Ni0.95Co0.025Mn0.025O1-δ) were synthesized by chemical synthesis route and studied for potential application as electrode material for supercapacitors. The phase structure of the materials was characterized by XRD technique and the crystallographic parameters were found out and reported. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed the presence of M-O bond in the materials. The morphological phenomenon of the materials was studied by SEM and the particles were found to be spherical with an average grain size of 14 – 28 nm. EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of appropriate levels of elements in the samples. The in-depth morphological characteristics were also studied by HR-TEM (High-Resolution Tunneling Electron Microscopy). Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance measurements were carried out in an aqueous electrolyte (6 mol/L KOH) to investigate the electrochemical performance of the graphene containing Co and Mn co-doped NiOnanocrystallinebased electrode materials and the material found to exhibit a specific capacitance of 1243 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and hence these electrode materials can be used in electrochemical supercapacitors.
