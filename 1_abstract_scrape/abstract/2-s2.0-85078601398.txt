Bimetallic sulfides are appealing great interest for renewable accumulated energy and conversion devices because of the multiple merits. Herein, flaky attached CuCo2S4 microspheres are reported via a simple solvothermal strategy and serve as an electrode to evaluate the supercapacitors characteristics. It should be noted that such electrode presents a high specific capacitance of 752 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 and excellent cycling stability over 4500 cycles. In addition, an asymmetric device is assembled by using CuCo2S4 and AC as the positive electrode and negative electrode, respectively, which achieves a high-energy density (46.2 Wh·kg−1 at 0.796 kW·kg−1) and retains a long cycling life over 8000 cycles. Such performance demonstrates that CuCo2S4 with the unique structure might be great potential for energy storage.
