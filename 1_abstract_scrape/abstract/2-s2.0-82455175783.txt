In this work, Al-substituted α-Co(OH)2/GO composites with supercapacitive properties were prepared by chemical co-precipitated method in which cobalt nitrate and aluminum nitrate were used as the raw material, and graphite oxide was employed as carrier. The as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements showed that the Al-substituted α-Co(OH)2/GO electrode material had excellent electrochemical capacitance. The specific capacitance of 1137 F·g -1 was achieved in 6 mol/L KOH solution at a current density of 1 A·g-1 within a potential range of 0-0.5 V. Moreover, only 12% losses of the initial specific capacitance were found after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A·g-1. © 2011 SIOC, CAS, Shanghai & WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
