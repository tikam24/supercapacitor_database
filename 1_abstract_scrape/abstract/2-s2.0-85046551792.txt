We report on a one-step spray printing technique to fabricate large-area flexible electrodes using poly (3, 4-ethylene dioxythiophene)-polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polyester cloth. The H3PO4 treated PEDOT:PSS electrodes exhibit an enhanced capacitance, high rate capability and wide voltage window (0–1.6 V). The printed polyester/PEDOT:PSS electrode treated with H3PO4 exhibits a specific capacitance of ∼40 F g−1 at 40 mV s−1. A large area device exhibits a high iR drop of 0.23 V, which can be minimized using conducting materials such as carbon cloth or steel mesh in place of polyester cloth.
