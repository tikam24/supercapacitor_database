The most commonly used materials in high-power devices such as electrochemical capacitors and super-capacitors studies include the transition metal oxides. We use simple and economically viable Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) methods for the growth of nanocrystalline nickel-cobalt oxides (NiO-CoO) thin films. The NiO-CoO thin films, which were obtained using nickel sulfate and cobalt sulfate as the starting materials, were deposited on non-conducting glass substrates and steel substrates. The XRD results show that the average crystallite size of the thin films is about 2.2nm. The thin films which were also characterized for AFM and SEM revealed randomly oriented nano-flake structures with absorbance greater than 45% in the UV region of the electromagnetic spectrum and band gap energy range between 2.75 eV and 2.95 eV. The electrical resistivity of the material was of the order of 108 - 1010 Ωm with activation energy of about 6.5488x10-5eV. Characteristic peaks were observed in the cyclic voltammetric studies. The hydrophilicity and supercapacitive characteristics of the NiO-CoO composite thin films show that they could possibly be useful in supercapacitive applications. © 2014 The Authors.
