CuCo2O4 nanostructures were synthesized through a facile solution combustion method. Electrochemical investigations demonstrate a novel electrode material for supercapacitors with remarkable performance including high-rate capability, high-power density (22.11 kW kg−1) and desirable cycling stability at different current densities. © 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
