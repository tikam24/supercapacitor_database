Herein, various nickel cobalt oxide nanostructures with different Ni concentrations are prepared via a hydrothermal route followed by annealing process for an electrochemical supercapacitor as well as a nonenzymatic glucose biosensor. The electrode synthesized on carbon cloth using Ni0.9Co2.1O4 nanosheet-like morphology showed a maximum 516.51 F g−1 specific capacitance at 10 mV s−1 scan rate and the cyclic stability of 87.7% over 2000 GCD cycles. The electrode prepared with Ni0.3Co2.7O4 on CC offered a linear response from 0 to 0.3 mM glucose concentration and exhibited a maximum of 759.5 µA mM−1 cm−2 glucose sensitivity.
