This document describes a first-principles-based mathematical model developed to predict the voltage-capacity behavior of batteries having hybrid cathodes comprising a mixture of carbon monofluoride (CFx) and silver vanadium oxide (SVO). These batteries typically operate at moderate rates of discharge, lasting several years. The model presented here is an accurate tool for design optimization and performance prediction of batteries under current drains that encompass both the application rate and accelerated testing. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
