Abstract The need of new systems for the storage and conversion of renewable energy sources is fueling the research in supercapacitors. In this work, we propose a low temperature route for the synthesis of electrodes for these supercapacitors: electrodeposition of a transition metal hydroxide-Ni(OH)2 on a graphene foam. This electrode combines the superior mechanical and electrical properties of graphene, the large specific surface area of the foam and the large pseudocapacitance of Ni(OH)2. We report a specific capacitance up to 900 F/g as well as specific power and energy comparable to active carbon electrodes. These electrodes are potential candidates for their use in energy applications.
