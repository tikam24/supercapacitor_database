We demonstrated an asymmetric aqueous supercapacitor made of p- and n-type conducting polymer electrodes. We used the high electron affinity (EA) n-type polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) as the anode conducting material, and the low ionization potential (IP) p-type polar polythiophene p(g42T-T) as the cathode material. EABBL matches IPp(g42T-T), enabling the fabrication of all-organic asymmetric p/n-supercapacitors that function in aqueous electrolytes. The devices operate in a voltage window up to 1 V, yielding areal capacitances of 90 mF cm-2 and specific capacitances of 33 F g-1 as well as excellent cycling stability with almost 100% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles.
