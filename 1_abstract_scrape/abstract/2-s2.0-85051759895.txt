Recently, it is essential to design and fabricate efficient electrode materials for energy storage devices. In this work, nanoflower–like Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2 assembled from ultrathin sheets are successfully grown on NF by a one pot hydrothermal method. The Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2 electrode exhibits superior specific capacitance of 3.36 F cm−2 (2240.7 F g−1) at 2 A g−1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte, and the cycling test is measured and still remain 96.9% of initial capacitance after 6000 cycles. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled, which shows excellent electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 56.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent cycle stability (91.9% retention of initial capacitance after 6000 cycles). In a word, the high performance can be attributed to the 3D nanoflower-like structure and the Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2 is a promising candidate in energy storage devices.
