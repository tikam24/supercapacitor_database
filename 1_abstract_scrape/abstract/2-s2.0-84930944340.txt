Iron tungstate (FeWO4) has been synthesized using two lowerature synthetic routes and investigated as a new pseudocapacitive electrode material for supercapacitors operating in a neutral aqueous electrolyte. Its electrochemical properties are clearly related to the specific surface area and seem to originate from Fe3 +/Fe2 + fast surface reactions. For FeWO4 obtained by polyol-mediated synthesis, a high volumetric capacitance of 210 F·cm- 3 (i.e. more than two times higher than that of activated carbon) was measured at 20 mV·s- 1 with less than 5% fade over 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, unlike most of the previously investigated iron based electrodes, a unique pseudocapacitive behavior is observed, thus emphasizing the role of the crystallographic structure on the electrochemical signature.
