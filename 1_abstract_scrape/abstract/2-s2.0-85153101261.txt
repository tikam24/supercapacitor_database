The porous Mo2C nanospheres were prepared by a high temperature calcination process. Different proportions of Ni nanoparticles were anchored and evenly distributed within the internal structure of porous Mo2C nanospheres via a hydrothermal process. Co2B hydrogen storage material was synthesized by a high temperature solid phase method. The Co2B + Mo2C and Co2B + Ni/Mo2C composites were manufactured via ball milling to improve the electrochemical hydrogen storage properties of Co2B. Eventually, the active materials doped Co2B composites electrodes revealed higher discharge capacities than conventional Co2B. More electrochemical active sites were provided for hydrogen adsorption and charger transfer owing to the extraordinary porous nanostructure and large specific surface area of Mo2C nanospheres. Moreover, the loaded Ni nanoparticles could further promote the electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of Co2B. As a result, the Ni/Mo2C-1 modified Co2B electrode achieved a highest discharge capacity of 688.7 mAh/g. The two active species of porous Mo2C nanospheres and Ni nanoparticles played a synergistic role during the charging/discharging processes. In addition, the high-rate dischargeability (HRD), kinetic properties and corrosion resistance of Co2B were improved with the addition of Mo2C and Ni/Mo2C-1.
