Here we present an account of the development and evaluation of a mechatronics design project, the Supercapacitor Car Challenge, intended for freshman engineering students. The project consists of four weeks of structured lab activities, two weeks of unstructured free design work, and a final week devoted to the design challenge, the Distance Trial. At the onset of this seven-week project, students are given a kit with parts to build a standard car design, and some additional materials they need for lab activities throughout the design project. The standard car is powered by supercapacitors and is designed to run for a short time until the charge in the supercapacitors is depleted. Students are to modify the design of the standard car to meet the objectives of the end-of-term design challenge. The first four weeks of the project cover relevant electronics concepts and skills along with the fundamental physics underlying the performance of a toy car's electromechanical system. During this project, students learn the basic underlying electromechanical theory while using various laboratory equipment and developing skills in conceptual design, electrical and mechanical prototyping, and system performance under engineering constraints. This report provides an account of the course, design project, and results of a study of direct and indirect assessment. Students were provided entrance and exit surveys, and results of direct assessment assignments are presented to complement the survey data.
