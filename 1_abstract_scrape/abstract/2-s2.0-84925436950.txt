Abstract 1D Co2.18Ni0.82Si2O5(OH)4 architectures assembled by ultrathin nanoflakes are synthesized for the first time by a hydrothermal method. We present a self-reacting template method to synthesize 1D Co2.18Ni0.82Si2O5(OH)4 architectures using Ni(SO4)0.3(OH)1.4 nanobelts. A high-performance flexible asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor can be successfully fabricated based on the 1D Co2.18Ni0.82Si2O5(OH)4 architectures and graphene nanosheets. Interestingly, the as-assembled 1D Co2.18Ni0.82Si2O5(OH)4 architectures//Graphene nanosheets asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor can achieve a maximum energy density of 0.496 mWh cm-3, which is higher than most of reported solid state supercapacitors. Additionally, the device shows high cycle stability for 10,000 cycles. These features make the 1D Co2.18Ni0.82Si2O5(OH)4 architectures as one of the most promising candidates for high-performance energy storage devices.
