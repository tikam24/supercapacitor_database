2D Cu-Ni-Co ternary oxide nanoflakes from 1D long leaf arrays were prepared using a simple, cost-effective, environmentally friendly hydrothermal approach, followed by heat treatment in air, and their supercapacitive performance was investigated. The binder-free 2D Cu-Ni-Co oxide nanoflakes electrode possessed an outstanding specific capacitance of 2615 F g − 1 (1046 C g − 1) at a current density of 1 A g − 1 as well as excellent rate capability and high capacitance retention of 88% at a high current density of 10 A g − 1 in a three-electrode configuration. A hybrid supercapacitor device exhibited a high specific capacity of 185 C g − 1 at 1 A g − 1 and high capacitance retention of 90.2% after 10,000 cycles. Additionally, the hybrid supercapacitor device delivered high specific energy of 51 Wh kg−1 at a specific power of 764 W kg−1. The attractive electrochemical performance of Cu-Ni-Co oxide makes this a promising electrode material for practical supercapacitor applications.
