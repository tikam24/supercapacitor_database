NiO/NiSnO3 nanocomposite synthesis was accomplished by a hydrothermal method. The role of polyvinylpyrrolidone and experimental parameters in the configuration of NiO/NiSnO3 nanocomposite was studied by employing standard characterization techniques. Electrochemical properties were demonstrated by adopting cyclic voltammetry, electro-impedance spectra and galvanostatic charging and discharging studies. All the obtained products have contact resistance Rct of 0.72 Î© at low frequency arising from the resistance between the working electrode and the electrolyte. The NiO/NiSnO3 nanocomposite superior properties may arise from nanosized rod morphology due to their inherent properties having a significant impact on their electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance for RSA3 can be estimated as 524 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g.
