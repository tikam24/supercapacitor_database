Novel benzoxazines were synthesized to prepare nitrogen-doped carbons with high nitrogen content. Monomers (2pd, 3pd) were successfully synthesized from aminopyridine, orth-hydroxybenzaldehyde and paraformaldehyde. Their chemical structures were confirmed via Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. The thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis results demonstrated that the cured benzoxazines had high char yield and their carbides had high nitrogen content. The nitrogen configurations of the carbons obtained from pyridine-based benzoxazines were pyridinic N, pyrrolic N and graphitic N, which were the active centers in nitrogen-doped carbons. We believe that these pyridine-based benzoxazines will be applied as the precursors for functional carbon materials in many fields such as hydrogen storage, fuel cell and supercapacitor.
