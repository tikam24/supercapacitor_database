In this paper, we have demonstrated a facile approach to synthesize the carbon nanotube/MoS2/Fe3O4 nanocomposites by two-step hydrothermal methods. Morphology characterization suggests that the nanocomposites compose of CNTs, flower-like MoS2 and spherical Fe3O4 with uniform diameter of 200-240 nm. The supercapacitor was fabricated using the ternary nanocomposites as electrode materials, in which 6 M KOH was used as electrolyte. The electrochemical measure results confirm that the synergistic effect in the ternary nanocomposites plays an important role in improving the storage capability.
