In this work, we report a low cost, facile synthesis method for Nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanostructures obtained by chemical bath deposition method for alternate transition metal oxide electrode material as a solution for clean energy. We developed a template free ammonia assisted method for obtaining porous structure which offering better supercapacitive performance of NiFe2O4 electrode material than previously reported for pure NiFe2O4. Here we explore the physical characterizations X-ray diffraction, FESEM, HRTEM performed to under-stand its crystal structure and morphology as well as the electrochemical measurements was performed to understand the electrochemical behaviour of the material. Here ammonia plays an important role in governing the structure/morphology of the material and enhances the electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of 541 Fg-1 is achieved at 2 mVs-1 scan rate which is highest for the pure NiFe2O4 electrode material without using any addition of carbon based material, heterostructure or template based method.
