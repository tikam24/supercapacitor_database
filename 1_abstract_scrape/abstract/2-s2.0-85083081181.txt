Integration of renewable energy based Distributed Generation (DG) units into the Electrical Distribution Network (EDN) has attained significant interest to utilize the locally available resources. But, these DGs injects fluctuating power into the network which affects the voltage/frequency instability of the EDN. Thus, an energy storage system and reactive power compensating devices has to be employed in the EDN, to improve the voltage/frequency stability. A configuration for E-STATCOM has been presented in this paper, which has the ability to provide active and reactive power support together. The E-STATCOM is formed by distributing Hybrid Storage System (HSS) into a two-level Voltage Source Converter. To meet the high energy/power density requirements, battery and ultracapacitor have been employed as HSS. The issues related to integration of HSS with the two-level converter and the control methods to extract E-STATCOM features like active power support, voltage regulation are discussed in this paper. A super-twisting sliding mode control has been employed for the battery fed DC-DC converter to provide the required energy support. The performance of the proposed system and the associated control methods are verified through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation for a wind energy-based DG connected to EDN and the results show effectiveness of the E-STATCOM.
