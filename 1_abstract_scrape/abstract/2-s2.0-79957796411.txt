Cobalt oxide-Polyaniline (Co3O4/PANI) nanocomposites were prepared via inverted emulsion polymerization. The structure of the obtained composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry(CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrometry(EIS) experiments. The Co 3O4/PANI(1:2) composite calcined at 400°C exhibits the highest capacitance value of 357 F/g at the scan rate of 5mV/s. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.
