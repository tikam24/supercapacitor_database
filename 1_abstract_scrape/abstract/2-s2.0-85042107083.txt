To accomplish high-performance flexible energy storage devices, a new class of flexible electrodes with prosperous constructions bearing exceptional electrical conductivity, exclusive porosity, and outstanding mechanical stability is extremely needed. Here, we have successfully fabricated a highly flexible electrode with nanocomposite of polyaniline/manganese hexacyanoferrate PANI/MnHCF nanocomposite (PANI/MnHCF) on highly conductive carbon fiber (FCF). The nanocomposite exhibits an ultra-high specific capacitance of 730 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with exceptional rate capability (350 F g−1 capacitance retention at a current density of 20 A g−1), and outstanding cycling performance (capacitance retention of ∼85% after 1000 cycles). The PANI/MnHCF/FCF electrode shows better electrochemical performance due to their exclusive properties such as excellent electrical conductivity, unique porous network and outstanding mechanical flexibility. Furthermore, the higher surface area of PANI/MnHCF nanocomposite facilitates the transport of electrons and electrolyte ions during rapid charge/discharge process. This present work offers a simple, scalable and cost-effective method for fabrication of other PANI/MnHCF nanocomposite based electrode, which is applicable for providing energy in practical flexible portable devices.
