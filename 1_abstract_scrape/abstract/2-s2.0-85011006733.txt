This work reports a thin-film supercapacitor featuring advanced electrode and electrolyte materials and the capability of integration on SiO2/Si substrate. Conventional supercapacitors see their limit including low effective surface area electrode, low voltage-tolerance electrolyte, and bulky size. This work addresses these issues by the following novelties: 1) spray-coated rGO electrode layer with the high surface area, 2) quasi-solid gel polymer electrolyte layer using ionic liquid with high electrochemical voltage window (> 3 V), and 3) thin film (100 Î¼m thick electrode) profile. The experimental results show the prototype generated 6 times higher energy density than the activated carbon sample. Our work pushes forward to a chip-scale energy storage solution for upcoming internet of things (IoT) applications.
