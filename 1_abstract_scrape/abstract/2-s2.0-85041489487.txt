The development of new electrode materials with various components, structures, morphologies and porosities is critical for improving the performance of supercapacitors. Here, we report a facile strategy for synthesizing porous layered stacked MnCo2O4 cubes through a hydrothermal method, followed by annealing treatment. Compared with other morphologies of MnCo2O4, the specific capacitance of porous layered stacked MnCo2O4 cubes reaches 480.5 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Furthermore, porous layered stacked MnCo2O4 cubes show an ultrahigh capacity retention of 75.7% even at a current density of 25 A g-1 and good cycling stability with 96.6% specific capacitance retained after 3000 cycles, which makes porous layered stacked MnCo2O4 cubes a great potential electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
