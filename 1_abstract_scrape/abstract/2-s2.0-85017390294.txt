Summary: The field of electrochemical energy storage is presently enjoying, many years after microelectronics, its "nanomania" with the arrival of nanoporous materials, nanotextured/nanostructured electrodes and nano-architectured current collectors. This review highlights a few outstanding examples of this recent paradigm shift from bulk to nanomaterials electrodes which have had a considerable impact on batteries and supercapacitor performances. Besides, it addresses, as personally perceived, future research needs to fully master the positive attributes of nanomaterials and envision diverse applications.
