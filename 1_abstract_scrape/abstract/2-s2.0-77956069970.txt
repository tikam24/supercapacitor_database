The paper discusses the operation of an energy source combination of battery and supercapacitor in a series hybrid electric vehicle power train, show the impact of losses in supercapacitor sizing. A simulation platform has been developed in Matlab/Simulink suitable for the modelling and analysis of combined energy sources and components considered for electric vehicle power-trains. The model presents a number of vehicle power-train components that can be interconnected to investigate alternative energy sources and power-train components proposed for electric vehicles [1]. The combination of energy sources undertaken to exploit its attributes in series hybrid electric vehicle power-train is proposed by a ZEBRA battery, which presents the primary energy source, and Maxwell supercapacitor, which presents the auxiliary power source.
