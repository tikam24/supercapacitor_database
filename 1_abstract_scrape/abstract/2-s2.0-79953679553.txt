New electrode materials for supercapacitors - activated carbons, produced by carbonization of mixtures of coal tar pitch and furfural, with a subsequent hydrothermal treatment, were characterized and tested electrochemically. The microstructure, surface morphology and porous structure of the carbon materials were studied, and the main textural parameters and micropore size distribution were determined. Symmetric sandwich-type supercapacitor cells, with identical carbon electrodes and organic electrolyte, were assembled and subjected to charge-discharge cycling study at different current rates. Four types of carbons as electrodes with different specific surface area (1000 - 1600 m2 g-1) and texture parameters, as well as tree types of organic electrolytes (Et4NBF4 - PC, LiBF4 - PC, LiPF6 - DMC/EC), were tested and compared with an asymmetric supercapacitor, composed by graphitized-activated carbon (carbon foam) as a negative electrode, and activated carbon/Li4Ti5O 12 oxide composite as a positive electrode. The capacitance values of up to 75 F.g-1 were obtained for the symmetric supercapacitors, depending on the microstructure and the conductivity of the carbon material, and about two times higher capacitance was obtained for the asymmetric supercapacitor, with good cycleability of both supercapacitor systems.
