There has been a growing interest in the performance of supercapacitors (SCs) based on Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs). It has recently been included in long-term energy storage and lightweight devices. The primary goal of this research is to improve the conductivity of CuO nanowire to increase its performance. We have successfully synthesized a wet chemical utilizing a dipping approach in this paper. rGO nanosheet layers were uniformly coated on CuO nanowire arrays. As long as positive, stable pathways for rapid ion or electron transport exist, the presence of atoms in rGO that will diffuse into the CuO lattice may improve the electrical conductivity of the CuO electrode. Furthermore, the surface area of the CuO@rGO-20 s electrode was also increased following rGO coating, resulting in more active sites. As a result, CuO@rGO-20 s electrode had a significantly greater areal capacitance of 1165 mF cmâˆ’2, which was 2.4 times higher than pristine CuO NWAs and excellent extended cycling performance 119% after 2000 cycles as a pseudocapacitive electrode. Overall, our data indicate that enhancing TMOs electrode performance has a considerable impact. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
