Exploration of novel structural metal silicates as electrode candidates is an efficient strategy to develop low-cost electrode for supercapacitors. In this work, manganese silicate corresponding to crystalline MnSiO3 with mesoporous structure was synthesized utilizing mesoporous silica as a self-reacting template through a facile hydrothermal method. The mesoporous manganese silicates exhibited uniform pore-size distribution of 3–6 nm and high specific surface area ranging from 244.2 to 374.7 m2/g by controlling the hydrothermal temperature. A series of electrochemical analysis demonstrated that the electrode for sample obtained at 160 °C showed the excellent electrochemical performance. A high specific capacitance of 251 F/g at 0.5 A/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte and good rate performance were achieved, which was mainly attributed to its high crystallinity and large specific surface areas facilitating electrochemical process. These results prove that the mesoporous manganese silicate as a promising electrode material has potential applications in supercapacitor.
