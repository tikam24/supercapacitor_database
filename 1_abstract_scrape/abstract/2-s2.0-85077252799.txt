This article presents the effect of nickel as dopant on the structural, morphological, and capacitance behaviors of SrTiO3 for supercapacitor application. Pure and Ni-doped SrTiO3 was synthesized via ball milling method. The phase structure and purity of the synthesized samples were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface morphology showed the role of dopants in fixing the grain size of SrTiO3. The electrochemical performance of pure and Ni-doped SrTiO3 was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic chargeâ€“discharge (GCD) in a 3-M KOH electrolyte solution. It was found that Ni-doped SrTiO3 exhibited the maximum specific capacity of 142 F/g at 1 A/g, which was significantly higher than that of pure SrTiO3 (105 F/g at 1 A/g). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) evidenced that there is the smallest charge transport resistance value for Ni-doped SrTiO3 sample.
