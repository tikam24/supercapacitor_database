In this work, the electrochemical performance of copper vanadate (Cu3V2O8) nanoparticles (NPs) and Cu3V2O8 NPs loaded reduced graphene oxide (Cu3V2O8 @rGO) nanocomposites (NCs) were reported. Cu3V2O8 NPs and Cu3V2O8 @rGO (0.02 M Cu3V2O8 and 0.01 g of rGO) NCs were prepared by a simple reflux technique, and the prepared NCs were analytically investigated. The monoclinic crystalline structure of the prepared Cu3V2O8 NPs was revealed by the XRD analysis. Presence of plate-like structured Cu3V2O8 NPs and layer-structured rGO in the prepared NCs were observed through HR-TEM images. The electrochemical performance of the prepared NCs was investigated through the fabrication of Cu3V2O8 NPs, and Cu3V2O8 @rGO NCs modified working electrodes and supercapacitors under 1 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry result suggested that the pure Cu3V2O8 NPs modified working electrode possessed the specific capacitance value of 538 Fg−1 (at 5 mVs−1), and this value was further enhanced to 1341 Fg−1 by the addition of rGO. The maximum specific capacitance values calculated from GCD analysis were found to be 13.2 Fg−1 (at 0.1 Ag−1) for Cu3V2O8 NPs and 1305 Fg−1 (at 1.5 Ag−1) for Cu3V2O8 @rGO NCs, based electrodes. The energy and power density values of the fabricated device using Cu3V2O8 NPs were found to be 2.067 W h kg1 and 403.8 W kg−1, respectively. Whereas, Cu3V2O8 @rGO NCs-based device possessed 7.642 W h kg−1 and 90 W kg−1 of superior energy and power densities, respectively. The cyclic test result confirmed that the Cu3V2O8 @rGO NCs-based device possessed the superior specific capacitance retention of 74% at the end of 2000 cycles, whereas, Cu3V2O8 NPs-based device exhibited only 69.5% of cyclic retention. The electrochemical results suggested that the inclusion of rGO in prepared copper vanadate nanoparticles induced the battery-like behavior. The proposed NCs can be utilized as the supercapacitor and/or battery electrodes.
