Wireless charging has become an emerging challenge to reduce the cost of a conventional plug-in charging system in electric vehicles especially for supercapacitors that are utilized for quick charging and low-energy demands. In this article, the design of an efficient wireless power transfer system has been presented using resonant inductive coupling technique for supercapacitor-based electric vehicle. Mathematical analysis, simulation, and experimental implementation of the proposed charging system have been carried out. Simulations of various parts of the systems are carried out in two different software, ANSYS MAXWELL and MATLAB. ANSYS MAXWELL has been used to calculate the various parameters for the transmitter and receiver coils such as self-inductance (L), mutual inductance (M), coupling coefficient (K), and magnetic flux magnitude (B). MATLAB has been utilized to calculate output power and efficiency of the proposed system using the mathematical relationships of these parameters. The experimental setup is made with supercapacitor banks, electric vehicle, wattmeters, controller, and frequency generator to verify the simulation results. The results show that the proposed technique has better power transfer efficiency of more than 75% and higher power transfer density using a smaller coil size with a bigger gap of 4â€“24 cm.
