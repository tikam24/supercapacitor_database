The applications of supercapacitor are overviewed home and broad. The mechanism and characteristics of super-capacitors, as well as its analysis methods have been discussed. Based on the analysis of super-capacitor structure, we Establish a mathematical model of super capacitor according to its own characteristics and the experimental data of Maxwell PC2500 supercapacitor from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).Then, the charge and discharge experiments of super capacitor are simulated by the Matlab/Simulink simulation.
