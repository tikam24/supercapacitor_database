Due to their many fascinating properties and low-cost preparation by chemical reduction method, particular attention has been paid to the graphene-based materials in the application of energy storage devices. In the present chapter, we focus on the latest work regarding the development of flexible electrodes for batteries and supercapacitors based on graphene as well as graphene-based composites. To begin with, graphene as the sole or dominant part of flexible electrode will be discussed, involving its structure, relationship between structure and performance, and strategies to improve their performances; The next major section deals with graphene as conductive matrix for flexible electrode, the role of graphene to offer efficient electrically conductive channels and flexible mechanical supports will be discussed. Another role of graphene in flexible electrode is as active additives to improve the performance of cellulose and carbon nanofiber papers, examples will be given and such strategy is promising for further reducing the cost of flexible electrodes. Finally, prospects and further developments in this exciting field of graphene-based flexible energy storage devices will be also suggested.
