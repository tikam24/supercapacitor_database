As one of the electrode materials for supercapacitor, Co3O4/graphene composite was mainly synthesized via two-steps method. Here, a facile one-pot method was used for Co3O4/graphene composite, and the performances of one-pot-synthesized Co3O4/graphene composite were carefully investigated. Liquid-phase exfoliation was used for graphene and the D-band/G-band ratio of liquid-phase exfoliated graphene was only 0.094, which indicated that the graphene had low defect density and enhanced electrical conductivity. Morphologies investigation of Co3O4/graphene composites indicated that Co3O4 nanoparticles with mean diameter of 14nm were uniformly anchored on graphene sheets. The facile one-pot method associated with liquid-phase exfoliated graphene induced Co3O4/graphene composite with enhanced specific capacitance of 392 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1. The Co3O4/graphene composite also expressed relatively small internal resistance and diffusion resistance (0.36 and 0.45, respectively). Moreover, the synthesized Co3O4/graphene composite yielded excellent rate performances with only 9.5% capacitance loss when current density was increased by a factor of 10.
