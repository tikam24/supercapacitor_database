Graphene aerogels derived from graphene-oxide (GO) starting materials recently have been shown to exhibit a combination of high electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and low cost that has enabled a range of electrochemical applications. Standard synthesis protocols for manufacturing graphene aerogels require the use of sol-gel chemical reactions that are maintained at high temperatures for long periods of time ranging from 12 h to several days. Here we report an ultrafast, acid-catalyzed sol-gel formation process in acetonitrile in which wet GO-loaded gels are realized within 2 h at temperatures below 45 Â°C. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analysis following supercritical drying and pyrolysis confirms the reduction of the GO in the aerogels to sp2 carbon crystallites with no residual carbon-nitrogen bonds from the acetonitrile or its derivatives. This rapid synthesis enhances the prospects for large-scale manufacturing of graphene aerogels for use in numerous applications including sorbents for environmental toxins, support materials for electrocatalysis, and high-performance electrodes for electrochemical capacitors and solar cells.
