Ti3C2Tx self-assembled film as a promising electrode material due to its high strength and ultra-high metal conductivity. However, it's challenging to solve the problem that the self-stacking phenomenon of nanosheets leads to the decrease of ion transport dynamics in the vertical direction. Here, we prepare sandwich-type macroporous Ti3C2Tx film, demonstrating appropriate mechanical properties as well as excellent capacitance and rate performance, compared with the compact MXene film by vacuum assisted filtration based on our previous work. The research provides perspectives for the development of MXenes-based supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical performance.
