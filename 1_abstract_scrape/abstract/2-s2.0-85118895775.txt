Ternary nanocomposites based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes and polyaniline (PANI) wrapped by sulfonated graphene nanopowders (s-GNs) were prepared by an in-situ sequence solution blending followed by ultrasonic dispersion. The role of functionalization s-GNs’ surface by methanol and sulfuric acid on the structural characteristics of CNTs20%@PANI and CNTs20%/s-GNs20%@PANI were conducted by X-Ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy. The results showed less agglomeration and a high interlayer distance between the nanoparticles for the functional groups intercalation which led to immobilize the conductive PANI and prohibit the volume expansion during the charge/discharge cycling of the supercapacitor’s electrodes. The sulfonated graphene also improved the interfaces between the electrolyte and the capacitor’s electrode and thereby better pseudo-capacitive behavior obtained. Compared to the PANI and CNTs@PANI, the ternary s-GN/CNTs@PANI nanocomposites exhibited the highest conductivity (σ) and the total resistivity (ρ) properties for the increased surface area, hydrophilic oxide surface SO−3 groups of the s-GNs and hence better mobility of the electronic charge carriers and higher capacitance.
