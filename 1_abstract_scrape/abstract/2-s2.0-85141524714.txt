In the current study, NiAl2O4, and silver doped NiAl2O4 were synthesized via a sol-gel approach and their composite with g-C3N4 was successfully prepared via an ultrasonication approach. The characterization of as fabricated materials was carried out via various conventional techniques. Furthermore, the electrochemical behavior of the as-fabricated electrode materials was investigated via various electrochemical techniques. The results of electrochemical measurements were analyzed for all three prepared electrodes and Ag-NiAl2O4@g-C3N4 nanocomposite was found to be a more active electrode material than other prepared electrodes. Ag-NiAl2O4 @g-C3N4 showed specific capacitance of 768 Fg−1, 94.01% capacitance retention after 6000 CV cycles, 519 s discharge time, 0.51 Ω charge transfer resistance, 27 WhKg−1, and 187.28 WKg−1 energy and power densities respectively. Ag-NiAl2O4@g-C3N4 can be considered a potential and propitious electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
