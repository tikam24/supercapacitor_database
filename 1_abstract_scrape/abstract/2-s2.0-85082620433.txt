Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) having sources with complimentary characteristics is preferred in electric vehicle application, so as to fulfill the requirements such as reduced weight, long life of sources and improved dynamic response. In this paper, electric vehicle (EV) power conversion system is implemented with HESS which is comprised of battery and ultracapacitor (UC). UC has high power density and more life cycles compared to battery and battery has high energy density. Here UC delivers high current during acceleration and it can take in large and sudden current during regeneration and hence it improves the battery life. Bidirectional converter is used to drive the inverter driven induction motor (IM). Sources are charged during regenerative braking and hence it increases the efficiency of EV. An experimental prototype of EV power conditioner is developed and tested.
