Nanocrystalline α-MnO2 was synthesized with solid-phase reaction through heat treatment and acid treatment at room temperature by using KMnO4 and Mn(CH3COO)2·4H2O as raw materials. The sample was characterized by XRD and SEM. The electrochemical characteristics of the sample were characterized by CV and constant current charge-discharge tests. The specific capacitance of the nano α-MnO2 was 222.7F/g in 1.0 mol/L Na2SO4 electrolyte at the scan rate of 3mV/s, the current density of 300mA/g, in the range of -0.1-0.8V(vs.SCE), after 1000 times cycle, the capacity is maintain of 85%, a good circulation performance and capacitance stability. The nano α-MnO2 was an excellent electrode material for supercapacitor.
