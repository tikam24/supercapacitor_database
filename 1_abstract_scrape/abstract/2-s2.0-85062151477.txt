The peculiar morphology of nanorods mixed with microspheres of manganese carbonate (MnCO 3 ) doping with different percentages (0, 2, 4, 6%) of silver (Ag) was synthesized by simple co-precipitation method. The effect of Ag doping on structural, morphological and compositional properties of MnCO 3 were investigated. XRD results revealed that the synthesized samples have hexagonal-rhombohedral structure and the peaks are shifted towards higher angles with increasing Ag content. The pure MnCO 3 exhibited microsphere like morphology with the size in the rage of 0.8–2.5 μm. XPS analysis confirmed the presence of Mn, C, O and Ag elements. The specific capacitance values are calculated and 4% Ag-doped MnCO 3 electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance of 554.6 Fg -1 at a current density of 0.5 Ag -1 , good rate capability of 54.74% and excellent cycle stability of 87.22% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles. From these results, Ag-doped MnCO 3 could be preferred as the potential competitor for future electrochemical supercapacitor devices.
