The work developed in this paper concerns the energy management of an autonomous multi-source system consisting of a farm of three wind turbines based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG), a fuel cell (FC) and of a Super-capacitor (SC). All of these components are connected using static converters to a DC bus to power a DC load. To control the DC bus voltage and the power exchanges, a dynamic control and management strategy for electrical energy have been developed to find the best distribution of power between the various elements constituting the autonomous power supply system. The proposed management strategy is essentially based on one of the three operating modes of the turbines on the wind farm (WF) “maximum power point tracking (MPPT)”, “without MPPT” or “disconnected”. In addition to that, the algorithm is also based on the state of charge (SOC) of the SC to monitor not only the starting and stopping of the FC but also the shedding of continuous loads if necessary. Indeed, many management scenarios can be proposed due to these different constraints in order to ensure the smooth running of the algorithm. The performance of the renewable power supply system studied and the management strategy proposed are then evaluated via a simulation work in order to discover their effect on the stability of the voltage of the DC bus and on the adjustment of the power balance.
