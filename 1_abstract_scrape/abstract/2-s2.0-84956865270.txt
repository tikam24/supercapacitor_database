We introduce a two-step hydrothermal and microwave method to prepare novel SnO2/MoS2 composites. The as-prepared samples are well characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The experimental results indicate that the SnO2/MoS2 composites are composed of MoS2 nanosheets and ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles with mean size of 3-4nm which are well-distributed and anchored on the surface of MoS2 nanosheets. The resultant composites demonstrate prominently improved electrochemical performances, which could be attributed to the unique and robust microstructures and synergetic effect between MoS2 and SnO2.
