Inspired by the natural nacre, we developed a novel strategy for fabricating the integration of supertough and high strength artificial nacre based on GO sheets via conjugated cross-linking. Highly Ï€-conjugated long chain molecules of 10, 12-pentacosadiyn-1-o1 (PCDO) are cross-linked with GO sheets only with content of 6.5 wt%, resulting in huge displacement when loading and adsorption of much more fracture energy. The toughness is two times higher than that of natural nacre. Furthermore, the n-conjugated polymers could add additional benefit to the high electrical conductivity of the chemically reduced GO (rGO). This study opens the door toward biomimetic production of GO- or rGO-based composites with supertough and highly conductive properties, which will have great promising applications in many fields like aerospace, flexible supercapacitor electrodes, artificial muscle, and tissue engineering.
