The achievement of electrode materials with favorable electrolytic wettability is of significance for raising their electrochemical performance due to the occurring of electrostatic and pseudocapacitive processes at the interface. Herein, a polyaniline-decorated carbon nanofiber/nanosheet network (PANI@CNF/CNS) was prepared by in-situ polymerization of PANI on the surface of an interwoven carbon nanofiber/nanosheet network (CNF/CNS). Molten-salt pyrolysis of bacterial celluloses produced CNF/CNS hybrids, which were subsequently used as a 3D interwoven conductive network for the decoration of PANI. Benefiting from high conductivity of the hierarchical carbon network and fast ion transport within the PANI@CNF/CNS, an asymmetric supercapacitor using the PANI@CNF/CNS and CNF/CNS as cathode and anode materials, respectively, exhibited a high energy density of 65.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1 and an excellent cycling life of 98% retention after 5000 cycles at 10 A g−1.
