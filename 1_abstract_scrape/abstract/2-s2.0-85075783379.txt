The conducting polymer nanocomposites have been extensively used due to manifold applications particularly as a novel supercapacitor material. The present work deals with the fabrication of PANI/rGO nanocomposites and investigating their morphological, optical and dielectric properties. The present paper is focused on the synthesis of (PANI)1-x(rGO)x nanocomposites (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08) prepared by an in-situ chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline using ammonium peroxide sulfate (APS) as an oxidant in presence of colloidal reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoparticles at 0-5 Â°C in air to improve optical and dielectric constants of PANI for supercapacitor applications. rGO was synthesized from graphite powder employing a modified Hummers method. The morphology of synthesized composite materials was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). FTIR spectroscopy analysis of PANI/rGO nanocomposites was performed using Perkin Elmer FTIR spectroscopy. Dielectric properties of nanocomposites were studied using impedance analyzer and it is observed that incorporation of rGO in PANI improves the dielectric properties. UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer was used to study the absorption spectra of the composite samples. The band gap energy (Eg) of the nanocomposites was determined using Tauc's relationship. It has been observed that the increasing the rGO concentration in composites reduces the optical band gap which attributes the enhancement in electron delocalization along the polymer chain. Also, the increment in protons with rGO concentration extends the density of states more into visible region of SEM spectra.
