Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is a kind of organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticle. This paper introduces the research progress of different kind of POSS organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles applied to lithium-ion batteries, fuel batteries, and supercapacitors by researchers on mechanical properties, thermal properties and electrochemistry properties. The results showed that the ionic conductivity of POSS/Li-ion solid polymer electrolyte reached 3.26×10-4S/cm and mechanical properties were commendable. The proton conductivity of POSS hybrid proton exchange membranes came to the level of 6.46×10-2S/cm and the mechanical strength was 18MPa with less content of POSS. With the inorganic core of POSS, smaller and more uniform multi-pore electrode materials offer a new idea on the fabrication of supercapacitor electrode materials.
