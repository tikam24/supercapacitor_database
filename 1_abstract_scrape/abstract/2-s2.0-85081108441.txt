A planar solid-state photocapacitor with two electrodes has been prepared for the first time using a passivated film of ZnS with Ag2S quantum dots deposited on ZnO nanorods, which were electrochemically grown on ZnO seed layers, as the photoanode. The supercapacitor part is composed of a electrodeposited poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) PEDOT film as the counter-electrode and an ionic liquid-based electrolyte between them deposited by the dip coating method. The different nanostructures and electrodes were morphologically and structurally characterized, and the device was electrochemically characterized and could reach a potential of 0.33 V during photocharge and a storage efficiency of 6.83%.
