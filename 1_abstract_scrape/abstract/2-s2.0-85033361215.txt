A high performance electrode material for supercapacitors is achieved by incorporating 20–30 nm Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes into a highly porous CNT/rGO hybrid framework. The Ni(OH)2/CNT/rGO nanocomposite delivers a high specific capacitance of 633 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 based on the total mass of the composite, implying favorable charge transfer reactions. Even at 10 A g−1, 65% of the capacitance can be retained, demonstrating impressive high-rate performance. Remarkable cyclic performance was also delivered, with capacitance retention of 80% after 3000 cycles at 2 A g−1. The remarkable power capability and cycle stability was attributed to the rational design, homogenous microstructure and consequent synergistic effect generated in the composite. The simple and scalable one-pot synthesis procedure can be extended to fabrication of other high performance energy storage materials.
