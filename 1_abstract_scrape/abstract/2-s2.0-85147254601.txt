In this work, we prepared a novel electrode material NiFe-MOF@NiFeTe nanoparticle-rod heterostructures with high capacity and structural stability on nickel foam using a simple two-step hydrothermal method. The prepared NiFe-MOF@NiFeTe heterostructure combines the advantages of MOF and metal telluride with a large specific surface area, high electrical conductivity, and fast redox reaction. Meanwhile, NiFe-MOF@NiFeTe is uniformly distributed on the nickel foam substrate, which avoids agglomeration and facilitates electrolyte transport. The prepared electrode materials have excellent electrochemical properties. At 5 A/g, the specific capacitance of NiFe-MOF@NiFeTe can reach 1245.2 F/g, and the capacitance retention rate can reach 92.3 % after 1000 cycles. Furthermore, the assembled NiFe-MOF@NiFeTe//AC hybrid supercapacitor has an operating voltage of 1.7 V, an energy density of 267.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1699.9 W kg−1, and a capacitance retention rate of 82.9 % after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A/g. This study provides a feasible strategy for the development of efficient and stable hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials.
