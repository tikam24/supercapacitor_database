For a supercapacitor electrode, carbon-based materials have received great attention for their high surface area and stability. In this work, sustainable and cost-effective synthesis of boron-doped activated biomass-derived carbon from the stems of Prosopis juliflora has been reported for supercapacitor applications. The activation by KOH creates pores and boron induces p-type doping in the carbon matrix. The material gave a higher specific capacitance of 307.14 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The symmetric supercapacitor device delivered 156.29 F/g of specific capacitance with 98.1% of energy efficiency. The observed energy and power densities were 7.81 Wh/Kg and 150 W/Kg, respectively. The device was further studied with stability test for 1000 charge/discharge cycles and showed 98.6% of capacitance retention and 97.9% of coulombic efficiency.
