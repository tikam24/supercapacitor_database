Cotton-based porous activated carbons (CACs) are prepared through a simple chemical activation method using cotton fiber as carbon source and ZnCl<inf>2</inf> as activating agent. Powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and N<inf>2</inf> adsorption-desorption tests demonstrate that the carbons activated with different amounts of ZnCl<inf>2</inf> have a large number of mesopores, notably, a maximum specific surface area of 2548.6 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> and ultrahigh pore volume of 1.54 cm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> for CAC2 sample are obtained when the cotton/ZnCl<inf>2</inf> mass ratio is 1 : 2. As an electrode material for supercapacitors, the CAC2 possesses a high specific capacitance of 239 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup> and good rate capability (82% capacitance retention even at 8 A g<sup>-1</sup>) in 2 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the as-assembled CAC2//CAC2 symmetric supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 13.75 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 225 W kg<sup>-1</sup> operated at the voltage range of 0 to 1.8 V in 0.5 mol L<sup>-1</sup> Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous electrolyte and an excellent cyclability retaining about 93% initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
