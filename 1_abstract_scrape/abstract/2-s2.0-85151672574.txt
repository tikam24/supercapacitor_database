The reduced graphene oxide–strontium oxide nanorods (RGO/SrO NRs) were prepared by using simple, eco-friendly hydrothermal synthesis methods. The synthesized composite powder of RGO/SrO NRs was characterized and confirmed by using different X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Elemental mapping, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization techniques. From TEM analysis, strontium oxide morphologies in nanorod type structure were uniformly decorated on a graphene sheet. The electrochemical performance of confirmed individual SrO NRs and RGO/SrO NRs is a potential candidate for an electrode material in supercapacitors. They were studied in three different molar concentrations of KOH electrolyte solution and tested in different techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), charge–discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cycling stability in the aqueous three electrolyte method. It was observed that the better electrochemical performance of individual SrO NRs and novel binary nanocomposite RGO/SrO NRs could be affected 6 M KOH electrolyte solution than the 1 and 3 M KOH electrolyte solution. The RGO/SrO NRs show higher specific capacitance (Csp) of about 271 Fg−1 at 0.5 Ag−1 current density and exhibits lower solution resistance (Rs) value of about 1.12 Ω in the 6 M KOH electrolyte solution. The capacitance retention of the RGO/SrO NRs in 6 M KOH is about 89.14% for continuous 1000 cycles than in 1 and 3 M KOH electrolyte solution.
