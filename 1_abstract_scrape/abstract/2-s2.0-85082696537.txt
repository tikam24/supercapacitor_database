Dual-carbon based rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors are promising electrochemical energy storage devices because their characteristics of good safety, low cost and environmental friendliness. Herein, we extend the concept of dual-carbon devices to the energy storage devices using carbon materials as active materials in both anode and cathode, and offer a real-time and overall review of the representative research progress concerning such generalized dual-carbon devices. In this review, the charge storage mechanisms of various ions on different carbonaceous electrodes are introduced at first. Then, the research progress and problems of dual-carbon devices based on four types of charge-storage mechanisms including “adsorption-adsorption”, “adsorption-intercalation”, “intercalation-adsorption” and “intercalation-intercalation” are systematically discussed. Finally, prospects for future research directions and challenges of the dual-carbon devices are presented, and some new insights are proposed as well.
