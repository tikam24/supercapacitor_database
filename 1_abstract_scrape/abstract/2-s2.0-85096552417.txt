This paper furthers the development of physics-based reduced-order models (PRBROMs) of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs, also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors) by extending the operating range over which the models are accurate and by adding a thermal model. A PBROM is parameterized for a 100F Maxwell BCAPO100-T01 EDLC over the operating range of OV through 2. 7V, between -20o C and 40o C. Results are presented showing voltage predictions and the variation in internal model parameter values versus EDLC charge state. The new method gives better predictions than a previous method that worked only close to a specific voltage/temperature operational setpoint.
