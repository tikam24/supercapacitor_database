Ordered carbon/graphene composite nanofibers (CGCNFs) with different porous configurations were used as a material to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes. These nanofibers were synthesized by applying a modified parallel electrode to the electrospinning method (MPEM) in order to generate electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers containing graphene. After synthesis, these fibers were submitted to carbonization under a N2 atmosphere at 1100 Â°C. The influence of the ordering and porosity of CGCNFs on their electrochemical performance was studied. The results showed that by adding deionized water to the spinning solution one could increase the number of mesopores and the specific surface area of CGCNFs, thereby significantly increasing their specific capacitance. In addition, the ordering of CGCNFs within the electrode improved the electron transfer efficiency, resulting in a higher specific capacitance.
