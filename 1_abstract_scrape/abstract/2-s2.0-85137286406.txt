The proceedings contain 119 papers. The topics discussed include: metal patterning via arc etching for thin film electronics; inkjet-printed flexible oxide photodetectors for scalable user interfaces; ultra-thin chips (UTC) integration on inkjet-printed papers; printed wireless battery-free humidity sensor for integration into lightweight construction parts; flexible microcrystalline silicon source-gated transistors with negligible DC performance degradation at 2.5 mm bending radius; localized catalyst printing for flexible conductive lines by electroless copper deposition on textiles; metal patterning via arc etching for thin film electronics; a direct transfer process for laser-induced graphene sensors on any substrate; a hybrid casting and screen-printing based manufacturing method for flexible sensors; assessment of a cyclic bending test method for printed flexible supercapacitor; and a static characterization of stretchable 3D-printed strain sensor for restoring proprioception in amputees.
