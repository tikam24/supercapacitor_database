Copolymer precursor poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylamide) (P(AN-AM)) was synthesized and electrospun into nanofibers for conversion into carbon fibers. This study demonstrated that electrospinning is capable of generating nanofibers with high surface area and high degree of chain alignment, which are beneficial for chain interaction and gas permeation during carbonization. TGA and DSC analyses indicated the more thermally controlled reaction was achieved with the incorporation of acrylamide copolymer. Carbon fibers pyrolyzed from P(AN-AM) have shown improved flexibility. The specific capacitance of polypyrrole deposited on the nanofibers was measured. The capacitance was 117F/g at 0.05A/g in propylene carbonate. Further improvement on the conductivity of carbon nanofibers will improve the overall capacitance at higher current densities.
