Textile supercapacitors are promising flexible energy-storage devices, and they have great potential in various wearable electronics. However, they suffer from low electrochemical performance. Developing a rational fiber surface structure to enhance the electron transportation, electrolyte ion diffusion, and electroactive surface area is the most promising strategy to address the above issue. A textile-based electrode is developed by in situ coating the primary fiber inside the cotton fabric with an Au metallic layer and a nanostructured conductive metal-organic framework layer. The hierarchically porous structure, 3D conductive skeleton constructed by metal plated fabrics and conductive active materials, high surface area, and rational interface structure provide the electrodes with excellent synergistic effects, leading to high specific capacitance (258 F g-1), long cycling life, outstanding structural stability, and flexibility. A symmetrical all-solid-state textile supercapacitor employing this electrode achieves a high energy density of 434 Î¼wh cm-2
