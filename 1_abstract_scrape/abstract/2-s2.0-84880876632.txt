The goal of this work is to propose a supervision methodology for hybrid generation systems. This strategy must improve the grid insertion of renewable distributed generator (DG) by associating them with a short term storage and available decentralized generator (ADG). A fuzzy logic supervisor (FLS) is proposed to maintain a reference power and to contribute to frequency control with a hybrid generator (HG) based on photovoltaic arrays, gas micro turbine and supercapacitors. A detailed method to build this supervisor is proposed. The proposed fuzzy logic supervisor is compared with a basic supervision strategy The FLS gives a better storage management by reducing high and low saturation state, thus the HG can provide a more regular power reserve to contribute to the primary frequency control. The performance of this supervisor is shown with the help of simulations.
