In this study, a facile strategy is introduced to fabricate interconnected and porous carbon nanofibers for electrode materials to improve the electrochemical performances of supercapacitors. The well-developed all-solid-state supercapacitor shows specific capacitances of 71 and 57 F g−1 at current densities of 0.25 and 5 A g−1, as high as ∼ 80% retention rate. The energy density calculated based on supercapacitor device is as high as 9.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 125 W kg−1 and the maximum power density is 64.1 kW kg−1. Almost 100% capacity has been maintained after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles.
