The energy challenge requires a broad range of options for energy harvesting, storage, and conversion. We have produced polymeric coatings by spraying, to be used as electrolyte and electrodes in a flexible electrochemical double layer capacitor. A thermoplastic polyurethane and a low molecular weight block copolyether were employed with LiClO4 to prepare solid polymeric electrolytes. Carbon black (CB) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were dispersed in the polymer blend electrolyte to produce nanostructured composite electrodes. The conductivities increased with the addition of block copolyether and carbon nanotubes to the electrolyte and electrode, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the nanocomposite electrodes showed nanoagglomerates of CB connected by carbon nanotubes. The solid supercapacitor prepared with these new materials as electrolyte and electrodes showed superior performance to other similar systems. The resulting safe and flexible multilayer device can meet the requirements of modern devices. Â© Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag 2009.
