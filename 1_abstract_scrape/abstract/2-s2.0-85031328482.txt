This article focuses on polymer-based gel electrolytes because basic features good self-standing characteristics, conductivity, and excellent window stability for supercapacitor devices when compared to aqueous electrolytes. Gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) based on 30% poly (methyl methacrylate) grafted natural rubber (MG30) doped with ammonium triflate (NH4CF3SO3) and plasticized with ethylene carbonate (EC) were prepared by a solution casting method. Owing to being plasticized, the GPEs exhibit high room temperature ionic conductivity of 9.61Ã—10-4 S.cm-1 at the composition of 26:14:60 wt% for MG30: NH4CF3SO3: EC. Linear sweep voltammogram study shows the highest conducting GPE exhibited electrochemical window stability of 2.7V. The GPEs has been employed to demonstrate the possibility of fabricating supercapacitor. Symmetric devices assembled using activated carbon as electrodes and GPEs (highest conducting) exhibit a specific capacitance of 32 F.g-1.
