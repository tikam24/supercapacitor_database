In this article, we synthesize the bifunctional materials of various transition metals (TM) (Co, Ni and Mn) doped SnO2@MoS2 composites for enhanced energy storage and improved photocatalytic activity for removing organic pollutants. Herein, we use a facile hydrothermal method for sample synthesis and the physico chemical properties of the synthesized samples were investigated in detail using various analytical tools. The energy dispersive X-ray spectra and elemental mapping confirmed the presence of species in the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed the corresponding energy state of various TM doped SnO2@MoS2 samples. The Mn doped SnO2@MoS2 composite exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 242 F/g at a current density 0.5 A/g. The capacitance retention of 83.95% was observed after 5000 continuous charge/discharge cycles. Further, the Mn doped SnO2@MoS2 composite had higher degradation efficiency (97%) compared to all other samples using methylene blue as an organic dye under visible light irradiation. Henceforth, this study demonstrates the optimum concentration of Mn doped SnO2@MoS2 composite is the outstanding bifunctional materials for supercapacitor and photocatalytic applications.
