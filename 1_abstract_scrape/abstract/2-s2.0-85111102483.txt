We are reporting the preparation of a self-doped mesoporous activated carbon by the treatment of waste collected from car engine exhaust. The waste was pyrolyzed at 850Â°C in N2 atmosphere using KOH activating agent. Highly porous activated carbon was obtained with the presence of N, O, S, and P as self-dopant. A high specific surface area of 410 m2g-1 with the pore volume of 0.5947 cm3g-1 was achieved. Electrode prepared with the activated carbon showed a high specific capacitance (280 Fg-1) using a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte. It retained 95% of initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles, demonstrated high cyclic stability and sustainability.
