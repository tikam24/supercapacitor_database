In this work, we report on the synthesis of in situ and ex situ carbon-modified Li 4Ti 5O 12-C (LTO-C) nanocomposite and its application in a hybrid supercapacitor constructed using activated carbon (AC) and LTO-C nanocomposite as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The hybrid capacitors are characterized by galvanostatic charge-discharge, cycle life testing, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that the AC/LTO-C hybrid capacitors exhibit high rate capability and long cycle life. In the potential range of 1.5-3.0 V, the AC/LTO-C hybrid system can deliver a specific capacitance of 83 Fg -1 based on the total mass of AC and LTO-C electrodes at a current density of 60 mA g -1 (2 C rate). At a higher discharge rate of 980 mA g -1 (32 C), the capacity is 68 Fg -1, about 82% of that at 2 C rate. After 9,000 deep cycles at 32 C, the hybrid capacitor still maintains 84% of its initial capacitance. The specific energy of such hybrid system is 20 Wh kg -1, which is at least twice that of an AC/AC system. Combining the high energy density with power capability, the AC/LTO-C hybrid supercapacitor has demonstrated high performance for applications needing high power output. Â© Springer-Verlag 2012.
