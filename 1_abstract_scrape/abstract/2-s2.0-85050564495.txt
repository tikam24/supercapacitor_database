Nanoparticle-featured MoS2 and WS2 have been synthesized using a facile one-step hydrothermal approach and their application as electroactive materials for high-performance supercapacitors has been investigated. The electrochemical results of the MoS2 electrode exhibit a higher specific capacitance (Cs) of 1531.2 F g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 with good cycling stability (up to 81.6% retention over 3000 cycles). The WS2 electrode delivers a high Cs of 1439.5 F g-1 at 5 mA cm-2 and excellent cycling stability with 77.4% retention after 3000 cycles. The outstanding performance of the MoS2 and WS2 electrodes indicates their potential in next-generation high-performance supercapacitor applications.
