Polyaniline (PANi) and poly(N-methylaniline) (PNMA) films have been successfully synthesized on pencil graphite electrode (PGE) using cyclic voltammetry (CV) from acetonitrile (ACN) solution of 0.1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) and 0.1 M monomer. These polymers have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CV and Mott-Schottky (MS) analysis. The electrochemical storage properties of PGE coated with PANi (PGE/PANi) and PNMA (PGE/PNMA) have been evaluated using CV, potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge measurement. In addition, the voltage range has been determined. By this way, it is suggested for which kind of technological devices supercapacitor can be used as a circuit element. CV and potantiostatic EIS show that the specific capacitance of the PGE/PNMA is higher than the PGE/PANi. On the other hand, according to charge-discharge tests, the PGE/PNMA has better charge-discharge stability than the PGE/PANi. Â© 2012 by ESG.
