In this study, hexagonal mesoporous structured NiCo2O4 with uniform size is successfully synthesized via a facile rotary evaporation. Hexagonal NiCo2O4 electrodes exhibit a high specific capacitance of 568.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, standout rate performance of 71.0% retention for current increases 16 times, and excellent cycling stability of 76.8% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles, which are attributed to interconnected mesoporous self-assembly architecture and larger specific surface area generated through the novel rotary evaporation. This strategy provides a new avenue to develop and broaden more mesoporous self-assembly functional materials.
