Through cyclic voltammetry polypyrrole/nitric acid (PPy/HNO3) film was electrodeposited on stainless steel mesh. Its special structure like corals was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Various approaches such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) were imployed to investigate the electrochemical performance of PPy/HNO3 film. The results showed that the specific capacitance of PPy/0.5M HNO3 can reach to 596 F•g-1 at a current density of 5 mA•cm-2; even 1000 cycles the specific capacitance still maintained 96% at a scan rate of 50mV•s-1. All data illustrate that PPy/HNO3 film may become a proming candidate for supercapacitor applications.
