Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been recently investigated as promising electrode materials for battery and supercapacitor applications. While most explorations have focused on PBA nanoparticles, very little attention has been focused on PBA films deposited on a metallic support. In this work, we have examined electrogenerating hexacyanoferrate (HCF) and hexacyanoruthenate (HCR) films on nickel surfaces via cyclic voltammetry. We found that the total material deposited was influenced by the metal cation present in the electrolyte solution and that, on average, the rate of deposition of the surface adsorbed/immobilized species was dependent on the species in solution. In particular, films electrogenerated in the presence of Na+ and K+ had the highest deposition rates. The cyclic voltammetric profiles exhibited dramatic differences depending on the cation present in the electrolyte solution. In addition, we found that all films were electrochemically irreversible in the presence of Li+ and Mg2+ containing electrolyte solutions. Further, and as a proof of concept, we modified high surface area nickel electrodes with HCF in sodium-based electrolytes, finding that these electrodes could operate reversibly at equivalent C-rates as high as 1667C.
