Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) integrated with iron oxide nanoparticles (α-Fe2O3/rGO) composites with different morphologies were successfully obtained through the in situ synthesis and mechanical agitation methods. It was found that the α-Fe2O3 was densely and freely dispersed on the rGO layer. By comparing electrochemical properties, the sheet-like α-Fe2O3/rGO composites demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance: the highest specific capacitance, and excellent cycling stability and rate capacity. The specific capacitance is 970 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and the capacitance retention is 75% after 2000 cycles with the current density reaching 5 A g-1. It is mainly due to the synergistic effect between the α-Fe2O3 and rGO, and the high conductivity of the rGO offers a fast channel for the movement of electrons.
