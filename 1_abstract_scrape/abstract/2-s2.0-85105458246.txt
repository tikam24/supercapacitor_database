Transition metal dichalcogenides are considered promising constituents in energy storage devices due to their large surface areas, 2D sheet structures, and occurrence of efficient redox reactions at their surfaces. Supercapacitors comprising WS2-polyaniline (PANI) composite electrodes which exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, particularly effective high frequency response, are constructed. The highly porous WS2-PANI device facilitate rapid ion transport and surface access, aiding rapid reversible redox reactions contributing to the high frequency pseudocapacitive profile of the device. The symmetric WS2-PANI supercapacitor displays significantly higher capacitance of 180 µF cm−2 at a frequency of 120 Hz. This study points to potential application of WS2 composites in high frequency applications such as alternating current line filtering, and may open new avenues for employing the material in energy storage applications.
