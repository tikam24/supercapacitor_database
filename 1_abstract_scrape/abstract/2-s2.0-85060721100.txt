â€”Novel hybrid energy storage system configuration is introduced by interleaving the supercapacitor between the electrostatically sensitive devices (ESDs) and DC-link capacitors that can handle all power demands in transient or steady state conditions, and perform the ESD functions. The new system integrates an adaptive sliding-mode DC-DC control method to address the voltage permutations and ensure the required output voltage. Bi-directional power flow, important to the continuous hybrid energy storage system operation is also fulfilled. The continuous successful operation is provided with supplemental protection controls. The operation of the proposed system is verified through simulation with Matlab/Simulink. The hybrid energy system developed in this paper can be used in several applications including electrical vehicles and grid integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems.
