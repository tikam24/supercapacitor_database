3D Porous manganese oxide nanorods (pMn-NRs) are produced via hydrothermal approach and utilized as an electrode material for pseudocapacitor. The pMn-NRs supported on carbon textile exhibit high pseudocapacitive charge storage in an aqueous electrolyte. Interestingly, the pMn-NRs electrode can operate up to a potential window of 1.0 V and exhibits admirable capacitance of 1243F g−1 at 1 A g−1 (approaching theoretical value) with superb cycling stability (98%) over 15,000 cycles.
