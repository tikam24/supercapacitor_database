The main purpose of this article is to design a wide-area damping controller (WADC) considering time delay compensator (TDC) in large-scale power systems in the presence of renewable energy sources. The TDC is designed to create an opportunity for compensation of uncertainty caused by the phase delay. Then, considering the retrieved uncertainty, Hâˆž/H2 synthesis method is used to make robust the WADC so that the controller can compensate long and continuous delays. This design is done for two hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) connected to a 16-machine, 68-bus power system. The first HRES includes photovoltaic and permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) fields in which a super-capacitor-based energy storage system is used in the DC link in order to improve the oscillations of the injected power resulted from the variations of wind speed and solar irradiation. The second HRES includes offshore wind farm and shore wind farm with double-fed induction generator units, and also, offshore tidal farm with PMSG units. This HRES delivers its generated power to the system through a high voltage direct current (HVDC) line. The design of the damping controller is implemented based on WADC and local control on HVDC and super capacitor converter. The simulations have been carried out in different scenarios in the MATLAB environment to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach.
