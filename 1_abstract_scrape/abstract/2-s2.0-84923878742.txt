The present article presents an original, compact and powerful electric source, synergistically combining ESB and UC for emergency starting of internal combustion engines. The prototype of this device was created on the basis of an original circuit solution; also, a special algorithm for optimal charging of the UC was developed. The prototype was successfully tested with a diesel engine.
