Hexagonal-like ZnCo2O4 nanostructured compound was synthesized using the double hydroxide solution by the facile hydrothermal method. Structural properties of the electro-active materials were studied by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and Raman spectral analyses. Scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy reveal the hexagonal-like morphology of the ZnCo2O4 material. The improved electrochemical behavior of the material was ascertained by the cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The modified ZnCo2O4 electrode reveals the highest specific capacitance of 845.7 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte and cyclic stability of 95.3% (capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5 A g−1). The morphology plays a significant role in improving the specific capacitance of the modified electrode material. The symmetrical capacitor was fabricated using ZnCo2O4 electrode by a scalable solution method. The promising electrochemical performance implies that the hexagonal-like nanostructured ZnCo2O4 electrode can be effectively used in supercapacitors.
