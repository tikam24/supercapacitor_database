In the present study, BiYO3/RGO composite, is successfully synthesized by simple calcination method without the aid of any surfactants. The morphology, structural, and optical properties of the composite are examined by XRD, FTIR, XPS, SEM, and TEM analyses. The electrochemical properties of BiYO3 incorporated RGO showed higher surface area, good electrical conductivity, and lower resistivity than the pure BiYO3. It is revealed that the RGO facilitated faster ion diffusion pathway for the improved redox activity in the BiYO3/RGO composite. Furthermore, the BiYO3/RGO composite possesses higher specific capacitance of 725 Fg−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1.
