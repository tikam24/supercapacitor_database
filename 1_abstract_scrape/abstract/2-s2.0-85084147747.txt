Typical solar powered DC-microgrids (DCMG) employ rechargeable batteries for energy storage. In order to extract and deliver the maximum power out from the PV array to the load, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) solar charge controller is mandatory. With the commercial supercapacitor (SC) devices available in the market, new converter techniques with SC energy storage are possible for DCMG systems. The SCALED converter is such a technique where the rechargeable battery bank is replaced by a supercapacitor bank. However, if a SC bank is used as the sole energy storage, existing MPPT schemes are no longer appropriate since the storage bank acts as near ideal capacitor instead of a rechargeable battery pack. This is due to the fact that a capacitor bank retains energy within its electrostatic field, compared to the electrochemical reaction related back EMF of a battery pack. This paper presents the theoretical analysis to validate the above hypothesis.
