In this study, X-type barium hexaferrite (Ba2Co2Fe28O46) nanoplatelet was prepared by sol–gel auto-combustion route and the detailed electrochemical analysis were reported. Various equipments were used to study the synthesized hexaferrite particles including XRD, FTIR, HRSEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, and VSM analysis. The XRD results revealed the single-phase X-type hexagonal structure. Metal oxygen stretching bands in various environments such as tetragonal and octahedral coordinates have been confirmed using FTIR spectra. Hexagonal plate-like-shaped grains were clearly seen from the morphological studies. The elemental analysis using EDX spectra and XPS study confirmed the existence of proposed elements in Ba2Co2Fe28O46 grains and valence states of barium, cobalt, iron, and oxygen ions are also studied via XPS analysis. The ferrite samples annealed at 1350 °C established the magnetic properties, such as high squareness ratio (∼0.583), saturation magnetization (54.89 emu/g), retentivity (32.03 emu/g), and coercivity (2.779 kOe). The electrochemical (EC) performance of the Ba2Co2Fe28O46 nanoplatelets was studied for the first time with CV, GCD, and EIS analysis. A high value of specific capacitance of 139.83 F/g at 0.5 A/g is obtained for Ba2Co2Fe28O46 hexaferrite prepared at pH 07. These results demonstrated that X-type barium hexaferrite (Ba2Co2Fe28O46) nanoplatelet is one of the potentially interesting electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
