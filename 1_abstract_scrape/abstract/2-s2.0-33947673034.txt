This paper deals with an experimental realization of a 42V hybrid power sources for automotive applications. It's composed by a battery which provides the power in constant mean power and a supercapacitor tank in order to supply power in transient state. Two DC/DC converters are used to adapt voltage and current levels between the 42V DC link, battery and supercapacitor tank. Voltage is regulated by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
