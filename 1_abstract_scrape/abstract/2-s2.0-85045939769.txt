Herein, we report a simple and facile sequential hydrothermal process for the synthesis of Co3O4 nanowire@NiO nanosheet arrays (CNAs). The as-synthesized CNAs were characterized in detail using various analytical techniques, which confirmed the high crystallinity, purity, and high-density growth of these nanomaterials. From an application point of view, the as-synthesized CNAs were directly used as supercapacitor electrodes, revealing a specific capacitance of up to 2018 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2. Furthermore, a flexible asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using the as-synthesized CNAs as the anode and activated carbon as the cathode, which revealed a specific capacitance of 134.6 mF cm-2 at a current density of 2 mA cm-2. In addition, the supercapacitor showed excellent capacity retention of 73.5% after 10, 000 cycles at a current density of 10 mA cm-2.
