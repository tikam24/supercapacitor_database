Biomass derived carbon nano and microstructures have been extensively studied in energy conversion and storage systems. Here, we report the synthesis of carbon from natural source (neem seed shell). It was chemically activated using KOH. Chemical activation is highly favorable for electrode materials which opens up fresh pathways for ions during the electrochemical process. Structural analysis confirms the prepared activated carbon to be of amorphous nature. We have fabricated symmetric supercapacitor using prepared activated carbon as electrode material within the potential range 0 - 1V. Electrochemical measurements reveal that energy storage process originates from non-Faradic process. Moreover, a maximum specific energy of 52W h kg-1 was found to be delivered at a rate of 383W kg-1. Such superior features of carbon derived from neem seed shells will make them as promising candidate for real life applications.
