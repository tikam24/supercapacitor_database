In this paper, the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized via a facile one-step solvothermal method without annealing treatment. XRD, TEM, XPS, and N2 adsorption/desorption were used to characterize the composition, morphology, and BET surface area of as-prepared sample, respectively. The analysis results indicated that the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles with spinel structure were successfully obtained. The NiCo2O4 sample was prepared into supercapacitors electrode materials. At room temperature, the electrode materials were investigated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charging-discharging in a 6 mol L−1 KOH aqueous electrolyte. Three-electrode systems, in which Hg/HgCl was employed as reference electrode, were used. The NiCo2O4 exhibited a specific capacitance of 717.9 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, the specific capacitance remained 84% after 1000 continuous charge-discharge cycles under the current density of 10 A g−1.
