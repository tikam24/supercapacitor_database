Manufacturing hybrid electrodes with the combination of electroactive materials and carbon carriers brings hope for high-performance supercapacitors, but the poor interfacial compatibility between hydrophobic carbon substrate surface and active materials is still the bottleneck to be solved. Here, we propose a superhydrophilic strategy to stabilize NiCo2S4 on inert carbon cloth (CC) using nitrogen-doped (N-doped) carbon layer as structure/interface coupling bridge, so as to prepare hybrid material (expressed as NiCo2S4/CC-CN) for supercapacitor. The N-doped carbon layer on CC leads to the formation of superhydrophilic surface/interface, which is conducive to the uniform growth of NiCo2S4 on CC and helps to effectively strong coupling interaction between CC and NiCo2S4. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor made of NiCo2S4/CC-CN as the positive electrode and as-prepared activated carbon cloth (PACC) as the negative electrode provides a high energy density of 0.11 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.35 mW cm−2. The interfacial engineering in this study holds the potential of creating high energy density electrodes for advanced energy storage.
