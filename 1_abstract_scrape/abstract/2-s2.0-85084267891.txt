Ambipolar conducting polymers make a promising supercapacitor electrode material by transporting both holes and electrons. However, for a long time, their performance is limited due to the poor electron transport ability and stability problem, featuring charges trapped in the bulky polymers without being sufficiently released. To increase the material conductivity and reduce the transport distance of ACPs based electrode material are the rational approaches to tackle this issue. Here we demonstrate the integration of vertically standing graphene with ACPs to provide enhanced conductivity and suppressed charge trap effect. The composite electrode material exhibits prolonged cycling life (88% after 10,000 cycles) and makes the best of the high voltage advantage of ACPs to provide a high specific area energy density of 19.6 ​μWh cm−2 (at the power density of 150 ​μW ​cm−2).
