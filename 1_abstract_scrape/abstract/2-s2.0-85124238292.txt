Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHS) with both high energy density and high power density is a pursuing goal. Coupling high capacity molecule with graphene is recognized as an effective way. However, the common physical integration techniques cannot ensure molecular-level uniformity for electrodes, hence leading to inferior synergetic effects, especially in high mass loading situation. To address this dilemma, here we integrate cost-effective and redox-active phenanthraquinone (PQ) with graphene through two self-assemblies, which are the assembly of PQ layers on GO (graphene oxide) sheets in solvent and assembly of GO sheets into fluffy graphene hydrogel (FGH) architecture, at molecular-scale to prepare highly uniform PQ-FGH. Attributed to the molecular-level adsorption and fluffy morphology, PQ-FGH electrode ensures rapid electron transfer speed between PQ and graphene sheets as well as fast ions transportation. As a result, PQ-FGHs with either low or high mass loading (∼1 or 11.4 mg cm−2) exhibit high capacity and superior rate capability. Correspondingly, the areal energy density of the ZHS at 0.81 ∼ 32.6 mW cm−2 achieves 1.31 ∼ 0.81 mWh cm−2, which is closed to the level of commercial Li-ion batteries. This strategy can be easily extended to other materials to prepare high performance supercapacitors or batteries.
