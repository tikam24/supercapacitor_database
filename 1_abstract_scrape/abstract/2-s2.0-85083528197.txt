A new series configuration without internal connection was designed and planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors with series structure were fabricated by liquid-air interface self-assembly and photolithography. Compared with the series structures of internal metal connection and graphene connection, the planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors with no internal connection greatly reduced internal resistance and saved device volume. The planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors with no internal connection were provided with high output voltage of 2 V, time constant of 0.042 ms, stack capacitance of 27.30 F cm-3 and capacitance retention of 89% after 10000 cycles of charging and discharging at scan rate of 100 V s-1.
