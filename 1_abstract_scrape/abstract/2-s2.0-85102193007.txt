Volumetric performance is of great importance in today's energy storage devices, and is used to evaluate their competitiveness in the markets of miniaturized electronic devices and space-constrained electric vehicles. Supercapacitors suffer from a low volumetric energy density in spite of their high power and long cycle life because of their use of porous but low-density carbons. This review considers compact carbon design strategies for high volumetric performance supercapacitors based on four key electrode parameters: density, thickness, gravimetric capacitance, and nonactive components. A guide is provided for constructing a conductive additive-/binder-free self-supported ultrathick, dense electrode to maximize the volumetric energy density. The research status of emerging micro-supercapacitors and hybrid supercapacitors is then briefly discussed, emphasizing the importance of their volumetric performance and the opportunities as well as challenges they face in the trendy Internet of things applications or larger device systems.
