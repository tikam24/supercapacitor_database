For portable and wearable microelectronics, supercapacitors have emerged as potential microscale power sources. Polymeric inks have received considerable attention in for a number of applications such as electronic device fabrication and light sensors. Many technological gadgets owe their use to polymeric inks. Energy storage devices such as supercapacitors are the key components of modern appliances. Several studies on conductive ink composition for various electronic applications have been published. Organic and inorganic photovoltaics, supercapacitors, radio-frequency identification solar cells, thin-film transistors, and smart textiles are among the printed electronic use of conductive inks, which include sensors, smart fabrics, batteries, and antennas. The advantages and disadvantages of conductive graphene-based inks and the role of polymeric material are also illustrated in this chapter.
