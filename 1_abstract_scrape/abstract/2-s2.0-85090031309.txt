Faced with current energy and environmental challenges, electric vehicles represent an interesting alternative solution to vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. Our project focuses on finding a solution that combines several energy sources with complementary characteristics and low environmental impact, adapted to these vehicles. The two selected sources are a fuel cell and a supercapacitor for their complementarity in terms of power density and mass energy. Fuel cell systems have disadvantages, such as high cost, slow response and no regenerative energy recovery during braking. Supercapacitors have a low energy density. Hybridization can be a solution to these drawbacks. The Energy Management Strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic has been developed. A first dimensioning of an electric powertrain was made, modelling of sources and DC/DC converters were built. Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR) is used as a unified formalism for modelling, control, and EMS development. The results of robustness gathered using different types of driving cycles will be presented and compared.
