Ti3C2Tx, a typical representative among the emerging family of 2D layered transition metal carbides and/or nitrides referred to as MXenes, has exhibited multiple advantages including metallic conductivity, a plastic layer structure, small band gaps, and the hydrophilic nature of its functionalized surface. As a result, this 2D material is intensively investigated for application in the energy storage field. The composition, morphology and texture, surface chemistry, and structural configuration of Ti3C2Tx directly influence its electrochemical performance, e.g., the use of a well-designed 2D Ti3C2Tx as a rechargeable battery anode has significantly enhanced battery performance by providing more chemically active interfaces, shortened ion-diffusion lengths, and improved in-plane carrier/charge-transport kinetics. Some recent progresses of Ti3C2Tx MXene are achieved in energy storage. This Review summarizes recent advances in the synthesis and electrochemical energy storage applications of Ti3C2Tx MXene including supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and lithiumâ€“sulfur batteries. The current opportunities and future challenges of Ti3C2Tx MXene are addressed for energy-storage devices. This Review seeks to provide a rational and in-depth understanding of the relation between the electrochemical performance and the nanostructural/chemical composition of Ti3C2Tx, which will promote the further development of 2D MXenes in energy-storage applications.
