Laser direct writing of polyimide (PI) film to induce porous graphene as a flexible electrode facilitates the development of efficient, low-cost, and large-scale preparation of flexible planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs). Nevertheless, current flexible MSCs based on laser-induced graphene (LIG) face bottlenecks such as poor LIG electrode wettability, inhomogeneous doping of heterogeneous components, and limited electrochemical performance. In view of this, a simple and effective process for in situ fabrication of flexible FeOx nanoparticles embedded N-doped LIG (FeOx@NLIG) electrode is developed by laser direct writing in this study. The as-assembled in-plane FeOx@NLIG MSCs exhibit an excellent areal specific capacitance of 13.82 mF cm−2, a remarkable energy density of 1.228 mW h cm−2 at a high power density of 0.024 mW cm−2, good flexibility, and conspicuous cycling stability. Besides, these high-performance in-plane FeOx@NLIG MSCs as a vital micro-energy storage component can be easily miniaturized, modularized, and integrated to suit customized needs of wearable electronics due to great advantages in terms of identicality and stability of the as-fabricated FeOx@NLIG.
