Concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated nitric acid were used as oxidants to oxidize the surface of hard carbon by ultrasonic oxidation, and its electrochemical performance as a negative electrode material for lithium ion supercapacitors was studied. The influence of ultrasonic oxidation treatment on the morphology, structure and relative content of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of hard carbon before and after treatment was studied by means of galvanostatic charge and discharge, cyclic voltammetry and AC impedance. The results showed that ultrasonic oxidation treatment can introduce appropriate amount of oxygen-containing functional groups on the hard carbon surface, add additional active sites, improve the electron mobility, and then improve the electrochemical performance of hard carbon materials. In the half-cell test, at a high current density of 2 A•g-1, the specific capacity of oxidized hard carbon is twice that of untreated hard carbon, and it has excellent rate performance. Lithium ion capacitors were fabricated with oxidized hard carbon anode and activated carbon cathode. The energy density is 37.6 W•h•kg-1, and the power density is 9415 W•kg-1, the capacity retention rate was 99.1% after 4000 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A•g-1, showing good cyclic stability.
