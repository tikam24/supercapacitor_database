Herein, we introduce the application of nickel hydroxide nanosheets on the electro-etched carbon fiber (ECF) formed via a direct electrodeposition, for fabrication of asymmetric supercapacitor. To confirm the practical applicability of prepared Ni(OH)2–ECF, an asymmetric device was assembled using Ni(OH)2–ECF in combination with an activated carbon (AC) electrode. Our results showed a substantial cycling stability (96% capacitance retention after 10000 cycles) and considerable rate capability at large discharge currents (60% capacitance retention at 8 A g− 1) for this asymmetric supercapacitor that may have originated from the good contact between Ni(OH)2 and ECF. A maximum specific capacitance of 88.1 F g− 1 was achieved for Ni(OH)2–ECF//AC/CF device and showed considerable rate capability at large discharge currents (60% capacitance retention at 8 A g− 1). The results of this study suggest the Ni(OH)2–ECF electrode is an excellent material for fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes.
