This paper presents a power control strategy for a marine power system made up of a hybrid diesel generator, a fuel cell, and an energy storage unit. For this purpose, a self-tuning fuzzy control is designed to manage the power generation between power sources during different maneuverings and voltage disturbances (both balanced and unbalanced) in an AC system. As a solution, a current control strategy using a voltage source converter is presented. Simulation results show the response of the whole system under a test driving cycle and this variety of voltage disturbance conditions. They illustrate the performance, including power flow control and voltage disturbance ride-through capability, of the proposed control strategy.
