A series of MnO2/bamboo-based activated carbon composites with different MnO2 contents were prepared by a mechanical milling method and investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. Cyclic voltammetry and constant current charge-discharge tests were also carried out. The specific capacitance of the composite containing 1% MnO2 reached a maximum of 338F/g and retained a value of 260F/g after 100 charge-discharge cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance shows that the materials have potential applications in supercapacitors.
