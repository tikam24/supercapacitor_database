This paper presents the stability-evaluation outcomes of a multimachine power system (MMPS) connected with a large-scale hybrid wind farm (WF) and photovoltaic (PV) farm or hybrid wind/PV farm (HWPF) and a hybrid energy-storage system (HESS) consisting of a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) and a supercapacitor (SC). A probability scheme is used to determine the rated power of the proposed HESS, where the capacities of the VRFB-ESS and the SC-ESS are designed to effectively utilize their operating features. The control strategy of the HESS is proposed to reduce the pressure of the VRFB-ESS and smooth the output power fluctuations of the HWPF. The steady-state stability, small-signal stability, dynamic performances, and transient simulations of the studied grid-tied HWPF fed to the MMPS with and without the HESS are achieved. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed HESS can enhance the stability and power-smoothing performance of the HWPF fed to the MMPS.
