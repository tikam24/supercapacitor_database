Adoption of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) brings a bright perspective to improve the total economy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This paper proposes a novel energy management method to improve the total economy of PHEV by exploiting the energy storage capability of HESS. Firstly, A cyber-physical energy management framework that enables the synergistic scheduling of fuel engine, battery, and supercapacitor is designed to derive the optimal power distribution strategy for PHEV with HESS. Then, an optimization-based energy management model is established to distribute the vehicle power requirement between the fuel engine and driving motor. The reduction of fuel cost and the mitigation of the battery aging phenomenon are designed as the optimization objectives. In a further stage, an online power distribution algorithm is designed for the optimal control of HESS, where the supercapacitor is used to prolong the battery life. The qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that both the fuel economy and battery aging cost are sensitive to the power system topology and power distribution algorithm. With the proposed methods, the PHEV total economy can be improved by 8.9% and 6.9% compared to the conventional PHEV structure and power distribution strategy while guarantee the vehicle dynamic performance.
