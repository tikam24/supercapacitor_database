The horizontally aligned MoO2/single-walled carbon nanotube (MoO2/SWNT) composite has been prepared by electrochemically induced deposition method which utilizes the good electronic conductivity of SWNTs as supporting material to deposit MoO2. The morphology and crystal structure of the composite were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The capacitive properties of the MoO2/SWNT composites have been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). A specific capacitance (based on MoO2) as high as 597 F g- 1 is obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s- 1 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Additionally, the MoO2/SWNT composites electrode shows excellent long-term cycle stability (only 2.5% decrease of the specific capacitance is observed after 600 CV cycles). Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.
