Carbon nanotube spaced graphene aerogels have been prepared by a hydrothermal method and used for supercapacitor applications. The specific surface area and specific capacitance can be controlled by tuning the amount of added carbon nanotubes. The as-prepared composite aerogels retain the advantage of aerogel structure in providing macropores to ensure electrodes fast wetted by the electrolyte ions and also possess additional mesopores created by the carbon nanotube spacers for more ion adsorption. Benefited from that, the composite aerogels exhibit significantly enhanced supercapacitor properties in both aqueous and ionic liquid electrolyte. Compared with graphene aerogels, the composite aerogels show a 37% larger specific capacitance of 245.5 F g-1 at a current density of 2.5 A g-1 and high rate capability of 197.0 F g-1 at a high current density of 80 A g-1 in aqueous electrolyte. Moreover, the composite aerogels deliver a 33% larger specific capacitance of 183.3 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and a high energy density of 80 Wh kg-1 when using an ionic liquid (EMIMBF4) as the electrolyte.
