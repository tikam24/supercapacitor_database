Supercapacitors are widely used as an energy storing device in a wide range of communication, transportation and daily life, including hybrid electric vehicles, new energy collection and conversion, high-power construction machinery, mobile electronic equipment, and so forth. The electrode materials of supercapacitor require effective, controllable porous structure, specific surface area, a reasonable pore size distribution, good electrical conductivity and easy molding. Nanoporous copper is a kind of porous material with high conductivity, high specific surface area, controllable aperture and good capacitance. It can be used as a current collector loading more active materials for supercapacitor, thus greatly improving the energy density of supercapacitor. In addition, the modified nanoporous copper can enhance the physical and chemical stabilities of porous copper substrate and retain more active sites. It offers a kind of idea for controllable electrode design of supercapacitors.
