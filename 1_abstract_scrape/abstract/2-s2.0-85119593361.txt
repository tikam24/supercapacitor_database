Herein, this work demonstrates the design and synthesis of multicomponent hybrid material NiSχ@MnCoOχ/NF core–shell nanoarrays with high charge storage performance for supercapacitors. The needle-like MnCoOχ nanoarrays as the skeleton of the core layer are grown vertically on the Ni foam via a hydrothermal method, while the NiSχ nanosheets are engineered to anchor onto the surface to form the shell via an electrodeposition method. The unique core–shell architecture provides a large number of reactive sites for MnCoOχ and NiSχ, enhances the number of ion diffusion channels and fast electron transfer pathway. As advanced electrode, NiSχ@MnCoOχ/NF delivers a high specific capacity of 1358 C g−1 (4.84 C cm−2) at 0.5 A g−1, which is 2.05 times that of MnCoOχ/NF (661 C g−1 or 1.35 C cm−2). Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor device (NiSχ@MnCoOχ/NF//rGO/NF) exhibits a high specific capacitance of 181.71 F g−1 (2.26 F cm−2), a long cycle life, and a maximum specific energy of 64.61 Wh kg−1, suggesting a great potential for practical application. Therefore, an ingeniously designed core–shell array structure can effectively realize the charge storage potential of the Mn–Co oxides and Ni sulfides, and this work presents an alternative method for constructing hybrid architectures for advanced electrochemical energy storage materials.
