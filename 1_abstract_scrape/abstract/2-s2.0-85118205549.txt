In this work, a simple, nontoxic, and eco-friendly method for recycling organic-based expired medicines into activated carbon was proposed. The formation, structural, and morphological features of the sample were proved by different physico-chemical tools such as Fourier transform infrared, Raman, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis. Further, expired medicine–derived activated carbon (Em AC) was used as electrode material for supercapacitor devices, and its biocompatibility was studied. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis were used to investigate the electrochemical properties of the fabricated Em AC@Ni foil electrode. The as-fabricated electrode delivered specific capacitance (Csp) value of 480 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Also, the electrode exhibited superior cyclic stability and maintained 88% of its capacitance value upto the completion of 8000 GCD cycles at the current density of 2 A/g. Further, Em AC–based symmetric device achieved the energy density of 28.33 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 666.01 W kg−1. Hence, the porous Em AC sample was identified as the promising electrode material for future energy storage devices without distracting any damage to the biological system.
