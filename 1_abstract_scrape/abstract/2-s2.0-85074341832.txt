Manipulation of low-dimensional solids through soft chemical routes is an elegant way to realize newer materials. A new family of single-crystalline transition-metal layered organophosphates, with about 185 000 metal phosphate layers in a single crystal, can be exfoliated to a single-layer nanosheet by a facile and rapid solvent assisted method. This exfoliation aids the formation of high-surface-area pyrophosphates with enhanced supercapacitance.
