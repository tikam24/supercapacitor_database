Hierarchical porous carbons (HPCs) are obtained via in-situ activation of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) obtained from simultaneous polymerization of resorcinol/formaldehyde (R/F) and polyacrylamide (PAM). The hierarchically micro-, meso- and macroporous structure of as-prepared HPCs is attributed to the synergistic pore-forming effect of PAM and KOH, including PAM decomposition, KOH chemical activation, and a foaming process of potassium polyacrylate formed by partial hydrolysis of PAM in KOH aqueous solution. The typical HPC electrode with the highest surface area (2544 m2/g) shows a high specific capacitance of 261 F/g at 1.0 A/g and a superior rate capability of 216 F/g at 20 A/g in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the electrode maintains the capacitance retention of 90.8% after 10000 charging-discharging cycles at 1.0 A/g, exhibiting long cycling life. This study highlights a new avenue towards IPNs-derived carbons with unique pore structure for promising electrochemical applications.
