In order to obtain materials for electrochemical capacitors with excellent capacitance performances, we adopted the sol-gel process to prepare strontium bismuth oxide(SBO) nanomaterials, and successfully synthesized an SBO/MWCNT composite used as electrode by a hydrothermal method. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and electrochemical measurements were performed to investigate the morphology, structure and supercapacitive performance of the composite. The results showed that the SBO/MWCNT electrode presented a specific capacitance of 516.8 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g in a 6 mol/L KOH aqueous solution. This value was much higher than that of SBO electrodes (446.5 F/g) and MWCNT electrodes (12.0 F/g). If the current density increased to 5 A/g, the specific capacitance of SBO/MWCNT electrode would remain as high as 446.4 F/g. EIS results indicated that the electrode also had a good frequency response. These results show that SBO/MWCNT is a promising composite electrode material with great application for energy storage and conversion devices.
