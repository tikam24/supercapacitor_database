Introducing Photovoltaic (PV) panels into Electric vehicles (EVs) helps enrich the energy systems of EVs, optimize the power configuration of EVs, extend the range of EVs, and improve the performance of EVs. A four-port converter is constructed using BOOST/BUCK/three-phase voltage-based inverter circuits, which can meet the balanced deployment of the composite energy system under different working conditions. The first and second BOOST circuits are used to realize the joint power supply of the super capacitor and battery to start and accelerate the electric vehicle. The third BOOST circuit is used to achieve the maximum power tracking of the photovoltaic panels to supply power to the EV and charge the battery. Power supply to the brushless DC motor using a three-phase inverter circuit. A reverse-parallel diode rectifier and a BUCK circuit are used to achieve braking energy return and reverse charging of the battery and super capacity. Simulation tests show that the four-port converter model can realize various operating modes such as super capacitor start-up and acceleration; smooth battery operation; maximum power tracking of PV panel and battery co-powering; charging of battery and super capacitor by PV panel; and parallel operation of multi-energy systems, maintaining the stability of voltage and speed and improving energy efficiency for EVs.
