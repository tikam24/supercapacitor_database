In this study, we synthesized bacteria-doped graphene oxide by one-pot carbonization process for supercapacitor electrodes. Bacteria solution depending on the type of Gram-negative and -positive bacteria were mixed with graphene oxide (GO), then carbonized at 700 °C for 1 h. The electrochemical properties demonstrated superior electrochemical performance as supercapacitors electrode application. The specific capacitance of prepared electrode was 237 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, which was more than 5 times greater than that of the graphene oxide and good cycling stability with no decay after 5000 cycles. These attractive results suggest that graphene oxide/bacteria composites can be used a supercapacitor electrodes material with high-performance.
