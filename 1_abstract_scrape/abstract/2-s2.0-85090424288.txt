Among various energy storage devices, pseudo capacitive supercapacitors have gained much attention due to its unique features of high-power density and fair enough energy density. This work is aimed to fabricate high power density and energy density supercapacitor by using MnO2 nano-flakes as electrode material. MnO2 nano-flakes have been synthesized using hydrothermal technique and incorporated in supercapacitor structure to study the performance. The electrochemical performance of MnO2 nanoflake electrode was investigated and obtained a specific capacitance of 145 F.g-1 at 5 mV.s-1 with energy density of 20.16 Wh.kg-1 and power density of 363.03 W.kg-1
