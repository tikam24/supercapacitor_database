Due to the dilemma of rapid consumption of fossil fuels and environmental pollution, development of clean, efficient and renewable energy conversion and storage technology has become an urgent need. Supercapacitors and hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells as typical representatives have become the focus of scientific research, in which the electrode materials are of much importance to their improved activity. In this work, a series of porous carbons (PCs) with high specific surface areas were prepared using natural coals as carbon precursors coupled with KOH activation. The effects of the mass ratio of coal and KOH as well as different activation temperatures on the microstructures of the PCs and electrochemical properties were studied in detail. The optimal PC4 (KOH: coal = 4) possessed a high specific surface area (SSA) of 2092 m2 g-1 and a well-developed microporous structure. As the electrocatalyst, it exhibited a positive onset potential of 0.88 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and half-wave potential of 0.78 V (vs. RHE) towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in an alkaline solution. PC4 also showed the highest specific capacitance of 128 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 among all the samples in this work. The relatively good performance of PC4 resulted from its well-developed microporous structure and large SSA, enabling fast mass transfer of electrolytes.
