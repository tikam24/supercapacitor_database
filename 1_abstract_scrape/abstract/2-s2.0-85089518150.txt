As an important member of the transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) family, VS4 has numerous captivating chemical and physical properties that benefit from its peculiar crystallographic structure and high sulfur content. However, low rate capability and poor cycling stability are two major hurdles that limit its practical application as an electrode material in supercapacitors. To address this issue, we synthesize VS4 in highly ordered mesoporous double gyroid morphology and hybridized with highly conducting antimonene (Sb) to expose more active edge sites for improving mass transfer of ions. Benefitting from the pseudocapacitive contributions, high conductivity and large surface area for ion transport, the VS4/Sb‖VS4/Sb cell displays high specific capacitance (539.4F g−1 @ 3 A g−1), good rate capability (~52%), excellent cycling stability (174% after 10,000 cycles), high energy and power density (93.5 Wh kg−1 and 1705 W kg−1). Quantification of kinetics of charge storage mechanism in both VS4 and VS4/Sb revealed that hybridization of Sb with VS4 may evolve it from being a typical battery like material to pseudocapacitive material. This work elucidates how morphological control of the material at the nanoscale together with hybridization of highly pseudocapacitive materials provides new opportunity for improving charge storage characteristics.
