Sea-urchin shaped α-MnO2 hierarchical nano structures have been synthesized by facile thermal method without using any hard or soft template under the mild conditions. The structural and morphology of the 3D-MnO2 was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). From the XRD analysis indicates that MnO2 present in the α form. Morphology analysis shows that α-MnO2 sea-urchins are made by stacked nanorods, the diameter and length of the stacked nanorods present in the range of 50-120 nm and 200-400 nm respectively. The electrochemical behaviour of α-MnO2 has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and charge-discharge (CD). The specific capacitance, energy density and power density are 212.0 F g-1, 21.2 Wh kg-1 and 1200 W kg-1 respectively at the current density of 2 A g-1. The retention of the specific capacitance after completion of 1000 charge-discharge cycles is around 97%. The results reveal that the prepared Sea-urchin shaped α-MnO2 has high specific capacitance and exhibit excellent cycle life.
