CuO nanostructured electrodes were successfully synthesized via a chemical bath deposition at room temperature for pseudocapacitor application. Changing the reaction time leads to the formation of different morphological nanostructures such as uniformed nanoneedles, nanotubes, nanosheets, and microflowers during oxidation. The electrodes were electrochemically characterized via cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge using 6 M KOH electrolyte at different scan rates of 2-50 mV/s and current densities of 2-5 mA/cm2, respectively. The electrodes exhibited good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance ranging from 88-231 mF/cm2 at 2 mV/s.
