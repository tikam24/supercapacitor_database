Three-dimensional (3D) mixed phases NiSe nanoparticles growing on the nickel foam were synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. A series of experiments were carried out to control the morphology by adjusting the amount of selenium in the synthetic reaction. Meanwhile, the as-prepared novel column-acicular structure NiSe exist three advantages including ideal electrical conductivity, high specific capacity and high cycling stability. It delivered a high capacitance of 10.8Fcm-2 at a current density-of 5mAcm-2. An electrochemical capacitor device operating at 1.6V was then constructed using NiSe/NF and activated carbon (AC) as positive and negative electrodes. Moreover, the device showed high energy density of 31Whkg-1 at a power density of 0.81kWkg-1, as well as good cycling stability (77% retention after 1500 cycles).
