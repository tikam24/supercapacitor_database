ZIF-67 (Co(MeIM)<inf>2</inf>, MeIM=2-methylimidazole) was selected as a precursor to synthesize the metallic cobalt/carbon composites on Ni foam directly and intimately. The results show that ZIF-67 forms a uniform membrane and densely covers the Ni foam substrate. Besides, the cobalt/carbon composites obtained are composed of cobalt nanoparticles with a diameter up to around 2.6nm, which are anchored on carbon homogeneously. The specific capacitance of the composites material is up to 512Fg<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 1Ag<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0M KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the specific capacitance loss is ~46.4% with increase at the current density from 1 to 20Ag<sup>-1</sup>. More significantly, the specific capacitance retention rate is 87.5% at a current density of 5Ag<sup>-1</sup> after 1000 cycles. These results suggest that the electrochemical performance can be greatly enhanced by the well-controlled size and distribution of the cobalt nanoparticles, which is mainly attributed to the unique structure and composition of ZIF-67.
