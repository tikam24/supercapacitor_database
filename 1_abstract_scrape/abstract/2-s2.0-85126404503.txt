Supercapatteries combine both capacitive and battery-like behavior, thereby including the benefits of both storage mechanisms. Supercapattery poses a nonideal polarization like that of a battery while they can be discharged completely. The negatrodes in supercapattery are usually made of carbonaceous materials and their composites due to their high surface area, electrochemical stability, electrical conductivity and high porosity. Various carbonaceous materials such as reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotube and activated carbon used as a supercapacitor-type electrode in supercapattery are briefly discussed in this chapter.
