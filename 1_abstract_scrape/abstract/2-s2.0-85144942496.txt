The rapid growth in the demand for a high-performance energy storage device with high-speed recharging ability has drawn the attention of many researchers to designs and develop new materials for supercapacitor applications. Out of the developing nanotechnologies, nanofibers have achieved a great deal of attention in energy resources and electrical science, where their intriguing properties contribute to the product functionality. The graphene oxide-based electrospun nanofibers are promising materials for applications in energy storage devices and supercapacitors due to the unique properties such as outstanding electrical conductivity, highly tunable surface area, excellent mechanical behavior, and good chemical stability. In this chapter, the authors give a brief introduction of the supercapacitor and discuss the structure and properties of GO, along with adequate explanation and insights toward the method for the fabrication of electrospun nanofibers. The conclusion section will discuss the electrochemical performance of functionalized graphene oxide-based electrospun nanofibers electrode for supercapacitor applications.
