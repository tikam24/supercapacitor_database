The re-stacking of graphene sheets leads to the far lower areal capacitance and energy density of the graphene-based micro-supercapacitors (MSC) than the expected. Herein, to solve this issue, a novel 0D/2D porous carbon integrated architecture (PC-IA) is ingeniously in-situ constructed by a two-step fabrication strategy, which is realized by the synthesis of 0D/2D TiC integrated architecture in a molten salt-containing Ti environment based on graphene nanosheets (GNS) as the template followed by high-temperature chlorination. Interestingly, the newly synthesized PC-IA shows huge advantages compared with the original GNS, such as higher specific surface area, more abundant porosity, better wettability to electrolyte and more effective ion channels in the c-axis direction, etc. As a result, when PC-IA is used as the electrode material, the fabricated MSC exhibits excellent electrochemical performances, such as ultrahigh areal capacitance of 70.12 mF cm−2 and high energy density of 9.48 μWh cm−2. Moreover, the fabricated MSC also behaves excellent mechanical flexibility and can be easily adjusted in the voltage and capacitance by connecting multiple MSC devices in series and parallel. Hence, this work opens up a new way for the reasonable design of carbon-based electrodes, which has broad application prospects in various flexible/wearable electronic devices.
