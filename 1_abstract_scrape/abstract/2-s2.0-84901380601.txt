This paper presents a control strategy for managing the demand-generation fluctuations using a hybrid energy storage system in a wind-dominated remote area power supply (RAPS) system consisting of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG), a battery storage system, a supercapacitor, a dump load, and main loads. Operation of a battery storage system is coordinated with a supercapacitor with a view to improving the performance of the battery. In this regard, the battery storage system is connected to the load side of the RAPS system, whereas the supercapacitor is connected to the dc bus of the back-to-back converter of the DFIG. The operation of the hybrid energy storage system is coordinated through the implementation of a power management algorithm, which is developed with a view to reducing the depth of discharge and ripple content of the battery current. In addition, the dump load is connected to the load side of the RAPS system, which utilizes the power in situations that cannot be handled via an energy storage system. In addition, a coordination method has been developed and proposed to coordinate the power flows among all system components with a view to regulating the power flow and thereby ensuring the robust voltage and frequency control on the load side while capturing the maximum power from wind.
