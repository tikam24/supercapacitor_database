We report the electrochemical performances of mesoporous Zn0.2Ni0.05Co0.5O microspheres, synthesised through a simple hydrothermal route for supercapacitor application. Structural properties were studied by using powder X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The crystal lattice parameter of mesoporous Zn0.2Ni0.05Co0.5O microspheres (MPS1) is found to be 8.108 Å with an average crystallite size of 31 nm. The electron microscopic study reveals the sphere-shaped microstructures with porous nature. The specific surface area of MPS1 found to be 54 m2 g−1 with bimodal average pore diameter of 4 and 12 nm from N2 absorption-desorption data. The electrochemical properties of MPS1 electrode were investigated by different experimental measurements in three-electrode configuration. The specific capacity of the electrode found to be 270 C g−1 (675 F g−1) at 4.08 A g−1 and 1253 C g−1 (2088 F g−1) at 2 mV s−1. The charge storage mechanism was explicated via Trasatti plotting approach. It reveals the major ratio of the charges stored in the outer surface of MPS1. Furthermore, the electrochemical long-term cycling stability of the electrode is examined by the galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle test and found an excellent cycling retention about 97% of its initial value after 1000 cycles.
