The energy storage of activated carbon modified with a semiconducting oxide TiO2 is studied. The composite was prepared by mixing nanosize TiO2 and activated carbon through a means of ultrasonic vibration in ethanol solution for 30min. It was found that with modification of TiO 2, the specific capacitance of activated carbon measured at 0.65mA/cm2 was increased from 47.2 to 63.1Fg-1. This method is unique in comparison the conventional method because it uses semiconducting TiO2 other than electrochemically active materials such as RuO2. The later has been adopted to make electrochemical- double-layer hybrid supercapacitors, however, the former is attributed to a pure double-layer supercapacitor. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
