N-doped mesoporous carbons (N-MCs) were synthesized via the oxypolymerization of aniline with a Pluronic F127 template, sintering at 850 °C in N 2 atmosphere, and activation in a KOH solution. The contrast experiments were carried out without the addition of F127 and the obtained sample was defined as N-Cs. The Brunaner-Emmett-Teller measurement, pore size distribution measurements, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of N-MCs and N-Cs were performed. The specific areas of the N-MCs and N-Cs reached 721 and 394 m 2 g −1 , respectively. The specific capacitances of the N-MCs and N-Cs were as high as 318 and 106 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 . The cycle life of N-MCs at different current densities was above 96% after 5000 cycles of charging and discharging, indicating that the N-MCs had excellent cycle stability.
