Advanced Analogic Technologies has introduced a 2-A flash LED driver IC in May 2008, which is capable of delivering high-intensity light from WLEDs. The AAT1282 uses a supercapacitor to deliver the high peak current needed to support the high-intensity flash, by combining a high frequency boost converter with fixed-input current limiting, dual-output regulated current sinks and I 2C control. This is required for mobile phones featuring cameras with resolutions of 5 megapixels and higher, while protecting the battery. The adoption of LED flash in portable applications has been limited due to the high levels of battery current, forward voltage and peak current required to produce this intensity. The AAT1282 allows designers to use WLEDs to deliver the high-intensity light needed for flash and video applications in high-megapixel cameras without draining or damaging the battery, by storing the output of a boost converter in a high capacity supercapacitor.
