The paper emphasis on a new control technique for Supercapacitor Energy Storage System (SCESS) in DC microgrid. Energy management has become an important factor in the present day scenario where immense renewable energy injection happens into the power grid. Supercapacitors are good energy storage elements and can be used as an independent SCESS in a droop-regulated DC microgrid through a proper energy management strategy. Such SCESS integrated microgrids are capable of compensating power oscillations happening because of load or source transients and hence they can improve the quality of power and also the life time of distributed generators (DG) or distributed energy storage elements. This work introduces a control strategy for the control of bi-directional converter which couples the grid with the SCESS that ensures switch and play feature. The proposed control system is simulated and results are verified.
