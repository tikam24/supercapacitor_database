Supercapacitor is an alternative power source due to its high energy density, fast charge/discharge time, low level of heating, safety, long-term operation stability. MWCNTs are used for supercapacitor applications due to their unique properties, structure, high surface area. In the present work nanocomposites were prepared from Cu modified MWCNTs (binary) from which ternary composite also prepared with HCl doped polyaniline (PANI). Cu modified MWCNTs were prepared by the reduction of copper sulphate with sodium borohydride in basic medium. The uniform coating of polymer, upon the Cu modified MWCNTs, was evidenced from the field emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images. The modification of MWCNTs with Cu, was confirmed from the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement and charge discharge test shows higher capacitance for the ternary composites (264 F/g) compared to the binary system (125 F/g). The cyclic stability and retention of specific capacitance also shows the better result for ternary system. Copyright Â© 2014 American Scientific Publishers.
