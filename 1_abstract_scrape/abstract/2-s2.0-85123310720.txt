The contemporary research of this modern world aims at the storage of electrical energy. Nanotechnology plays an important role in offering nanoscale materials to energy resources and storage. This paper reviews some of the nanomaterials used in energy transformation and storage systems. Various nanomaterials, i.e., carbon nanotube, nanofibre, metal nanoparticle and nanocrystalline hybrids are briefed here which are used in a supercapacitor, solar cell, lithium-ion battery and hydrogen storage. CNT-based nanocomposites show higher capacity and durability compared to metal nanomaterials and hybrids. Materials like Lithium Tungstate, Silver, Poly (Trimethylene Carbonate) and Graphene which are used in Electrochromic Devices show transmittance of ~ 90% in different environments. Chromium Oxide which is treated as anode material in ECDs exhibits transmission of ~ 90%-95% in visible and IR spectra.
