In this work, a Co-ZIF material and the derived nanoporous cobalt-rich carbons by direct carbonization of this Co-ZIF material were synthesized and used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. This ZIF material exhibited a high specific capacitance of 160.3 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 , an excellent rate capability (73.72 F g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), and a good cycling stability with 100% of its initials specific capacitance after 8000 cycles. In addition, the obtained derived nanoporous carbons displayed ideal capacitor behaviors and were promising electroactive materials for supercapacitors at low current density. The nanoporous carbon obtained at 650 °C possessed a highest specific capacitance of 393 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 and a wide potential application range of −1.0–0.33 V. In addition, a symmetric supercapacitor device consisting of Z-C-650 and activated carbon exhibited a maximum energy density of 61.23 Wh Kg −1 at a power density of 700 W kg −1 and predicted that Z-C-650 could be used as a potential energy storage material.
