Sustainable nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) -based composites as advanced functional materials have attracted considerable attention for using in soft wearable electronic devices. In this work, a controllable one-pot method to fabricate NFC/g-C3N4 composite film with different content of graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) via vacuum-induced self-assembly (VISA) process has been presented. The composite film was constructed by electrostatic interaction/hydrogen bonding between NFC and g-C3N4 coupled with vacuum-assisted filtration. The results demonstrated that the obtained NFC/g-C3N4 composite film exhibited better specific capacitance. The high specific capacitance of 51 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 and 46 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 are achieved. The study provides a straightforward method of fabricating freestanding film as supercapacitor electrode, which have the potential in soft wearable electronic devices.
