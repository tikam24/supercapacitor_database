While Electrical Double-Layer Capacitors (EDLC's) have been proven to achieve round-trip efficiencies of over 95%, electrical efficiencies of Capacitive Deionization (CDI) systems are still far from those values. Since this issue seems to be crucial for CDI to commercially compete with other water treatment processes including Reverse Osmosis (RO) it is essential that these efficiencies be improved. In this work, the electrical response of a commercial EDLC's and a CDI system are compared. Results of asymmetric constant current experiments reveal that the main electrical inefficiency occurs during the discharge stage (i.e. in CDI this refers as salt desorption or electrode's regeneration). Here, we propose an operational mode of CDI focused on improving performance of regeneration by simply conducting this stage in a more concentrated solution (3.5M NaC) brine water. The experimental findings suggest that this operational strategy led to 1) an increase from ≈40% to 75% in the round-trip efficiency of CDI, approaching (although admittedly not reaching) those of EDLC's; 2) a drop in ohmic resistance in the discharge cycle of 92% (from 19.77 Ω to 1.45 Ω) consequently increasing the amount of energy that could be potentially recovered from 0.24 J to 0.50 J, and thus, reducing significantly the energy consumption of the process; 3) a wider range of deionization/regeneration current density ratios (0.1–1.25) in which high efficiency values (65–75%) are still maintained. In general, we find that this operational mode might have practical relevance as it implies that CDI systems may be operated with a higher degree of flexibility allowing them to be coupled more readily with renewable energy technologies. Furthermore, the use of a highly concentrated electrolyte (i.e. not deionized water) during regeneration offers an innovative solution for brine concentration.
