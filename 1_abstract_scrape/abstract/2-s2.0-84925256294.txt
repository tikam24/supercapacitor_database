In order to evaluate the effect of temperature on the performance of supercapacitor using coconut shell activated carbon (AC)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as nano-composite electrodes, the supercapacitor's properties were tested in 4mol L-1 KOH solution at 35°C∼60°C. The results indicated, when temperature increased from 35°C to 60°C, the resistance decreased from 0.83Ω to 0.78Ω by 6% and the capacitance increased from 93.32F g-1 to 104.36F g-1 by 11.8%. It was the contribution of high conductivity and the end open ration of CNTs. These results indicated that CNTs-based nano-composite electrode had good performance at high moderate temperature, and would be a promising material for use in low-cost electrical energy storage device.
