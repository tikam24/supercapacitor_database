Nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-OMC) was synthesized through evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) technique by using pyrrole and carbamide as N sources. The obtained N-OMC has high-ordered 2D-hexagonal mesostructures with uniform pore size and high specific surface area. When pyrrole and carbamide were simultaneously employed as N sources, the sample shows higher subtotal percentage of pyridinic and pyrrolic N, leading to better electrochemical performance. As-prepared N-OMC with dual N sources (N12-OMC-1) possesses an ultra-high specific capacitance of 310 F g−1 at the current density of 1.0 A g−1 and remains 245 F g−1 (nearly 80% of its capacitance at 1.0 A g−1) at 20 A g−1, achieving both high rate capability and high specific capacitance. N12-OMC-1 based symmetrical supercapacitor demonstrates the highest energy density of 17.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 225 W kg−1 and maintains 12.2 Wh kg−1 at a very high output power density of 13500 W kg−1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Moreover, the N12-OMC-1 based symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits an excellent long-term electrochemical stability with 96.2% capacitance retention and 97% coulombic efficiency after 5000 cycles. Outstanding performances of N12-OMC-1 make it a potential candidate for supercapacitor applications.
