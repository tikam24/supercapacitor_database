Currently Na-ion battery (NIB) technology is proving a popular area of investigation, in part due to the considerable interest in developing 'beyond lithium' battery technology to augment -or in certain situations replace- lithium ion batteries. Consequently, NIBs have begun to gain prominence -in part due to their flexibility and low cost. An examination of the ongoing work in this field reveals significant advances have been made, which provides impetus to explore and understand the topic in detail. Moreover, as NIBs are currently beginning to see commercialization, there is considerable interest in targeting future advances, including recent research into nascent Na-ion capacitors (NICs) which consist of a coupled supercapacitor- and battery-type electrode. The goal of this review will, therefore, be to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in NIB technology, as well as the development of future Na-based technological advances (including NICs). The most promising advances will be discussed, including remaining challenges and future developments. This will help highlight not only the potential benefits in terms of environmental impact, performance and cost, but also the flexibility and versatility of these systems -as well as future pathways for Na-based technological development.
