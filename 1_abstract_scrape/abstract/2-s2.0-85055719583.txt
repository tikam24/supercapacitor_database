With the rapid proliferation of cloud computing, the energy cost of datacenters and the impact of reactive power on the grid have become major concerns. This paper presents two energy management control schemes for distributed uninterruptible power supply (UPS) architectures utilizing lithium-ion ultracapacitors (LIC) for improved system efficiency and reactive power mitigation. One scheme is proposed for low-power servers with an internal dc bus, while another is proposed for medium-to-high-power server racks with an in-rack dc bus. The LIC and the dc bus interface with a bidirectional dc-dc converter, which allows the power supply unit to run in the optimal operating region for the improved system efficiency and power factor. The server-level UPS architecture is experimentally tested using a 200-kHz, bidirectional, multiphase dc-dc converter with hysteretic current-mode control, while achieving 33% reactive power mitigation. Based on the SciNet datacenter in Toronto, ON, Canada, a rack-level distributed UPS architecture is built in MATLAB, and system-level simulations indicate a 37% reduction in the reactive power.
