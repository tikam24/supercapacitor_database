The pure monoclinic Fe2(MoO4)3 nanoparticles are prepared by a hydrothermal approach followed with calcination at 500 °C. The phase, structure and morphology of the obtained sample is characterized by several technologies. Notably, the supercapacitor behavior of the as-prepared Fe2(MoO4)3 is firstly investigated. The cyclic voltammetry data at different scan ratios reveal that the electrochemically reaction is dominated by the Faradaic redox reaction. A stable capacity with about 430F g−1 is achieved at 1.0 A cm−2 after 3000 cycles, demonstrating a possible application in supercapacitors.
