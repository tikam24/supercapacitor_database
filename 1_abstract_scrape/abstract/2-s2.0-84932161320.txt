Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is prepared by thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide in air. Symmetric RGO/RGO supercapacitors are constructed in a non-aqueous electrolyte and characterized. The values of energy density are 44 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> and 15 Wh kg-1, respectively at 0.15 and 8.0 kW kg<sup>-1</sup>. The symmetric supercapacitor exhibits stable charge/discharge cycling tested up to 3000 cycles. The low-temperature thermal exfoliation approach is convenient for mass production of RGO at low cost and it can be used as electrode material for energy storage applications.
