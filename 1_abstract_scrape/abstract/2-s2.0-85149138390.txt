The agglomeration of graphene sheets and undesired pore size distribution usually lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical properties of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) film electrodes. Herein, crumpled exfoliated graphene (EG) sheets are adopted as the microstructure-regulating agent to tune the morphology and micro-/mesopore amounts with the aim of increasing active surface sites and ion transportation paths in electrodes. With the optimum ratio between EG and GO, the resulting 75%-EG/RGO shows significantly improved specific gravimetric capacitance (Cs) and rate capability when compared with pure RGO electrodes in a symmetrical supercapacitor system. Moreover, when coupling the 75%-EG/RGO cathode with a Zn anode to form a Zn ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHS), the 75%-EG/RGO exhibits a much higher Cs of 327.39 F g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 and can maintain 91.7% capacitance after 8000 cycles. Systematic ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements reveal that the charge storage mechanism is based on both reversible physical adsorption and dual ion uptake. Furthermore, the quasi-solid-state flexible ZHS also presents high capacitive performance and can maintain âˆ¼100% capacitance under various bending states, demonstrating potential application in wearable electronics. This strategy opens up a new path for constructing high-performance graphene film electrodes.
