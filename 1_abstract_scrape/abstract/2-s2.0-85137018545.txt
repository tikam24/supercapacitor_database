Herein, a green and novel FeCl3-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment method is adopted to convert the bamboo shavings waste into bamboo-based hierarchical porous carbons (BHPCs) with ultra-high specific surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. Utilizing this mild FeCl3 catalyst can not only promote the dehydration, condensation, and carbonization of bamboo shavings to catalyze the formation of hydrochar, but also facilitate the development of the pore structure of hydrochar. Moreover, the effects of different FeCl3 solution concentrations, activation temperatures, and KOH/hydrochar ratios on the pore structure of BHPCs and the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors are thoroughly investigated. Compared with the hydrothermal carbonization without FeCl3 addition, the BHPCs (1-BHPC-800-5) electrode materials obtained by FeCl3-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment have superior specific surface area (up to 3688 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (as high as 1.989 cm3 g−1). Meanwhile, the best-performing 1-BHPC-800-5 demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance in supercapacitor applications, providing a pleasant capacitance of 378 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and capacitance retention of 96.6% after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles at 5.0 A g−1 in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. The energy density can reach 10.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1 in a two-electrode system. Therefore, this novel and efficient catalytic hydrothermal pretreatment method offers a promising prospect for converting waste biomass into hierarchical porous carbon materials with a large specific surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. Key Points: Adopting a green FeCl3-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment method to convert bamboo shavings waste into BHPCs. BHPCs exhibit a hierarchical porous structure and an ultra-high specific surface area (up to 3688 m2 g−1). A very high capacitive performance (378 F g−1 at 0.5 Ag−1) is achieved. The excellent rate performance (nearly 71% capacitance retention), outstanding cycle stability (capacitance retention of 96.6% after 10 000 charge/discharge cycles) and large energy density (10.3 Wh kg−1 at 250 W kg−1) are demonstrated.
