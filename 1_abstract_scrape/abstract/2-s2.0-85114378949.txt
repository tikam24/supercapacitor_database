The proceedings contain 5 papers. The topics discussed include: floating of PPY derived carbon based symmetric supercapacitor in alkaline electrolyte; supercapacitors using binder-free & surfactant-free CNT electrodes; capacitance enhancement of activated carbon through mechanical activation for Li-ion capacitors; electrochemical processing of commercial carbon cloth for supercapacitor applications; and resolving the effects of surface area and porosity on the capacitance of activated carbon.
