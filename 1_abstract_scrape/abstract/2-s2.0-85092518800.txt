The multifunctional 3D Ni3Se2 nano-architectures were successfully synthesized by a facile solvothermal route, and their electrochemical performances were systematically investigated. As electrode for supercapacitor, 3D Ni3Se2 nano-architectures exhibited a high specific capacity of 1545.6 μAh cm−2, good rate capability and excellent cycling stability. Besides, as the electrodes for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, 3D Ni3Se2 nano-architectures demonstrated electrochemical activity and stability towards water splitting. Moreover, the electrocatalytic behaviors of the nanostructures were also investigated at various temperatures. Remarkably, as an electrolyzer for overall water splitting, 3D Ni3Se2 nano-architectures showed low cell voltages of 1.61 V for anode and −1.75 V for cathode at 10 mA cm−2 and stability for 10 h. The work presented here sheds some light on the development of low-cost and high-activity multifunctional electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage and conversion.
