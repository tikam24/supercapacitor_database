Two dimensional (2-D) nanoblades can expose numerous active sites, valence states and enable shortened diffusion paths upon layering. Herein, layered nanoblades of iron cobaltite (FeCo 2 O 4 ) are prepared and aligned in a criss-cross manner to express their electrochemical merits. Sharp edges of the nanoblades contribute through more chemically reactive sites, while, b–value of 0.7 suggests faradaic capacitive (pseudocapacitive) charge storage. Typically 960.0 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 with excellent cycling stability (94% for 10,000 cycles) demonstrates brilliant performance in supercapacitor cell. On assembling iron cobaltite (FeCo 2 O 4 ) nanoblades with graphene nanoribbons (negative electrode) in an asymmetric supercapacitor it pays off with a superb energy density of 34.5 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 6391.7 W kg −1 retaining 116.5% for 5000 cycles.
