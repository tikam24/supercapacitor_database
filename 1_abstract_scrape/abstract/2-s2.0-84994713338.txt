We have developed material and architectural alternatives for flexible supercapacitors and investigated their effect on practical performance. The substrate alternatives include paperboard as well as various polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films and laminates, with aqueous NaCl electrolyte used in all devices. In all the supercapacitors, activated carbon is used as the active layer and graphite ink as the current collector, with various aluminium or copper structures applied to enhance the current collectors’ conductivity. The capacitance of the supercapacitors was between 0.05 F and 0.58 F and their equivalent series resistance (ESR) was from <1 Ω to 14 Ω, depending mainly on the current collector structure. Furthermore, leakage current and selfdischarge rates were defined and compared for the various architectures. The barrier properties of the supercapacitor encapsulation have a clear correlation with leakage current, as was clearly shown by the lower leakage in devices with an aluminium barrier layer. A cycle life test showed that after 40000 charge-discharge cycles the capacitance decreases by less than 10%. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
