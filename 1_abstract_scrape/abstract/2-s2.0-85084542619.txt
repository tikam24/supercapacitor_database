Adaptive wavelet analysis strategy is proposed for energy management in this paper. With the help of wavelet analysis, the power demand is decoupled to high frequency and low frequency components by the wavelet decomposition, which are respectively undertaken by ultracapacitors and power lithium ion batteries. According to the power demand and the state of charge of the ultracapacitors, the fuzzy control is used to adjust the wavelet decomposition layer in real time, so that the ultracapacitors have greater absorption redundancy and release energy redundancy. For verifying the effectiveness of proposed method, we conducted the control strategy simulation experiment through Matlab/Simulink Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule. The results show that the adaptive wavelet analysis can decompose the demand power in real time, and the strategy can keep the state of charge of ultracapacitors being in the range of 0.5 to 0.9. In addition, compared with the conversional method of wavelet decomposition, the proposed method reduces the energy loss by 10.66% at least.
