The production of activated carbon using biochar exclusively for energy and environmental applications is attracting attention. In this review, an outline of the recent trends towards biomass-derived inclusive specific lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose-derived electrodes is explained in a holistic manner. Distinctive lab-scale approaches for manufacturing biochar, including carbonisation, and the role of activation agents and conditions are also considered. In particular, various modification procedures and their influence on the electrochemical performance of super capacitor-based applications are described, as well as its suitability towards multiple environment applications. Feedstock with diverse compositions, carbonisation and activation procedures have considerable domination on the properties of produced biochar. Activated biochar is pristine, environment friendly and cost-effective with advanced potential in many fields. Furthermore, a wide range of available renewable precursors and investigations on adaptability and sustainability are briefly discussed in the present manuscript.
