Carbon nanotube (CNT)-based electrodes in flexible supercapacitors have received significant attention in recent years. Carbon nanotube fiber fabrics (CNT-FF) have emerged as promising materials due to their high surface area, excellent conductivity, and mechanical strength. Researchers have attempted to improve the energy density and rate performance of CNT-FF supercapacitor electrodes through various strategies, such as functionalization with conductive materials like MnO2 nanoparticles and/or incorporation of graphene into them. In addition, the utilization of CNTs in combination with thin metal film electrodes has also gained widespread attention. Research has focused on enhancing electrochemical performance through functionalizing CNTs with conductive materials such as graphene and metal nanoparticles, or by controlling their morphology. This review paper will discuss the recent developments in supercapacitor technology utilizing carbon nanotube-based electrodes, including CNT fiber fabrics and CNTs on thin metal film electrodes. Various strategies employed for improving energy storage performance and the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies will be discussed. Finally, the paper will conclude with a discussion on the challenges that need to be addressed in order to realize the full potential of carbon nanotube-based electrodes in supercapacitor technology.
