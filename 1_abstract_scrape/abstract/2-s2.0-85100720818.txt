A simple and facile hydrothermal method has been used for synthesis of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). The structural and morphological properties of as-prepared MoS2 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques respectively. The XRD results indicate that the as-prepared MoS2 material shows polycrystalline nature. The optical properties of MoS2 were investigated by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopic technique. The UV-Vis absorption spectra show absorption of light in visible region. The supercapacitor behavior of MoS2 was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). These results indicate that MoS2 is promising material for supercapacitor application.
