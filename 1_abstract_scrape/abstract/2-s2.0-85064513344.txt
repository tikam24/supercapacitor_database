CuCo 2 S 4 is regarded as a promising electrode material for supercapacitor, but has inferior conductivity and poor cyclic stability which restrict its wide-range applications. In this work, hierarchically hybrid composite of CuCo 2 S 4 /carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was synthesized using a facile hydrothermal and sulfuration process. The embedded CNTs in the CuCo 2 S 4 matrix provided numerous effective paths for electron transfer and ion diffusion, and thus promoted the faradaic reactions of the CuCo 2 S 4 electrode in the energy storage processes. The CuCo 2 S 4 /CNTs-3.2% electrode exhibited a significantly increased specific capacitance of 557.5 F g −1 compared with those of the pristine CuCo 2 S 4 electrode (373.4 F g −1 ) and CuO/Co 3 O 4 /CNTs-3.2% electrode (356.5 F g −1 ) at a current density of 1 A g −1 . An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled using the CuCo 2 S 4 /CNTs-3.2% as the positive electrode and the active carbon as the negative electrode, which exhibited an energy density of 23.2 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 402.7 W kg −1 . Moreover, the residual specific capacitance of this ASC device retained 85.7% of its original value after tested for 10,000 cycles, indicating its excellent cycle stability.
