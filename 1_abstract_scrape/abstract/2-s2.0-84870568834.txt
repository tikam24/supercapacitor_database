Business costs and energy/environmental concerns have increased interested in biomass materials for production of activated carbons, especially as electrode materials for supercapacitors or as solid-state adsorbents in CO 2 adsorption area. In this paper, waste celtuce leaves were used to prepare porous carbon by air-drying, pyrolysis at 600 °C in argon, followed by KOH activation. The as-prepared porous carbon have a very high specific surface area of 3404 m2/g and a large pore volume of 1.88 cm 3/g. As an electroactive material, the porous carbon exhibits good capacitive performance in KOH aqueous electrolyte, with the specific capacitances of 421 and 273 F/g in three and two-electrode systems, respectively. As a solid-state adsorbent, the porous carbon has an excellent CO2 adsorption capacity at ambient pressures of up to 6.04 and 4.36 mmol/g at 0 and 25 °C, respectively. With simple production process, excellent recyclability and regeneration stability, the porous carbon that was derived from celtuce leaves is among the most promising materials for high-performance supercapacitors and CO2 capture. © 2012 American Chemical Society.
