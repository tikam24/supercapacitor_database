CAP-XX supercapacitors are double-layered capacitors with the ability to store more energy that a traditional capacitor that can be used in conjunction with a small solar cell to power a wireless sensor node. These store charge on nanoporous carbon electrodes on aluminum foil, arranged in multiple layers, and connected in parallel to minimize the resistance and maximize the capacitance of the device. A capacitor placed at the input of a buck-boost regulator to allow a wider voltage window, with a maximum voltage of 5 V and minimum voltage of 2.5 V, allows input peak power of approximately 7 W/85% efficiency. The supercapacitor's high energy storage and high power delivery allow it to buffer a high-power load from a low-power energy-harvesting source.
