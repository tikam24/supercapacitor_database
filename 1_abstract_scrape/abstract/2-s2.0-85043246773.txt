This paper describes an energy management strategy for an electric vehicle (EV). The proposed EV architecture contains a pack of the batteries which presents the energy source and a pack of the supercapacitors (SC) used as power source. The pack of the batteries produces the necessary energy to move forward the vehicle while the pack of the SC produces the lacking power in acceleration and in braking phases. Two DC-DC converters are used to interface the energy sources with the DC-bus. A bidirectional DC-AC converter is used to connect the traction motor to the DC-bus. The proposed control method is focused on the power flow management within the EV depending on electrical behavior of the energy sources. The validity of the proposed control strategy is proofed through some reduced scale simulations tests using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).
