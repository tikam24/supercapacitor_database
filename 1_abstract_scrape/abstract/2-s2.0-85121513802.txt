The copper oxide (CuO) nanostructures are synthesized by various simple and cost-effective chemical methods. The morphology of metal oxide nanostructures depends on the synthetic strategy. The electrochemical behavior primarily depends on the morphology of the electrode. The significant impact of synthetic strategy on the structural, morphological, and subsequently on the supercapacitive performance of CuO nanostructures is studied. The chemical bath deposition (CBD) leads to well defined growth of 1D nanostructures, while the intermittent growth process (successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, SILAR) leads to nanoparticulate morphology. CBD grown CuO nanorods have shown comparatively higher capacitance (207 F g−1) than CuO nanoparticles (147 F g−1) at current density of 2 A g−1.
