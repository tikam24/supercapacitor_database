The 2D transitional metal carbides/nitrides (MXenes) manifest great application prospects in the domain of Supercapacitors (SCs). MXene, because of outstanding physiochemical merits, superior volumetric capacitance, metallic-like conductivity, multilayered structures, adjustable surface terminations, redox reaction active surfaces and structural advantages facilitate energy storage. This review demonstrates how MXene is synthesized and different factors that play crucial role in energy storing capability. In the light of reported literature, different methods to enhance capacitance, Energy density (ED) and voltage window of device are elaborated. It focuses on the strategy of composite formation, good selection of electrolyte leading to enhanced capacitance performance of Ti3C2Tx and performance of distinct MXene-based composite. Electrochemical performance of MXene-based composites has shown far more enhanced results as compared to the precursors due to synergistic effect. Finally, a comprehensive view is provided based on the current development and opportunities in order to mention the growing popularity of 3D MXenes in SCs. This review can furnish a road map for scientists to tailor electrochemical features of MXene-based composite for latest generation of energy storage devices.
