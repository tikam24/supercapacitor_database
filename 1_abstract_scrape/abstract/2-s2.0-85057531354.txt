Hierarchical three-dimensional (3D) porous structures of nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (LDH) are grown on diatomite biotemplate via one-step hydrothermal method. The crystal morphologies and properties of the materials can be controlled by adjusting the ratios of Ni-Co ions concentration during the reaction process. Increasing the proportion of nickel causes the morphology of the Ni-Co LDHs to change from nanowires to nanosheets, and improves the electrochemical performance of Ni-Co LDH@diatomite. The Ni3Co1 LDH@diatomite composites exhibit an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 514 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 and have 94.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycling tests at a current density of 2 A g-1. Interestingly, the assembled Ni-Co LDH@diatomite@nickel foam//AG asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) achieves a maximum energy density of 56 Wh kg-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.
