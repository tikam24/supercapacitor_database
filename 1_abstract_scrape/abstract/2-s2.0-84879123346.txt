The structure and capacitive properties of microtube bundle carbons (MTBCs) from carbonization of paulownia sawdust (PS) followed by NaOH activation were investigated. Morphology analyses indicated that MTBCs had abundant micropores and mesopores with a high specific surface area of about 1900 m2 g-1. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies demonstrated the excellent charge storage, transfer capability, and low impedance of MTBCs. The specific capacitance of MTBCs-4 was as high as 227 F g-1 at 2 mV s -1. Experimental results indicated that MTBCs provide smooth charge-transfer pathways for the ions in electrolytes and gateways to micropores and mesopores in the bulk. The hybrid supercapacitor model of MTBCs based on electrical double-layer capacitors and electrostatic capacitors was discussed and demonstrated. MTBCs are electrostatic capacitors at low frequency current, and may provide the pathways for easy accessibility of efficient charge transmission and high energy storage.
