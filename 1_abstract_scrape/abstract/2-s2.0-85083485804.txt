A Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell is a device in which an electrochemical reaction occurs between fuel and oxidant producing electricity and water is the only by-product with zero emission. Usually, Pt nanoparticles prepared on carbon support used as oxidation and reduction reaction in PEM fuel cells. Because, carbon-supported platinum shows better oxidation and reduction activity among all the pure metals. Alloying of Pt with another non-noble metal is a strategy to develop Pt-based electrocatalysts, which reduces the Pt loading in electrodes and alters the intrinsic properties such as active sites available on surface and binding strength and electronic effect of species. Carbon support loss its catalytic activity due to electrooxidation under fuel cell operating conditions for long-term operations. In particular, the encapsulation of carbon with polyaniline (PANI) supported Pt enhances the electrode stability in fuel cells by Enhancing the Active Surface Area (EASA), chemical resistance and electron conductivity. Different supported catalysts have been proposed to improve electrochemical stability of nanoparticles in PEM fuel cells and supercapacitor.
