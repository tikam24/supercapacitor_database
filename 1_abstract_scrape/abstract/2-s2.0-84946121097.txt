A recuperation system based on 48V components IS a promlsmg low-cost solution for hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) to reduce C02 emissions. A power net configuration mcludmg a 48V recuperation system con tams two energy storages, 12V storage and 48V recuperatIOn storage respectively. This paper investigates the insertion of a 12V tap to the 48V storage. Thereby, the fadure safety IS mcreased and a component downsizing is possible. Supercapacitors and lithium-ion cells are considered as storage technology for recuperation storage. First, load behavior of 12V and 48V level is determined. Then several options to connect the 12V tap to the 12V power net are investigated regarding the interaction of both vol!age levels. Due to supercapacitor voltage characteristics, a dual-voltage supercapacitor storage is only possible to a limited extend. Lithium-ion batteries appear clearly more suitable.
