The paper considers ways to increase the efficiency of electrochemical supercapacitors by using electrodes of porous semiconductors as electrodes. The technique of manufacturing porous layer on the surface of indium phosphide is presented. The basic regularities of the formation of porous spaces and the dependence of morphological properties on the patterns of etching are established. In order to provide the chemical inertia of the nanostructured surface, it is proposed to cover it with a layer of graphite. This increases the resistance of the resulting structures and becomes the basis for their use as electrodes of supercapacitors.
