This paper explores the impact of ultracapacitor (UC) modelling on fast frequency response performance. The dynamic model of the UC bank is based on the nonlinear dynamic model of the UC cell which takes into account the dependence of the UC parameters on the applied DC voltage. The complete system is modelled and tested on IEEE 39-bus system in DIgSILENT PowerFactory for overfrequency and underfrequency events. The performance of the realistic UC model is compared against an ideal ultracapacitor model to show that the ideal representation is not always appropriate, although for most cases the ideal model will suffice.
