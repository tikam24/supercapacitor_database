Multiple transition metal sulfides (TMSs) have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) due to their advantages such as high capacitance and good stability. However, improving the electrochemical performance of TMSs remains an urgent priority. In this work, the quaternary TMS of Cu2MnSnS4 (CMTS) with a unique irregular rice-like 2D nano-condensed structure is synthesized via a cost-effective and facile one-step solvothermal method. Benefiting from the rice-like nanostructure and synergistic effects between Cu, Mn, Sn and S, CMTS reveals a high specific capacitance of 1117.7 F g−1 at 0.8 A g−1, and maintains outstanding cycling stability of 82.3% over 10,000 cycles at 10 A g−1. These exceptional electrochemical properties demonstrate the excellent Faraday reaction and charge storage performance of CMTS, which thus represents a promising electrode material in SCs. This work not only offers an effective strategy for the preparation of common electrode materials, but also provides insights into the design of high-performance energy storage devices.
