A three-dimensional mesoporous carbon/nickel foam hybrid material has been prepared using an insitu solution growth approach, and its energy storage as a binder-free supercapacitor electrode is explored. The nickel foam is chosen as an electrically conducting scaffold and also as a porous substrate for the growth of poly(benzoxazine-co-resol). After carbonization, tightly packed carbon layers are uniformly coated on the skeleton of the nickel foam. Such carbons show hierarchical porosity (micro-, meso-, macroporosity), a high surface area of 811m2g-1, and graphitic domains. These features allow easy access, rapid diffusion, and a high loading of ions, producing a material in which ion diffusion is faster than in bulk carbon and which is highly efficient in producing an increased double-layer capacitance. The obtained electrodes exhibit an excellent capacitive behavior in KOH solutions, that is, low contact resistance, high specific capacitance (192Fg-1), and good rate performance. Furthermore, the three-dimensional porous substrates facilitate a high mass loading of active materials, up to 21mgcm-2, and per-area capacitance of 1.18Fcm-2. This synthesis strategy is scalable and potentially usable for large-scale production.
