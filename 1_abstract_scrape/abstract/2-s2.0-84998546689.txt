Titanium carbide derived carbon (TiC-CDC) was prepared by the molten salt electrolytic method in molten salt NaCl–KCl at the potential of 1.3 V using TiC pellets as the anode. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectrum were used to characterize the composition, morphology and microstructure of TiC-CDC. The electrochemical performance of TiC-CDC for supercapacitor was investigated in 0.5 mol L−1 Na2SO4 by cycle voltammograms, ac impedance spectrum and galvanostatic charge/discharge. TiC-CDC showed excellent electrochemical and capacitive performances and maintained a capacity value of 126.1 F g−1 after 1000 cycles with a capacity retention rate of 97% at the current density of 3 A g−1. The current work demonstrated the feasibility of molten salt electrolytic method for preparation of TiC-CDC and provided a non-polluting and environmentally friendly strategy for high performance supercapacitor fabrication.
