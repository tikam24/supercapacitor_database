Molybdenum nitride was developed through thermal nitridation of electrodeposited molybdenum oxide and was evaluated as electrode materials for electrochemical capacitors. Nitrided molybdenum electrode showed significantly enhanced capacitance and improved chemical stability comparing to the as-deposited molybdenum oxide electrode. The added capacitance was attributed from the reversible pseudocapacitance of molybdenum nitride. The study demonstrated an economical alternative process to produce molybdenum nitride electrodes with area specific capacitance comparable to those deposited by CVD. Â©The Electrochemical Society.
