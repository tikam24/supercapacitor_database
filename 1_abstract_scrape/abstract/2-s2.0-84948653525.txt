Porous Mn3O4 with micro/nano-structure were fabricated by a modified solvothermal approach using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant and CH3CH2OH/H2O as a co-solvent, in which H2O derives from the source material crystalline hydrate Mn(CH3COO)2.4H2O. It is found that a number of micelles form synchronously surrounding the crystalline hydrate with the addition of Mn(CH3COO)2.4H2O. The Mn3O4 prepared presents a micro/nano-structure self-assembled by two-dimensional lamella structure with a thickness of approximately 100 nm, and a mesoporous with a specific surface area of 138.5 m2 g-1 and a total pore volume of 0.273 cm3 g-1. The electrochemical performance of the porous Mn3O4 used as a supercapacitor electrode exhibits a relatively high specific capacitance value of 302 F g-1 at a low current density of 0.5 A g-1, and a good high-rate dischargeability (246 F g-1, 81% capacity retention when the current densities are increased by 10 times (5 A g-1)), as well as good cycling stability (89% retention after 5000th charge/discharge cycles at 5 A g-1).
