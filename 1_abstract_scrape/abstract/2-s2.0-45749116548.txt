work uses the Wagner Factor as a qualitative means of explaining the effects that perturbing the oxygen content in Lai-xSr xMnO3±δ (LSM) cathodes has on their O 2 redox activity and as well as the emergence of pseudo-capacitive characteristics under low pO2 atmospheres. The Wagner Factor correlates the rate constant of the O2 redox reaction in mixed conducting perovskites (kchem, Dchem) to changes in the oxide's oxygen concentration. The emergence of an oxygen under-stoichiometric (3-8) state under low O2 partial pressures and/or at high cathodic overpotentials is believed to lead to the observed electrochemical capacitive behavior. copyright The Electrochemical Society.
