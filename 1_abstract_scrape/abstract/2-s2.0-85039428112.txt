The high electrical conductivity and high specific surface area of graphene are traditionally regarded as the most intriguing features for its promise as the electrode material for supercapacitors. In this perspective, we highlight that from the engineering point of view, the unique colloidal chemistry of chemically functionalized graphene is the key property that has made graphene stand out as a promising nanoscale building block for constructing unique nanoporous electrodes for capacitive energy storage. We present several examples to demonstrate how the non-covalent colloidal forces between graphene sheets can be harnessed to engineer the nanostructure of graphene-based bulk electrodes for supercapacitors based on both the electrical double layer storage and the redox reaction or pseudo-capacitance mechanisms. The colloidal engineering strategy can be extended to enable other nanomaterials to achieve high energy storage performance.
