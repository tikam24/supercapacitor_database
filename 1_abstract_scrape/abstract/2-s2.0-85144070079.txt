Progress towards extra stable Zn ion power supply systems is important for developing integrated electronics. However, deep-seated issues of severe Zn dendrite growth radically impede the rechargeability and utilization of Zn ion storage devices in these electronics. Herein, a tough zwitterionic osmolyte-based hydrogel electrolyte (denoted as SPS-Zn) with multiple network interactions was developed in this work to effectively modulate the Zn deposition behavior and suppress the dendrite growth. Through this approach, the original sodium alginate/polyacrylamide (denoted as SP) polymeric network can be optimized and it eventually enables strong mechanical strength (high tensile strength of 61.8 kPa at 310.2%), high ionic conductivity (2.50 S mâˆ’1), large Zn2+ transference number (tZn2+ = 0.64), and low activation energy for Zn2+ ion desolvation. Additionally, the theoretical calculations further proved that the zwitterionic osmolytes promote the migration of solvated Zn2+ ions via the formation of ion-migration channels, possess a strong affinity to metallic Zn for increasing nucleation sites, and restrict the 2D diffusion of Zn2+ ions. Meanwhile, experimental results and the finite element simulation revealed that SPS-Zn can homogenize the electric field distribution and Zn2+ flux. Consequently, the asymmetry and symmetric batteries with SPS-Zn display enhanced cycling life and reversibility. The as-assembled zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) exhibits satisfactory capacity and long-term stability. A portable integrated device with the ionic skin (denoted as i-skin) and ZHSC was also assembled and it could steadily detect physiological signals. This work provides new insight into the design of functional hydrogels for highly stable ZHSCs and integrated i-skins.
