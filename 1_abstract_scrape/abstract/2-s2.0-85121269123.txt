Porous biochar materials are becoming the research focus referring to high-performance supercapacitors because of their green, efficient and sustainable characteristics. Herein, we designed a novel composite material based on porous biochar (PB) skeleton with Ni-Co layered double hydroxide. Specifically, the PB was obtained from pinus tabulaeformis pollen (PTPB), providing a good microstructure for electron transport and ion transmission to achieve high conductivity. The Ni-Co LDH can provide abundant active sites due to the strong OH- adsorption and deprotonation energy, which can get effective enhancement of capacity performance. The as-obtained PTPB@Ni-Co LDH electrode presents 1932 F g−1 (268 mAh g−1) at 1.0 A g−1, on account of the synergistic effect, and with the current density reach to 20 A g−1 the electrode keeps 1249 F g−1. Simultaneously, with 6000 cycles at 10 A g−1 being finished, the capacitance retention rate was up to 89.53%. In addition, the PTPB//PTPB@Ni-Co LDH based energy storage device reflects 63.54 Wh kg−1 at 800 W kg−1. In short, our proposed PTPB@Ni-Co LDH can provide a simple and practicable solution to manufacture new high-performance carbon-based supercapacitors, and put forward a novel perspective to improve the cycling performance of LDH.
