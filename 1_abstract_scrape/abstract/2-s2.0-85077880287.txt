Herein, a new electrode material HHK-CC@Ti3C2TX (HHK-CC = activated carbon cloth, TX = F, O, or OH) for a flexible solid-state supercapacitor (SSC) is prepared by a simple method. The activated carbon cloth (HHK-CC) is obtained by treating with potassium permanganate beforehand. The specific area, oxygen-containing functional group, hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity of the activated CC are increased significantly after the potassium permanganate treatment. A few layers of Ti3C2TX flakes are coated directly on the HHK-CC. When the loading Ti3C2TX on the HHK-CC@Ti3C2TX electrode is 3 mg cm−2, the prepared electrode achieves a high capacitance of 1033 mF cm−2 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2. After assembling as a symmetrical SSC, the flexibility and mechanical strength of the CC are still preserved and no significant capacitance decreasing is observed under the conditions of bending and deformation. The capacitance value remains at 94.2% after 1000 cycles, and a high power density of 0.779 W cm−2 is obtained at the energy density of 4.5 μWh cm−2. This work gives a new strategy for designing flexible supercapacitors.
