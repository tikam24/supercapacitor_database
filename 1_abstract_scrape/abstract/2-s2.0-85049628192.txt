In order to determine the fault type of high voltage line accurately in a short time, a device based on high frequency injection method to judge the fault type is designed. The device consists of charging control module, super capacitor group, high frequency inverter module and intelligent control module. The specific work process is to produce high-frequency carrier through high-frequency inverter module for high frequency injection, and judge the fault type by the discharge status or discharge current of the super capacitor. Computer simulation and hardware verification are given to illustrate the simulation results. The results show that the type of interphase short-circuit fault can be determined.
