High-energy electrodes at high mass loadings (usually >8.0 mg cm−2) are desired for aqueous pseudocapacitors. Yet, how to overcome the thickness-dependent resistance increase of ion/electron transport in pseudocapacitive materials is still challenging. Herein, a high-performance electrode (denoted as AMC) adapted to high mass loading is achieved by promoting the Li-ion affinity of 3D MoO2/carbon fabric. The experimental results and corresponding computational results reveal that the oxygen-activated surface of AMC, combined with the wettability and conductivity superiority of 3D graphite network, significantly facilitates the Li-ion adsorption and diffusion at the electrode/electrolyte interface, even at large thicknesses. Consequently, even at a high mass loading up to 8.1 mg cm−2, the AMC electrode also displays an impressive specific capacity (567.5 C g−1 at 2.5 A g−1), substantially superior to most advanced pseudocapacitive electrodes. The strategy of boosting energy characteristic by enhancing the affinity of charge carriers is applicable to other pseudocapacitive electrodes.
