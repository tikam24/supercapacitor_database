Manganese fluoride and manganese carbonate grown on nickel foam were successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal method using the same raw materials and their electrochemical performances were compared. Manganese fluoride grown on nickel foam gained with double NH4F at 80 °C displays a specific capacitance of 411.25 F g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and retains 65.85% of the initial capacitance (164 F g−1) at 2 A g−1 after 5000 cycles. While manganese carbonate grown on nickel foam obtained with regular NH4F at 160 °C exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 533 F g−1 at 200 mA g−1 and that of 228 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 with a capacitance retention of 59.65% after 5000 cycles.
