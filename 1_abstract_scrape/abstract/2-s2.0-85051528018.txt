In the present study, the simple facile chemical approaches have been used to grow one dimensional (1D) titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotubes and three dimensional (3D) microflowers over 1D (3D–1D) TiO2 hierarchical for supercapacitor. Here, 1D TiO2 nanotubes are synthesized by electrochemical anodization and 3D–1D TiO2 microflowers have been successfully synthesized by hydrothermally grown 3D microflowers on predeposited 1D TiO2 nanotubes. Furthermore, TiO2 films have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry, contact angle measurements and electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance (Cs) values of 1D TiO2 and 3D–1D TiO2 have been calculated by cyclic voltammetry and charge discharge measurements. The improvement in Cs for 3D–1D nanostructure has been observed around 66.50 Fg−1, which is greater than that of 1D nanostructure 54.09 Fg−1 at 5 mV S−1 scan rate. Stability study revealed ~ 67% capacitance retention for 1D TiO2 nanotubes and 76% capacitance retention for 3D–1D TiO2 microflowers after 2000 cycles. These results indicate that the growth of 3D–1D TiO2 microflowers showed better performance than 1D TiO2 nanotubes for supercapacitor application.
