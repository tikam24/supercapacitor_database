Novel pompon-like nickel-cobalt double hydroxide/graphene oxide (Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2/GO) composites were successfully synthesized via a simple one-step solvothermal process. Their structure, morphology, surface and electrochemical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM), X-ray diffraction(XRD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge(GCD) curves. The composite electrodes showed typical pseudocapacitance performances. When addition amount of graphene oxide was 10mg, resulted composite exhibited a high specific capacitance (2050.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 84% after 1000 cycles. Appropriate amount of graphene oxide not only served as a structural director but also enhanced the conductivity and stability of the resulted composite. The attractive performances and facile fabrication made the prepared Ni(OH)2/Co(OH)2/GO composite become a promising candidate for low-cost high-performance energy storage device.
