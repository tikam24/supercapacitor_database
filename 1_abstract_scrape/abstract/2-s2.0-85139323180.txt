In this work, a new, uninvestigated electrode material, Nickel Manganese Selenide (NiMnSe, NMS), is directly prepared on nickel foam, using nickel foam as a substrate and a nickel source. The material demonstrates a well distribution at nickel foam skeleton as extraordinary three-dimensional hierarchical graces-like morphology with a nanosheet structure, promoting a high surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. For the Li-ion battery, the NMS electrode demonstrates a capacity for the first discharge cycle of 1,040 mAh/g and 600 mAh/g for the subsequent discharge cycle at 100 mA/g. For supercapacitor application, the NMS electrode exhibits a specific capacity of 1,950 C/g at 0.5 A/g, with a remarkable coulombic efficiency and capacity retention even at the high current of 10 A/g. A hybrid two-electrode system with an NMS electrode used as a cathode and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3) as an anode is fabricated to introduce the novel electrode for practical application and reveals specific energy of 65.6 Wh/kg at a specific power of 632.7 W/kg. It retains specific energy of 18.2 Wh/kg at a specific power of 6,560 W/kg, making it a potential electrode for energy storage devices.
