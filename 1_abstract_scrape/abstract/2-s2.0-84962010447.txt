A novel bio-inspired hollow activated carbon microtubes (HACMs) was prepared from low-cost, renewable biomass willow catkins by low temperature pre-carbonization combined with KOH chemical activation and used as supercapacitor electrode materials. The as-prepared HACMs exhibit hollow fiber-like structure with thin wall thickness of less than 1 Î¼m, high microporosity surface area (997 m2 g-1) and concentrated pore size distribution (1-2 nm). The electrochemical measurement results demonstrate that the HACMs electrode materials have high gravimetric capacitance of 306 F g-1 superior to most of the previously reported activated carbons and outstanding volumetric capacitance of 303 F cm-3.
