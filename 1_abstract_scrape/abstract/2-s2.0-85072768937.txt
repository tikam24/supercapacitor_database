Highly porous three-dimensional carbon networks with large ion-accessible surface areas are critical for high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices, yet remain challenging to achieve via simple and scalable processes. By introducing ultrahigh heating rate into thermally driven reduction process and ensuring a high local temperature via thermal management, we propose the production of such materials through micro-explosive reduction process initiated by short heating pulses, for example using a camera flash. This simple and scalable method enables rapid gas generation and release process and creates sponge-like electrode materials with high ion-transportation quality. Electrochemical supercapacitors based on the fabricated electrodes demonstrate high energy density of around 60 Wh kgâˆ’1.
