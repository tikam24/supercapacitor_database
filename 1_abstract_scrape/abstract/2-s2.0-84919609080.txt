Because of the complex dynamic behavior of supercapacitor, its modeling must be based on parallel, distributed structures (each component has to represent a model of activity, distributed on many processing units), with learning capacity. For this purpose, the paper proposes a new feed forward artificial neural network structure with two hidden layers and with backpropagation training. The neural network provides, after activation, training, testing and reinitializing, output values with a total correlation of 0, 9426 compared with target values.
