In this research work, we report a facile one pot synthesis of Sn doped SrO (Sr1-xSnxO1-δ; where x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) based two dimensional nanoparticles. The physico-chemical properties of the prepared materials were characterized by XRD, EDAX, SEM and TEM. XRD confirmed that the prepared samples are cubic. The presence of appropriate atomic percentage of elements was predicted by EDAX. SEM and TEM data confirmed the presence of nanostructured grains in the samples. The electrochemical techniques such as, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to characterize the reproducible performance of the Sn doped SrO nanostructured electrode materials in 1 M of H2SO4 medium. Among the different samples studied, Sr0.6Sn0.4O1-δshowed a maximum specific capacitance of 56.49 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV. Hence, Sn doped SrO can be good electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
