In this paper, a supercapacitor electrode composed of copper sulphide (CuS) microspheres with nitrogen-doped graphene (GN) was successfully synthesized via a simple and convenient one-step hydrothermal method. The chemical composition and microstructure of GN/CuS are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron (XPS) as well as Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Moreover, when researched as electrode materials for supercapacitors, it is demonstrated that the GN/CuS composite electrodes exhibit excellent electrochemical properties, showing the specific capacitance of 379 F g-1 at current density of 1 A g-1, which due to their specific electrode architecture.
