In the present investigation, we have synthesized Ni3V2O8@GO composite by co-precipitation method and designed as a new anode material for supercapacitor applications. The phase formation and surface morphology of the Ni3V2O8 and Ni3V2O8@GO composite were confirmed by XRD and FE-SEM measurements, respectively. It was observed that the synthesized Ni3V2O8@GO composite was found to have a small stone-like particle morphology. The electrochemical behavior of Ni3V2O8@GO composite as an electrode material for supercapacitor application was examined by electrochemical techniques. The obtained results showed that the Ni3V2O8@GO composite electrode exhibits maximum specific capacitance value 547 Fg−1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 which was much superior than that of pure Ni3V2O8 (118 Fg−1). The improved electrochemical behavior of the Ni3V2O8@GO composite may be due to its well crystalline nature and also offers more active sites for Faradic reactions, good conductivity, and rapid diffusion of the electrolyte ions. Furthermore, the fabricated Ni3V2O8@GO composite electrode possessed an outstanding cyclic stability and nearly 95% of original specific capacitance value was sustained after 1500 charge-discharge cycles at 5 Ag−1. This indicates that shaped the spherical Ni3V2O8@GO composite possessed excellent electrochemical property that favors it as an auspicious electrode candidates for supercapacitor applications.
