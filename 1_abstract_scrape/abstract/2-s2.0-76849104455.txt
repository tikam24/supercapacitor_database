The decrease of energy consumption per 1 bit processing (ε) and power supply voltage (Vdd) of integrated circuits (ICs) are long-term tendencies in micro- and nanoelectronics. In this framework, deep-sub-voltage nanoelectronics (DSVN), i.e., ICs of ∼1011-1012 cm-2 component densities operating near the theoretical limit of ε, is sure to find application in the next 10 years. In nanoelectronics, the demand on high-capacity capacitors of micron sizes sharply increases with a decrease of technological norms, ε and Vdd. Creation of high-capacity capacitors of micron size to meet the challenge of DSVN and related technologies is considered. The necessity of developing all-solid-state impulse micron-sized supercapacitors on the basis of advanced superionic conductors (nanoionic supercapacitors) is discussed. Theoretical estimates and experimental data on prototype nanoionic supercapacitors with capacity density δC ≈ 100 μF/cm2 are presented. Future perspectives of nanoionic devices are briefly discussed. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.
