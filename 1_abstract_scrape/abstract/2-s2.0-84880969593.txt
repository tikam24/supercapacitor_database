3D SnO2 nanoflowers on Ti foil have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method without usingany surfactant or catalyst. The synthesized 3D SnO2 nanostructures are characterized by X-ray diffraction,field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The FESEM resultsshowed that the nanoflower consists of multiple nanopetals of width ∼5 nm and each SnO2 nanofloweris ∼3 μm in diameter. The time-dependent morphology evolution of SnO2 nanoflowers was studied indetail, and a possible growth mechanism was proposed. In addition, high dispersed Ni nanoparticles wasloaded on SnO2 nanoflowers applied in supercapacitor. The electrochemical properties of the 3D Ni/SnO2 nanoflowers were investigated by a series of electrochemical tests. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
