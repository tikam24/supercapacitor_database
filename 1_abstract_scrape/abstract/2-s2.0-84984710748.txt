In this paper, three dimensional reduced graphene oxide skeleton onto nickel foam (3D RGO NF) was fabricated by a facile dip-coating method combined with alkaline reduction. The as-prepared skeleton was used as a substrate to immobilize Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) with special morphology of nanowires to effectively prevent the agglomeration of material. The Ni-Co LDH/3D RGO NF electrode exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 1054 F g−1 compared with Ni-Co LDH/NF, excellent rate capability (60% capacitance retention with a ten-fold increase in current density) as well as long cyclic life (95% capacity retention after 2000 cycles). In addition, an aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor was composed of Ni-Co LDH/3D RGO NF as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode, which exhibited a specific capacitance of 108.7 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 in a potential range from 0 to 1.6 V; it showed maximum energy density of 38.6 Wh kg−1 at 69.5 W kg−1. Moreover, the Ni-Co LDH/3D RGO NF//AC has an outstanding cycling stability (about 70% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles), which makes it a potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage devices.
