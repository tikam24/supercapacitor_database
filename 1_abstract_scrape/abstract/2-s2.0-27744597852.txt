The effect of varying the hydrothermal time to synthesize manganese oxide (MnO 2) nanostructures was investigated along with their influence on structural, morphological, compositional, and electrochemical properties in supercapacitor electrode materials. XRD and TEM studies showed that the MnO 2 prepared in shorter hydrothermal dwell time was a mixture of amorphous and nanocrystalline particles, and there was an evolution of crystallinity of the nanostructures as the dwell time increased from 1 to 18 h. Interestingly, SEM, TEM, and HRTEM revealed a variety of structures ranging from nanostructured surface with a distinct platelike morphology to nanorods depending upon the hydrothermal reaction time employed during the preparation of the manganese oxide: increasing the amount of individual nanorods in the materials prepared with longer hydrothermal reaction time. The surface area of the synthesized nanomaterials varied from 100 to 150 m 2/g. Electrochemical properties were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies, and the capacitance values were in the range 72-168 F/g depending upon synthesis conditions. The formation mechanism of the nanorods and their impact on the specific capacitance were discussed in detail. Â© 2005 American Chemical Society.
