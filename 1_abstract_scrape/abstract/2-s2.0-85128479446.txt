A novel, one-pot hydrothermal synthesis of Ti3C2Tx (MXene)/CoS2/CuCo2S4 nanohybrid with multiple reactive equivalents has been demonstrated for designing of supercapacitor devices in both symmetric and asymmetric mode. Morphological study established successful coating with intercalation of sheet-like CoS2 and particle-like CuCo2S4 on Ti3C2Tx nanosheets. The ratio of MXene to CoS2/CuCo2S4 was varied to optimize the electrochemical efficiency. Three-electrode set up of electrochemical analysis revealed that the 5:1 ratio of MXene to CoS2/CuCo2S4, delivered the highest specific capacitance of 706.5 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density. The corresponding fabricated asymmetric device provided utmost specific capacitance (93.7 F g−1) and energy density (42.2 Wh kg−1) along with excellent cyclic life of 96% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Additionally, the device was successful in glowing LEDs and operating a 2 V fan. This proposed MXene based hybrid nanocomposite electrode with supreme electrochemical energy storage efficiency and excellent cyclic life holds immense potential for future energy technologies.
