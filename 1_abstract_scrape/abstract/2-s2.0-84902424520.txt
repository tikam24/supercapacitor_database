Carbon nano-powders (CNP) have been prepared by the electrochemical reduction of molten Li-Na-K carbonates at the eutectic composition (43.5-31.5-25mol %) at 450°C. After removing traces of carbonates by washing using aqueous based-solutions and filtration, the powders are composed of amorphous and graphitized domains, as revealed by XRD, with a low crystallinity. XPS investigations have pointed out the presence of different types of CO bonds with a surface oxygen content of about 6%. Finally Raman spectroscopy measurements have evidenced the presence of graphene, confirming observations by TEM and AFM measurements. The carbon powders prepared in our experimental conditions exhibit high specific surface area (≈1100m2 g-1) and are characterized by the presence of ultra- and super-microporosity, meso- and macroporosity. The carbon powders were tested in electrochemical capacitors as negative electrode in presence of aqueous or inorganic electrolyte. Capacitance of about 150Fg-1 in aqueous 0.1 M K2SO4 and about 45Fg-1 in 1M NEt4BF4 in acetonitrile have been observed after 10,000 cycles. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
