Graphene oxide-MnO2 (GO-MnO2) was successfully synthesized by microwave -assisted method with the substrate of GO covered by MnO2. MnO2 contained disordered pore structure and aggregate of random shape. GO exhibited layer-like shape and had a large numbers of functional groups on its surface. The electrochemical measurements were employed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), the results showed that the GO-MnO2 composite had good capacitive performance, the maximum of specific capacitance was 127 F g-1 at the current density of 100 mA g-1.
