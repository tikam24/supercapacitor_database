Nowadays, the integration of Energy Storage Systems in the electrical grid is a fundamental key to support the transition toward a reliable decentralized, renewable energy supply and electrochemical accumulators are one of the most promising storage technologies for many grid-connected applications. However, many applications, for example offering ancillary services, could increase the strain on the batteries causing a degradation of performances. Thus, the use of batteries coupled with supercapacitors, that have a higher specific power and a longer lifetime, allow a better management of the battery in many grid-connected applications. The article describes the results of characterization and ageing tests executed in order to verify the improvements, in terms of performances and lifetime, of a hybrid lithium-ion battery-supercapacitors system compared to a system composed by a battery operated alone.
