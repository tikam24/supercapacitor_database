Self-assembled, aggregated, chain-like SnO2 nano-assemblies were synthesized at room temperature by a simple wet chemical route within an hour in the presence of DNA as a scaffold. The average size of the SnO2 particles and the chain diameter were controlled by tuning the DNA to Sn(ii) molar ratio and altering the other reaction parameters. A formation and growth mechanism of the SnO2 NPs on DNA is discussed. The SnO2 chain-like assemblies were utilized as potential anode materials in an electrochemical supercapacitor. From the supercapacitor study, it was found that the SnO2 nanomaterials showed different specific capacitance (Cs) values depending on varying chain-like morphologies and the order of Cs values was: chain-like (small size) > chain-like (large size). The highest Cs of 209 F g-1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 was observed for SnO2 nano-assemblies having chain-like structure with a smaller size. The long term cycling stability study of a chain-like SnO2 electrode was found to be stable and retained ca. 71% of the initial specific capacitance, even after 5000 cycles. A supercapacitor study revealed that both morphologies can be used as a potential anode material and the best efficiency was observed for small sized chain-like morphology which is due to their higher BET surface area and specific structural orientation. The proposed route, by virtue of its simplicity and being environmentally benign, might become a future promising candidate for further processing, assembly, and practical application of other oxide based nanostructure materials.
