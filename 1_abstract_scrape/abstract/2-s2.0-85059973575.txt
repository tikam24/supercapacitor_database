This paper presents the operation of hybrid power system with fractional order fuzzy PID controller. Hybrid power system consists of more than one power generating station having renewable and nonrenewable energy resources. In this paper hybrid power system includes Solar PV cell, Wind turbine for power generation and some energy storing devices like ultra-capacitor, battery, flywheel etc. The minimization of frequency deviation is required to maintain constant power flow. A suitable control strategy is required for this purpose. In this paper, PID, Fuzzy PID and Fuzzy FOPID controllers are designed to sustain the constant power flow between load and generation. The Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is used to tune the controller parameters for maintaining constant power flow. The robustness test is done to know the effect of Ultra capacitor and different types of energy storage elements on hybrid power system. The results show that performance of fuzzy FOPID controller is better than other designed controllers.
