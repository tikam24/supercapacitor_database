A reduced graphene oxide/Ni(OH)2 composite with excellent supercapacitive performance was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal route without organic solvents or templates used. XRD and SEM results reveal that the nickel hydroxide, which crystallizes into hexagonal β-Ni(OH)2 nanoflakes with a diameter less than 200 nm and a thickness of about 10 nm, is well combined with the reduced graphene oxide sheets. Electrochemical performance of the synthesized composite as an electrode material was investigated by cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. Its specific capacitance is determined to be 1672 F/g at a scan rate of 2 mV/s, and 696 F/g at a high scan rate of 50 mV/s. After 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A/g, the composite exhibits a specific capacitance of 969 F/g, retaining about 86% of its initial capacitance. The composite delivers a high energy density of 83.6 W·h/kg at a power density of 1.0 kW/kg. The excellent supercapacitive performance along with the easy synthesis method allows the synthesized composite to be promising for supercapacitor applications. © 2014 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
