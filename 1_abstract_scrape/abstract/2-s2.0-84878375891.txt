Multilayer graphene oxide (MGO) nanosheets have been prepared by a simple chemical method. The MGO has been employed as a novel and low cost electrode material in construction of a high energy aqueous symmetric supercapacitor MGO/MGO. Scanning electron micrographs reveal the formation of nanosheet structure with thickness ranging from 30 to 50 nm The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results confirm the existence of oxygenated functional groups in the MGO nanosheets. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods are carried out to characterize electrochemical performance of the symmetric supercapacitor MGO/MGO. The maximum cell applied potential 1.2 V is obtained associates with 60 F g-1 of total electrode materials and maintains about 85% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor MGO/MGO shows high specific energy, specific power and maximum power values of 12 Wh kg-1, 300 W kg-1 and 20,751 W kg-1 based on the total mass of the active electrode materials, respectively, at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 in 1 M H 2SO4. The performance of the proposed supercapacitor has been compared with a symmetric supercapacitor based on graphite oxide (GO). Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.
