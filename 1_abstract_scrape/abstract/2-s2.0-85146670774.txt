In this research, we have made a breakthrough on the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of supercapacitors based on N-Ti3C2@Ni3S4 nanocomposites. These materials are prepared using in-situ growth of Ni3S4 nanoparticles on nitrogen doped delaminated Ti3C2 MXene via a hydrothermal method. The phase development and surface morphology are systematically investigated using a range of characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The electrochemical results demonstrate that N-Ti3C2@Ni3S4 nanocomposite has specific capacitance of 1280 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 current density, higher than d-Ti3C2 MXene, N-Ti3C2, Ti3C2@Ni3S4. N-Ti3C2@Ni3S4 showed 81% cyclic stability after 20,000 cycles. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) device of N-Ti3S4@Ni3S4 demonstrated an excellent energy density of 9.4 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 604 W kg−1 and 3 Wh kg−1 at 2016 W kg−1. N-Ti3C2@Ni3S4 nanocomposites for SSC device application make them advantageous for portable electronic devices.
