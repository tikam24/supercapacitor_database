The supercapacitor is a relatively young electronic component which bases its operation on the principle of the Helmholtz double layer of charge formed on the surface of an activated carbon (with an extremely high equivalent surface) and an electrolyte which allows both a short distance between the electric layers as well as a very large useful area. For optimal use of an EDLC (Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitor) it is necessary to know the time behavior, specific electrical characteristics (discharge current, charge current, voltage variation at the terminals, equivalent series resistance, and especially leakage current (self-discharge current), as well as behavior over a long time - days or even months - under electric charge at different voltages, etc.) and the influence of environmental operating conditions (temperature, humidity, vibration, etc.). For modeling in more detail the behavior of an EDLC in time and voltage a comparison between the Zubieta model and actual behavior was performed. The research is focused on the accuracy of the Zubieta model related to the real behavior of supercapacitors.
