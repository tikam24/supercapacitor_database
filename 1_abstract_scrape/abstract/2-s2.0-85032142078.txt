The importance of conducting polymer composites can be gauged from the fact that they are being intensively focused in various applications like fuel cell bipolar plates, EMI shielding devices, sensors, actuators, anticorrosion coatings, solar cells, biomaterials, etc. The light-weight, cost reduction, and ease of processing of the polymer-based products make them very attractive to replace conventional materials. Harnessing the synergism in properties between both micron and nanosized conducting filler particles and the polymer, the properties of the composite system could be enhanced in a better manner. In this regard constant search of novel conducting fillers especially graphite and graphite-derived high aspect ratio fillers along with polymers paved a path for realizing high-performance conducting composites. There is an urge in understanding latest trends in the field of conducting polymer binary and hybrid composites starting from synthesis, processing to applications. Hence this book chapter is intended to review recent research activities on structure-property correlations in conducting polymer-graphite binary and hybrid composites and their applications in diversified fields.
