Ionic liquids as electrolytes for energy storage devices is a promising field. Here, the various approaches of how ionic liquids can be modelled are discussed along with how the modelling connects to experimental results. Recent theoretical developments are highlighted along with extended discussion of what molecular dynamics simulation options are now available and what key results can be extracted. Ab initio work is also discussed, this includes some of the spectral properties, both of ionic liquids and their electrolyte formulations.
