Bi2S3 nanorods-reduced graphene oxide nanosheet (BGNS) composites with uniform morphology have been successfully prepared via a facile one-pot hydrothermal reaction using thioacetamide (TAA) as both the sulfur source and reducing agent. The simple and versatile synthetic procedure could accomplish the controlled fabrication of BGNS hybrids with tunable size and composition through adjusting the additive amount of GO. When employed as active materials for supercapacitor electrodes, in comparison with pristine rGO and X-Bi2S3 that obtained in the absence of GO, the BGNS composites displayed enhanced electrochemical performance by combining desired functions of individual components and introducing extra synergistic effects into the system. It is believed that the novel BGNS composites with multifarious advantages including nontoxicity, abundant resource and low cost are promising for practical application in supercapacitors.
