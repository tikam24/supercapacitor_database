Polypyrrole/MnO2 composites with unique three-dimensional network structure were successfully deposited on graphite felt (GF) fibers at the temperature of 50°C to fabricate PYMG-HT composite, which can be used as a free-standing electrode for supercapacitors. For comparison, PYMG-LT electrode was also prepared in ice bath, and the polypyrrole/MnO2 deposits on GF prepared at 0°C exhibit nano-flower shape, which is different from PYMG-HT. The PYMG-HT electrode displays specific capacitance as high as 821.3 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A g-1, which is much higher than that of PPy/MnO2 reported previously. Moreover, the PYMG-HT exhibits enhanced capacitive performance compared to PYMG-LT electrode. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
