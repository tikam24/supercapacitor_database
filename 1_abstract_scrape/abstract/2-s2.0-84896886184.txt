3D-interconnected nanoporous structure of reduced graphene oxide-carbon nanotube (RGO-CNT) is fabricated using the silica colloidal template method. This porous structure is beneficial for the decoration of RGO-CNT film with MnO2 as well as enables electrolyte penetration to the inside of RGO-CNT nanostructure. The 3D-interconnected nanoporous film of MnO 2-decorated RGO-CNT eventually is utilized as an electrode for supercapacitors, exhibiting excellent cycle performance and high power performance.
