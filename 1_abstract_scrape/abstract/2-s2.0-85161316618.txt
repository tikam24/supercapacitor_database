The conversion of plastic waste into high-value metal-organic framework (MOF) materials has currently grabbed the attention as an important research area for mitigating environmental and economic issues. Due to their large surface area and high porosity, MOFs have a significant advantage as supercapacitor electrode material. In this study, MOFs (Cu-MOF, Zr-MOF, and Ti-MOF) were produced from plastic wastes (PET bottles) using hydrothermal approach. These MOFs were tested electrochemically in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte using three-electrode setup. Among them, Cu-MOF (104.8 F/g at 0.5 A/g) showed higher capacitance and increased diffusion contribution (78.4 %) than its counterparts Zr-MOF (70.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g; 70.4 %) and Ti-MOF (55.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g; 67.5 %). Further, solid-state symmetrical supercapacitor devices have been assembled using all the plastic wastes derived MOFs viz. Cu-MOF//Cu-MOF, Zr-MOF//Zr-MOF, and Ti-MOF//Ti-MOF. Among them, Cu-MOF//Cu-MOF symmetric supercapacitor device performed better than the others by rendering energy density of 18.2 Wh/kg at 825 W/kg power density along with a cyclic stability of 87 % after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. These studies open new avenues to utilize waste PET bottles to synthesize high functional MOFs for next generation supercapacitors.
