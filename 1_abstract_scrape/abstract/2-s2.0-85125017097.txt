Range of electric vehicle depends on onboard energy storage system and strategies used to handle this power. Range anxiety, current drain during peak power demand and less battery life are the discouraging factors associated with battery alone electric vehicle. Suitable factor for battery as stress reduction is ultracapacitor and its utility along with the battery is in development stage. Limited research work is reported on control algorithm for battery and ultracapacitor as hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) in electric vehicle. Here, different energy management strategy is studied and presented. Conventional rule-based strategy is studied and simulated on Simulink platform. A modified rule-based strategy is proposed and simulated on the same platform. A comparative analysis suggests that modified rule-based strategy is having fast response, capable to provide constant dc link voltage and having better performance.
