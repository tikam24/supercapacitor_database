Silver (Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized through an electroless deposition providing high surface coverage of porous material. The structural and morphological characteristics were investigated along with electrochemical studies to evaluate the charge storage performance. The nanoparticle morphology provides more active sites and diffusion paths for the electrolyte ions resulting in maximum utilization of active electrode material. Ag nanoparticles based electrode not only exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 452 F/g (at scan rate of 2 mV/s) and specific energy of 27.8 Wh/kg, but also achieved a tremendous gain over cyclic stability by retrieving 63% capacitance after 10,000 cycles. Such attractive electrochemical behavior of the formed electrode is suitable for the manufacturing of the good quality supercapacitors by utilizing a roll-to-roll industrial production technology.
