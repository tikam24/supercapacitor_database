Rare-earth doped metal oxide nanoparticle working electrode for supercapacitors has obtained a high level of expectation among researchers due to its high cyclic stability, larger surface to volume ratio and a characteristics of varied morphology with synergistic effect. With much advancement in the field of nanotechnology and the ever demanding necessity of similar material with varied characteristics and morphology has arised, here synthesis technique come into effect due to its prominent parameters leading to our designated requirement. Here, 1% dysprosium doped CuO nanoparticles were synthesized by solution combustion and co-precipitation techniques for ultracapacitor working electrode. The structural and morphological analysis revealed the retention of monoclinic structured CuO nanoparticles and the particles were spherical in shape for both the techniques and the average crystallite size was found to be 8-13 nm. The thumbprint vibrational bands of the material were confirmed through FT-IR spectrum and the Raman active modes were confirmed through Raman analysis. The electrochemical characterization for the as-synthesized working electrode material was carried out through cyclic voltammetry in 1M aqueous solution of Na2SO4 electrolyte. The fabricated Cu0.99Dy0.01O electrodes exhibited a peak efficiency of 25.31 Fg-1 and 20.01 Fg-1 synthesized by combustion and co-precipitation technique for a scan rate of 5 mV/s respectively.
