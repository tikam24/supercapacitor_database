Flywheel systems have been promoted as “mechanical” batteries and offered as energy storage systems capable of high power and high cycle life. Operation of a flywheel energy storage system (ESS) is basically the same as that for an ultracapacitor, only the energy is stored as kinetic rather than potential energy. There is a direct analogy between angular speed of a flywheel and voltage in an ultracapacitor. The higher the angular speed (e.g., voltage) the greater the energy storage capacity in a flywheel. Issues that plague flywheel systems parallel those of the ultracapacitor: A containment vessel to hold a vacuum for a long term and non-contacting bearings correspond to minimization of ESR in an ultracapacitor. High tensile strength materials that can withstand large hoop stress without rupturing correspond to the dissociation potential of the ultracapacitor electrolyte. Even the governing equations are similar. However, whereas the ultracapacitor stores energy in the same form as it is being used, the flywheel system depends on electromechanical energy conversion in both directions; hence, its efficiency will be lower than that of an ultracapacitor.
