Supercapacitors can store and deliver energy by a simple charge separation, and thus they could be an attractive option to meet transient high energy density in operating fuel cells and in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. To achieve such requirements, intensive studies have been carried out to improve the volumetric capacitance in supercapacitors using various types and forms of carbons including carbon nanotubes and graphenes. However, conventional porous carbons are not suitable for use as electrode material in supercapacitors for such high energy density applications. Here, we show that edge-enriched porous carbons are the best electrode material for high energy density supercapacitors to be used in vehicles as an auxiliary powertrain. Molten potassium hydroxide penetrates well-aligned graphene layers vertically and consequently generates both suitable pores that are easily accessible to the electrolyte and a large fraction of electrochemically active edge sites. We expect that our findings will motivate further research related to energy storage devices and also environmentally friendly electric vehicles. Energy on edge: The new concept "molten potassium hydroxide-induced drilling effect" is introduced to achieve a high volumetric capacitance. The porous carbons produced by using this concept are edge-enriched. Edge sites contribute considerably to the capacitance and allow entrance to intraparticle pores. Therefore, these carbons are highly suitable electrode materials for high energy density supercapacitors for use in hybrid electric vehicles. Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
