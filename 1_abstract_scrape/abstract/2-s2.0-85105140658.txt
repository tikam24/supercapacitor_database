Zinc cobaltite (ZnCo2 O4 ) is an emerging electrode material for supercapacitors due to its rich redox reactions involving multiple oxidation states and different ions. In the present work, potato chip-like 0D interconnected ZnCo2 O4 nanoparticles (PIZCON) were prepared using a solvothermal approach. The prepared material was characterized using various analytical methods, including X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The possible formation mechanism of PIZCON was proposed. The PIZCON electrode material was systematically characterized for supercapacitor application. The areal capacitance of PIZCON was 14.52 mF cm−2 at 10 µA cm−2 of current density, and retention of initial capacitance was 95% at 250 µA cm−2 following 3000 continu-ous charge/discharge cycles. The attained measures of electrochemical performance indicate that PIZCON is an excellent supercapacitor electrode material.
