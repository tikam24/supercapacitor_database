Designing multifunctional materials with special morphology, high specific surface area structure and environmentally friendly is still crucial for energy conversion and storage application. Transition metal phosphide has been regarded as a promising and competitive candidate owing to its multiple merits such as earth-abundant, enriched redox-active sites and superior stability. In this study, the hierarchically hexagon-like NiCoP/Co(PO3)2 composites supported on Ni foam (NF@NiCoP/Co(PO3)2) were prepared by a hydrothermal reaction, followed by a phosphorization treatment. The obtained NF@NiCoP/Co(PO3)2 composites offer short ion diffusion distance, numerous reaction active sites and fast electron conduction rate, which enhancing the performance of supercapacitors and electrocatalysis. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, the as-synthesized electrode material exhibits high specific capacity (2.33 mAh cm−2 at a 4 mA cm−2), excellent rate capacity (84%, 4 mA cm−2 to 25 mA cm−2) and good long-term cycling stability (retained 80.3% over 5000 cycles). The asymmetric supercapacitor device (NF@NiCoP/Co(PO3)2//AC ACS) achieve a high energy density of 46.86 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 1.6 kW kg−1. Furthermore, the NF@NiCoP/Co(PO3)2 nanostructure also demonstrated the superior electrocatalytic performances toward overall water splitting. A low cell voltage of 1.69 V can be achieved at current densities of 50 mA cm−2 (η50 = 1.69 V). The results show that NF@NiCoP nanomaterials are promising multifunctional materials for supercapacitor and overall water splitting applications.
