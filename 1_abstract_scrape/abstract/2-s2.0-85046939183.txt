Hybrid energy storage systems (H-ESSs), as hybridizations of batteries and supercapacitors (SCs), need to be handled by appropriate energy management systems (EMSs). Smoothness of battery current to reduce their degradation are normally the aim of the EMSs. The evolutions of SC voltage however also need to be addressed. Various approaches for handling SC voltage while managing battery current can be found in the literature. Most of the time, their limitations are achieved directly or indirectly in the EMS. This paper aims to develop a merging control scheme to include the SC control outside the EMS. This control scheme based on the inversion principle of the Energetic Macroscopic Representation is proposed for a battery/SC subsystem. Two control schemes are thus systematically deduced and then merged. The battery current reference is generated regarding their aging behavior. Meanwhile, the SC voltage reference is deduced concerning the required SCs stored energy as a function of the vehicle velocity. The proposed approach is validated by simulation in Matlab/SimulinkÂ®.
