Background: Nanocarbon hybrids have been a topic of interest in recent years because of their important role in energy storage and conversion device fabrication. Objective: To get low-cost Graphene/N-doped Carbon Composites (G-NC) for superca-pacitor applications. Method: G-NC samples were prepared with a two-step hydrothermal method and char-acterized with field emission scanning electron microscopy, 77K nitrogen adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of samples was investigated with cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements in three-electrode configurations. Results: Samples showed a sheet-type morphology and nanoporous structure. The na-nohybrids had a specific surface area of 350 m2g-1, delivered maximum specific capacitance of 103 F g-1 at 0.5A g-1 in 6 M KOH with good cycle stability. Conclusion: Low-cost G-NC nanohybrids with good electrochemical performance are promising for supercapacitor applications.
