In order to overcome the ever-challenging environmental issues such as the greenhouse gas emission, traditional energy sources are gradually being replaced by renewable energy sources. However, the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources leads to the decrease of power system inertia, as renewable sources barely contribute to inertial response. To tackle this problem, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is composed of a battery and a supercapacitor, is proposed to enhance frequency control and optimize the system performance in this paper. Besides, a sizing method for the HESS is presented with the consideration of system cost and operation. The effectiveness of the proposed sized HESS is verified through simulation results.
