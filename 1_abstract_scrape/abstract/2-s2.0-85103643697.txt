Plant-based carbon materials have been used for electrode materials of supercapacitor due to their low price and developed pore structure. In this work, a kind of Activated Carbon derived from Barbary Figs Husk (ACBFH) was prepared by direct carbonization followed by KOH activation. TEM and BET analysis showed that the obtained ACBFH at 700 °C had the well hierarchical structure with uniform micropores and mesopores distribution. Due to the hetero-atom doping (N and O) and high specific surface area (1480 m2·g−1), the specific capacitance of the ACBFH electrode reached up to 497 F·g−1 in three electrode configuration with excellent capacitance retention of 96.5% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, all-solid-state symmetric ACBFH700//ACBFH700 device exhibited superb energy density value of 35.8 Wh·kg−1 at power density of 478.6 W·kg−1. Importantly, two symmetric devices in series could light yellow and blue LEDs for 16 and 8 mins, respectively. Therefore, the ACBFH opened the way for supercapacitor device with an efficient and sustainable electrode material in energy storage devices.
