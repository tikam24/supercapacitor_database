Electrode materials are crucial for the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In view of the high specific surface area, high conductivity of graphene nanosheets and the high pseudocapacitance of polyaniline (PANI), the combination of graphene with PANI has become a research hotspot. In this work, we summarize the recent advance on the synthesis of PANI and graphene/PANI composites, and their application in supercapacitors. The synthesis of PANI is the basis of preparing graphene/PANI composites, so we first introduce the synthesis methods of PANI. Then, the advances of two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) graphene/PANI composites are summarized according to the inherent feature of graphene. The 2D composites of pristine graphene and functionalized graphene with PANI are introduced separately; furthermore, the 3D composites are classified into three sections, including flexible graphene/PANI composites, graphene framework based composites, and printable graphene/PANI composites. At last, aiming at solving the current challenges of graphene/PANI composites, we put forward some strategies for preparing high performance graphene/PANI composite electrodes.
