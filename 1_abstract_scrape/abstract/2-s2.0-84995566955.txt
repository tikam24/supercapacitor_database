Reduced grapheme oxide (rGO) - SnO2 composites for supercapacitor applications were synthesized and characterized to understand their utility. Graphene Oxide (GO) was prepared through modified Hummer's method and mixed with SnO2 precursor solution prepared through Sol -Gel chemistry to attain rGO- SnO2 composite. The synthesized powder was annealed to get rGO- SnO2 composite. X - ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies show the successful synthesis of GO, SnO2 and rGO-SnO2 composites evidenced by standard signatures. Cyclic Voltammometric studies show interesting results for the composites where the specific capacitance for the composite is 1.62 times higher than that of the pure SnO2.
