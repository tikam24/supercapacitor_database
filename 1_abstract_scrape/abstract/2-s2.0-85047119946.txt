Herein, we report a rational synthesis of branched CoMoO4 nanowire arrays (NWAs) with remarkable supercapacitor performance on Ni foam via facile low-temperature (95 °C) one-step hydrothermal method. The CoMoO4 NWAs yielded high specific capacitance, rate performance, and cycling stability. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor device was assembled by virtue of the as-prepared CoMoO4 NWAs as positive electrode and the activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. This asymmetric supercapacitor device exhibits a maximum voltage of 1.6 V and high energy density (46.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1) as well as power density (8000 W kg−1 at 26.7 Wh kg−1). Such outstanding electrochemical performance implied the as-prepared CoMoO4 NWA electrode will be a prospective candidate for supercapacitors.
