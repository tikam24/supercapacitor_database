With the rapid development of intelligent products, wearable electronics show great potential to replace traditional electronics. With the increasingly perfect functions of wearable electronics, the energy storage and supply of these products are receiving more and more attention from the whole field. In this paper, a triboelectric nanogenerator based on electrostatic spinning technology is proposed (EPF-TENG), and an electrostatic spinning fiber supercapacitor (EPF-SC) is constructed, which are combined into a self-charging system (EPF-TENG-SC). As an independent technology black box module, this system can be directly imported into the wearable electronic product system to interact and combine with other product component modules. The EPF-TENG-SC has been shown to be able to be used for sustainable power supply of wearable electronics.
