Hexagonal β-Ni(OH)2 nanoplates grown on commercial graphene nanosheets (GNSs) were successfully prepared through a fast and facile microwave hydrothermal method. The GNSs/NiO@Ni(OH)2 composite was obtained via an additional treatment, due to which NiO separated out from the hexagonal nanoplates. A possible formation mechanism of these composites was put forward based on their morphology and microstructure. The GNSs/Ni(OH)2 composite exhibited high specific capacitance of 1172 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1 and showed specific capacitance of 1042 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 3 A g−1, whereas the GNSs/NiO@Ni(OH)2 composite showed higher rate capability (684 F g−1 at a discharge current density of 24 A g−1, ∼92% capacitance retention at 3 A g−1). GNSs/Ni(OH)2 anodes after the first charge-discharge cycle were characterized by TEM. Besides, both the composites delivered high energy density and high power density, due to which they are promising materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
