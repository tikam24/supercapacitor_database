In this research we present a low cost and facile preparation of Ag@MoS2/WO3 nanorod composite for supercapacitor electrode material. The morphology and chemical composition were determined by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM and FTIR analysis. The TEM image depicts uniform deposition of silver nanoparticles over heterostructured MoS2 nanosheets/WO3 nanorods. The electrochemical performances were measured by CV, GCD, and EIS test in alkaline electrolyte. The specific capacity of Ag@MoS2/WO3 was found to be 95.61 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1 which is two folds higher than that of pure WO3. Additionally, the Ag@MoS2/WO3//AC asymmetric supercapacitor electrode exhibits specific energy of 19.63 W h kg−1. Such excellent electrochemical properties of WO3 nanorods can be attributed to its unique nanostructure where the silver nanoparticles and MoS2 facilitate fast ion transfer and protect from electrode diffusion to improve the electrochemical performance of WO3 and insist for the practical energy storage device.
