Internet of Energy (IOE) is a new ecological energy system focusing on renewable energy, based on electric energy. It is characterized by multiple energy sources, coordination of supply and demand, centralization and decentralization, and extensive public participation. It is particularly worth mentioning that it is combined with energy storage, which represents the trend of intelligent development and rational utilization of urban energy in the future. Supercapacitors have become a research hotspot due to their excellent performance in power systems. In this paper, by introducing the energy storage principle of supercapacitors, we summarized the existing five supercapacitor models, and analyzed the characteristics and applicability of each model. At the same time, by summarizing and analyzing the energy storage principle of supercapacitors and related models, we focus on their role in the development of IOE, and also forecast the development prospect of IOE. Based on the deep integration of the Internet concept and advanced information technology with the energy industry, we aim to achieve green, coordinated and efficient development to drive economic growth and support the energy revolution, through multi-energy collaborative energy network, information and physics integrated energy system and innovative energy operation mode.
