Aquaharmonics Inc (AH) intends to develop, build, and perform open ocean testing on a 1:7 scale device. Testing will include data capture and performance optimization in wave climates representative of full scale in potential deployment locations. Test data will be used to develop a scaled device to provide minimized levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for markets with high power demand.
