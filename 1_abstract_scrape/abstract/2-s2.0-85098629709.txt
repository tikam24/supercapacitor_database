As an important class of battery-type materials, transition metal selenides are widely investigated for application in hybrid supercapacitors. Herein, we report the two-step synthesis of bimetallic copper cobalt selenide nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon layers ((CuCo)Se/NC) by using metal-organic framework (MOF) as the functional templates. Benefitting from the Cu incorporation in CoSe matrix and integration of MOF-derived carbon layers, the optimized (CuCo)Se/NC electrode delivers a reasonably high specific capacity of 121.4 C/g at 1 A/g with outstanding rate capability and cycling stability. The full hybrid supercapacitor device based on the (CuCo)Se/NC electrode shows a maximum energy density of 16.3 Wh/kg at a power density of 155.3 W/kg with excellent long-term cycling stability over 5000 cycles.
