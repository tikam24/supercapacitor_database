A novel process is reported which produces an asymmetric supercapacitor through the complete recycling of end-of-life lithium ion batteries. The electrodic powder recovered by industrial scale mechanical treatment of spent batteries was leached and the dissolved metals were precipitated as mixed metals carbonates. Nanowires battery-type positive electrodes were produced by electrodeposition into nanoporous alumina templates from the electrolytic baths prepared by dissolution of the precipitated carbonates. The impact of the different metals contained in the electrodic powder was evaluated by benchmarking the electrochemical performances of the recovered nanowires-based electrodes against electrodes produced by using high-purity salts. Presence of inactive Cu in the nanowires lowered the final capacitance of the electrodes while Ni showed a synergistic effect with cobalt providing a higher capacitance with respect to synthetic Co electrodes. The carbonaceous solid recovered after leaching was in-depth characterized and tested as negative electrode. Both the chemical and electrochemical characterization indicate that the recovered graphite is characterized by the presence of oxygen functionalities introduced by the leaching treatment. This has led to the obtainment of a recovered graphite characterized by an XPS C/O ratio, Raman spectrum and morphology close to literature reports for reduced graphene oxide. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using the recovered nanowires-based positive electrodes and graphite as negative electrodes has shown a specific capacitance of 42 Fg−1, computed including the whole weight of the positive electrode and recovered graphite, providing a maximum energy density of ~9 Whkg−1 and a power density of 416 Wkg−1 at 2.5 mA cm−2.
