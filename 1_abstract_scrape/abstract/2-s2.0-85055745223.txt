Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of metal oxides with structural anisotropy, rich surface chemistry and unique electronic structures are technologically intriguing. Importantly their chemical versatility makes them different from their counterparts and potential candidates for number of applications, specifically in the field of energy. This review article will summarize the recent progress in the synthesis of atomically thin 2D metal oxides and their applications for energy storage. It will first explain the structural fundamentals at atomic level thickness and change in surface chemistry due to defective structure and/or unsatisfied surface atoms. Further, it will highlight how different synthesis routes bring variety of 2D materials with tuneable electronic structures. In progress, it will describe the advantages of atomically thin materials over their bulk equals for applications in energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Finally, conclusive remarks will be listed with future perspectives towards designing heterostructured metal oxides in 2D nanosheets to overcome their limitations for various energy storage applications.
