The fast OH− transfer between hydroxide layers is the key to enhancing the charge storage efficiency of layered double hydroxides (LDH)-based supercapacitors (SCs). Constructing interlayer reactive sites in LDH is much expected but still a huge challenge. In this work, CdS nano-dots (NDs) are introduced to interlayers of ultra-thin NiFe-LDH (denoted CdSinter.-NiFe-LDH), promoting the interlayer ions flow for higher redox activity. The excellent performance is not only due to the enlarged layer spacing (from 0.70 to 0.81 nm) but also stems from anchored interlayer reactive units and the undamaged original layered structure of LDH, which contribute to the improvement of OH− diffusion coefficient (1.6 × 10−8 cm2 s−1) and electrochemical active area (601 mF cm−2) better than that of CdS NDs on the surface of NiFe-LDH (2.1 × 10−9 cm2 s−1 and 350 mF cm−2). The champion CdSinter.-NiFe-LDH electrode displays high capacitance of 3330.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent retention capacitance of 90.9% at 10 A g−1, which is better than the NiFe-LDH with CdS NDs on the surface (1966.6 F g−1). Moreover, the assembled asymmetric SCs (ASC) device demonstrate an outstanding energy density/power density (121.56 Wh kg−1/754.5 W kg−1).
