Nanocrystalline Li2TiO3 was successfully synthesized using solid-state reaction method. The microstructural and electrochemical properties of the prepared material are systematically characterized. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the prepared material exhibits predominant (002) orientation related to the monoclinic structure with C2/c space group. HRTEM images and SAED analysis reveal the well-developed nanostructured particles with average size of ∼40 nm. The electrochemical properties of the prepared sample are carried out using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) using Pt//Li2TiO3 cell in 1 mol L−1 Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The Li2TiO3 electrode exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 122 mAh g−1; it can be used as anode in Li battery within the potential window 0.0–1.0 V, while investigated as a supercapacitor electrode, it delivers a specific capacitance of 317 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA g−1 within the potential range −0.4 to +0.4 V. The demonstration of both anodic and supercapacitor behavior concludes that the nanocrystalline Li2TiO3 is a suitable electrode material for supercapattery application.
