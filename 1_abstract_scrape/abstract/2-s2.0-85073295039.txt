A derivative of 1,4-Naphthoquinone coded HBU671 was synthesized and used in addition to activated carbon as composite electrode for supercapacitor application. From the electrochemical properties analysis, a specific capacitance of about 300 F g exhibited almost two times of that of activated carbon at a scan rate of 100 mV s and a potential window of-0.2-1V. This improvement is due to the inherent redox reaction in HBU671. Cycle test also proved that this composite-1-1 is still stable even after 1000 cycle within the applied potential window and it is highly recommended for practical application.
