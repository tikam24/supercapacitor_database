ThH voltage of single supercapacitor is no more than 1.6V. So a lot of cells are combined to a bank in order to reach higher voltages which make it possible for a high efficient transformation from the supercapacitor bank. Sometimes hundreds of cells are connected whereas the voltages of the cells differ with others. So proper measure should be taken to detect the voltages of the individual cells. This paper represents a new method of detecting the voltages of cells quickly. A microprocessor is implied to control the multi channels. This method is much faster and more accurate than those done by relays or voltage distribution by resistors. It is implied in the capacitor bank which contents 20 cells and gains a good result. It costs 1ms to detect each capacitor and the precision reaches 2mV. As the detecting board is powered directly by supercapacitors and CAN bus is applied to connect the boards, it is more suitable for detecting voltages of supercapacitors in vehicles. Â© 2009 IEEE.
