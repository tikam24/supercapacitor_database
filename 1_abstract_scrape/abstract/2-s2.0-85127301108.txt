In situ growth of manganese hexacyanoferrate nanostructure (Mn-HCF) on Ni foam is achieved by simply heating Ni foam in the acidic solution containing KMnO4 and K3Fe(CN)6 at 120 °C. Ni foam is used not only as the current collector but also as the reducing agent for the reduction of both KMnO4 and K3Fe(CN)6. In acidic medium, MnO4− is reduced to Mn2+ while Fe(CN)63− is reduced to Fe(CN)64−. The produced Mn2+ and Fe(CN)64− subsequently react with each other to produce Mn2[Fe(CN)6] ∙ 0.5H2O (Mn-HCF). Mn-HCF supported on Ni foam (Mn-HCF/Ni foam) is used as a binder-free electrode for supercapacitor, which exhibits high areal capacitance and long cycling life. The asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC) fabricated with Mn-HCF/Ni foam and activated carbon (AC) as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, presents a high energy density of 8.84 W h m−2 at power density of 75.3 W m−2, implying the great application prospect of Mn-HCF/Ni foam.
