Rational design and synthesis of high-efficient and cost-effective electrode materials are pivotal for developing high performance supercapacitors. Herein, we synthesized N, O, co-doped hierarchical porous carbon fibers (NPCFs) towards high performance symmetric supercapacitor with N-rich cocoon silk as precursor via an alkali activation and a g-C3N4 mediated strategy. By adjusting the addition of g-C3N4, the N doping content and pore structures can be regulated, and the optimized material NPCF1 (mass ratio, primary char CF: g-C3N4 = 1:1) exhibits high N doping content (6.05%) with domination of active pyridinic-N pyrrolic-N, and more abundant pores as well as higher specific surface area (2643.75 m2 g−1). Meanwhile, NPCF1 as supercapacitor electrode can deliver high specific capacitance of 392 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate performance (222 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) in 6 M KOH. More impressively, NPCF assembled symmetric supercapacitor with 1.0 M neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte can still achieve a high operating voltage of 1.8 V, an outstanding energy density of 20.77 W h kg−1 at a power density of 450 W kg−1. Such universal small molecule nitrogen source-mediated strategy may inspire new progress of synthesizing advanced carbons for energy-related application.
