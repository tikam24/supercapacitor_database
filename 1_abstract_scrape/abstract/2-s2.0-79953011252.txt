We developed an electric double layer capacitor using an ionic liquid as the electrolyte salt for a high energy density and a life performance. The influence of the surface area of the activated carbon and the concentration of the electrolyte on the storage and life performance of the capacitor was studied. Separator can control the gas generation during the float charge of the capacitor to be able to extend the its life. Our produced capacitor, "N's Cap", by these techniques has good performances and the storage module assembled with the cells and the external circuit was presented. Â© 2007 WEVA Journal.
