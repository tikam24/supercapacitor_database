Transition-metal chalcogenide nanostructures provide a unique material platform to engineer next-generation energy storage devices such as lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and potassium-ion batteries and flexible supercapacitors. The transition-metal chalcogenide nanocrystals and thin films have enhanced electroactive sites for redox reactions and hierarchical flexibility of structure and electronic properties in the multinary compositions. They also consist of more earth-abundant elements. These properties make them attractive and more viable new electrode materials for energy storage devices compared to the traditional materials. This review highlights the recent advances in chalcogenide-based electrodes for batteries and flexible supercapacitors. The viability and structure-property relation of these materials are explored. The use of various chalcogenide nanocrystals supported on carbonaceous substrates, two-dimensional transition metal chalcogenides, and novel MXene-based chalcogenide heterostructures as electrode materials to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium-ion batteries is discussed. The sodium-ion and potassium-ion batteries offer a more viable alternative to lithium-ion technology as they consist of readily available source materials. Application of various transition metal chalcogenides such as MoS2, MoSe2, VS2, and SnSx, composite materials, and heterojunction bimetallic nanosheets composed of multi-metals as electrodes to enhance the long-term cycling stability, rate capability, and structural strength to counteract the large volume expansion during the ion intercalation/deintercalation processes is highlighted. The promising performances of layered chalcogenides and various chalcogenide nanowire compositions as electrodes for flexible supercapacitors are also discussed in detail. The review also details the progress made in new chalcogenide nanostructures and layered mesostructures for energy storage applications.
