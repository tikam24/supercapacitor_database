TiN is herein used as an example to elucidate that a sintering treatment should be considered as a relevant variable to discuss charge storage mechanisms, charge transfer resistances and others important electrochemical aspects of the non-oxidic supercapacitor electrodes. Binder-free TiN nanocoatings with low charge transfer resistance (<2Ω), rapid response with diminutive τ0 (10 ms) and high electrochemical stability displayed competitive capacitance values (120F‧g−1 at 2A‧g−1) as high-performance supercapacitor electrodes. The sintered electrodes finally improve the nanostructure connectivity and preserves the microstructural integrity, reinforcing the adhesion and joining between the collector and the electroactive material. A gradual degradation was observed for as-deposited coatings, leading to capacitance losses during cycling due to the chemical instability of the pre-sintered TiN coatings, while the full-connected electroactive nanostructure resulting from the thermal treatment leads to an enhancement of the electrochemical response. The robust structure of the sintered electrode helped to prevent chemical/structural damages avoiding retention capability losses. The processed coatings with designed microarchitectures onto non-carbonaceous collector allows distinguishing the effects of each charge-storage mechanism, both capacitive and faradaic contributions of the electroactive material. Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD) is the selected technique to prepare nanostructured films on the Ni foams from TiN nanoparticles (TiN[sbnd]NPs) suspensions. FESEM and electrochemical results confirm that TiN[sbnd]NPs full-cover the 3D foams and the first layers, in direct contact with the substrate, consolidate during the EPD process due to the elevated voltage applied to the on growing layer.
