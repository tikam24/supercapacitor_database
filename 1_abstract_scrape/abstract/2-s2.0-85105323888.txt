Nowadays, how to get the high power density and high specific capacitance in supercapacitors remains an open challenge. To deal with this issue, we propose a carotenoid inspires nanomaterial structure of Lycopene (LC) that consists of nanoparticles (NPs) with a diameter of approximately 1 µm to 20 nm are prepared by a solvent extraction method. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the presence of LC and Brunauer–Emmett–teller surface area of LC NPs finds to be in the range of 33–62 m2g−1. The prepared LC then investigates its electrochemical performances as an electrode for supercapacitor. Fresh LC has an outstanding capacitance of 389 Fg−1 at 0.2 Ag−1 in a three electrode system, and it was 107 Fg−1 also at a higher current density of 2.2 Ag−1. Furthermore, at an energy density of 9.5 Wh kg−1, fresh LC has a decent power density of 0.2 × 106 Wkg−1. Bode phase plot reveals the relaxation time so of 27.5 ms and 26.7 ms, corresponding to capacitor response frequency of 5.80 Hz and 5.91 Hz for fresh LC and aged LC (20th day) based super capacitors, respectively. At the end, it also studies the applicability of Kramers–Kronig relationships to assess the validity of real and imaginary impedance measurements for LC NPs using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method.
