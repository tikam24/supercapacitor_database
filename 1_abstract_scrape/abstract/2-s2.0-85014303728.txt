Impedance-sourced networks provide an efficient means of power conversion between source and load in a wide range of electric power conversion applications (dc-dc, dc-ac, ac-dc, and ac-ac). Various topologies and control methods using different impedance source networks have been presented in the literature, e.g. for adjustable-speed drives, uninterruptible power supply, distributed generation (fuel cell, photovoltaic (PV), wind, etc.), battery or super-capacitor energy storage, electric vehicles, distributed dc power systems, avionics, flywheel energy storage systems, electronic loads, dc circuit breaker, and many more [1-13]. A variety of converter topologies with buck, boost, buck-boost, unidirectional, bidirectional, isolated as well as non-isolated converters are possible by proper implementation of the impedance source network with various switching devices, topologies, and configurations. Figure 7.1 shows the general configuration of an impedance source network for electric power conversion.
