The romanechite-like sodium manganese oxide Na2Mn 5O10 is synthesized through alkaline hydrolysis of [Mn12O12(CH3COO)16(H 2O)4] followed by thermal calcination. Amorphous Na 2Mn5O10 is obtained at relatively low temperature (200 °C). Increasing the calcination temperature leads to highly crystalline nano-rods. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that Na 2Mn5O10 is a good candidate as positive electrode materials for supercapacitor: specific capacitances of 178, 173 and 175 F g-1 are obtained for Na2Mn5O10 calcined at different temperatures (200, 400 and 600 °C), respectively, by charge-discharge tests at 0.1 A g-1. Moreover, capacitance losses of all the products in 1000 cycles are less than 3%. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
