The current study evaluated the impact of the annealing temperature on the electrochemical characteristics of the spinel-like nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) nano-/microstructures. For this purpose, NiCo2O4 samples are prepared through a facile co-precipitation synthesis and calcined at two distinct temperatures of 300 째C and 500 째C. The prepared samples were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy dispersive X-rays analysis (EDX). The electrochemical characterizations are carried out on prepared samples using the CHI760E electrochemical workstation to determine their suitability as active materials for supercapacitors. The results revealed the battery-type behavior of the prepared electrode materials with the highest value of specific capacity in a 500 째C calcined sample of 224 C/g at 2.00 A/g. The results of EIS are aligned with the outcomes of CV and GCD. The electrochemical analysis indicates that the 500 째C calcined temperature is appropriate for use as electrode material in supercapacitors.
