Nanostructured manganese dioxide decorated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MnO2/MWNT) composite was prepared by a hydrothermal method using a 3D precursor manganese benzoate dihydrazinate. Microscopic analysis confirmed that the nanostructured MnO2 particles were densely decorated over the MWNT surface. The composite showed high specific capacitance (276 F·g−1 at a current density of 3.0 A·g−1) and an excellent cycle stability (91.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles), suggesting its potential application for a high-performance supercapacitor.
