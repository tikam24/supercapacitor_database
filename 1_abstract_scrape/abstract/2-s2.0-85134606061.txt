One of the foremost necessary desires of energy systems has been the existence of efficient, flexible, transportable, and eco-friendly devices. Among all the energy storage systems, supercapacitors have attracted plenty of attention thanks to their distinctive properties. Among all capacitor technologies, laser-induced graphene (LIG)-based capacitors are within the spotlight nowadays due to their high flexibility and simple manufacture. The most downside with LIG-based capacitors is their low conductivity and low charge capacity. During this work, to overcome this problem, the surface of LIG is covered with silver nanowires (AgNWs) and LIG/AgNWs composite is employed to form supercapacitor. In this study, all the electrochemical properties of the prepared composite were investigated, and therefore the results showed that AgNWs could increase the electrical conductivity of LIG by about 2.25 times, improve electrode–electrolyte interaction, and increase areal capacitance by 1.3 times. Additionally, the synthesized supercapacitor shows stable cyclic behavior and retention capacity equal to 78% after 1000 charge–discharge cycles. A singular increase in LIG conductivity and improved in its cyclic performance. Furthermore, galvanostatic charge/discharge curves indicated acceptable charge capacity of the LIG/AgNWs supercapacitor.
