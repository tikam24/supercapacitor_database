Using three-dimensional porous nickel foam(NF) as template, the grapheme/manganese dioxide/NF (G/MnO2/NF) self-supported composite is prepared through electrochemical deposition of graphene(G) and hydrothermal synthesis of nanosheets manganese dioxide (MnO2), which is then employed as binder-free electrode to improve the electrochemical properties. The micro structure and surface morphology of the composite are analyzed by XRD, Raman and SEM. The electrochemical properties of the electrode material are investigated by CV, GCD and EIS tests. The results indicate that its specific capacitance is up to 722 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g. Moreover, it still remains at about 97% of initial value after 1000 times cycles of GCD test.
