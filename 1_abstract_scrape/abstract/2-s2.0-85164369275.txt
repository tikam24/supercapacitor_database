The performance of supercapacitor degenerates at low temperature, even fails to work sometimes. Solar photothermal conversion provides a new direction for the performance improvement of supercapacitor. Manganese dioxide (MnO2) has a high specific capacity, while it should be compounded with other active materials due to its low electric conductivity. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the performance of MnO2-based supercapacitor using the photothermal effect of polypyrrole (PPy), which exhibited excellent light absorption ability and pseudocapacitance property. MnO2 and PPy were successively deposited on slow filter paper by wet chemistry method and low-temperature interfacial polymerization approach, and PPy/MnO2 paper-based composites with different PPy contents were prepared. The structures and properties of the composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and AC impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that the porous structure of filter paper was well preserved after PPy deposition, and MnO2 was covered to form a large active area. The specific capacitance of MnO2/PPy-400 single electrode reached 1 487.1 mF/cm2, 67% higher than that of pure PPy electrode. Under the simulated sunlight with the intensity of 1 kW/m2, the surface temperature of the assembled symmetrical supercapacitor increased from 21.2 °C to 46.7 °C after 10 min. The specific capacitance of the symmetrical supercapacitor assembled by the paper electrode with PPy of 400.0 μL was 52.9 mF/cm2 with illumination, five times that in dark, suggesting excellent photothermal effect to enhanced capacitor performance.
