The development of hollow and porous materials is essential for effective energy storage and conversion owing to their facile transport of electrons and ions. Herein, through a facile low-temperature thermal decomposition reaction of ZIF-67 crystals, hollow Co3O4 nanocages composed of numerous nanoparticles with a porous structure are prepared. These hollow and porous Co3O4 nanocages (Co3O4 HPCs) possess a pore size distribution between 20 and 60 nm and a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of 211.79 m2 g-1. Benefitting from the large surface area, a maximum specific capacitance of 140.0 F g-1 can be calculated. Furthermore, the assembled Co3O4 HPCs//activated carbon hybrid supercapacitor can deliver an energy density of 19.8 W h kg-1 and 97.3% capacitance retention during 5000 cycles. As a result of good electrochemical performance of these Co3O4 HPCs, they can be a promising electrode for supercapacitors.
