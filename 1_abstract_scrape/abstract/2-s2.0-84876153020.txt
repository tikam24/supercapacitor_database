A graphene/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (G/PEDOT) hybrid was prepared by the in situ polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene using the precursor of graphene, graphene oxide, as an oxidant under microwave heating. The G/PEDOT hybrid was characterized by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of G/PEDOT hybrid electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The G/PEDOT hybrid as a supercapacitor electrode material afforded high specific capacitance and good cycling stability (93% retention after 10 000 cycles at a high current density of 5 Ag-1) during the charge-discharge process. A maximum specific capacitance as high as 270 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1 was achieved in 1m H2SO4 electrolyte solution. In addition, the energy density of the G/ PEDOT hybrid reached 34 Whkg-1 at a power density of 25 kWkg-1. Â© 2013 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
