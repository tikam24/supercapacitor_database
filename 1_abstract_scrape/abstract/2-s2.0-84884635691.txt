This paper is concerned with a simulation model design and construction of the energy efficiency measurement of the tram emulation with the on-board energy storage system. The kinetic energy is accumulated into the supercapacitor during vehicle braking. This energy can be used to accelerate the tram (in next). It is important to save the braking energy of the vehicle, which accelerate very often. Â© 2013 IEEE.
