High-entropy oxides (HEO) are a novel material with the unique electrochemical properties, which are stabilized due to the high configurational entropy. In this paper, a high-entropy (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O nanopowder with the sizes of 40-65nm and a rocksalt structure was synthesized by a polyacrylamide gel method and subsequent calcination at 900â„ƒ for 2h in the presence of a mole ratio of acrylamide/metal cations of 120:1. The results show that the temperature of forming a single-phase (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O nanopowder decreases with the increase of the mole ratio of acrylamide/metal cations. The HEO nanopowder has a specific capacitance of 402F/g at a current density of 1A/g. A rate capability of 62% appears at 20A/g. The capacitance retention is 61% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 5A/g. It is indicted that (Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2)O nanopowder could be used as a prospective electrode material for supercapacitors.
