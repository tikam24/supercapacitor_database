The vast seeking of energy and lacking of fossil fuels has concerned adequate attention of investigators to advance materials, including outstanding electrochemical characteristics. Carbon-based materials, for example, graphene, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, have gained massively focus because of their essential electrical, thermal and mechanical characteristics. CNT and graphene are practicing a make of electrodes for energy storage applications. Carbon materials as anode materials have some limitations because charge storage is bound through adsorption-desorption of ions at the electrode/electrolyte interface, producing a double layer, and their collection while synthesis and processing result in lower electrochemical activity. Carbon nanomaterials with 3D and 2D structures, like CNT, GN, GN foams and carbon nanofibers, have been extensively published due to their distinct morphological and physical characteristics for energy storage purposes. This review article estimates and collects published data to exhibit an essential and comprehensive state of the art survey.
