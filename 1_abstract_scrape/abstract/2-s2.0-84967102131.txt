Synthesis of a series of porous coordination polymers with nanorod morphology constructed from a catechol-substituted porphyrin[meso-tetrakis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)porphyrin] is reported. While the coordination polymers had moderate surface areas (100-400 m2 g-1), their thermolysis in an inert atmosphere led to carboniferous materials with large surface areas (up to 800 m2 g-1), containing metal oxide nanoparticles. Capacitance measurements (by electrochemical charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry) of the resulting hybrid materials revealed that these hybrid nanomaterials exhibit high (super) capacitances (up to 380 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) with good cycling properties. The results demonstrate the utility of using porphyrin coordination polymers for the preparation of hybrid supercapacitor materials and also indicate that these carbon-metal oxide nanoparticle materials are promising for energy storage applications.
