Hierarchically porous carbon materials with high nitrogen functionalities are extensively studied as highperformance supercapacitor electrode materials. In this study, nitrogen-doped porous carbon textile (N-PCT) with hierarchical pore structures is prepared as an electrode material for supercapacitors from a waste cotton T-shirt (WCT). Porous carbon textile (PCT) is first prepared from WCT by two-step heat treatment of stabilization and carbonization. The PCT is then nitrogendoped with urea at various concentrations. The obtained N-PCT is found to have multi-modal pore structures with a high specific surface area of 1,299 m2 g−1 and large total pore volume of 1.01 cm3 g−1. The N-PCT-based electrode shows excellent electrochemical performance in a 3-electrode system, such as a specific capacitance of 235 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent cycling stability of 100 % at 5 A g−1 after 1,000 cycles, and a power density of 2,500 W kg−1 at an energy density of 3.593 Wh kg−1. Thus, the prepared N-PCT can be used as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
