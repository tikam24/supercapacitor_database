Nanohybrid anode materials for highly efficient asymmetric supercapacitors are developed with a hydrothermal approach using organ-like (Ti3C2Tx) MXene as a main basis. The MoSe2/Ti3C2Tx hybrid supercapacitor has a high specific capacitance of 1531.2 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 and a low potential of 200 mV at 10 mAg−1. Additionally, the Tafel slope of 37.7 mV dec−1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) makes this supercapacitor an excellent electrochemical performer. The supercapacitor with Ti3C2Tx/MoSe2nanohybrid as the positive electrode shows excellent performance. Even after 10,000 cycles, it retains a capacitance of 94.1% with a high current density of 5 Ag−1, a high specific energy of 58.8 Whkg−1 and a high specific power of 800.3 Wkg−1. In comparison with unmodified MoSe2, it increases conductivity, speed of charge transfer, and active sites which is explained by the strong interfacial connection between MXene and Ti3C2Tx crystals.
