Engineering hierarchical heterostructure materials has been recognised as a challenging but prepossessing strategy for developing hybrid supercapacitors. Thus, a Ni-Co PBA derived 3D/1D heterostructure NiO/NiCo2O4 based layered double hydroxide on carbon cloth (CC/NiO/NiCo2O4/NiMn-LDH) as a battery-type electrode was successfully designed via a controllable hydrothermal method. The 3D Ni-Co PBA nanocubes served as scaffolds, providing more space for the nickel-cobalt precursors to grow and then calcine to form a continuous conductive layer of 3D/1D CC/NiO/NiCo2O4. Subsequently, 2D ultrathin NiMn-LDH nanosheets were uniformly anchored on 3D/1D NiO/NiCo2O4, resulting in a unique hierarchical structure that effectively addressed the restacking issue and dead volume of NiMn-LDH, contributing to increased charge and electron transport rates, which promoted the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from abundant interfaces with the open channels of the nanoarchitecture, the CC/NiO/NiCo2O4/NiMn-LDH electrode showed an exceptional specific capacity of 1593.0 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a desirable rate performance of 92.9% at a current density of 8 A g−1. Surprisingly, HSC devices can achieve an ideal specific energy of 44.28 W h kg−1 at a specific power of 108.22 W kg−1 with 97.59% cycling durability after 10 000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles. These remarkable properties indicate that the designed novel hierarchical heterostructure electrode has great potential for broad applications in electrochemical energy storage systems.
