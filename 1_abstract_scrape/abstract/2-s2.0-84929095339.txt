In the present work, a three-dimensional (3D) porous framework of RuO2/reduced graphene oxide hydrogels (RuO2/RGOH) was prepared by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. In this hybrid hydrogel, RuO2 nanoparticles were homogeneously dispersed on the exfoliated RGO sheets. The as-prepared RuO2/RGOH electrode shows excellent supercapacitive performances with high specific capacitance (345 F g-1 for 15% RuO2 loading), good rate capability and a long electrochemical cycling life (without decaying after 2000 cycles). Furthermore, RuO2 in the hybrid can contribute a capacitance as high as 1365 F g-1, which is comparable to its theoretical value. These excellent results originate from the factors that the 3D porous network structure provides a more accessible surface area and facilitates an electron and proton injecting/expelling process in the electrochemical reaction. This work provides a facile method for preparing graphene-based composite materials with remarkable capacitive performances.
