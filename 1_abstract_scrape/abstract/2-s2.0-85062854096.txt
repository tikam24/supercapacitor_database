Porous carbon composite electrodes have attracted extensive attention due to their excellent electrochemical performance toward energy storage applications. In this work, hierarchical nitrogen-containing porous carbon (HNPC) and α-MnO2 nanowires composite electrode is prepared through a template method. The as-prepared composite electrode, characterized as one-dimensional nanowires inserted into three-dimensional interconnected porous structures, exhibits high specific capacitance of 204.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability (97.2% remains after 5000 cycles). Moreover, the fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor based on HNPC//HNPC/MnO2 achieves a wide working voltage window of 1.8 V and a high energy density up to 30.1 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 900.0 W kg−1. The results indicate that the HNPC/MnO2 composite electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance have promising perspective in supercapacitor applications.
