The nature of solar radiation is not steady, therefore having a solar-capacitor device that can simultaneously capture, convert and store solar energy can promote the technologies using solar energy. A self-charging photoactive supercapacitor is designed and fabricated as a functional solar energy storage device, which is accomplished in situ self-assembled storage technique. The solar-capacitor device is assembled on a multilayered photoelectrode including cationic dye and conducting polymer. The supercapacitor can be charged when the photo-electrode is illuminated. The voltage of the Ppy and Ppy+MB photo-electrodes based devices was increased under illumination effect by 5.22 mV and 23 mV, respectively. The presented results on the hybrid device based Ppy+MB are encouraging for solar-capacitor devices with dual properties of harvesting solar energy and store charges in a single device with two-terminals. With the simplicity of fabrication nanocomposite thin film Ppy+MB, low-cost solar capacitor device can be made for small integrated electronic devices for harvesting and storage energy.
