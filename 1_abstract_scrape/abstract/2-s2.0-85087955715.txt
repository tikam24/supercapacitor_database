Electroactive composite coating based on polyaniline and activated IR pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile particles onto anodized graphite foil was developed for the first time. The roughened surface and presence of oxygen-containing groups on the foil surface provide good adhesion of the composite material. The study of coating properties by SEM and XPS techniques showed that the introduction of activated carbon material particles into the coating increases its surface due to the porosity of the polyacrylonitrile-based activated carbon, and facilitates electronic and ion transport during charge-discharge cycles. Electrochemical performance of composite coatings in comparison with polyaniline coating was investigated by methods of cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. It has been shown that areal capacitance of composite based on activated IR pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile and polyaniline coating was 2.8 F cm−2, that is by one and a half times higher than this value for polyaniline (1.9 F cm−2). It was demonstrated that there is almost no capacity loss after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
