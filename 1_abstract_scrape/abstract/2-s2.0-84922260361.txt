Carbon fibers have been studied for electrochemical applications. Recently, carbon nanotubes present a wide potential uses in electric, mechanic, electrochemical and materials science field. At present study, vertically aligned carbon nanotubes were produced over carbon fibers. The process occurs catalytically by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using mixture with camphor and ferrocene. After that, the VACNT/CF composite are treated by oxygen plasma for oxygen functionalization. Prior the electrochemical analysis, CNT/Carbon fibers are treated by hydrochloric acid to remove residual catalyst. The electrodes were tested in a usual electrolyte (with H2SO4 0.5M) in a conventional electrochemical cell. The specific capacitance was tested in a separate device. The configuration of carbon fibers and VACNT presents a high potential application for electro analytical application and energy storage.
