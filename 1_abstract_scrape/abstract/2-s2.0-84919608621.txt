This paper present a research on the realization of polymeric coatings based on CNT/CNF-electroactive polymer networks structures type 3D for supercapacitor purposes. This paper shows effective measurements and tests made in order to determine the quality of electrodes using cyclic voltammetry method to realize a deposion of a reactant on the graphite electrode and to see the relationship between different concentrations of ferrocyanide reactant and the applied potential.
