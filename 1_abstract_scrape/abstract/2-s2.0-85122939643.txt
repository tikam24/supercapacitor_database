Nano structured metal oxides received considerable research attention due to their unique properties that can be used for designing advanced nanodevices. Thus, in the present study, Tungsten oxide/graphene oxide (WO3/GO) nanocomposite was synthesized, characterized and implemented in an electrochemical system. Graphene oxide was synthesized by Hummer's method. WO3 doped Graphene oxide nanocomposite were also successfully synthesized using sodium tungstate as the source of Tungsten. The crystalline structure and optical properties of WO3 doped GO nanocomposite were characterized by UV-VIS spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) with EDAX spectroscopy. The XRD spectrum showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the crystal planes of crystalline Tungsten oxide. Using Debye scherrer formula, the size of the undoped and Tungsten oxide doped Graphene oxide nanocomposite were also calculated. The morphological studies of the nanocomposite revealed crystal like morphology. The energy dispersive analysis confirmed the presence of Carbon, Tungsten and oxygen in the doped WO3/GO lattice. Cyclic voltammetric behaviour showed better electrochemical response with the doped sample when compared with the undoped sample.
