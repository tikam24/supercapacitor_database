Manganese dioxide has been considered to be one of the most attractive electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage applications owing to its high theoretical specific capacitance, low cost, abundant natural reserves and eco-friendliness. However, MnO2 has poor conductivity, which limits rate capability, and thus hinders the application of MnO2 in energy storage. Here we attempt to take advantage of cobalt-based metal organic frameworks derived nanoporous carbon (MOF-NPC) to improve the electrochemical performance of MnO2-based composite electrodes. We fabricated Na+-MnO2/MOF-NPC hybrid electrode by a simple redox reaction method. Accordingly, the hybrid electrode reaches a specific capacitance of 217.0 F g−1, which is significantly better than that of the individual components. Then the contribution of capacitance and diffusion to the whole is analyzed quantitatively. The capacitance retains 82.80% when the current density increases from 2 A g−1 to 20 A g−1. After 5000 cycles, the total capacitance loss is only 9%. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled using Na+-MnO2/NPC composite and activated carbon as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The asymmetric supercapacitor has the capacitance retention of 82% after 3000 cycles. These results provide a promising direction for designing high-performance supercapacitors.
