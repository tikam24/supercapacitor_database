Herein, we developed a novel microwave-assisted hydrothermal synthetic method for urchin-like bimetallic manganese-cobalt carbonate composites. Compared with the traditional process, the microwave-assisted hydrothermal process is not only environmentally friendly, but also more convenient. The electrode of supercapacitors prepared at 120 °C for 10 min exhibited the best electrochemical performance, which could deliver a high capacitance of 839.58 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2 and remain 82.12 % of its initial capacitance even after 8,000 successive charge-discharge cycles at a high current density of 6 mA cm−2. We have found the possibility of using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal process to synthesize the urchin-like bimetallic manganese-cobalt carbonate composites, which is of great importance for the application of bimetallic manganese-cobalt carbonate composites in the supercapacitor field.
