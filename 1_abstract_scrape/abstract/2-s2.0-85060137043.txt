B, N dual-doped sisal-based activated carbon (BN-SAC) with a multiscale porous structure for high-rate supercapacitor electrode was prepared through a novel and facile strategy. With the inherent cellular channels serving as primary macropores, secondary mesopores and micropores are generated on the fiber surface and tracheid walls through low-pressure rapid carbonization of (NH4)2B4O7-containing sisal fibers and successive KOH activation. In addition to introducing B, N atoms into the BN-SAC, the additive also facilitates the formation of mesopores due to the rapid gas evaporation during its decomposition, leading to significantly increased specific surface area (2017 m2 g−1) and mesoporosity (68.6%). As a result, the BN-SAC-3 shows highly enhanced electrochemical performance including a high specific capacitance of 304 F g−1, excellent rate capability (with 72.6% retention at 60 A g−1) and superior cycling stability (4.6% capacitance loss after 3000 cycles). After assembling the BN-SAC-3 into symmetric supercapacitor, it shows a specific capacitance of 258 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 76.4% retention at 40 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and delivers a maximum energy density of 24.3 W h kg−1 at a power density of 612.8 W kg−1 in 1 M TEABF4/AN electrolyte. This work provides a new strategy for the synthesis of multiscale porous ACs for high-performance supercapacitors or other energy storage and conversion devices and is expected to be applied on other biomasses for large-scale production.
