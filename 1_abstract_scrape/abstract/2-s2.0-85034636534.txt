This paper presents a multifunctional interface circuit for the battery-ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Both the voltage equalization of the battery banks and energy exchanging between two kinds of energy source will be realized, by using the appropriate control strategy. Thus the reliable work and the health of the battery bank can be maintained, and the ultracapacitor (UC) can keep in a good state of charge (SOC). The simulation results based on MATLAB/Simulink platform validate the effectiveness of the proposed multifunctional interface circuit for the HESS.
