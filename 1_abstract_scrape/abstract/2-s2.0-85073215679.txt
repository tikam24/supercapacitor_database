Abstract: Mn3O4@SWCNT nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized using potassium permanganate and hydrazine hydrate. The prepared composite was evaluated as electrode material in supercapacitors, and characterized by X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, surface area and pore size analysis. The cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were performed in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solutions. The specific capacitance at scan rate of 5 mV s–1 is 603.6 F g–1.
