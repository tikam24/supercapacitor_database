In order to overcome the disadvantages of long regulation time and large overshoot in the traditional marine diesel power main network under complex operating conditions, a hybrid energy storage system is added to the main diesel power network in this paper, the charge and discharge power of the battery and the supercapacitor are changed by the power optimization control strategy. Using MATLAB/Simulink to build the simulation model of marine diesel-storage main network system, the analysis and simulation results show that the overshoot and regulation time of marine diesel-storage main network are obviously reduced after adopting the power optimal control strategy of hybrid energy storage system, at the same time, the charging and discharging power of battery and supercapacitor can be adjusted automatically according to different working conditions.
