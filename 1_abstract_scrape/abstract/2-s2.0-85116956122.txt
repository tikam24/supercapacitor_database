Electrode materials play a vital role on the performance of supercapacitors. Hence, it is important to develop novel electrode materials with excellent properties. NiCo2O4 has the advantages of easy synthesis, low cost, abundant natural resources and high theoretical capacitance, and has been widely studied as novel electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, the low conductivity, small specific surface area and poor electrochemical stability of NiCo2O4 has seriously limited its application. In this review, we present a brief description of the structure of NiCo2O4 and the energy storage mechanism of supercapacitors. Furthermore, we review several synthetic methods of NiCo2O4 and current modification researches, including morphology modification, composite modification and imported defects. In the future, the research should focus on the environmental friendly and efficient preparation method, improving the electrochemical performance by doping or defects, increasing the working voltage window and exploring suitable electrolytes.
