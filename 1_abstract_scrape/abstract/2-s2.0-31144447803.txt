Mesopore nickel-based mixed rare-earth oxide (NMRO) and activated carbon (AC) with rich oxygen-contained groups were prepared as electrode materials in a supercapacitor using room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte. These electrode materials were characterized by XPS, XRD, N2 adsorption, SEM as well as various electrochemical techniques, and showed good properties and operated well with RTIL electrolyte. A 3 V asymmetrical supercapacitor was fabricated, which delivered a real power density of 458 W kg-1 as well as a real energy density of 50 Wh kg-1, and during a 500-cycle galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement, no capacity decay was visible. Such promising energy-storage performance was to a large extent ascribed to nonvolatile RTIL electrolyte with wide electrochemical windows and high stable abilities worked with both electrode materials.
