In this paper, an adaptive nonlinear control method based on Lyapunov function is proposed for fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) used in electric vehicles. The fuel cell (FC) acts as the main energy storage device, which is connected with a boost converter. And the supercapacitor (SC) acts as the auxiliary energy system, which is connected with a bi-directional DC-DC converter. Based on the two energy storage devices and connected converters, the integral system model is obtained. In the design process of the control scheme, the adaptive controller is utilized to solve the problems of external disturbance and uncertain parts in the system model. The Lyapunov based stability analysis is given to prove the convergence of the proposed control method. And the final simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.
