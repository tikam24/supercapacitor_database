The development of advanced electrode materials through structure engineering has attracted a huge interest for high-power and high energy-densities storage devices. Herein, a series of hierarchical Ni3SnxS2-x nanomaterials are synthesized using a feasible hydrothermal method, revealing an interesting structural evolution from Ni3S2 to Ni3Sn2 through Sn doping. The optimized Ni3SnxS2-x is evaluated as an electrode material for supercapacitors, achieving a high capacitance of 2377.78 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and excellent rate performance of 1567.78 mF cm−2 at 50 mA cm−2. These excellent properties can be ascribed to the synergetic effect of numerous electrochemical active sites introduced by Sn doping, as well as improved conductivity due to the hierarchical structure. In addition, the as-prepared Ni3SnxS2-x also exhibits higher-coercivity and lower-saturation magnetization. This work fully demonstrates an effective approach to prepare the functional electrode materials as energy storage devices.
