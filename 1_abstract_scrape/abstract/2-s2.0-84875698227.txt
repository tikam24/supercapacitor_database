We report on the successful synthesis of a graphene-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid architecture by a parallel chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of the two carbon allotropes. The carbon hybrid is a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure with tuneable architecture comprising vertically grown CNTs as pillars and a large-area graphene plane as the floor. The formation of CNTs and graphene occurs simultaneously in a single CVD growth that we describe as a synchronous synthesis method. Unique nature of the fabrication approach contributes significantly to the quality and composure of final nanohybrid. Detailed characterization elucidates the cohesive structure and robust contact between the graphene floor and the CNTs in the hybrid structure. The functionality of the synthesized graphene hybrid structure has been demonstrated by its incorporation into a supercapacitor cell. Our fabrication approach provides an attractive pathway for the fabrication of novel 3D hybrid nanostructures and efficient device integration. Copyright Â© 2013 Materials Research Society.
