This work describes a straightforward approach to the production of highly-performing and cost-effective C-based materials for energy storage application while proposing an original and effective method to the control of the final material morphology. Indeed, robust few-layer graphene-like and highly open-cell structures have been prepared by a modified chemical activation procedure starting from costless sugar/salt mixtures. The as-prepared C-samples ensure high ion-accessible surface area and low ion transport resistance, two key features for the fabrication of effective electrochemical double layer supercapacitors. A selected sample from this series exhibits high specific capacitance (Cg) (312 and 234 F g−1 at 0.5 and 50 A g−1, respectively, in 0.5 M H2SO4), particularly at high current density values, along with excellent cycling stability and Cg retention for increasing charge–discharge rates.
