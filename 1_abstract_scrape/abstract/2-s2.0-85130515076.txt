This successfully performed a facile one-way KOH impregnation strategy, to hierarchically prepare interconnected porous carbon and self-oxygen doped from Averrhoa bilimbi leaves waste, as binder-free electrode material (PCBLs) for high-quality symmetrical supercapacitor. 3D porous structure and surface area PCBLs-derived controlled by different KOH concentrated solution. KOH infiltrated into precursor as act activation agent to completely removed inorganic impurities, result high carbon content of 85.54–87.22% with oxygen functional group of 10.61–14.71%. The precursor impregnated at 0.5 mol/L possessed excellent micropores 87.69%, adjusting mesopores and appropriate amounts of oxygen doped of 14.71%. As a result, it performed high performance of symmetrical supercapacitor. Furthermore, the electrochemical performance was evaluated within a two-electrode system using a binder-free solid coin design in different aqueous electrolytes of 1 M H2SO4, NaOH, and Na2SO4, respectively. This indicated that the symmetric supercapacitor-based PCBL-5 had a high specific capacitance of 293 F g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 1.0 A g−1. It also showed impressive energy densities of 26.54, 21.85, and 16.12 Wh kg−1 in 1 M H2SO4, NaOH, and Na2SO4, at an optimum power density of 178.44 W kg−1. The observed desirable excellent material and electrochemical behaviors of the new source hierarchical porous carbon derived from Averrhoa bilimbi leaves waste would be a competitive candidate as electrode material in the development of high-quality supercapacitor devices.
