Because of their multiple chemical valence states, multi-element transition metal oxides can undergo reversible redox reactions between the different valence states during charging and discharging. However, the low electrical conductivity of transition metal oxides limits the rate of electron transfer. The combination of transition metal oxides with three-dimensional carbon substrate is a promising but extremely challenging strategy to prepare high specific capacitance, stable and environmentally friendly supercapacitor electrode materials. Here we report a facile one-step vapor deposition synthesis of network-like FeNb2O6 nanostructures directly growing on flexible carbon cloth (CC). The as-prepared FeNb2O6/CC composite has good electrical conductivity, and the network-like structure also makes it have large specific surface area. Resultantly, the composite exhibits an high specific capacity of 365.9 mAh g−1 at a current density of 2.5 A g−1. And at the current density of 25 A g−1, a specific capacity of 75.9 mAh g−1 can still be maintained.
