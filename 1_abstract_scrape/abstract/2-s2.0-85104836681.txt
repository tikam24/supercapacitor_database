Significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the sensitivity and working range of flexible pressure sensors to improve the precise measurement of subtle variations in pressure over a wide detection spectrum. However, achieving sensitivities exceeding 1000 kPa−1 while maintaining a pressure working range over 100 kPa is still challenging because of the limited intrinsic properties of soft matrix materials. Here, we report a magnetic field-induced porous elastomer with micropillar arrays (MPAs) as sensing materials and a well-patterned nickel fabric as an electrode. The developed sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 10,268 kPa−1 (0.6–170 kPa) with a minimum detection pressure of 0.25 Pa and a fast response time of 3 ms because of the unique structure of the MPAs and the textured morphology of the electrode. The porous elastomer provides an extended working range of up to 500 kPa with long-time durability. The sophisticated sensor system coupled with an integrated wireless recharging system comprising a flexible supercapacitor and inductive coils for transmission achieves excellent performance. Thus, a diverse range of practical applications requiring a low-to-high pressure range sensing can be developed. Our strategy, which combines a microstructured high-performance sensor device with a wireless recharging system, provides a basis for creating next-generation flexible electronics.
