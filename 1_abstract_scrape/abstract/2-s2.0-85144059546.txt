This paper describes a one-step carbonization technique using Ganoderma Lucidem spores (GLS) for three-dimensional helical rod-structured porous carbon (3D-HPC). The micromorphology, pore structure, and pore size distribution of the 3D-HPC systems were studied using a variety of techniques, including XRD, Raman Spectroscopy, FTIR, and FESEM. The electrochemical performance of the nitrogen-doped 3D-HPC/900 demonstrates a GCD process with a Csp of 242.6 Fg−1 at a CD of 2Ag−1. With a 10 mV/s scan rate, the CV curve has a Csp range of 377.12 Fg−1. Even after 4000 cycles, the SCs device maintains successful performance, with 84.5 % capacitance retention and 98.2 % coulombic efficiency. Additionally, the 3D-HPC/900 electrode has a high ED of 92.38 Whkg−1 and a PD of 1662.9 Wkg−1. Recent electrode advancements were confirmed by illuminating red LEDs for 1 to 1.5 min while dropping the voltage. This study proposed a novel carbon source that is environmentally friendly, low-cost, and simple to use, as well as a cost-effective and technologically novel approach for using environmental supercapacitor applications.
