Novel SmMn2O5 hollow long cuboids were synthesized via long time solvothermal route. The structural investigation of orthorhombic phase SmMn2O5 was associated by the predominant peak of (211) crystal plane. In depth analysis of band structure have been explored by the strong absorbance edge around 380 nm in UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-DRS) spectra and the calculated energy band gap was 3.22 eV from Tauc plot. The intensive investigation of electrochemical performance of novel SmMn2O5 hollow long nano-cuboids were revealed from cyclic voltammogram and the specific capacitance obtained was 256 F/g at 5 mV/s scan rate. The water oxidizing ability of the fabricated SmMn2O5 hollow long nano-cuboids electrode was examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) study at the maximum current density of 0.37 mA/g. The internal resistance (Rs) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) were respectively reported as 13 and 355 Ω with low Tafel slope value of 64 mV/dec. The stability of the fabricated novel SmMn2O5 hollow long nano-cuboid electrode was investigated through chronoamperometry (CA) study for 3 h with 100% retention of water oxidizing ability.
