The application of MOF materials in supercapacitors has been greatly restricted due to the poor conductivity and structural stability. Given that, this work improves the conductivity and stability of Ni-MOF by self-assembled strategy. We report here the Mo-doped Ni-MOF nanosheets (M-NMN), in which the Mo-based clusters are encapsulated in the holes of the Ni-MOF frame structure by self-assembly. The results show that the M-NMN-1 material with a Mi/Mo molar ratio of 1: 1 exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance. Furthermore, the nanosheet structure of the M-NMN-1 materials acts as a “superhigh way” for charge transport to accelerate charge transfer rate and enhance the conductivity of the electrode materials. As-prepared M-NMN-1 electrode material exhibits high specific capacity of 802 C g−1 at 1 A g−1. Furthermore, assembled battery-supercapacitor hybrid device exhibits an excellent energy density of 59 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 802 W kg−1, and superior cycle retention of 93% after 20,000 cycles.
