Carbon electrodes were deposited using atmospheric pressure plasma torch from the mixture of argon and acetylene gases on stainless steel substrates. SEM images show that when Ar/C2H2 ratio increases from 15 to 55, electrodes surface roughness decreases. Raman scattering spectroscopy results indicated that ID/IG ratio decreases from 1.64 to 1.24. The capacity values and stability voltage of fabricated supercapacitors were measured. It was observed that with the increase of ratio Ar/C 2H2 from 15 to 55, the capacity of supercapacitor increases from 16 mF to 36 mF. Meanwhile, the stability voltage of supercapacitor increases from 0.40 V up to 0.50 V with the decrease of the Ar/C2H2 ratio from 55 to 15.
