Lithium-ion capacitor is a hybrid electrochemical energy storage device, which combines the intercalation mechanism of lithium ion battery with the cathode of electric double-layer capacitor. To improve the energy density of hybrid Lithium-ion capacitor, a high-performance ion adsorption cathode is essential. Herein the porous activated carbon for using as cathode of hybrid Lithium-ion capacitor has been prepared through a two-step fabrication process in which naturally Chinese-chives are used as biomass carbon precursor. The biomass-derived porous carbon exhibits an extremely high specific surface area (3011 m2 g−1) and relatively applicable pore volume (2.6 m3 g−1). Besides, it displays excellent capacitive performance with specific capacity of 124 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.3 A g−1, good rate capability and outstanding cycling stability in organic electrolyte. The hybrid Lithium-ion capacitor is assembled using biomass-derived porous carbon as cathode material and the silicon/flake graphite/carbon nanocomposite as anode material. The hybrid device shows a high energy density of 159 W h kg−1 at 945 W kg−1 and outstanding cycle stability (with 80% capacity retention rate after 8000 cycles at 1 A g−1).
