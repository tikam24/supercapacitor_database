Hexagonal nickel-organic framework (Ni-MOF) [Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, 4-4′-bipyridine] is fabricated through a one-step solvothermal method. The {001} crystal plane is exposed to the largest hexagonal surface, which is an ideal structure for electron transport and ion diffusion. Compared with the surrounding rectangular crystal surface, the ion diffusion length through the {001} crystal plane is the shortest. In addition, the cross-linked porous mesh structures growing on the {001} crystal plane strengthen the mixing with conductive carbon, inducing preferable conductivity, as well as increasing the area of ion contact and the number of active sites. These advantages enable the hexagonal Ni-MOF to exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrode materials. In a three-electrode cell, specific capacitance of hexagonal Ni-MOF in the 3.0 m KOH electrolyte is 977.04 F g−1 and remains at the initial value of 92.34% after 5,000 cycles. When the hexagonal Ni-MOF and activated carbon are assembled into aqueous devices, the electrochemical performance remains effective.
