Hierarchical porous activated carbon (AC) was obtained by the carbonization of dried spinach leaves followed by activation with KOH. The product was characterized by nitrogen adsorption, FT-IR, FE-SEM and electrochemical tests. The AC has a dominant number of micropores, a medium number of mesopores and a few macropores with a specific surface area up to 2616 m2/g and a large number of oxygen-containing functional groups. The AC electrode exhibits a good double-layer capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 238 F/g in a 2 mol/L KOH electrolyte. A supercapacitor made of the AC has a high energy density of 10.1 Wh/Kg at a current density of 0.5 A/g and an excellent cyclic stability for 2000 cycles over a potential range from 0 to 1.2 V.
