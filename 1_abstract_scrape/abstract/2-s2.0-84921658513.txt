Ultrathin CeVO4 nanobelts were successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method. The thickness of a single nanobelt is about 2.4 nm, which can effectively shorten the ion diffusion and fasten the charge pathway. More importantly, ultrathin CeVO4 nanobelts and graphene are easily assembled as a flexible all-solid-state asymmetric device, which shows a highly flexible property and achieves a maximum energy density of 0.78 mWhcm-3 and a high life cycle of >6000 cycles.
