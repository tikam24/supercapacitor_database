The In-Wheel Motor (IWM), which is a driving system for Electric Vehicles (EVs) is effective for improving driving range or reducing vehicle weight. However, IWM has not been put to practical use because of a possibility of power line disconnection. Therefore, we proposed a Wireless In-Wheel Motor (W-IWM), in which Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is used to remove these lines and improve the practicability of IWM. In this paper, the advanced system of W-IWM, which has a Supercapacitor (SC) and circuit for dynamic charging on its wheel side, is proposed. Additionally, a power-flow control method is proposed to control the power-flow of multiple power sources in the system. The power-flow control method is verified by simulation and experiment.
