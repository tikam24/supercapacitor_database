Supercapacitors are the most advanced, promising, and emerging energy storing devices in the future energy technology. In recent times, rapid progress is made in the development of fundamental and applied aspects related to supercapacitors. Supercapacitors also tender exceptional power density and durability. As such supercapacitors are highly explored for large number of emerging energy storing technologies including mobile devices to address energy storage and harvesting. The testing techniques for supercapacitors due to high specific capacitance require constraints like time constants and as such require suitable adaptations and modifications of the conventional techniques and instrumentation to yield desired estimations. Consequently, the prime importance is paved in terms of developing the testing techniques to determine electrochemical characteristics of novel supercapacitor materials. In this contrast, various state-of-the-art techniques are developed to estimate electrical, thermal, charging/discharging behavior of supercapacitors. This chapter encapsulates the electrochemical techniques dedicated for parameter estimation pertaining to supercapacitors.
