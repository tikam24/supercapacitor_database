Porphyrin-based conjugated microporous polymers have shown the huge application potential in energy storage systems, but the low conductivity limits the practical applications. In this work, copper porphyrin-linked conjugated microporous polymer (CuTAPP-CMP) is synthesized. Then CuTAPP-CMP is combined with greatly conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by simple vacuum filtration strategy. The resulting CuTAPP-CMP/CNTs-3 shows the flexible property, which enables them to be the flexible electrodes for supercapacitors (SCs). Fortunately, the flexible electrode of CuTAPP-CMP/CNTs-3 shows the specific capacitance of 207.8 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 as well as long cycle performance over 3700 cycles at 20 A g−1. The good electrochemical properties could be due to the synergic action of the high conductivity of CNTs and the high pseudocapacitance of CuTAPP-CMP. Our work provides a way to open up high-performance organic electro-active materials for SCs.
