In this paper, an improved Predictive Torque Control (PTC) of a PMSM based on Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is developed for smooth torque operation in electric vehicle applications (EVs). The fuel cell presents the main source and it is complemented with a quick power source (supercapacitors). The embedded Grew Wolf optimizer is used to solve the torque tracking tasks with minimal oscillations at low speed operation of PMSM drive. The new PTC algorithm can successfully ensure smooth time evolution of the torque and the speed. The design methodology is detailed and the provided simulation results show that the proposed PTC-GWO can be implemented in simulink, offering high performance in both steady and transient states of the PMSM drives even at low speed range.
