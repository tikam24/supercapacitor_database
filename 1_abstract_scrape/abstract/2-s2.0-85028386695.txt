Hybrid vehicular power system is a complicated and nonlinear system, and its energy management strategy is one key factor for vehicle performance. The hybrid powertrain consisting of engine, Ni-MH battery and ultra-capacitor is designed, and the energy management strategy for a hybrid vehicular power system is proposed by Haar wavelet which makes vehicle power demand into high frequency and low frequency parts, then distributed among engine, Ni-MH battery and ultra-capacitor by genetic algorithm with the aim of reducing fuel consumption, therefore, improves the system performance and lengthens the service life of components. System modeling and simulation are conducted in Matlab, and the results show that this method of power distribution can meet the design requirements, and have better fuel economy compared to fuzzy control strategy.
