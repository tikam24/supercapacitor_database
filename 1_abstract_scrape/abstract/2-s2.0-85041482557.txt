This paper introduces a rational design and synthesis of three-dimensional (3-D) zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8) derived carbon/NiAl-LDH core-shell composite for high performance supercapacitor. The ZIF-8 derived carbon polyhedrons templated growth of LDH nanoplatelets gives rise to coexistence of micro/meso/macropores and optimized synergistic effect in the stable 3-D core-shell structure. Remarkably, the composite shows excellent capacitive performances originating from the considerable charge storage and electroactive species exposure as well as high ion diffusion rate. This work highlights the strategy of structure design in constructing composite materials with optimized synergistic effect, which greatly promotes the supercapacitor development.
