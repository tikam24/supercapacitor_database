A core/shell polyaniline (PANI)/MnO2 composite (denoted as “PANI@MnO2”) was prepared and evaluated as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. In the composite, α-MnO2 showed chrysanthemum-like and spherical structure, which were coated in situ with PANI. In this process, α-MnO2 serves as a scaffold and also acts as an oxidant to induce aniline polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy images clearly showed the core/shell structure of the PANI@MnO2 composite, which was further characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the thermo-gravimetric analysis illustrates that the composite has a good thermal stability and the mass ratio of PANI and MnO2 is 0.11. Electrochemical properties of the composite and its components were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectra and chronopotentiometry. The specific capacitance of the high-mass loading PANI@MnO2 electrode is 75 Fg−1, 1.1 times higher than that of MnO2 electrode (67 Fg−1), at a current density of 0.1Ag−1. Moreover, the composite electrode retains 90% of the initial capacitance after 3000 cycles, while this is only 75% for α-MnO2. The improved electrochemical performance may be attributed to the synergistic effect between PANI and α-MnO2.
