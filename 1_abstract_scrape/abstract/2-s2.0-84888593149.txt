We report an eco-friendly and one-step route for the chemical synthesis of hierarchical conducting polypyrrole (PPy) nanostructures via a reactive template of MnO2. The as-prepared PPy nanotubes are found to show good electrical conductivity and superior electrochemical properties for supercapacitor applications. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
