The hardware and software system, based on LabVIEW package, for electrical investigations of supercapacitors was developed. The system provides standard testing (cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge and discharge, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, etc.) of supercapacitors in the temperature range of 30 to 100Â° C and under pressure up to 3 bars. The effectiveness of the system was verified.
