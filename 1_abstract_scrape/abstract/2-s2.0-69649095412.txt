In this study, exfoliated graphite and a polyaniline (PANI)-graphite nanocomposite were developed from in situ polymerization of aniline. Graphite nanosheets were synthesized from expandable graphite. The PANI-graphite nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, the electrochemical measurements, such as cyclic voltammetric curves, showed that the conductivity of the obtained nanocomposite increased. Therefore, the supercapacitor behavior of PANI improves with adding graphite. Â© 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
