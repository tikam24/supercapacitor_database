N-enriched mesoporous carbon nanofibers (NMCNFs) were prepared by an electrospinning technique using graphitic carbon nitride (g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf>) nanosheets both as sacrificial template and N-doping source. The resultant NMCNF film has a high N-doping level of 8.6 wt% and a high specific surface area of 554 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. When directly used as the electrode material for supercapacitor, the free-standing NMPCNF film shows a significantly improved capacitive performance including a higher specific capacitance (220 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and a better rate capability (∼70% retention at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>) than those of microporous carbon nanofiber film prepared using the same process without using g-C<inf>3</inf>N<inf>4</inf> nanosheets (145 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup> and ∼45% retention at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>). Moreover, the NMCNFs show superior stability with only a ∼3% decrease of its initial capacitance after 1000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g<sup>-1</sup>. More significantly, the energy density of a symmetrical supercapacitor (SC) based on the NMPCNF film can reach 12.5 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 72 W kg<sup>-1</sup>.
