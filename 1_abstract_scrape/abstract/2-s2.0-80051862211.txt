Pure or hybrid electric vehicles require batteries with high capacity and long life under charges and discharges at high powers, and aluminum doped α-Ni(OH)2, which is actually a layered double hydroxide (LDH), can meet such requirements. It was found that [Ni4Al(OH)10]OH can be fully charged in less than 12 minutes under constant current densities or potentials, and it can discharge a capacity of 300+ mAh·g-1 even at a current density of 2000 mA·g-1. It can also restore some of its capacity after a gap from many strengthy discharges. However, the materials are not stable to concentrated KOH and electrochemical cycles, especially at high temperatures: it converts into β-Ni(OH)2. To commercialize this material, we found that some additives, such as Ca(OH)2, RE2O3, Zn(OH)2 can improve its stability. It is also possible to improve its performance by adding some supercapacitor materials.
