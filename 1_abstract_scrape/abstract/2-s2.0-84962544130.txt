Flexible solid-state supercapacitors attract more and more attention as the power supply for wearable electronics. To fabricate such devices, the flexible and economical current collectors are needed. In this paper, we report the stainless steel fabrics as the current collector for high-performance graphene-based supercapacitors. The stainless steel fabrics have superior properties compared with the widely used flexible current collectors. The flexible supercapacitors show large specific capacitance of 180.4 mF/cm2, and capacitance retention of 96.8% after 7500 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, 96.4% of the capacitance is retained after 800 repeating stretching-bending cycles. The high performance is related to the excellent conductivity, good mechanical flexibility, and high electrochemical stability of the stainless steel fabrics. The achievement of such high-performance and flexible supercapacitor can open up exciting opportunities for wearable electronics and energy storage applications.
