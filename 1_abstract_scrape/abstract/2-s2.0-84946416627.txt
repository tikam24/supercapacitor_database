Hybrid nanostructures with reliable electrochemical performances (e.g., high rate capability and long cycling lifetime) and low fabrication costs are attractive for extensive application for next-generation energy storage devices. Herein, based on the inexpensive commercial carbon black (CB), a ternary manganese ferrite/carbon black/polyaniline (MCBP) hybrid is designed and synthesized through a facile two-step approach. It is found that the synergistic effects in this strongly coupled ternary hybrid nanostructure can remarkably enhance the electrochemical performances, including the impressively high rate capability (∼98% capacitance retention at a current density of as high as 40 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (∼80% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 A g-1). A symmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using ternary MCBP hybrid, which presents excellent rate capability (over 94% capacitance retention at 10 A g-1) and long cycle life (∼75% capacitance retention after 100,000 cycles at 5 A g-1). Such a low-cost integrated ternary hybrid is a promising electrode material for commercial applications in supercapacitors.
