An efficient method for synthesis of polyaniline wrapped graphene aerogel/silver nanoparticles (PANi/rGA/AgNPs) has been successfully developed via a facile in situ one-pot hydrothermal method. The synergistic effect of the large surface area of rGA simultaneously with the high redox reaction of AgNPs and PANi, constituting a unique micro-nano framework structure, possesses the beneficial to rate capability and cycle stability. The assembled solid-state supercapacitors of PANi wrapped rGA/AgNPs can endow the specific capacitance of 365.14 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a high capacity retention of 88% after 4000 cycles at 1 A g−1.
