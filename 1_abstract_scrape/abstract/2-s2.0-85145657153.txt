In order to improve the capacitive performance of supercapacitors, NiMoO4 electrode materials were successfully prepared by a simple and low cost hydrothermal route, and the morphology, microstructure and properties of the materials were successfully optimized by adding reduced graphene oxide (rGO). Electrochemical and sophisticated physical property tests are used to examine the qualities of items. As a supercapacitor electrode material, the NiMoO4/rGO composite performed admirably. The specific capacitance reached 2056 Fg−1 at a current density of 2 Ag−1, which is greater than standard NiMoO4 at the same current density (788 Fg−1). After 1000 charge/discharge cycles, NiMoO4/rGO retains 91.1 % of its initial capacitance. NiMoO4/rGO composites can be used in asymmetric supercapacitors, and the asymmetric supercapacitor device offers a high power density (60. 2 Whkg−1) and energy density (750.5 Whkg−1) when used as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. A combination of mesoporous-NiMoO4 nanoparticles with a high specific surface area and good interaction with conductive rGO is responsible for the improved electrochemical performance of NiMoO4/rGO.
