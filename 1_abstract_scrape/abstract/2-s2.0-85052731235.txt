Porous carbon nanosheets with open 2D nanostructure have been considered a desirable and high-efficient energy-storage material. Herein, N, S, P co-doped interconnected porous carbon nanosheets (CPCNs) with high defect density and open 2D ultrathin nanostructure are prepared by using a cork-shaped soybean aerogel as carbon source. A reasonable design of the preparation technology controls the formation of the distinctive and ordered structure of intermediates during the synthetic process. The as-prepared CPCN material is made of interconnected nanosheets with a thickness of 4.9 nm and have a maximum N-dopant content of 5.83 at. % and a high specific surface area of 3586 m2 g−1. Due to the synergistic effects of the features, the CPCN electrode for supercapacitors has a high capacitance of 427 F g−1 with a long cycling stability of 97.42 % after 10 000 cycles. For lithium-ion batteries, the CPCN material also exhibits an excellent capacity of 1220 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 with a high rate capability and cycling stability. Moreover, a scenario through using CPCN to enhance the electrochemical performance of nano-inorganic material proves a high scalability in the application for the products.
