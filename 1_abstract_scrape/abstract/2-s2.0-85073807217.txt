In this case, RGO (graphene reduced load) aggregates (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene) were used to prepare basic films by chemical deposition method. Optimize electrochemical deposition (3, 4-ethylene dioxide) and rGO voltage Windows and electrolytes. SEM observation confirmed that PEDOT/rGO did synthesize the necessary composites. Electrochemical tests showed that the electrochemical performance of PEDOT electrode was improved by adding rGO. The mixed PEDOT/rGO electrode has a high specific capacitance (134 F/g, 0.8 mA/cm2).
