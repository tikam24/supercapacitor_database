Porous carbons were prepared by the carbonization of water soluble chitosan and they were then used to synthesize porous C/NiO composites. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption experinents were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the products. The results showed that the mesopore-rich composites consisted of NiO crystallites and porous carbon. The electrochemical properties of the porous C/NiO composites were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. We found that compared with porous carbon, the composites showed superior electrochemical capacitive performance. When the mass ratio of nickel to carbon was 2:20, the composite had a large specific capacitance of 355 F · g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A·g-1and excellent cyclability with a capacity retention of about 99%after 1500 cycles. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
