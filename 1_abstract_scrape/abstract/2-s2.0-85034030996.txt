Modular multilevel converter (MMC) receives wide acceptance in high power, high voltage applications. However, large capacity capacitors are needed in the sub-modules due to low frequency fluctuation power. The voltage fluctuation is even larger especially in the startup of Motor drive or low frequency output application. Besides, the integrated energy storage systems (ESS) in MMC is used for recovering the kinetic energy in motor drive. This paper investigates the feasibility of using the ESS to work as the energy buffer for the low frequency fluctuation energy in the submodule (SM) while achieving the energy storage function at the same time. Simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC prove the validity of the control strategy.
