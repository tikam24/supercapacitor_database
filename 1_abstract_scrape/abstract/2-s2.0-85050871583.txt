A series of proton-functionalized graphitic carbon nitride (fgC3N4) modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/nickel-aluminium layered double hydroxide (LDH) composites (fgC3N4-rGO/LDH-1 and fgC3N4-rGO/LDH-2) were prepared by a novel scalable strategy using different amounts of fgC3N4-rGO as a conductive matrix. The morphological analyses reveal that the LDH sheets are gradually assembled on the fgC3N4-rGO matrix. The fgC3N4-rGO and LDH mutually minimize their self-aggregation in fgC3N4-rGO/LDH composite. The porous skeleton of fgC3N4-rGO/LDH-1 (highest loading of fgC3N4-rGO matrix) produces a high surface area (240 m2/g) and mesopores (diameter; 2.2 nm). The fgC3N4-rGO/LDH-1 electrode generates a specific capacitance value of 1190 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate performance (71% at 10 A g−1), and good cycling stability (90% after 3000 cycles), in a three-electrode setup. Hierarchical fgC3N4 functionalized rGO composite (3D-fgC3N4@rGO) was used as a negative material. The 3D-fgC3N4@rGO produces an excellent capacitance of 345 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, high rate capability (74% at 10 A g−1) and good cyclic stability (90% after 3000 cycles). The fgC3N4-rGO/LDH-1 and 3D-fgC3N4@rGO were assembled to fabricate a solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device using KOH/PVA gel electrolyte. The device operates within the potential window of 1.6 V and produces the highest energy density and power density of 54.76 W h kg−1 and 12031.92 W kg−1, respectively. The solid-state device shows an excellent cycle life of 91% after 7000 cycles, and it can power a red LED, suggesting very efficient for practical application.
