Ag-doped NiO porous network structure grown on Ni foam has been synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. Then network structure is assembled by numerous interconnected superfine nanowires, and Ag is uniformly distributed in the body of NiO network. The unique porous network structure doped by conductive Ag and the direct integration of electrode materials on Ni foam current collector provide efficient pathways for electron transport and electrolyte ions diffusion. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the Ag-doped NiO electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 570.7 F gâˆ’1 and excellent cycling stability. The Ag-doped NiO electrode with relatively high electrochemical performance is a promising candidate for the supercapacitor electrodes. These results can also provide strategies to develop advanced electrode materials supercapacitor applications.
