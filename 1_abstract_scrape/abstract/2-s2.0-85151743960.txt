It took more than one century of research and development since the first discovery of fundamental theories on capacitance, before capacitor became a commercially available and viable solution in energy-related applications in the form of supercapacitor (SC). In this chapter, a few major highlights of the development of SC in the span of a few decades is provided. A brief introduction to the theories, properties and classes of SC are also described. As SC is gaining popularity in the research and actual implementation as energy storage device, the discussion emphasizes on the applications of SC in power grid and transportation. The utilization of SC as an energy buffer in the microgrid is discussed and the key properties of SC that make it suitable for power quality control is elaborated. In a smart grid, SCs can be used as short-term power supplies to critical facilities in sectors such as telecommunication and healthcare. In addition, the significance of SC in the railway industry is highlighted and implemented case studies are discussed. A comparative study of supercapacitor with other energy storage devices, such as batteries, fuel cells and other energy storage technologies is provided. The strengths and weaknesses of each energy storage system class are discussed. Based on the strengths of SC, the commercialization aspects and future perspectives of SC in high-power and low-power applications are also described.
