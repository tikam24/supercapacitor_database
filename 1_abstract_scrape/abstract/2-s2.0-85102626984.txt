Wireless power transfer (WPT) system is widely applied in the underwater environment. A multi-transmitter multi-receiver (MT-MR) WPT system is proposed in this paper for the application of the submerged buoy, and numbers of beacons can be charged at the same time to send more data. Both series and parallel connection structures of several coils are analyzed in detail. In order to increase the system efficiency at ultracapacitors charging process, a maximum efficiency tracking (MET) with a primary current controller (PCC) and an optimal resistance controller (ORC) is studied and designed. All above analyses are verified in a three-receiver WPT system prototype. When ultracapacitors are charged from 10V to 25V, the system efficiency is achieved at almost 70.5%, and the charging voltage of all three receivers can be stabled.
