The rapid development of wearable electronic devices has created a huge demand for flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors (FSSCs), and high-performance electrode materials for FSSCs are strong desired simultaneously. In this work, boron and nitrogen-doped carbon (BCN) anchored on active carbon fiber cloth (ACC) are specially designed and manufactured by immersing ACC in a mixed solution of urea, boric acid and polyethylene oxide-propylene oxide (P123) and then calcining, which can be used to assemble high-performance FSSCs as electrodes. The three-dimensional (3D) cross-linked network of BCN grown on the carbon fibers improves the transmission rate of electrons and provides abundant electrochemical reaction sites, which are conducive to the performance of supercapacitors. Thanks to this structural advantage, the ACC@BCN electrode exhibits an area specific capacitance of 1018 mF cm−2 and a volume specific capacitance of 535.8 F g−1 at a current of 1 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the symmetric FSSCs based on ACC@BCN show high energy density of 1.573 mWh cm−3 and power density of 128.7 mW cm−3, and the capacitance retention can still keep 89.5% even after 10,000 cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way for large-scale preparation of high-performance, high-stability electrode materials for wearable electronic devices.
