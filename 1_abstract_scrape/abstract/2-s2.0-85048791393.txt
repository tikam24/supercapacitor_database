With the increasing demand for IT infrastructure, powering IT equipment is one of the largest operating expenses for data centres. According to the data published by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), USA global data centres cloud power market is exploding at over 10 percent annually to an estimation of 200 billion kilowatt-hour by 2020. Enhancing the efficiency of the server power supply by at least 1 % could result in an astronomical savings of energy and expenditure. SCALDO is a patented technique developed at the University of Waikato to enhance the efficiency of LDOs. This concept can be used inside silver box power supplies to enhance the quality of output power. However, to practically realize above system, several switches need to be implemented. This paper discusses a novel concept to use SCALDO efficiently inside silver box power supplies.
