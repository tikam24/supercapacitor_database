A kind of phosphorus-doped composite was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method with poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) polymer (P123) as soft template, physic acid as phosphorus source and glucose as carbon source. The composite was then etched by KOH under high temperature to form a three-dimensional microporous structure. SEM and TEM observations shows a typical feature of multi-layer dense hierarchy of micropores with relatively large pores outside and micropores inside the composite, FT-IR and XPS analysis indicates a successful doping of P element. Electrochemical tests indicate that the P-doped porous composite has a further high specific capacity up to 235 F/g than the un-doped carbon materials which is only 182 F/g in 1 mol/L KOH. Besides, it retains excellent charge-discharge reversibility with high capacitance retention up to 90% even after 4 000 cycles. The electrochemical results demonstrate that phosphorus doping can obviously improve the hydrophilicity of electrode surface and pseudo capacitance, making it possess better electrochemical characteristics.
