A novel three-dimensional (3D) graphene/siloxene (GSE) hybrid membrane electrode was designed via flow-directed assembly followed by an in situ vapour reduction process. The prepared GSE membrane incorporated the benefits of two-dimensional (2D) lamellar siloxene and graphene sheets while overcoming their application limitations. Notably, the GSE membrane exhibited better electron migration and ion transportation abilities than a graphene membrane (GHE). GSE all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (ASSSs) showed a high specific capacitance (175.43 F·g−1 at 0.2 A·g−1), and an exceptional power density of 6000 W·kg−1, which corresponds to an energy density of 24.5 W·h·kg−1. The capacitance decline was negligible under different bending conditions, and superior capacitance stability was attained (97.5% of the initial capacitance was retained after cycling 10,000 times at 3 A·g−1). Therefore, the tuning strategy adopted herein demonstrates the potential of GSE for application in wearable and portable electronics.
