A graphene (GN)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs) nanocomposite electrode material were prepared via reduction of exfoliated graphite oxides in the presence of CNTs pretreated by mixed acid. The GN/CNTs nanocomposite characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrum (Raman) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) has a layered structure with CNTs uniformly sandwiched between the GN sheets, which efficiently decreased the agglomeration GN sheets. Electrochemical data demonstrate that the GN/CNT exhibited higher specific capacitance than that of graphene.
