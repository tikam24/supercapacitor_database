MoO 3 nanorods were synthesized through the microwave method and the nanocomposites of MoO 3 /activated carbon were prepared for supercapacitor and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The XRD pattern revealed that the prepared MoO 3 has a hexagonal phase (h-MoO 3 ). The as-prepared h-MoO 3 was composited with activated carbon (AC) and tested for supercapacitor studies. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibited an appreciable specific capacitance, power density, and energy densities. Further, dedoping of nitrogen in the doped AC creates defects on AC (DAC). These DAC/MoO 3 nanocomposites were prepared and tested for its electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reactions. DAC/MoO 3 nanocomposite showed much higher electrocatalytic activity than the neat MoO 3 . [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
