Copper molybdate (CuMoO4) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by microwave combustion method and urea act as the fuel. The formation of nanocrystalline structure was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The chemical composition of the CuMoO4 NPs was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) associated with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) was used to investigate morphological and elemental composition of the prepared sample. The morphology and particle size of sample were investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) analysis. The optical and electronic defects were confirmed by the UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy at room temperature (RT). The magnetic behavior was analyzed by vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis recorded at RT. The X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyze the chemical state of the elements in the prepared sample. The electrochemical behavior was examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge and discharge analysis (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The presence of redox pairs is showed in CV curves and along with the EIS data showed the supercapacitor nature. The GCD analysis displayed discharge curves and a high specific capacitance of ~ 127 F/g was acquired at a stable discharge current density (1 mA/cm2). The cyclic stability analysis showed capacitance retention of about 82.5% after 1000 cycles, proposing the potential application of CuMoO4 in energy storage devices.
