Two-dimensional (2D) metal carbides, MXene, present the promising application for the energy storage system. Among the MXene family, Ti 2 CT x as the lightest material, shows its unique electrochemical performance. Herein, Ti 2 CT x is synthesized by selective etching Al layer from the Ti 2 AlC. With the optimized HF treating condition, Ti 2 CT x displays high volumetric capacitance and remarkable rate ability. Moreover, the Ti 2 CT x //Ti 2 CT x symmetric supercapacitor is designed and assembled, which presents capable capacitance, outstanding rate performance and excellent cycling performance. The remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to its 2D structure and high electronic conductivity. This work demonstrates the potential application of the Ti 2 CT x for the supercapacitors and provides a template to design high-performance supercapacitors with 2D electrode materials.
