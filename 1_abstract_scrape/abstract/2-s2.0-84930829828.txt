To address the issue that RuO2 was difficult to deposit directly on the micro-3D-structure metal current collector due to its high deposition potential, this study was engaged to prepare RuO2 composite film by the fractional electro-deposition method. PPy/GO film was firstly deposited on nickel current collector as substrate, then RuO2 particles were deposited on the substrate after heat-treatment, finally the RuO2 composite film was carried on a second heat-treatment. By means of scanning electron microscope (SEM), it can be found that the porous structures of RuO2 composite film multiply with the increase of heat-treatment temperature, so that the pore structure of the membrane electrode is improved. By means of X-ray energy dispersive spectroscope (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS), the results indicate that there exists amorphous RuO2·xH2O in the film, which ensures the great specific capacity of the membrane electrode. The electrochemical testing results indicate that the electrochemical performance of membrane electrode is optimal when heat-treatment temperature reaches 105℃, with specific capacitance of 28.5 mF/cm2, energy density of 0.04 Wh/m2 and power density of 14.25 W/m2. The RuO2 composite film prepared by using step-by-step electro-deposition method is a type of excellent electrode material for micro-supercapacitor.
