The surfactant-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation of expanded graphite can produce graphene sheets in large quantities with minimal defects. However, it is difficult to completely remove the surfactant from the final product, thus affecting the electrochemical properties of the produced graphene. In this article, a novel approach to fabricate flexible graphene/polypyrrole film was developed: using surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a template for growth of polypyrrole nanofibers (PPyNFs) instead of removal after the exfoliation process; followed by a simple filtration method. The introduction of PPyNF not only increases the electrochemical performance, but also ensures flexibility. This composite film electrode offers a capacitance up to 161 F g-1 along with a capacitance retention rate of over 80% after 5000 cycles.
