In this paper, uniform TiO2 nanowires (TiO2 NWs) on reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanosheets were successfully synthesized by a simple and low-cost hydrothermal method. The high capacitance (202.5 F⋅g−1 at 1 A⋅g−1) and excellent cyclic stability (81.9% capacity retention after 5000 cycles) were achieved for TiO2 NWs-RGO nanocomposite as supercapacitor electrode. The excellent electrochemical performance is due to the synergistic effect of one-dimensional TiO2 NWs with chemical stability and RGO with excellent conductivity. Moreover, TiO2 NWs can effectively avoid agglomeration, shorten the ion diffusion length and greatly facilitate the charge transfer both at the contact interfaces and within the electrode materials during the electrochemical process. A symmetric supercapacitor was successfully assembled using the TiO2 NWs-RGO nanocomposite. It possesses a remarkable performance with a specific capacitance of 45.7 F⋅g−1, an energy density of 9.08 Wh⋅kg−1 at a power density of 598 W⋅kg−1 .
