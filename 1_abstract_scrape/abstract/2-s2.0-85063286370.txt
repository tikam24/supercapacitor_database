Hierarchically porous activated carbons with high specific surface areas are synthesized by chemical activation of the leaves of Schefflera octophylla. The specific surface areas of the materials are over 2300 m 2 g −1 and the specific pore volume is as high as 1.92 cm 3 g −1 . The optimized material achieves a high specific capacitance of 336 F g −1 in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 , and it also shows excellent cycling stability with 97.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g −1 . The simple synthesis route of hierarchically porous activated carbon from renewable bio-wastes enables a promising strategy in both reducing wastes and producing useful energy storage materials.
