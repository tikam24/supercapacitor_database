Nickel hydroxide consisting of loosely packed nanospheres was synthesized as positive electrode material for an asymmetric capacitor based on Ni(OH) 2 and activated carbon (AC). Two series of supercapacitors were fabricated to investigate the effects of the single electrodes of Ni(OH) 2 and AC on the electrochemical performance of asymmetric Ni(OH) 2-AC capacitor. Parameters including cell voltage window, specific capacitance and cyclic stability were assessed. In one series of supercapacitors, mass of Ni(OH)2 was excessive while mass of AC was varied, the AC electrode thus constrained both the capacitance and the upper limit of cell voltage. Deficiency of AC resulted in lower specific capacitance and narrower cell voltage window but benefited to cyclic stability. In the other series of supercapacitors, the mass of AC was excessive whereas the mass of Ni(OH)2 was changeable in each cell, Ni(OH)2 electrode thus dominated both the capacitance and the lower limit of cell voltage. As a consequence, deficiency of Ni(OH)2 led to higher specific capacity and wider cell voltage window as well as lower cyclic stability. These results can contribute to improving understanding of and optimizing performance of asymmetric Ni(OH)2-AC capacitor. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
