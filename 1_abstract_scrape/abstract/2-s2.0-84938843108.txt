In this paper, electric and hydraulic regeneration methods of recovering potential energy from an electro-hydraulic forklift truck are studied. Two similar forklift setups equipped with either electric or direct hydraulic energy storage are compared. In the first setup, the forklift lifting system is controlled directly with an electric servomotor drive. The servomotor drives a hydraulic pump capable of also operating as a hydraulic motor during lowering motion. In the second setup, the hydraulically operated forklift is equipped with an energy recovery system consisting of pressure accumulators for storing energy and a hydraulic digital valve package for precise leakage free flow control. This paper describes the arrangements of the experimental setups. The results of the proposed systems are then compared from the energy efficiency point of view. Energy-savings ratios for electric and hydraulic test systems were calculated for different fork velocities and payloads. Â© 2014 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.
