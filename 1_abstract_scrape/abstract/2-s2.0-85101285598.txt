A facile one-pot hydrothermal method is employed to synthesize {CNT–MnO2–Ni(OH)2} (CMN), {rGO–MnO2–Ni(OH)2} (RMN) along with a novel composite material{rGO–CNT–MnO2–Ni(OH)2} (RCMN). This paper first time reports reduced graphene oxide–multiwall carbon nanotube–manganese dioxide–nickel hydroxide rGO–CNT–MnO2–Ni(OH)2 quaternary composite powder as a supercapacitor electrode material. The as-obtained rGO–CNT–MnO2–Ni(OH)2 quaternary composite shows high specific capacitance (1906.4 F g−1) at 3 mV s−1. In addition, cyclic stability measurement reveals that RCMN composite retains admirable capacitance (92.5%) even after 10,000 cycles. The enhancement in cyclic stability and specific capacitance is attributed to the exclusive combination of rGO/CNT as a conductive network and MnO2/Ni(OH) 2 nanostructures as active materials which endorse effective charge transfer and expedites high capacitance and cyclic stability.
