Via a facile one-step chemical bath deposition route, homogeneously dispersed Mn3O4 nanoparticles have been successfully deposited onto the inner surface of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNAs). The content and size of Mn3O4 can be controlled by changing the deposition time. Field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis reveal the morphologies structures of Mn3O4/TNAs composites. The crystal-line structures are characterized by the X-ray diffraction patterns and Raman spectra. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further confirms the valence states of the sample elements. The electrochemical properties of Mn3O4/TNAs electrodes are systematically investigated by the combine use of cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The resulting Mn3O4/TNAs electrode prepared by deposition time of 3 h shows the highest specific capacitance of 570 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. And it also shows an excellent long-term cycling stability at a current density of 5 A g−1, which remaining 91.8% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. Thus this kind of Mn3O4 nanoparticles decorated TNAs may be considered as an alternative promising candidate for high performance supercapacitor electrodes.
