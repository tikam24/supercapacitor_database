The present study aims on carbonized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composite paper as electrode for supercapacitors. CNTs were synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and dispersed in water using SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfonate) as dispersant. Paper fibers were mixed with dispersed CNTs by speed-cutting procedure in water, and the composite paper was obtained by vacuum filtration, carbonized in vacuum furnace at 1460â„ƒ. The resultant composite paper was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor fabricated using this composite paper was tested by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance with 1 mol/L LiPF6 as electrolyte. The testing results indicated an excellent performance of the fabricated supercapacitor: a maximum capacitance of 105 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s, a specific energy of 22 Wh/kg and a specific power of 1.5 kW/kg at a discharge current of 12 mA.
