In this paper, a simple “one-step” route is introduced to prepare a kind of novel honeycomb-like hierarchical porous carbon (h-HPC) by carbonizing and activating garlic seeds. Due to its special microstructure, h-HPC shows excellent electrochemical properties and high supercapacitor performances. The experimental results reveal the following: (1) There exists an optimal condition for synthesizing h-HPC, i.e., 700 °C carbonization temperature and 1:1 mass ratio of KOH and garlic seeds. (2) h-HPC has a three-dimensional interconnected porous structure and exhibits a specific surface area as high as 1417 m2/g with a narrow pore size distribution. (3) When h-HPC is employed as an electrode material in supercapacitors, its specific capacitance reaches a value up to 268 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g and excellent rate capability. (4) The h-HPC-based symmetric supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 31.7 Wh/kg at a power density of 500 W/kg and retains 99.2% of the initial capacitance after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at 200 mV/s. When compared with similar works, these data are competitive, which demonstrates that the garlic-derived h-HPC is a kind of promising electrode material for the next-generation high-energy-density supercapacitors.
