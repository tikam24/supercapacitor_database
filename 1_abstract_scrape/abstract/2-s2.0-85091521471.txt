Recent developments of low-power electronic devices have triggered interests towards small-scale energy storage. One promising approach is to fabricate micro-supercapaciors (MSCs). In this work, we demonstrate a facile fabrication of MSCs by laser reduction and patterning of graphene oxide nanoribbon (GONR) thin films coated on poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate through LightScribe technique. We fabricated the in-plane geometry electrodes consisting of reduced GONRs (i.e., graphene nanoribbons, GNRs) with the lateral spatial resolution of approximately 20Î¼m in addition to the stacked geometry electrodes for comparison. The fabricated in-plane- GNR electrode device showed superior electrochemical properties compared with the stacked-GNR electrode ones. Our impedance measurements supported that this is due to high lateral ion diffusivity along the basal plane of GNRs. In addition, GNR-based in-planeelectrode device also showed a higher capacitance than the graphene-based one, which is due to the more efficient edge effects of GNRs.
