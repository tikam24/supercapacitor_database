In this study, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), polyaniline (PANI) and their composite (MoS2/PANI) were facilely preparedviaa liquid-phase method andin situpolymerization. An MoS2/PANI/functionalized carbon cloth (MoS2/PANI/FCC) was facilely constructed by a drop-casting method. MoS2/PANI-10/FCC displays remarkable electrochemical performances, and its specific capacitances varied from 452.25 to 355.5 F g−1at current densities ranging from 0.2 to 4 A g−1, which were higher than those of MoS2/CC (from 56.525 to 7.5 F g−1) and pure PANI/CC (319.5 to 248.5 F g−1), respectively. More importantly, the MoS2-10/PANI/FCC electrode has a long cycling life, and a capacity retention of 87% was obtained after 1000 cycles at a large current density of 10 A g−1. Moreover, the MoS2/PANI-10/FCC-based symmetric supercapacitor also exhibits excellent rate performance and good cycling stability. The specific capacitance based on the total mass of the two electrodes is 72.8 F g−1at a current density of 0.2 A g−1and the capacitance retention of 85% is obtained after 1000 cycles.
