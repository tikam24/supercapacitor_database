Porous carbon materials and metal oxides are the most favorite electrode materials for supercapacitors. Herein, we put forward a novel biomass-derived carbon and metal oxide composite which denoted as AGC@MnO2 (activated ganoderma lucidum spore-derived O and N co-doped nanoporous carbon and pompon-like MnO2 composite). When tested as electrode material, AGC@MnO2 exhibits an excellent capacity of 1324 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode system. Besides, AGC@MnO2 exhibits a high energy density of 43.75 Wh kg−1 at a low power density of 250 W kg−1 and an ultra-long cycling life of 92.3% retention after 5000 times charge and discharge at 20 A g−1. All of the electrochemical results indicate AGC@MnO2 is a potential and valuable candidate of electrode materials for supercapacitors.
