Hydrogen titanium oxide, H2Ti12O25 is prepared by soft chemical method. A fabricated asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor using an AlPO4 modified H2Ti12O25 anode shows electrochemical performance superior to a Li4Ti5O12 anode, including cycling performance. The anode comprised of H2Ti12O25 coated with 3 wt.% AlPO4 shows the energy and power density of 41.1 Wh kg-1, 194.1 W kg-1, respectively, at a current rate of 0.1 A g-1 as well as the highest cycling performance, with 94.1% specific capacitance retained after 1000 cycles at a current rate of 3.0 A g-1. These excellent results are convincing evidence that H2Ti12O25 should be regarded as one of the more promising anode materials.
