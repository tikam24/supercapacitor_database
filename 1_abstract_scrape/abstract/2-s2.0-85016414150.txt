A facile strategy of uniform flower-shaped binary-metal-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has been successfully synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method as the precursor of porous Mn2NiO4 nanostructures. After heat treatment at different temperatures, the as-prepared Mn2NiO4 inherits the morphologies of MOFs and can hold until 450ÂºC. This porous Mn2NiO4, used as supercapacitor electrodes, exhibits a high specific capacitance (531.5 F g-1 at a current density of 1.0 A g-1), with a relatively high specific surface area (114.2 m2 g-1). The high capacitance is mainly attributed to the porous and hierarchical structure, which facilitates fast diffusion of active ions, improves structural stability and large contact area between Mn2NiO4 and the electrolyte. The developed synthetic strategy may provide design guidelines for constructing advanced ternary nanostructured supercapacitors electrode.
