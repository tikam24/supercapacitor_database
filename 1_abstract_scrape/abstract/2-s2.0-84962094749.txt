Low-cost supercapacitors have the ability to rapidly store a large amount of charge, which makes them the best alternative to batteries in portable electronics. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of all-carbon supercapacitors using an organic electrolyte. By using ZIF-derived nanoporous carbon electrodes, we have realized a high-performance supercapacitor cell using 2 M NEt4BF4/PC as the electrolyte. Our device shows good energy storage capacity that is comparable to the other previously reported supercapacitors.
