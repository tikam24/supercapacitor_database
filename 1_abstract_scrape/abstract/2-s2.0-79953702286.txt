Nanostructured mesoporous manganese oxides were easily prepared by mixing KMnO4 with ascorbic acid in an aqueous solution under ambient conditions. The obtained manganese oxides were identified as having an α-MnO2 tunnel structure composed of an edge-shared network of [MnO6] octahedra. TEM observations revealed that the obtained MnO2 materials had three-dimensional frameworks which consisted of homogeneous nanoparticles with sizes of ca. 5 nm. Nitrogen sorption analyses showed that these MnO2 nanoparticles exhibited a type IV isotherm, indicating a mesoporous character. Large surface areas up to 284 m2 g-1 were recorded. The electrochemical performances of the synthesized α-MnO2 nanoparticles as supercapacitor electrode materials were studied using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling in a three-electrode system at a potential range from 0 to 1.0 V vs a saturated calomel electrode in 0.5 M sodium sulfate solution. The result showed that mesoporous MnO2 with three-dimensional frameworks exhibit a high capacitance up to ∼ 200 F g-1. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor was assembled by using MnO2 mixed with a small amount of activated carbon as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. By balancing the mass of MnO2 and activated carbon, a practical cell voltage of 1.8 V could be obtained in aqueous medium with a capacitance of 23.1 F g-1. After 1200 cycles, the maximum energy density is 10.4 Wh kg-1 and power density is 14.7 kW kg-1. Thus, the obtained αMnO2 nanoparticles are suitable for use as supercapacitor electrode materials. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
