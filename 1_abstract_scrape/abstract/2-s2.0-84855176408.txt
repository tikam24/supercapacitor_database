The combination of an electric double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and an "electrolyte charge storage system", which is a completely novel charge storage method, was investigated. We screened p-type and n-type active materials and selected acetylferrocene for the former and 1, l'-diheptyl-bipyridinium bis (tetrafluoroborate) for the latter. As a result, our capacitor effectively used the redox reactions of active materials dissolved in the electrolyte to increase its charge capacity. Self-discharge caused by the shuttle effect of active materials was almost suppressed using an anion-exchange membrane separator.
