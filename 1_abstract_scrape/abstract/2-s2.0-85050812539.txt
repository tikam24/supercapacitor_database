Mixing room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) may optimize electrolyte properties for the better performance of electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs). To understand the composition effects, we theoretically investigate the potential window, interfacial structure, capacitance, and energy density of RTIL mixtures consisting of one common cation and two anions of different sizes. A combination of quantum density functional theory (QDFT) and classical density functional theory (CDFT) calculations indicates that the electrolyte composition has significant effects on the EDL structure and potential of zero charge, thereby altering the integral capacitance and electrochemical potential window. The two quantities can be optimized together to achieve the best EDLC performance.
