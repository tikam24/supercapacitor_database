With the development of wearable electronic devices towards flexibility, safety, and functionality, supercapacitors are required to simultaneously possess satisfactory energy density and flexibility. Although the environmental friendliness, high theoretical capacity and tunable structure of CuS, the instability of their corresponding compounds on the flexible substrate as well as its poor conductivity limit its development. To address these issues, a pea-like hollow CuS nanoparticle structure is fabricated on the surface of carbon fiber with Cu plating, and a novel kind of flexible electrode named CPCC@CuO@CuS-H is synthesized. The inner copper plating of the electrode brings good electronic conductivity, and the hollow structure effectively improves the charge diffusion ability. CPCC@CuO@CuS-H has ultra-high mass specific capacity of 1387.1 F g−1 in an electrolyte of 2.0 M KOH solution under 2 A g−1. Moreover, the construction of disulfide bond in electrode can effectively improve the stability of hollow structure. The electrode has satisfactory rate performance and long cycle life at an ultra-high current density of 20 A g−1. Especially, by assembling a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor (CPCC@CuO@CuS-H//CC@AC), the operating voltage closes to 1.8 V, and the energy density achieves the aim of 139.5 Wh kg−1 when the high-power density is located at 1800 W kg−1, with 82.9% electric capacity retaining after 10000 cycles, showing its promising potential in flexible devices.
