Aiming at the laser ignition of B/KNO3 pyrotechnic mixtures based on super-capacitor driven laser, a laser ignition model from super capacitor driven laser diode to laser irradiation heating agent is established. The influence of discharge voltage, super capacitor capacitance and equivalent resistance on laser ignition delay is analyzed. The simulation results show that with the increase of the discharge voltage and capacitance of super capacitor and the decrease of the equivalent resistance of super capacitor, the laser output power and energy are significantly increased, the delay time of laser ignition is shortened and the ignition energy decreases significantly. The simulation results can provide the basis and technical support for the laser rapid ignition design based on super capacitor.
