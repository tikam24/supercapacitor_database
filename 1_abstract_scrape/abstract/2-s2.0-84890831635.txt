The use of hybrid electrodes prepared from phosphotungstic acid (H 3PW12O40, PW12) and activated carbon (AC) allows the fabrication of highly durable aqueous supercapacitors operating at a superior voltage (1.6 V) thanks to the high overpotential of PW 12 towards H2 generation. The combination of the double-layer capacitance plus the redox activity of the polyoxometalate clusters leads to an intrinsic increase in specific capacitance (from 185 F g -1 for AC to 254 F g-1 for AC-PW12) and a 60% increase in the operating voltage (compared to conventional AC supercapacitors with aqueous electrolytes, e.g. 1 M sulphuric acid). The hybrid energy storage mechanism and the increased operating voltage converge to yield improved specific energy and power. Moreover, the hybrid AC-PW12 electrode material showed an outstanding stability even after 30000 cycles (0 to 1.6 V) with 98% retention of the initial capacitance, much superior to the stability of the parent supercapacitor based on plain AC under the same conditions.
