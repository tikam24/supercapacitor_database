Benefiting from their pronounced electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacity, metal selenides are considered as promising cathode materials for assembling battery-supercapacitor hybrid devices (BSH). However, the limited reaction centers, long electron and ion transmission paths and fragile structure lead to their electrochemical performance far away from actual application. Herein, nanocrystals assembled flower-shaped Ni1-xCoxSe2 is synthesized for the first time via a facile method, which is demonstrated as an advanced battery-type cathode material. The introduction of Co atom can not only modulate the morphology of Ni1-xCoxSe2 to expose more active sites, but also enhance the conductivity and structural stability, and thus improved electrochemical reaction kinetics and cycling stability are realized. The electrochemical experimental results demonstrate the Ni0.8Co0.2Se2 delivers optimal specific capacity of 130.7 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, good rate capability and satisfactory cycling stability (81% capacity retention after 5000 cycles). Moreover, the assembled Ni0.8Co0.2Se2//AC aqueous hybrid device also displays a high energy density of 45.6 Wh kg−1 at 414 W kg−1 and an excellent cycle lifespan with 83.6 % of capacity retention after 5000 cycles, outperforming recently reported Ni-Co-Se based devices. This work gives rational guidance towards the exploration of nanocrystals assembled advanced structure with high electrochemical performance.
