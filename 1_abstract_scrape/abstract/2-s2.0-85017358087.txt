The redox reaction between KMnO4 and Ni was carried out on a chain-like Ni surface under hydrothermal conditions and γ-MnO2 nanosheets were produced through this facile route. The original Ni nanochains, as cores, dominated the final morphology of the composites with MnO2 nanosheets loaded on their surface. The uniform assemblies of MnO2, with large amounts of exposed sites, allowed them to be good candidates for application in various fields. The reduction of 4-nitrophenol by NaBH4 was selected as model reaction to test the catalytic activity of the samples and the samples could also be made into electrodes for supercapacitor measurement. Both the results revealed the advantages of the γ-MnO2 assembled on the Ni chain surfaces. Furthermore, the magnetic cores facilitated the recycling of the sample and increased the stability upon charge–discharge cycles.
