A high thermal flexible supercapacitor for mobile robot has been fabricated from Poly-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (PVP) with carbon aerogel hybrid electrodes in 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte. The carbon aerogel prepared from phenol formaldehyde resin and it was mixed with PVP followed by thermal treatment. The obtained PVP/aerogel was systematically characterized using HRTEM, XRD and CV for their morphology, surface area, crystallinity, chemical composition and electrochemical behaviours, respectively. The distinctive assembly pointedly improves the conductivity of composite films, which is a vital constraint in pseudocapacitors. The hybrid film with optimal carbon content, while realistic as an electrode, showed good capacitive activities in 1% of [BMIM]+BF4- electrolyte. The fabricated supercapacitor exhibited excellent rate capacity, with 70% of the original capacitance retained when the scan rate was increased from 5mVs-1 to 500 mV s-1. This film maintained 50 % of energy density (0.46mWhcm-3) under high power density (184.2Wcm-3 up to 150C temperature. These types of electrodes could support supercapacitor based energy storage systems to be very attractive for a variety of high thermal storage device for mobile robot and its applications.
