Here we report on a novel supercapacitor electrode based on IrO2-Ta2O5 nanoparticles supported on WO3 nanoplatelets. The nanoplatelets were directly grown on a W plate using a facile hydrothermal method, whereas the IrO2-Ta2O5 nanoparticles were formed via a thermal decomposition technique which can be easily scaled up. The structural, morphological, and electrochemical properties of the WO3 nanoplatelets and the formed trimetallic oxide nanocomposite have been investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and charging/discharging techniques. The fabricated trimetallic oxide nanocomposite exihibited rectangular cyclic voltamograms even tested at high potential scan rates, a high specific capacitance and high charging/discharging stability, promising utilization in the design of high-performance devices for energy storage.
