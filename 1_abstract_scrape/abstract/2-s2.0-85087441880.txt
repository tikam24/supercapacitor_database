In this paper, using a low-cost paper fiber (PF) as a substrate, eigenstate polyaniline–coated PFs with graphene (GO/PANI/PF) ternary materials were synthesized by using the chemical oxidative polymerization method. Electrochemical measurements showed that the GO/PANI/PF electrode exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance compared with the PANI electrode. By adjusting the ratio of PANI and PF, the as-prepared GO/PANI/PF–2.5% electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance 937 F g−1 at current density 1 A g−1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, and 74.5% retention of initial capacitance after 2000 charge–discharge cycles at 5 A g−1. The symmetric capacitor on the basis of GO/PANI/PF nanocomposite delivers a superior energy density of 10.12 Wh kg−1 at 456 W kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1.
