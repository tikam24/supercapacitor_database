Supercapacitors (SCs) are one of the sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies, and have attracted widespread attention and great deal of research due to high power density, long cycle life and stability, and reliability. The energy storage performance of SC depends on the electrode materials, which determine the energy storage mechanism, the theoretically capacitance, and other important performance parameters. In this review, we gathered different electrode materials, including the carbon-based materials, metal oxides, metal hydroxide, conducting polymers and their derivative materials, pointed out of their characteristic and merit/demerit in SCs, and illustrated the general strategy in designing high-performance electrodes. And this chapter would review the preliminary exploration and provide guidance for design and synthesis electrode materials with high energy storage performance.
