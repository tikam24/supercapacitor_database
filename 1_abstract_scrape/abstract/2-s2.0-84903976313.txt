Supercapacitors have been emerged as an important energy storage device, owing to their high power density, excellent cycle ability, fast charge-discharge processes and low self-discharging. In this work, we have developed a facile soft- Templated hydrothermal procedure to produce hollow mesoporous carbon spheres, which can deliver a relatively high capacitance (∼190 F/g) and an energy density of ∼26.38 Wh/kg at the discharging current of 1 A/g. The hollow cavity and micropore volume are shown to be the main factors that contribute to the good capacitive behavior. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
