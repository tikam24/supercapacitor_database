The switching device voltage stress of traditional two-level DC-DC converter is high, and the output current ripple is big. Used a three-level bi-directional DC-DC converter to control super-capacitor energy flow, which improves the super-capacitor charge/discharge efficiency and input voltage level. Analyzed the three-level bi-directional DC-DC converter working principle and control strategy, a simulation platform is built by Matlab/Simulink, which verify three-level bi-directional DC-DC converter topology advantages, meanwhile realizes the control of the DC net voltage, flying capacitor voltage and super capacitor charge/discharge current; finally, the prototype experiment illustrates the rationality and effectiveness of the converter and its control strategy.
