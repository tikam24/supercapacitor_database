Monolithic electrochromic supercapacitors (ECSs) have attracted increasing interest in recent electrochemical electronics due to their simplicity and unique ability to visually indicate stored energy levels. One crucial challenge for practical use is the improvement of shelf-life. Herein, zwitterionic (ZI) ionogels are proposed as effective electrolytes to reduce the self-discharging decay of ECSs. All-in-one ZI electrochromic (EC) gels are produced by one-pot sono-polymerization. The presence of ZI moieties in the gel does not affect the EC characteristics of chromophores. In addition, excellent capacitive properties in areal capacitance and coulombic efficiency are presented owing to the alignment of ZI units under an electric field and the formation of ion migration channels where rapid ion transport is allowed. Furthermore, the shelf-life of the ZI gel-based ECS is significantly improved by adjusting the interaction between polymeric gelators and ion species. The ZI gel-based ECS is expected to be a key platform for future smart energy storage devices.
