Films of polypyrrole/graphene on titanium mesh were prepared by electrochemical reduction of the fresh dried foam films of graphene oxide followed by an electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole. The as-obtained composite had highly surface area, conductivity, and could be used as the electrode for supercapacitors, especially directly used as the active materials in free of binders while the Ti mesh worked as the collector. Plenty of polypyrrole nanoparticles formed on the surface of reduced graphene film, and some fiber-like aggregates could be formed during the polymerization, which worked as the material for pseudo-capacitance. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitor reached 400 F/g and showed high stability with retaining capacitance of 82% after 5000 cycles, indicating that the nanocomposite is a suitable active material for supercapacitors.
