Hollow transition metal sulfide hybrid nanostructures offer promising potential materials for electrochemical water splitting and energy storage applications. Herein, we demonstrate the rational design of hollow structured NiCo2S4@C3N4@VS2 hybrid nanostructures for asymmetric supercapacitor and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through an efficient step-by-step strategy, ultrathin VS2 nanosheets were vertically grown on C3N4 coated NiCo2S4 hollow nanospheres to form NiCo2S4@C3N4@VS2 hybrid nanostructures. Benefiting from intriguing morphological features and conductivity, NiCo2S4@C3N4@VS2 hybrid nanostructures exhibit a large specific capacitance 1984.1 F/g at 1 A/g, superior rate capacity (91.5% at 5 A/g) and outstanding durability (retaining 88.4% over 5000 cycles at 5 A/g). Moreover, the NiCo2S4@C3N4@VS2//AC asymmetric supercapacitor device provides a large energy density (31.7 Wh/kg), remarkable power density (711.1 W/kg) and superior cycle life (retention of 91.2% after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the hybrid nanostructures manifest enhanced electrochemical activity as electrocatalysts for HER process with small Tafel slope of 71.8 mV dec−1, excellent overpotential of 110 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and remarkable stability. Thus, the NiCo2S4@C3N4@VS2 hybrid nanostructures can hold excellent potential for advanced asymmetric supercapacitor and alkaline HER electrodes.
