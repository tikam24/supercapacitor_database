Although MnFe2O4 is regarded as superior supercapacitors (SCs) electrodes in aqueous electrolytes owing to its diatomic synergistic effect and electron-occupied states at Fermi level, researches on MnFe2O4 electrodes for ionic liquid (IL)-based SCs which can easily achieve high energy densities, are still hindered because of mediocre interfacial electrochemical behaviors of MnFe2O4 electrodes in IL electrolyte with high viscosity. Herein we propose a 3D space-confined MnFe2O4 electrode (denoted as 3DSC-MFQDs) and conduct in-depth research on its interfacial electrochemical behaviors in high-voltage IL electrolyte. The formation mechanism of the Stern/diffusion layer of IL ions near electrode surface has been studied for the first time. Investigation of potential-driven ion accumulation deeply elucidates strong characteristic adsorption between IL ions and electrode with abundant active sites which can easily overlap with the electron cloud of positively charged imidazole rings of EMIM+ cations. Stronger adsorption improves the interfacial electrochemical behavior of 3DSC-MFQDs (high diffusion coefficient of 3.374 × 10−8 m2/s), providing highly-reversible redox reaction of 3DSC-MFQDs and thus leading to durable structures of 3DSC-MFQDs electrode. On this basis, flexible SCs (FSCs) with high energy/power density based on ionogel electrolyte are fabricated and act as efficient flexible energy storage devices for practical applications.
