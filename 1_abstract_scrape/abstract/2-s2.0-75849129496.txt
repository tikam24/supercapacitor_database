Polyaniline/MC (mesoporous carbon) composite was synthesized by in situ chemical polymerization method and was used as a new electrode material for supercapacitor. The composite was characterized by N2 adsorption and scanning electron microscope. The electrochemical capacitance performance of the composite was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests with a three-electrode system in a 10 wt% H2SO4 solution. The polyaniline/MC composite electrode shows much higher specific capacitance than pure MC electrode, which is attributed to the incorporation of polyaniline onto the pore surface of MC.
