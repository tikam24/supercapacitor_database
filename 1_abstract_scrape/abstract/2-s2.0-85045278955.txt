The service life of the super capacitor is very sensitive to the temperature. In order to obtain the optimization strategy of forced convection heat dissipation for super capacitor energy storage power, the main factors affecting the efficiency of forced convection heat dissipation are analysed based on the heat transfer theory, and the main direction of heat dissipation optimization are determined. The numerical heat transfer calculation model is established by the method of computational fluid dynamics. The internal flow field and temperature field distribution characteristics of super capacitor power supply are analysed. And the influence of cold air volume flow rate, air outlet layout and super capacitor heat dissipation structure on the heat dissipation effect is calculated and compared. The results show that the super capacitor heat dissipation structure and air outlet layout are most obvious to the improvement of heat dissipation. The maximum temperature of super capacitor is reduced to 32.62 °C from 68.69 °C through optimization in the same ventilation air volume flow rate and temperature. The improvement effect is very obvious.
