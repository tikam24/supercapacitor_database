A low molecular weight gel electrolyte was formed by the self-assembly of a low molecular weight gelator in KOH aqueous solution and first used as electrolyte in the supercapacitor. When the temperature was below 70 °C, the gel electrolyte was solid-like. The electrochemical characteristics were investigated by impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge cycle tests. As a result, the activated carbon supercapacitor with the low molecular weight gel electrolyte was found to exhibit higher specific capacitance (158.8 mA h g-1) than that with the 6 M KOH aqueous solution (156.6 mA h g-1) after 150 cycles. Therefore, the low molecular weight gel electrolyte had good electrochemical properties while solving the problem of solution leakage. It was indicated that the low molecular weight gel electrolyte was a novel electrolyte for supercapacitors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
