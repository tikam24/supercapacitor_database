In order to solve the problem that the existing Rubber-Tyred Gantry (RTG) Crane consumes massive generating/braking energy through resistance, produces plenty of heat, causes excessive fuel consumption and exhaust emission during working, the relation of energy flows of the existing system is analyzed and the value of the improvement of energy saving is confirmed in the paper. Firstly, the constitution and principle of the RTG energy saving system are proposed. In addition, the topology and principle of the bi-directional DC/DC converter are anatomized. Thirdly, after analyzing a model for supercapacitor voltage equalization strategy, a voltage equalization method for RTG energy saving system is proposed, namely active voltage equalization method, and design of active voltage equalization circuit parameters and control strategy are given. Finally, simulation analysis of the series connection of supercapacitors module is performed. Â©2010 IEEE.
