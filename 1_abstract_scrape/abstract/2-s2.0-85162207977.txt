Ongoing rapid depletion of global energy attributed to the improvement of immaculate and renewable energy sources become indispensable. To face the challenge of this energy caused by those newly introduced molecules, nanotechnology comes up with new frontiers in engineering and material science especially carbon nanomaterials as it has capability of efficient energy storage and conversion. Graphene as a novel 2D nanomaterial has great potential with many remarkable applications and also graphene-based assemblies are put forth in the area of research owing to its inherent physicochemical properties as well as an optimistic material. It has several applications like conversion of energy and storage of energy. This book chapter thoroughly goes through the development and progress of graphene and graphene-based material in the field of research for the improvement of energy storage equipment, such as supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and energy-conversion devices, including solar cells, fuel cells. Various structures and modified mechanisms are expected just to increase the potentiality of graphene-based material, that is, to increase their capacity of storing energy and conversion, respectively. The advantages, challenges, and limitation of graphene-based materials, when they are being utilized in different energy-related aspects in terms of storage and conversion, have also been focused in this book chapter.
