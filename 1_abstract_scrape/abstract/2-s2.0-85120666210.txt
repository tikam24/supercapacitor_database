The electrolyte used, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. It is known that the concentration of electrolyte is also a controlling parameter for a given active material where the performance will be optimum for a particular concentration. Herein, we report a study on the effect of electrolyte concentration on the electrochemical performance of reduced graphite oxide–potassium hydroxide supercapacitor. The supercapacitor achieves a maximum specific capacitance of 232 F g−1 in 6 M KOH with energy and power density values of ~21 Wh kg−1 and ~400 W kg−1, respectively. The kinetics of charge storage reveals that the combination of surface phenomenon and intercalation process leads to maximum specific capacitance.
