Control of the pore structures of carbon aerogels (CAs) was investigated by changing the sol-gel polymerization and activation conditions. The morphologies and physical properties of the CAs and KOH activated carbon aerogels (ACAs) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and N2 adsorption isotherms. The electrochemical performances of the CAs and ACAs as electrode materials were characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV), a galvanostatic charge-discharge test, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that the well developed three-dimensional nano-network structures and the reasonable pore size distributions of the CAs have great effect on their electrochemical performance in supercapacitors. Because of abundant mesopores and a high specific surface area (1480 m 2·g -1), the specific capacitance of a ACA electrode in 6 mol·L -1 KOH electrolyte was approximately 216 F·g -1 at a scan rate of 100 mV·s -1. A simple model was used to investigate the role of the pores in electrochemical performance. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.
