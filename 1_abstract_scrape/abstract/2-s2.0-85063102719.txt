Fabrication activated carbon/PANi electrode from coconut shell was successfully made using the simple heating method. Polymerization of PANi using chemical polymerization method showed the oxidation form was emeraldine salt. The highest specific capacitance was 289 F/g at the 1 mV/s for the 18 wt% of PANi. The stability of the electrode cycle of activated carbon/PANi lasted up to 20 cycles with a decrease of the capacitance value of 21.9%. The stability of this cycle indicates that the electrolyte accessibility is good. Alloys of activated carbon and PANi have been shown to strengthen the stability of PANi. Activated carbon has good cycle stability and PANi has good conductivity so that these two materials contribute to each other.
