Carbon-based materials, as electrodes for supercapacitors, have attracted tremendous attention. Therefore, nitrogen-doped porous carbons (NPCs) were prepared through a facile carbonization/activation strategy by treating different mass ratios of melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin and KOH. It is clearly demonstrated that because of the introduction of KOH, the resulting NPCs were shown to have increased specific surface area and a rich pore structure, and the best sample possessed a large specific surface area of 2248 m2 g-1 and high N content, which contributed to the good electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Accordingly, a three-electrode system assembles NPCs as an electrode using aqueous KOH solution; the specific capacitance was 341 F g-1 under the current density of 1 A g-1 and retained a specific capacitance of almost 92% after 5000 cycles. The maximum energy output for a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor with NPCs as the electrode material was 9.60 W h kg-1 at 1 A g-1. NPCs have promising applications on high-performance supercapacitors and other energy-storage devices.
