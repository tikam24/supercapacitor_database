Nano-sized insoluble iron, cobalt and nickel hexacyanoferrates (Mhcf) were prepared by a simple co-precipitation method. The potential of using these materials for supercapacitor was examined by cyclic voltammogram and constant charge/discharge. Due to the different types of the second metal (M), the Mhcf electrodes showed different electrochemical capacitive performances. The specific discharge capacitances of Fehcf, Nihcf and Cohcf electrodes at the current density of 0.2 A g-1 were 425 F g-1, 574.7 F g-1 and 261.56 F g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, the Mhcf electrodes showed good cyclic performance. Â© 2008.
