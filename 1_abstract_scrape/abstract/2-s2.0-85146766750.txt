Nowadays, supercapacitors have been among popular electrochemical energy storage devices in modern life. Plenty of active materials have been investigated and developed to meet the increasing demands for high-performance supercapacitors. In this study, we introduce a facile chemical synthesis route in combination with a subsequent calcination process to fabricate the oxide/hydroxide composites of nickel (Ni) and copper (Cu) as active materials for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors. Effects of the composition and calcination temperatures on the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors have been investigated systematically. The optimum composite was the sample calcinated at 200 Â°C and containing nickel hydroxide and copper oxide with a molar Ni/Cu ratio of 1:1. At a specific current of 1 A.g-1 the composite electrode could offer a high specific capacitance of 684.2 F.g-1. In addition, at the higher specific current of 3 A.g-1 the electrode supplied a relatively high specific capacitance of 526.3 F.g-1 for the first cycle. After long-term test of 1000 cycles of charge-discharge, the electrode maintained 91.7 % of the initial specific capacitance. This suggests the high application potential of synthesized optimum composite for supercapacitors.
