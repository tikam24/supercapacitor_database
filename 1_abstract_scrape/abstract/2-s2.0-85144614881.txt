As a new type of energy storage device, aqueous zinc-ion capacitors (AZICs) have excellent performance, such as high power density, high energy density, long cycle life and high safety.AZICs have a high application prospect in the field of civil electronic equipment and military electrified weapons and equipment, and are expected to become a new generation of energy storage scheme instead of lithium-ion batteries.In this paper, the recent advances of carbon-based materials for zinc ion capacitors, such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene and biomass derived carbon were summarized.The zinc ion storage performance of MXenes was analyzed in detail, and the energy storage mechanisms of transition metal oxides were revealed.It is pointed out that developing the cathode materials with high capacity, high voltage tolerance and low temperature adaptability is of great importance.
