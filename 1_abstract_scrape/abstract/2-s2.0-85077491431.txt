An advanced electrode of supercapacitor was prepared by electrochemically depositing MoS2 into TiN nanotube arrays (NTAs) on a Ti mesh substrate. The morphologies, structures and properties of these samples were measured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical characterization. The results demonstrate that MoS2 is successfully electro-deposited into TiN NTAs, and their specific capacitance increases firstly and then decreases with the deposition pulse times. The sample with 900 pulses possesses the highest specific capacitance of 353.2 F/g at 0.6 A/g and the lowest internal resistance of 2.195 Ω and interface resistance of 0.005 Ω. Its retention of specific capacitance is 63% after galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles for 700 times at a current density of 0.8 A/g. All the results indicate that incorporating MoS2 into TiN NTAs is a promising supercapacitors electrode material.
