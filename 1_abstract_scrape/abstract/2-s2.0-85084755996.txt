In this study poly(carbazole) films deposited on stainless steel have been investigated as electrode material for supercapacitor applications. Poly(carbazole) films were electrodeposited using cyclic voltammetry in presence of lithium, sodium and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate salts. Poly(carbazole) films doped with perchlorate anions having different counter cations were characterized by SEM, ATR-FTIR and solid state conductivity measurements. Capacitive behaviours of PCz coated steel electrodes were tested by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. It was found that counter cation of the dopant is significantly effective on the capacitive performance on the obtained PCz films and the PCz film synthesized from lithium perchlorate has the better capacitive performance than the poly(carbazole)s synthesized from sodium perchlorate and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate salts.
