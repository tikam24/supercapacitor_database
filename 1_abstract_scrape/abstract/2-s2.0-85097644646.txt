In this study, a jasmine petal-like nanoflower WS2/ZnCo2O4 material was synthesized using a hydrothermal technique for use as a sophisticated electrode in supercapacitors. The WS2/ZnCo2O4 composite demonstrated improved properties compared to those of WS2 and ZnCo2O4 electrodes. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the WS2/ZnCo2O4 electrode showed a specific capacity of 154.74 mA h gâˆ’1 with an excellent rate capability of 80.08% and stability of 96.34% over 4000 cycles. Furthermore, the structural and morphological analyses of the WS2/ZnCo2O4 composite electrode demonstrated its excellent energy storage performance.
