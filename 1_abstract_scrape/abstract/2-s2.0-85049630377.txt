This paper shows very reliable, extended range power supply for an electric vehicle. The power sources present are solar PV source, a battery and an Ultra capacitor (UC) [1]. Vehicles operated only on battery oriented systems faces issues of charging, discharging of battery rapidly. To decrease these impacts on battery, it will consolidate with ultracapacitor. The advantages of this setup include better acceleration performance, longer driving range, controlled regenerative braking, smaller battery pack and longer battery life. The work introduce in this paper tries to minimize the stresses on battery, present during periods of acceleration and braking of three phase induction motor drive. Bidirectional DC-DC converters are used for the proper flow of power to motor during various stages of driving cycle. The THD values are also get reduce up to great level with this framework.
