Porous nanoflower-like Co3O4 material on conductive nickel foam substrate was synthesized by hydrothermal reaction combined with thermal decomposition method. The effects of surfactants on the morphology and electrochemical properties of Co3O4 electrodes were investigated. The Co3O4 electrodes modified with SDS, PVP and CTAB surfactants exhibited nano-flower, nano-rod and honeycomb array structures, respectively. Compared with PVP and CTAB, the addition of SDS surfactant can promote the connection of nanostructures in the solution-recrystallization process, provide a large activity area, and reduce the crystallinity of materials. In addition, SDS inserted into the interlayers is decomposed to form the hierarchical flower-like structure. The Co3O4-SDS sample displayed superior electrochemical properties. At the current density of 1 A g− 1, the specific capacitance of Co3O4-SDS was 1150 F g− 1. The specific capacitance retention was 74% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 8 A g− 1. The maximum energy density of the assembled Co3O4-SDS//AC supercapacitor reached 30 Wh kg− 1 even though the power density was 813 W kg− 1. The energy density remained 9.0 Wh kg− 1 as the power density increased to 16,200 W kg− 1.
