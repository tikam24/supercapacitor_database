The electrochemical energy storage that based on earth-abundant materials is essential because of the future demands. Because of carbon-based architecture supercapacitors, rapid charging/discharging, and long life cycle, they considered attractive compared to chemical to batteries. Therefore, copper oxide (CuO) as positive electrode and reduced grapheme oxide (rGO) as negative electrode materials were used for a high-performance supercapacitor in a low cost, simple, and ecofriendly method. During the present work, synthesized reduced graphene oxide/copper oxide (rGO/CuO) nanocomposite using a simple chemical method is carried and investigated. The crystallinity index (Ic) of CuO, 1.0 M rGO/CuO and rGO was 90.61%, 88.42%, and 86.25%, respectively, at 500 °C and one h, while it was 76.30%, 73.51%, and 67.77respectively, at 500 °C and 30 h. As the test temperature increases, Ic% of both rGO and 1.0 M rGO/CuO increases, and that of CuO decreases. As the test period increases, Ic% for rGO, CuO, and 1.0 M rGO/CuO decreases. As the molarity concentration increased, the crystallinity index of rGO/CuO composites increased. The specimens characteristics are carried and investigated using; EDX, SEM, GC/MS, and XRD analysis. The appearance of the peaks at 2θ = 22.20° and 43.58° were related to GO, and peaks at 22°, 20°, 43.58°, 50.70°, and 74.37° indicated the synthesis of the nanocomposite.
