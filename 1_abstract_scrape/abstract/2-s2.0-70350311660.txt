Portable and remote data gathering systems often need to be powered from small long life batteries and are required to transmit data sporadically. GPRS RF transmitters typically operate at a minimum voltage of 3.2 Volts and draw pulsed currents in the order of 1 to 2 Amps. Zigbee typically requires 10 - 100mA transmit current from a 3V battery. These peak load powers are too great to be supplied by small long life batteries such as a CR2032, even though the battery can supply the average system power. This paper offers a solution using a single cell supercapacitor to supply the peak loads with low cost circuitry. A single cell supercapacitor cannot operate at 3V, but does not require a balancing circuit and is lower cost and half the size of a dual cell supercapacitor required for 3V operation. Â© 2009 IEEE.
