Hybrid fibers of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets with MnO2 were fabricated by a facile chemical reduction and self-assembly strategy. FESEM images have shown that MnO2 rods with diameters of approximately 50-80 nm anchor on the reduced graphene oxide nanosheets as spacers in hybrid fibers, and a certain degree of reduced graphene oxide nanosheets oriented along the main axis of the obtained hybrid fibers has been observed. The electrochemical performance of MnO2/reduced graphene oxide hybrid fibers (MGFs) as binder-free electrodes is evaluated by using a three-electrode system. The hybrid fibers exhibit a high specific capacitance of 363.2 Fg-1 at a constant current density of 200 mAg-1. The improved electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between the MnO2 and reduced graphene oxide nanosheets in the hybrid fibers and suggests that MGFs with good performance will be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
