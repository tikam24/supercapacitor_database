Electrode materials with high surface area, tailored pore size, and efficient capability for ion insertion and enhanced transport of electrons and ions are needed for advanced supercapacitors. In the present study, a mixed metal-organic framework (MOF) (cobalt-and manganese-based MOF) was synthesized through a simple one-pot solvothermal method and employed as the electrode material for the supercapacitor. Notably, a Co-Mn MOF electrode displayed a large surface area and excellent cycling stability (over 95% capacitance retention after 1500 cycles). Also, superior pseudocapacitive behavior was observed for the Co-Mn MOF electrode in the KOH electrolyte with an exceptional areal capacitance of 1.318 F cm-2. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled using Co-Mn MOF and activated carbon electrode as positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The fabricated supercapacitor showed a specific capacitance of 106.7 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and delivered a maximum energy density of 30 W h kg-1 at 2285.7 W kg-1. Our studies suggest the Co-Mn MOF as promising electrode materials for supercapacitor applications.
