The increasing demands for green sustainable energy have motivated much interest and attention in energy conversion systems. In this work, 3D hierarchical network porous CNS@Ag0.5@Co-180-10/GNPs hetero-nanostructure hybrid was successfully designed and fabricated via a multistep transformation approach of liquid-phase reduction procedure and subsequent hydrothermal activation pathway, through using a facile heteroatoms synergistic-doping cobalt-based AgCo hybrid and precursor assisted-templating strategy. Here, the chemical compositions, structure parameters and electrochemical performances of C, N, S-tri-doped Ag@Co composites precursor can be simply tuned by adjusting the requirement of Ag content in alloys, hybridization temperature and activation time. It was found that the typical CNS@Ag0.5@Co-180-10/GNPs material possessed a molar ratio of 0.5:1 of Ag and Co, hybridized at 180 °C and activated for 10 h is endowed with large specific surface area (1370 m2g−1), suitable porosity (wider mesopores and narrow micropores), unique morphology (porous 3D hierarchical network structure) and outstanding electrochemical performance (657.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 for specific capacitance, 97.11% at a current density of 15 A g−1 after 5000 cycles for capacitance retention), providing a new insight to design a promising electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.
