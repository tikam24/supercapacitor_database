Fabrication methodologies of conducting polymer (CP) nanomaterials have been demonstrated and investigated for energy storage and conversion, including solar cell, supercapacitor, and fuel cell. Recently, these CP nanomaterials have been synthesized based on soft template method, hard template method, and template-free method. CP nanomaterials can exhibit the enhancement of physical and chemical properties compared to bulk material due to a reduction in size. Furthermore, new concepts toward nanotechnology can provide the emerging and promising applications of CP nanomaterials for energy storage and conversion. In practice, research and development using CP nanomaterials have been proliferating in the field of energy issues. We have suggested three applications including solar cells, supercapacitors, and fuel cells with CP nanomaterials. These devices showed outstanding performances and represent good possibilities. These results pave the way for the development in the field of energy storage and conversion with CP nanomaterials.
