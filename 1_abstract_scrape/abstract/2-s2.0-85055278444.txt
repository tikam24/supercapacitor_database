Unique nanostructure, high electrical conductivity, satisfactory energy density, and extraordinary cycling stability are important evaluation criteria for high-efficient energy storage devices. Herein, Fe3O4 nanospheres are successfully in situ decorated on graphene nanosheets through an environmentally benign and facile solvothermal procedure. When utilized as an electrode for supercapacitor, the graphene/Fe3O4 nanocomposite exhibits a notably enhanced specific capacity (268 F·g−1 at 2 mV·s−1) and remarkable cycling performance with 98.9% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, the fabricated graphene/MnO2//graphene/Fe3O4 asymmetric supercapacitor device displays a desirable energy density (87.6 Wh·kg−1) and superior cycling stability (93.1% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles).
