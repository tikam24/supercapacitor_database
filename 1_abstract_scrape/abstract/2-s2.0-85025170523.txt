The durability (cycle life) and electrochemical performance of a symmetric device was studied via floating technique (voltage- holding). This technique has been proposed as a suitable and reliable method to evaluate the cycle life of a supercapacitor device. This procedure represents the true performance metric of the device and gives an insight into the possible degradation effect that might occur under the test conditions when compared to the conventional cycling method. Based on the above- mentioned technique the symmetric device studied in this work presented an excellent stability with a 12% capacitance loss from 102 F g-1 to 90 F g-1 at 2.5 A g-1 after floating for 500 h with a gradual drop in the resistance, signifying a good cycle life for the device over several hours of holding (âˆ¼21 days).
