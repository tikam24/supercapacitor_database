Self-charging power packs possess great potential applications in the micro-systems, but these electric circuits are required to be portable, light-weight and even wireless connected for practical applications, in particular, in the wearable and portable electronics. In this study, we report wireless portable light-weight solution-processed self-charging power packs by tandem solar cells integrated with solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors through solution-processed electrical conductive polymeric thin film. Towards the end, we first develop solution-processed tandem solar cells by perovskite solar cells (PSCs) combined with ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) for achieving large operational voltage. We then develop solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors by both novel positive electrode and solid-state polymeric electrolytes for enhancing the energy density and cycling stability. After that, we integrate PSCsâ€“OSCs tandem solar cells with solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors through solution-processed electrical conductive polymeric thin film to build wireless portable light-weight solution-processed self-charging power packs. This novel self-charging power packs not only possess advanced features such as portable, light-weight and wireless connection, but also exhibit excellent electric-circuit device performance, such as with an overall efficiency of 12.43% and an energy storage efficiency of 72.4% under white light illumination. All these results demonstrate that the wireless portable light-weight self-charging power packs through utilization of tandem solar cells as the renewable energy source and solid-state asymmetric supercapacitors as the energy storage device connected with solution-processed electrical conductive polymeric thin film, for the first time, are developed.
