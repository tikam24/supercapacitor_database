Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) and TMCs-based nanocomposites have attracted extensive attention due to their versatile material species, low cost, and rich physical and chemical characteristics. As anode materials of lithium-ion capacitors (LICs), TMCs have exhibited high theoretical capacities and pseudocapacitance storage mechanism. However, there are many intrinsic challenges, such as low electrical conductivity, repeatedly high-volume changes and sluggish ionic diffusion kinetics. Hence, many traditional and unconventional techniques have been reported to solve these critical problems, and many innovative strategies are also used to prepare high quality anode materials for LICs. In this mini review, a detailed family member list and comparison of TMCs in the field of lithium-ion capacitors have been summarized firstly. Then, many rectification stratagems and recent researches of TMCs have been exhibited and discussed. In the end, as an outcome of these discussions, some further challenges and perspectives are envisioned to promote the application of TMCs materials for lithium-ion capacitors.
