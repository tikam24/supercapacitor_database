In the present work, we demonstrated a facile process to prepare graphene/MnO2 composites via a simple hydrothermal method at 120Â°C using KMnO4 and graphene oxide as raw materials followed by reduction with or without hydrazine. The electrochemical performance of the graphene/MnO2 composites were investigated in a neutral electrolyte of Na2SO4. Among these samples, the sample rGM3 prepared without hydrazine show uniform morphology and the best electrochemical performance. The specific capacitance of rGM3 is 169 F g-1 at a specific current of 0.2 A g-1. It exhibits a maintenance of 75.5 % of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. The results manifest that the graphene/MnO2 composites can be potentially applied in supercapacitors.
