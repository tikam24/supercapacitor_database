Copper oxide nanostructures with diverse morphology were prepared using Cu foil as substrate via a solution route. The as grown copper oxide nanostructures were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The XRD and FTIR analysis confirm the formation of copper oxide. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows the formation of hierarchical structures of copper oxide with different morphologies. Application of the prepared copper oxide was evaluated as supercapacitive material in 1M Na2SO4 solution using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The specific capacitance has been calculated using CV curves. It has been found that the pseudo-capacitor performance of copper oxide can be tuned via employing different samples.
