State of Charge (SOC) equalization is an important function in battery management system (BMS), especially for a long series-connected battery packs. Switched capacitor (SC) circuit is often used as the intermediary energy storage for a non-dissipative voltage equalization circuit. In this work, a new SC-based equalization circuit has been developed by implements several modifications. First, the SC circuit can be operated on low-frequency switching using a small-size supercapacitor with 1.5F capacitance. Hence, the switches scheduling may be implemented by the non-demanding internal clock of the microcontroller and low-cost electromechanical relay as the switches. Second, the transient switching losses caused by conventional hard-switching frequency can be reduced by implementing the Zero-Current Switching (ZCS) SC circuit. The experiment shows that the equalization current of ZCS-SC is maximized at the resonance frequency of the coupled inductor and capacitor in the circuit. The modification circuit has an equalization current 2.66 times more extensive when implemented on Pack-to-Cell (P2C) topology instead of Cell-to-Cell (C2C) topology. The ZCS-SC circuit is modified with complementary phase-shifted switch scheduling to enhance equalization continuity up to 1.83 times larger than a conventional single ZCS-SC circuit. It also improves the equalization speed up to 1.74 times faster for the lowest-voltage cell to reach the same voltage as the next cell.
