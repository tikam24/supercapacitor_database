The black-to-transmissive electrochromic polymer has significant value with practical applications. Integration of electrochromic and supercapacitor bifunctional materials can indicate its capacitor level by visual color change in real-time. In this paper, based on three EDOT derivative monomers were associated to phenanthrocarbazole/benzotriazole/benzothiadiazole, M1, M2 and M3, a novel ternary random copolymer film was successfully prepared by electrochemical copolymerization. Since the corresponding homopolymers of three monomers are red, green and blue in the neutral state respectively, and their oxidation states are all transparent, therefore the obtained ternary random copolymer films show the black-to-transmissive electrochromic behavior. The copolymer film pCo-2 was prepared via electrochemical copolymerization with suitable monomers feed ratio (1: 1.5: 1 of M1: M2: M3). Benefit from ternary random electrochemical copolymerization, the pCo-2 copolymer displays excellent electrochromic-supercapacitor properties among the similar bifunctional materials, with fast response time, high optical contrast, good cycling stability and large area (volume) specific capacitance. The electrochromic supercapacitor device based on pCo-2//PEDOT can make an LCD run continuously. This work provides an available general approach to realizing black-to-transmissive electrochromism towards electrochromic-supercapacitor bifunctional applications.
