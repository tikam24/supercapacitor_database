Recent innovations in energy storage technologies and power electronics converter have enabled Energy Storage Systems (ESS's) to become an alternative for reusing the regenerated braking energy in urban rail transit. Worldwide, typical energy storage technologies use Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLC's or also known as Super-capacitors or Ultra-capacitors) and batteries, since they offer high power density and energy density and can be used for supplying peak power demands and for voltage stabilization purpose. In the proposed work, on the concept of real rail traction drive system, a scaled simulation and its prototype hardware of dc-dc bi-directional converter responsible for recuperation of braking energy in ESS's in 3-phase traction drive The work includes analyzing regenerated braking of a 3-phase traction motor controlled by v/f drive along with the detailed analysis of operational modes, including Ride Through Capability (RTC). All the results have been investigated and validated by a comparison of simulated results in MATLAB with implemented prototype hardware for the drive's performance for recovering the regenerated braking energy in ESS.
