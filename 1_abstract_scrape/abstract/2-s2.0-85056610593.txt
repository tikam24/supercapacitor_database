We have newly designed five kinds of polyvalent solute that have two to four quaternary ammonium functional groups in one cation. Their molecular structure is designed to be as compact as possible, with either two or three cationic groups on a linear molecular structure, or three or four cationic moieties on three strands in a star-shape. The prepared solutes have a bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide anion in common and a flexible molecular structure that can easily adsorb onto the electrode surface of an electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). Since a single polyvalent solute molecule can accumulate more electric charge by adsorption than can a monovalent solute, a high capacitance is possible even at a low solute concentration compared with conventional cells. We evaluated some electrochemical properties of these polyvalent solutes as an electrolyte and their EDLC performance, including initial capacitance, rate characteristics and cycle durability. All the polyvalent solutes had a potential window of 5 V or more, and in particular the divalent salt showed a capacitor performance equivalent to that of the monovalent salt even at half salt concentration in the electrolyte. On the other hand, the trivalent and tetravalent solutes had a lower charge utilization rate compared with a monovalent solute.
