Oxygen and nitrogen co-enriched hierarchical porous carbon hollow microspheres are synthesized by using biomass-derivative sodium lignosulfonate as a feedstock through a facile and scalable process. This four-step synthesis process involves spray drying, thermal stabilization, carbonization, and post nitric acid modification. The as-obtained carbon exhibits a moderate but efficient porosity (specific surface area of 991 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.75 cm3 g−1), small particle size of 0.2–5 μm, high electrode density of 0.45 g cm−3, and abundant surface oxygen/nitrogen species (13.12 at.%/0.97 at.%). Its electrochemical performance is evaluated by assembling into supercapacitors in 7 M KOH electrolyte. The three-electrode cell presents a high gravimetric capacitance of 284 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and good rate capability of 43.6 % at 20 A g−1. While the two-electrode cell gives an impressive volumetric capacitance of 21.2 F cm−3 at 0.1 A g−1, marvelous volumetric energy density of 2.9 Wh L−1 at 11.3 W L−1, and remarkable cycling stability of 93.4 % capacitance retention after 10000 cycles, which is superior or comparable to that of commercial activated carbon.
