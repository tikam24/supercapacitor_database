The Nanostructured Origami™ process consists of patterning a two-dimensional (2-D) membrane with desired micro- and nanoscale features and then folding it into a three-dimensional (3-D) configuration. Electrochemical capacitors, or supercapacitors, are ideal for origami fabrication because their performance can be enhanced through the use of 3-D geometry and nanostructured materials. A supercapacitor with an electrode area of 350×350 μm was created using the origami process and characterized using electrochemical analysis methods. The experimentally measured capacitance values of approximately 1 μF are consistent with theoretical predictions. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.
