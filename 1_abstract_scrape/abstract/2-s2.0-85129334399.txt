Flexible thin-film storage devices have attracted significant devotion owing to their diminutive nature. Flexible thin-film electrode fabrication, Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) plays a crucial role because of its tuneable nanostructures, well-regulated chemical composites, and fine thin film thickness controller. Herein, we tuned thin film Co3O4 nanostructures using PLD varying pulsed repetition rates of 2 Hz, 5 Hz, and 8 Hz, for thin energy storage device fabrications. Furthermore, we have grown WO3 thin films nanostructures through PLD for suitable negatrode in thin-film Hybrid Supercapacitor (HSC) devices. Here we fabricated solid-state TFHSC devices such as Co3O4 || WO3 consuming semi-solid gel electrolyte PVA-KOH. At foremost novel aspect of the Co3O4 || WO3 TFHSC device delivered a supreme volumetric capacitance of 141.9 F cm−3. Also, the device reached the voltage window of 1.6 V. Further, the TFHSC device delivered a determined volumetric specific energy density of 12.62 mWh cm−3 at a volumetric power density of 1.27 W cm−3. The HSC device achieved notable stability performances in cycle life 27,000 with an appropriate coulombic efficiency of above 97% along with remarkable capacitance retentions of 91%. More importantly, the TFHSC are a good approach to building portable energy systems for wearable microelectronics and bio-medical applications.
