Fiber-shaped supercapacitor has drawn more attention for wearable electronic devices. We prepared hierarchical porous carbon fiber (HPCF) successively by phase-separable wet-spinning of polyacrylonitrile, preoxidation and carbonization with tension to use for the fiber-shaped electrode. The added tension during preoxidation and carbonization and the elevated temperature of carbonization improve the order carbon structure and the graphitization degree, endowed HPCF with high strength of 326.95 MPa. Thus, the all solid-state fiber-shaped supercapacitor is assembled without breakage. In addition, the hierarchical porous structure of HPCF with specific surface area of 276.0 m2 g−1 contributes a high specific capacitance of 158 F g−1. The novel porous carbon fiber in this work exhibits the appropriate potential for wearable applications.
