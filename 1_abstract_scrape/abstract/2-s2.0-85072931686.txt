Supercapacitors are an energy storage device used in the automotive industry. Due to its low energy density, it is difficult to use only supercapacitors in applications. DC-DC converters are used alongside the supercapacitor to maintain the terminal voltage of the supercapacitors. This research proposes a block-box model to represent the behaviour of boost DC-DC converter with supercapacitor module. Real set of signals were collected experimentally from the boost DC-DC converter to estimate transfer function. The NI compact DAQ-9184 was used to capture the experimental measurements, and Matlab System Identification Toolbox was used to identify discrete transfer function. The PID controller had been designed using the estimated transfer function then the model was verified by the SimPowerSystems model of boost DC-DC converter. The Simulation result proves the estimated transfer function of the boost DC-DC converter represent its actual behavior.
