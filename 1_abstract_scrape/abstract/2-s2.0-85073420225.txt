As a new type of electrochemical energy storage device between a conventional capacitor and a battery, the overall performance of the supercapacitor was mainly limited by the electrode material. It is found that transition metal oxides with pseudocapacitance property have attracted much attention in the field of electrochemical energy storage due to their multiple oxidation states, polymetallic ion characteristics and high theoretical specific capacity. In this paper, the structure and energy storage mechanism of flexible supercapacitors were briefly described first. Then, the "binary" and "ternary" flexible composite electrode materials constructed with different numbers of transition metal oxides were summarized. Next, the application of the flexible supercapacitor assembled from the composite electrode materials in the wearable electronic device and the multifunctional flexible device, the energy storage smart window (ESS window), was summarized. Finally, the challenges faced by the transition metal oxide-based flexible supercapacitors in practical applications and the main research directions in the future were proposed.
