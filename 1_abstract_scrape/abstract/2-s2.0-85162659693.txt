A PV-integrated isolated DC microgrid has the potential to supply the electricity in remote areas with high reliability through greener and cheaper renewable energy resources (RERs). Having in mind the uncertainties in the RERs due to climatic changes, a combined application of battery and supercapacitor as composite energy storage devices (CESDs) in the DC microgrid is presented in this paper. The purpose of CESD is to compensate the power imbalance caused by the intermittency of renewable sources and varying load demands. The power allocation in the composite energy storage system is a major concern and also it remains a challenging issue in conventional techniques. Hence, in this paper, the problem is resolved by implementing an improved mixed droop technique (IMDT) with optimized steady-state as well as transient performances. With the proposed technique, the supercapacitor compensates all the fast power fluctuations in the system, while the battery supplies only the average power at steady-state. This control strategy advances the consistency of the system, dynamic restoration of the DC bus voltage, and reduces current stress from the battery units. Both MATLAB simulation and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Also, the scheme is verified for a large-scale 4kW PV generating system through simulation.
