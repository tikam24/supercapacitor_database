We introduced a facile chemical polymerization method to construct nanocomposites by combining conducting polyaniline (PANI) nanowires arrays with graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. The surface morphology and structure of nanocomposites are characterized by SEM, FT-IR, Raman measurements. Electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammetry(CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The results indicated that the average specific capacitance of nanocomposites could be as high as 469 F/g in the potential range from 0 to 0.7 V at a current density of 0.2 A/g, higher than pure PANI electrode (452 F/g), showing a synergistic of PANI and GO. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of GO/PANI was 1 Ω·cm2. They also exhibited greatly to improve electrochemical stability and rate performances.
