Manganese dioxide and Manganese dioxide based materials have long been used in various energy storage systems because of their outstanding electrochemical behavior, low cost, and environmental compatibility. In recent years, many studies had focused on its nano scale applications due to the structural flexibility and the unique physicochemical properties. The basic crystal structure of manganese dioxide configures of one manganese atom surrounded by six oxygen atoms to form an octahedron. Here β-MnO2, γ-MnO2, λ-MnO2 and δ-MnO2 nanoparticles have been successfully synthesized by simple precipitation methods. Powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed for the identification and examination of the crystalline phase structures. Presence of functional groups and purity of the sample were evaluated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Morphology studies were carried out via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical performances of the β, γ and δ phases were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Among the four electrodes, δ-MnO2 exhibited the highest value for specific capacitance. These results show that the prepared MnO2 electrodes are good materials for supercapacitor application, especially δ-MnO2.
