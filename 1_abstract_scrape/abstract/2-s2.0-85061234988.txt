The effect of the carbon-material specific mass on the electrochemical parameters of electrodes for supercapacitors on neutral aqueous electrolytes is studied. It is shown that the highest specific capacitance of 11 F/g is observed for electrodes with the specific mass of 1 mg/cm 2 . These electrodes are stable at the potential scan rate from 2 to 600 mV/s, in contrast to electrodes with the specific mass of 6 mg/cm 2 . As the power increases, the decrease in the specific energy of the electrode with the mass of 1 mg/cm 2 is less pronounced as compared with the electrode with the mass of 6 mg/cm 2 . The specific energy of the former electrode is 8 W h/kg for the specific power of 20000 W/kg, whereas for the specific energy of the latter electrode is 5 W h/kg for the specific power of 2000 W/kg.
