In the article the mathematical model of the bidirectional DC-DC converter with accounting the incomplete controllability is considered. The article shows that the mode of incomplete controllability appears during the mode changing of DC-DC converter from Buck to Boost and vice versa. It is assumed that the DC-DC converter operates as a part of variable frequency drive and it is used to connect the block of supercapacitors to the DC link of frequency converter. In this case, in the construction of a mathematical model of DC-DC converter it is necessary to consider the DC link model of the frequency converter, which has a significant influence on transients in the system. The developed mathematical model also takes into account the work of the DC-DC converter in DCM and CCM. The paper presents an equations system of mathematical model, block diagram and simulation results of the DC-DC converter. It is shown that the incomplete controllability of DC-DC converter has a significant influence on the transients in the system.
