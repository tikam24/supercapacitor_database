The surfactant free SnO2 nanostructure was successfully synthesized by simple one pot hydrothermal route and its physico-chemical properties were investigated. XRD result confirmed the formation of tetragonal SnO2 nanostructure. Raman spectrum revealed two Raman active modes (Eg+A2u) of SnO2 nanostructure. SEM images revealed nanoplate array formation of SnO2. The well defined metal oxygen vibration band (O-Sn-O) at 609 cm-1 was confirmed through FTIR spectrum. The electrochemical properties of the sample were examined by employing four different electrolytes such KCl, KOH, Na2SO4 and NaOH respectively. The highest specific capacitance of about 120.41 F/g for 5 mV/s and good conductivity was observed for the electrolyte KCl by cyclic voltammogram (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies.
