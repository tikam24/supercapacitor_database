The search of electrode materials with high electrochemical activity is one of key solutions to actualize both high energy density and high power density in a supercapacitor. Recently, we have developed one novel kind of rare earth and transitional metal colloidal supercapacitors, which can deliver higher specific capacitance than electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLC) and traditional pseudocapacitors. The electrode materials in colloidal supercapacitors arin colloidal supercapacitors aree in-situ formed electroactive colloids, which were transformed from commercial rare earth and transitional metal salts in alkaline electrolyte by chemical and electrochemical assisted coprecipitation. In these colloidal supercapacitors, multiple-electron Faradaic redox reactions can be utilized, which can deliver ultrahigh specific capacitance often larger than one-electron capacitance. Multiple-valence metal cations used in our designed colloidal supercapacitors mainly include Ce3+, Yb3+, Er3+, Fe3+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Sn2+ and Sn4+. The colloidal supercapacitors can be served as the promising next-generation high performance supercapacitors.
