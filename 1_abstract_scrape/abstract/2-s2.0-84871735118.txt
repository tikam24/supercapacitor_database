We report a facile strategy to synthesize of polypyrrole/molybdenum disulfide (PPy/MoS2) nanocomposite as an advanced electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors applications. Flowerlike MoS2 with graphene-like subunits structure is prepared using a hydrothermal method, and the nanocomposite PPy are embedded in MoS2 nanosheets is prepared by in situ oxidation polymerization of pyrrole in the presence of MoS 2 suspension. Structural and morphological characterizations of the nanocomposite are investigated by XRD, FE-SEM and TEM measurements. Their electrochemical properties are also investigated using cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. The PPy/MoS2 nanocomposite exhibit high specific capacitance of 553.7 F g-1 and its capacitance can still remain 90% after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 A g-1. Â© 2012 Elsevier B.V.
