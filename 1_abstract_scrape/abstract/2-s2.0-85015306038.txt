Aiming at the problem of load power fluctuation in the stable microgrid operation, this paper proposes a real-time power regulation scheme based on the Fast Fourier Transfer (FFT) algorithm. By FFT algorithm, load power is processed into two components of high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF), which are absorbed to supercapacitor and battery banks, respectively. At the same time, for purpose of realizing the effective smooth switching between operation modes, the consolidate control strategy for inverter is adopted in this paper. Simulation results indicate that processing effect of FFT on the load power fluctuation is better than that of LPF (low pass filter) on it, and the power quality is improved. With the unified control strategy imposed on inverter, system can operate well and transform smoothly between grid-connected and standalone mode which needn't foresee the operation condition.
