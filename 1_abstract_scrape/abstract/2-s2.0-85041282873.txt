Supercapacitors are characterized by high energy and power density. For those reasons, it is possible to use them as a highly efficient sources of energy. The possibility of using supercapacitors grow along with a reduction in their size while maintaining the above mentioned parameters. The fulfillment of this objective requires the use of modern materials for the construction of ultracapacitors (how supercapacitors are also described), such as nanomaterials. Recently, due to the great electrical and mechanical properties and high specific surface, carbon nanotubes, as a material for supercapacitors electrodes manufacturing, are being investigated. This article presents results of parameters calculation based on finite element method, obtained for supercapacitors models. In the described models used for simulation, electrodes are made of carbon nanotubes, obtained by synthesis using LSCVD method.
