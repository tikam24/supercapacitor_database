A novel solid-state battery-supercapacitor hybrid device is fabricated for high-performance electrical energy storage using a Si anode and a TiO2cathode in conjunction with a flexible, solid-like gel polymer electrolyte film as the electrolyte and separator. The electrodes were fabricated as three-dimensional nanostructured vertical arrays by sputtering active materials as conformal shells on vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) which serve as the current collector and structural template. Such nanostructured vertical core-shell array-electrodes enable short Li-ion diffusion path and large pseudocapacitive contribution by fast surface reactions, leading to the hybrid features of batteries and supercapacitors that can provide high specific energy over a wide range of power rates. Due to the improved mechanical stability of the infiltrated composite structure, the hybrid cell shows excellent cycling stability and is able to retain more than 95% of the original capacity after 3500 cycles. More importantly, this solid-state device can stably operate in a temperature range from −20 to 60 °C with a very low self-discharge rate and an excellent shelf life. This solid-state architecture is promising for the development of highly stable thin-film hybrid energy storage devices for unconventional applications requiring largely varied power, wider operation temperature, long shelf-life and higher safety standards.
