EDLC was fabricated using hybrid solid polymer electrolyte from PVA-diapers and an activated carbon powder as electrode by using solution casting method. For comparison, four types of EDLC cells were constructed and tested. It was found that an EDLC with a PVA-diapers (60:40) polymer electrolyte exhibited much higher capacitance and longer cycle-life. The electrocapacitive properties of the supercapacitor (P50HD50, P60HD40, P70HD30 and P80HD20) were done using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD). Results from these analysis showed that P60HD40 cell had recorded excellent rate capability and highest Csp value of 179 F g-1 (EIS), 50 F g-1 (CV), 328 F g-1 (GCD) respectively. Futher, results from ESR (GCD) analysis showed that P60HD40 composition of PVA/H3PO4 liquid electroyte gave a lower value of 88.05 Î© in the supercapacitor cell compared with another cells.
