New thin films of pyrolized polyacrylonitrile (PAN) aerogels synthesised without the CO2 supercritical drying step were investigated. Both the physical and electrochemical characterisation were conducted to evaluate these materials as double layer electrodes in a supercapacitor. High surface areas up to about 400-500 m2.g-1 were obtained with these aerogel PAN films. The highly porous nature of the films is also confirmed by SEM. Specific capacitances as high as 130 Eg-1 were obtained in 5M KOH aqueous media. Galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were realised in a non-optimised two-electrode cell configuration. Energy and power densities were estimated to be about 4.4 W.kg-1 and 1400 W.kg-1.
