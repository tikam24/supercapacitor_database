Herein, Y-doped Ni(OH)2 composites were successfully fabricated via a simple hydrothermal process. The specific surface areas were significantly improved when Y3+ ions were incorporated into the Ni hydroxide lattice. The Y-doped Ni(OH)2 electrode exhibited the remarkable specific capacity of 735.46 C g-1 at 1.5 A g-1 and ultrahigh rate performance with 71.36% capacity retention at 20 A g-1. The optimum Y-doped Ni(OH)2 electrodes were further evaluated for application in an asymmetric supercapacitor, demonstrating the maximum energy density of 55.49 W h kg-1 at the power density of 843.31 W kg-1 as well as satisfying cycling performance with 85.8% retention after 7000 cycles.
