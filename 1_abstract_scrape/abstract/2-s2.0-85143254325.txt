A theoretical study of the interior ballistics of an electrically-operated solid propellant is presented. This study is motivated by the desire to replace liquid hydrazine (N2H4) monopropellant systems, and N2H4/oxidizer combinations, for orbit insertion, or on-orbit functions. The objective was to define a feasible motor and electric power configuration for the thrust range 1 to 100 Newtons, with the constraints of a "green" propellant and simple grain design. As well, a commercially available power source was sought. Based on previous published experimental work by this group, it was shown possible. An ammonium nitrate/epoxy 75/25 propellant was used, in a simple cylindrical internally-burning grain. The propellant is dielectric, yet has a conductive melt layer under the combustion zone. Planar, consumable electrodes serve to impose an electric field. Ultra-capacitors of 600 Farad were selected as refillable power source, arranged in a specific array form. The concept herein is a hybrid propulsion form, a departure from so called electrothermal-chemical propulsion. The propellant mass was 60 grams, and the maximal ultra-capacitor mass was under 2 kg. Fixed-thrust missions were imposed in the above range. The calculated e-power required was under 11 kW, and electrical energy storage was under 10 Watt-hours. The relevant specific impulse was between 245 and 260 sec.
