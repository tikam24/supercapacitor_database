The investigation of inexpensive, effective, environmentally friendly next-generation energy storage devices is an urgent task due to the discontinuities of new generation energy that hinder their further widely application. Among the multitudinous explored energy storage devices, supercapacitors have been regarded as the most potential energy storage systems thanks to their distinctive features of ultralong cycling lifespan, ultrafast charge/discharge process, and high power density compared with batteries and conventional capacitors. Nevertheless, the existing defect of low energy density has always been a bottleneck problem to their long-term development and widespread applications. Meanwhile, the electrodes are the core component in supercapacitors, determining the electrochemical performance directly. Consequently, transition metal oxides were chosen as the promoting materials to design and fabricate appropriately and rationally act as supercapacitor electrodes to harvest the outstanding electrochemical performance of both high energy and power density simultaneously. Here, we summarized the recent advances in transition metal oxides with different dimensions as electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors, including zero-dimensional nanostructures (nanospheres, nanocrystals, nanoparticles), one-dimensional nanostructures (nanorods, nanowires and nanotubes), two-dimensional nanostructures (nanoflakes, nanoplatelets), three-dimensional nanostructures (spherical structure, hollow structure, flower-like structure, honeycomb structure, mesoporous structure), and the corresponding supercapacitors electrochemical performance, expecting to make a thorough inquiry of the relationship between structure and property for highlighting the route to design and synthesis high-performance transition metal oxide-based supercapacitor electrodes.
