In the present work, we demonstrate the supercapacitor applications of titania nanotube @α-Fe2O3 composites (TNT@α-Fe2O3) synthesized via successive anodization–hydrothermal methods. The structure and morphology of the composites were studied through XRD and SEM analyses and the electrochemical properties were studied through CV, GCD and EIS analyses. The hybrid composite, TNT-Fe4 exhibited highest supercapacitor performance with a capacitance of 157.32 mFcm−2 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 owing to the unique micro/nano hybrid architecture of the composite, comprising of a hierarchical layered Fe2O3 coating on titania nanotubes. The asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated with the composite electrode together with activated carbon showed an excellent capacitance of 142.86 mFcm−2 with an energy density of 38.88μWhcm−2 at 0.2 mAcm−2. The high rate capability and outstanding cyclic stability of the composite validate the potential application of the device in charge-storage systems.
