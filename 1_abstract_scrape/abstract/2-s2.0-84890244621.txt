Graphene were prepared by simple redox method using graphite as raw materials. Supercapacitors were fabricated using the as-prepared graphene as electrode in organic electrolyte. The phase and morphology were characterized by XRD and SEM methods. The performance of supercapacitors were analyzed using galvanostatic charging and discharging testing, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that graphene-based supercapacitors had larger values of specific capacitance than that of the natural graphite-based ones. The specific capacitance was 45.5 F/g (rentention rate at 85.5%) after 888 charging and discharging cycles at the current density of 200 mA/g between the voltage from 1.25 to 2.5 V. The graphene-based supercapacitors have a good charge-discharge cycle performance.
