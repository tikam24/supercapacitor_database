High electrochemical performance pomegranate-like porous carbon was synthesized by the carbonization and activation of phenolic resin which was prepared by adding phenolic resin monomer mixture into KOH aqueous solution and hydrothermal treatment. In the process of hydrothermal, KOH solution could hinder the polymerization of phenolic resin monomer to form big phenolic resin particles. During the carbonization, phenolic resin plays the role of forming small particles and binder during carbonization, which can simultaneously achieve high specific surface area and form three dimensional structures to improve the conductivity. The results showed that pomegranate-like porous carbon composed of small nanometer-scale particles was observed. The obtained porous carbon electrode materials had a high content of micropores with specific surface area as high as 2199.9 m2 g−1. The porous carbon exhibited a high specific capacitance of 341.3 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, good rate capability with 71.0% retention from 0.1 to 5 A g−1. Moreover, it showed high capacitance retention of 96.1% after 5000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, indicating excellent cycling stability. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor showed high energy densities of 17.0 Wh kg−1 and 8.5 Wh kg−1 with the corresponding power densities of 49.6 W kg−1 and 1.8 kW kg−1, respectively. The facile method could be a promising candidate for preparing porous carbon electrode materials with excellent electrochemical performance in the fields of supercapacitors.
