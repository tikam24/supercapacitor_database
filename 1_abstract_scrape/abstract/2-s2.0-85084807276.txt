This paper concerns the modeling of asymmetric supercapacitor cells based on electrode’s data obtained throughout laboratorial tests, such as hydrogen bubble evolution electrodeposition. The electrode’s data type here implemented concerns three electrodes system tests, which are designed to provide a single electrode output. This procedure provides instructions on the extraction of electrodes tests parameters, the device’s design throughout dimensional basis and comparison with commercially available products and the estimation of energetic output by forecasting the resulting capacitance, voltage, energy and mass of the theoretical supercapacitor.
