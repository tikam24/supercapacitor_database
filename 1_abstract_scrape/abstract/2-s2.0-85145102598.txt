For isolated micro grid applications, this article provides a unique multi-source and HES-integrated converter architecture. Other multi-input converter systems fail to manage power changes caused by wind, sun, or unanticipated load disruptions. Supply sustainability and reliability have become important considerations due to renewables' uncertainty. To reduce power efficiency and unbalanced loading uncertainty, the battery can respond quicker than diesel generators and micro turbines. This research examines the power generation of a solar, wind, battery, and super capacitor-based isolated micro grid. When the load abruptly decreases or increases, the PCC voltages are interrupted. As a consequence, we develop a novel control approach for PCC's voltage profile optimization. Reacting to high-frequency changes using a super capacitor increases battery life and minimizes storage unit size. Basic functions such as charging and discharging energy storage based on system power availability are also included in the control structure. The ANFIS Adaptive controlled proportional integral (IC-PI) controller optimizes synchronous generator speed management to enable exact wind MPP monitoring. The boost converter controls DC link voltage while the load side power converter harvests solar MPP. Important elements of the recommended configuration: (i) Built-in voltage boosting, super capacitor voltage control, and battery-super capacitor power sharing (ii) Less sensors and a simpler control system. Complete configuration and control structure analysis, modeling, and design using MATLAB simulations are provided.
