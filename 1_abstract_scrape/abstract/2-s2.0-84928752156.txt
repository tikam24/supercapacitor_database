Surfactant-treated graphene/polyaniline (G/PANI) nanocomposites were prepared by the MnO2 template-aided oxidative polymerization of aniline (ANI) on the surfactant-treated graphene sheets. The electrochemical performances of the G/PANI nanocomposites in a three-electrode system using an aqueous sulfuric acid as an electrolyte exhibited a specific capacitance of 436 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which is much higher than the specific capacitance of pure PANI (367 F g−1). Such a higher specific capacitance of the G/PANI nanocomposite inferred an excellent synergistic effect of respective pseudocapacitance and electrical double-layer capacitance of PANI and graphene.
