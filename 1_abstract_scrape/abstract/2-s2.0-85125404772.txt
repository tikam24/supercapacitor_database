With the development of high-performance supercapacitors, a conductive polymer (CP)-based pseudocapacitance electrode with good electrical conductivity and low processing costs holds a promising application prospect. As the core component of supercapacitors, the CP electrode with adjustable spacing, a high specific surface area, and a faster ion diffusion path has been extensively investigated. Herein, based on accurate top-down photolithography and electropolymerization approaches, we fabricate a CP-coated vertically aligned micropillar array (MPA) electrode. The electrode presents an overwhelming enhanced areal specific capacitance compared with that of a flat configuration, which is partially ascribed to an increased electroactive surface area, two rapid channels for ion diffusion and electron transfer, and enhanced electric field intensity that is provided by the MPA structure. Based on the fabricated CP-based MPA electrode, an asymmetric supercapacitor is assembled with two thiophene derivatives, presenting a high energy density and excellent cycling stability. A supercapacitor system cascading with three asymmetric supercapacitor devices further demonstrates the practical applications by driving the light-emitting diodes. This work provides a good reference for the further development of CP-based energy storage devices with high energy density and superior cycling stability.
