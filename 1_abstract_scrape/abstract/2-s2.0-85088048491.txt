Modulating the phase property of electrode materials is of intrinsic importance for enhanced energy storage performance. Here, through a pillar-coordinated strategy, a series of metaborate pillar-coordinated hierarchical α-Ni(OH)2 (Ni(BO2-)-LDH) are fabricated via Ni-MOF precursor etching process. During the etching process, the coordinated organic ligand is gradually substituted by inorganic anions (OH- and BO2-) with small size and the BO2- anions are effectively coordinated on the surface of as-formed α-Ni(OH)2 layer to fabricate a pillar-coordinated α-Ni(OH)2 structure. The physical morphology of MOFs parent is successfully maintained, which provides rich pores and channels for fast diffusion of electrolyte. Meanwhile, the unique pillar-supported α-Ni(OH)2 structure is robust to avoid the phase-transfer reaction from the α-phase to β-phase during the charge/discharge process in strong alkaline electrolyte, which can provide a deep and durable Faraday reaction. Therefore, the optimized Ni(BO2-)-LDH-4 shows a capacity value of 244.4 mAh g-1 (1760 F g-1) at 1 A g-1 and an outstanding cycle performance of keeping approximately 82.1% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at 5 A g-1. Furthermore, a hybrid supercapacitor with the Ni(BO2-)-LDH-4 and three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (3D-RGO) as electrodes presents a high energy density of 56.5 W h kg-1 at 0.111 kW kg-1.
