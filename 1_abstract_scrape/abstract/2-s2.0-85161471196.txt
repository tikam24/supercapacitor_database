In this work, novel mesoporous tetrakaidecahedron-like α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals have been designed in high yield through a simple hydrothermal method. The growth mechanism of mesoporous tetrakaidecahedron-like α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals was first investigated in detail based on the FESEM images and XRD results of the intermediate products. The electrochemical performance demonstrates that the mesoporous tetrakaidecahedron-like α-Fe2O3 nanocrystal electrode displays enhanced pseudocapacitive properties with a high specific capacitance of 245 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and good capacitance retention of 83.9% after 2000 continuous charge–discharge cycles, implying that the porous tetrakaidecahedron-like α-Fe2O3 nanocrystals have great potential applications for supercapacitors.
