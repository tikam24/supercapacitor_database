Flexible planar micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) are favored in wearable electronics for energy storage components due to their great advantages in miniaturization, integration, and flexibility. However, the fabrication process of MSCs is usually complicated, and simple, fast and practical techniques for the preparation of MSCs still face challenges. Herein, a simple and efficient screen printing technique is creatively employed for fabrication of high-performance flexible planar MSCs based on pseudocapacitive MoS2 nanoparticles decorated highly conductive electrochemically exfoliated graphene (MoS2/EEG) hybrid electrodes. The as-assembled MoS2/EEG MSCs reveal a noteworthy areal capacitance of 13.6 mF cm–2, a super high energy density of 1.478 mW h cm–2 with a high power density of 0.08 W cm–2, and outstanding cycling stability with capacitance attenuation of only 10% of after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles. Briefly, such screen-printed planar MoS2/EEG MSCs have good scalability, excellent mechanical properties, and fine performance consistency, which are most promising as an important micro-power energy storage component for flexible integrated electronic devices.
