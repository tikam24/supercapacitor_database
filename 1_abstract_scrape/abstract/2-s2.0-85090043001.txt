Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and supercapacitors (SCs) are two promising electrochemical energy storage systems and their consolidated products, lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) have received increasing attentions attributed to the property of high energy density, high power density, as well as long cycle life by integrating the advantages of LIBs and SCs. For LIBs, an initial irreversible capacity loss is hardly avoidable due to the formation of solid electrolyte interface layer, which usually causes the over-consumption of lithium ions. The way to overcome the issue is prelithiation. In addition, prelithiation is a prerequisite to obtain a satisfactory electrochemical performance as a result of lithium-resource shortage for LICs. In this review, advantages and scientific issues existed in prelithiation materials and approaches for LIBs and LICs are discussed comprehensively from multiple perspectives.
