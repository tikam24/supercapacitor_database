To overcome the energy demand, environmental pollution, and global warming, replacing fossil fuels using clean and renewable hydrogen energy is a promising strategy. Water catalysis is the key step toward industrial hydrogen generation. Herein, we obtained remarkable performance of CuCo for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide. The CuCo nanocomposite functional material on nickel foam is rich in copper nanoparticles. The CoCu oxide on nickel foam showed catalytic performance superfast in the HER in a 1 M KOH environment at 1.62 V to carry a 10 mA/cm2 current density and no decrease in current afterward a non-stop run for 25 hr. CoCu (S2) has a Tafel slope of (a) 69 mV/dec in a 0.5 M H2SO4 and (b) 119 mV/dec in a 1 M KOH. It has been found to be cost-effective, highly active, and healthy for energy conversion by electrochemical. Moreover, the capabilities of charge storage were also inspected. It strongly provides a capacitance of 681 and 607 F/g at a 1 A/g admirable rate of capacitance retention. The attractive features of CoCu oxide are present in more abundance and superior for the HER kinetics activity. The electrocatalyst provides better stability and durability and provides long-term applications for the advance of a functional catalyst for charge storage, and water splitting applications is strongly demonstrated.
