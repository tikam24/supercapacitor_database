Well-crystalline Mn3O4nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by an economical and high yield facile low temperature solution process at 80 °C for electro-active electrode materials in supercapacitor applications. The semispherical morphology of Mn3O4NPs was observed which have the average particle size of 20–30 nm. The crystalline, structural, compositional and optical properties of synthesized materials evidenced the formation of Mn3O4without existing any other oxide phases, possessing the typical tetragonal structure of Mn3O4with the band gap of 2.37 eV. To evaluate the properties of the synthesized Mn3O4NPs as effective electrode in electrochemical double layer supercapacitors (EDLCs), the cyclicvoltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling analysis were carried out in 2 M TEABF4electrolyte. Mn3O4NPs electrode with activated carbon showed the highest capacitance of ∼216 Fg−1as compared to bare AC and bare Mn3O4NPs electrodes. An excellent stability by maintaining ∼85% of initial value after 1000 cycles was recorded for Mn3O4NPs-AC electrode based EDLC.
