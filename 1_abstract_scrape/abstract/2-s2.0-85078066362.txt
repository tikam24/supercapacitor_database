This work presents a fault ride-through control scheme for a non-isolated power topology used in a hybrid energy storage system designed for DC microgrids. The hybrid system is formed by a lithium-ion battery bank and a supercapacitor module, both coordinated to achieve a high-energy and high-power combined storage system. This hybrid system is connected to a DC bus that manages the power flow of the microgrid. The power topology under consideration is based on the buck-boost bidirectional converter, and it is controlled through a bespoke modulation scheme to obtain low losses at nominal operation. The operation of the proposed control scheme during a DC bus short-circuit failure is shown, as well as a modification to the standard control to achieve fault ride-through capability once the fault is over. The proposed control provides a protection to the energy storage systems and the converter itself during the DC bus short-circuit fault. The operation of the converter is developed theoretically, and it has been verified through both simulations and experimental validation on a built prototype.
