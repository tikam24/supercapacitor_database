The current paper focuses on the energy management in a fast charging station for PHEV batteries; that uses in addition to the grid a flywheel energy storage and a supercapacitor; with main objective to minimize the duration of the battery charging process and the time required to recharge the storage devices afterward. The designed station is capable to recharge PHEV batteries with capacities lower or equal to 15 kWh from a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 95% of the battery state-of-charge in a maximum duration of 15 minutes. After a battery has been charged, a waiting period (during which no cars are allowed at the charging station) of a maximum duration of 7.5 minutes is required. During this period, the storage devices are being recharged to their maximum. A scenario displaying the charging process of two different PHEV batteries is presented with the simulation results.
