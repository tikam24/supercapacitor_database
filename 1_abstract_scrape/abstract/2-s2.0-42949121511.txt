Carbon nanotubes with larger inner diameter were synthesized by the chemical vapor deposition of carbon monoxide (CO) on iron catalyst using H2S as promoting agent. It is found that the structure and morphology of carbon nanotubes can be tailored, to some degree, by varying the experimental conditions such as precursor components and process parameters. The results show that the presence of H2S may play key role for growing Y-branched carbon nanotubes. The products were characterized by SEM, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. Furthermore, the obtained carbon nanotubes were explored as electrode materials for supercapacitor. Â© 2006 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.
