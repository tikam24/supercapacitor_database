The power electronic interface is critical in matching a distributed generation (DG) unit's characteristics to grid requirements as most DG technologies rely on renewable energy. Increased adoption of electric vehicles (EV) is seen as a positive step toward minimizing air pollution as well as carbon emissions. Rapid proliferation of electric vehicles as well as charging stations has exacerbated voltage quality as well as harmonic distortion difficulties, which harm the efficiency of combined renewable energy. This research proposes novel hybrid design techniques in control systems that enhance the energy efficiency of electronic converters for power electronics. The control system enhancement has been carried out using a hybrid energy storage electric convertor, and energy efficiency is improved using a synergetic battery reference adaptive controller. A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)'s internal combustion engine with a small photovoltaic (PV) module is utilised to assess a proposed control method which effectively regulates electric power on-grid by draining electricity from batteries during peak hours as well as then charging them during off-peak times, lowering the load on the converter as well as allowing electric vehicles to charge faster. Experimental results show the constant acceleration case obtained battery current of 92 Amps, ultracapacitor current of 89 Amps, charging voltage of 88 V, DC load current of 85 Amps, battery SOC of 72%, and the time-varying acceleration proposed technique obtained current of 94 Amps, and ultracapacitor current of 90 Amps, charging voltage of 90 V, DC load current of 82 Amps, battery SOC of 79%.
