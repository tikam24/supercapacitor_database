Metal oxide and metal dichalcogenide heterostructure composites are promising candidates for electrochemical use. In this study, a hybrid heterostructure composite electrode material was made using a straightforward hydrothermal process using transition metal oxide (NiO) and metal dichalcogenide (MoS2). The surface of the flower-like structured MoS2 was grown with granular structured NiO, and this heterostructure composite exhibited considerably improved specific capacitance when compared to the pure NiO and MoS2 materials. The pseudocapacitive performance was effectively supported by the heterostructure combination of transition metal oxide (TMOs) and metal dichalcogenide (MDC), which greatly improved ion transport within the material and storage. At a current density of 1 A/g, the prepared heterostructure composite electrode material exhibited a specific capacitance of 289 F/g, and, after 2000 cycles, the capacitance retained 101% of its initial value. The symmetric device was constructed and put through tests using LED light. This finding opens up a new avenue for the quickly increasing the field of heterostructure materials.
