Nickel cobalt hydroxides have been regarded as a potential candidate for energy storage devices owing to the attractive high theoretical capacitance. However, practical application of NiCo hydroxides is hindered by their poor chemical stability which leads to low cycling life. To overcome the obstacles, a facile, large-scale and low cost method for fabricating NiCo layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs) with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) or polypyrrole (PPy) is developed. The synthesized composite with significantly enhanced electrochemical performances displays a uniform and loose nanostruture owing to the property of PPy or rGO which reduces the aggregation of NiCo hydroxides. Particularly, the as-prepared NiCo-LDHs@rGO composite exhibits a high specific capacitance of 1703 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and an extraordinary rate capability with 76.3% capacitance retention after 100-fold increase in current density. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) composed of NiCo-LDHs@rGO (positive electrode) and activated carbon (negative electrode) was fabricated. The ASC reveals an excellent energy density (47.1 Wh kg−1 at 399.9 W kg−1) and shows great long-term cycling stability (73.3% capacity retention after 10000 cycles), and so it holds great promise for future practical application.
