In this experiment, the special prominence is given to the influence of Cobalt (Co) doped α-MnO2 NPs synthesized via co-precipitation technique. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis are used to examine the Co doped α-MnO2 nanoparticles. Further, the capacitance natures of the electrodes were determined from cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge measurement and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy. As from the electrochemical analysis, the prepared electrode was showing the pseudo capacitance nature. Also, the prepared Co doped α-MnO2 electrode was showing the higher capacitance values of 1015 F/g at 10 mV/s which is more than the pure α-MnO2 (901 F/g at 10 mV/s). In addition, the study of charge–discharge curve shows that the capacitance values of the Co doped α-MnO2 (996 F/g at 1 A/g) electrode is more than the pure α-MnO2 (876 F/g at 1 A/g) electrode. Moreover, Co doped α-MnO2 electrode shows the much lower Rct (charge transfer) value which indicates the better SC performance of the prepared electrode material.
