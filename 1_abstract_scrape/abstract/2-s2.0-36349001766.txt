α-Manganese dioxide is synthesized in a microemulsion medium by a redox reaction between KMnO 4 and MnSO 4 in presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate as a surface active agent. The morphology of MnO 2 resembles nanopetals, which are spread parallel to the field. The material is further characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, energy dispersive analysis of X-ray, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area. Supercapacitance property of α-MnO 2 nanopetals is studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling. High values of specific capacitance are obtained. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.
