Significant enhancement in supercapacitor performance was achieved via the synthesis of nanocrystalline RuO<inf>2</inf> on vertically aligned Few Layered Graphene (FLG) nanoflakes, synthesized on bare n-type heavily doped silicon substrates by microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition. The RuO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles (diameter <2 nm) were deposited using a combination of low base pressure radio frequency magnetron sputtering and subsequent electrochemical cycling in acidic media. The well-dispersed RuO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles on FLGs achieve a specific capacitance of the order of 650 F g<sup>-1</sup>. The specific capacitance of RuO<inf>2</inf>-FLGs is significantly higher than pristine sputtered RuO<inf>2</inf> (∼320 F g<sup>-1</sup>) and FLGs (∼6 F g<sup>-1</sup>) indicative of the synergistic effect between the FLGs and RuO<inf>2</inf>. In addition, the fabricated RuO<inf>2</inf>-FLG supercapacitors show excellent cycling capability with approximately 70% retention of initial specific capacitance over 4000 cycles at high charging-discharging rates of 500 mV s<sup>-1</sup>. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the good electronic conductivity of the FLGs as well as high utilization of well-dispersed RuO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles on FLGs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.
