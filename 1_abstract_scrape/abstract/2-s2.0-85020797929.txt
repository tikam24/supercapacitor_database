The Z-source converter features stepping up/down in single stage, none dead-time and high reliability, which attaches great significance to electric vehicles (EV). An ultra capacitor-battery hybrid energy storage system (HESS) for electric vehicles is proposed based on bi-directional Z-source topology. The HESS is incorporated in the traction inverter system, and the DC-DC converter for the battery is omitted. The steady operation principles for power distribution in HESS modes are analyzed. A frequency dividing coordinated control is then employed to enhance the system dynamic response and the seamless switching. Estimation methods for the battery peak current are also investigated, to avoid the impacts of short-time inrush current on battery. Finally, the steady performance and transient response are verified by simulation and experimental results.
