Three dimensional (3D) hollow porous activated carbon was prepared by pyrolysis of lotus seedpod as biomass carbon precursor. Subsequently, manganese dioxide (MnO2) particles were in situ formed uniformly on the hollow pipes activated carbon by hydrothermal deposition reaction. The morphology and structure of the obtained lotus seedpod-based activated carbon/manganese dioxide composite (L-AC@MnO2) were investigated using the scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectra. The electrochemical properties of electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic current charge and discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The specific capacitance of L-AC@MnO2 is 248 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The capacitance retention rate of the composite material can still reach 79.3% at a current density of 8 A g−1 after 3000 cycles. The assembled symmetrical supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 16.6 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 123.7 W kg−1. The result also provides a feasible method for the design and synthesis of electrodes materials in high-performance supercapacitors.
