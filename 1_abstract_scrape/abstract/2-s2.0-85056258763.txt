In this study, molybdenum oxide thin films were prepared using a method different than the ones known in the literature and their capacitance properties were investigated. Catalase and invertase enzymes were mixed with molybdenum ions dissolved in water and molybdenum oxide thin films were coated on substrates. Surface analysis of the films was performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, whereas structural properties were examined through X-ray Diffraction and capacitance properties by current/voltage measurements. Regarding the molybdenum oxide thin films that were produced with catalase enzyme in crystal structure, the highest capacitance value was obtained as 560 F/g. According to Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis, it was found that thin films contained around 75% molybdenum, equally distributed on the surface of the films. Moreover, we get very interesting results as a result of the capacitance measurements that we have performed with different light sources.
