Keeping in view the contribution of Renewable Energy Storage Systems (RESSs), a certain rise in demand of marine Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) has been observed. To tackle the intermittent behavior of RESs, the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) is integrated in the system. The drawback of BESS is low power density, shorter life, more space requirement, and cost factor. To overcome the problems of BESS, Supercapacitor (SC) is proposed to integrate with BESS. The updated system can achieve better performance with high energy and less space requirements. To gain the maximum advantage from the hybridized system, power management and consumption must be achieved. The propeller system is vital part of marine. However, integration of induction motor to drive propeller results in transients on both ends (source/load). The proper control is required to overcome those transients. In this paper, a new joint control strategy is utilized for PV, conventional diesel power plant, SC, and battery. In this system PV fed HESS and utility grid with new joint control strategy is used to feed lighting load, heating load, and induction motor. The three phase induction motor generates transients with even a small change in load or source voltage. The new control strategy stabilizes the transients due to load side variations mainly induction motor. The simulation results are compared before and after application of three phase load which validates the efficiency of new joint control strategy. The simulation is performed in MATLAB Simulink.
