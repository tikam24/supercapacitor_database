The polyamic acid (PAA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) blends electrospun fibers were prepared by electrospinning method. PAA with high carbon conversion served as carbon nanofibers; PVP with low carbon conversion served as porogenic sacrificial agent. Then, the PAA-PVP-based carbon nanofibers with well-controlled meso/macro pore structure were obtained via thermally induced phase separation process. The morphology and electrochemical performance of porous carbon nanofibers are investigated by structural analysis and electrochemical measurements. The relationship among pore structure, character of electrolyte and electrochemical performance of porous carbon nanofibers was extensively evaluated. Porous carbon nanofibers derived from PAA-PVP (mass ratio = 5:2) electrospun fibers show adjustable average pore diameter (3.1 nm), high BET specific surface area (743.5 m2 g−1), and average pore volume (0.126 cm3 g−1). The supercapacitor constructed by porous nanofibers as electrode in ionic liquids electrolyte exhibits wide electrochemical stability window (3.4 V), high specific capacity (211.7 F g−1), good power density (2021 W kg−1), and low internal resistance (1.0 Ω). The findings reveal a guideline of the preparation of blending polymer-based porous carbon nanofibers for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
