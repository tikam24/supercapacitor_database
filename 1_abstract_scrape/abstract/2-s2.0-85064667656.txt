Trimanganese tetraoxide (Mn3O4)nanoframeworks were successfully prepared using a novel and facile hydrothermal route based on the redox–reaction between KMnO4 and formamide. The volume ratio between formamide and water has a crucial effect on the sample's morphology. When applied as the electrode material for supercapacitors, Mn3O4 nanoframeworks delivered a high specific capacity of 568 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention of 98.3% after 5000 continuous cycles at 5 A g−1. The excellent performance was ascribed to its unique hollow and mesoporous features. Furthermore, Mn3O4//Bi2O3 asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC)was assembled using Mn3O4 nanoframeworks as a positive electrode and Bi2O3 nanoflowers as a negative electrode, respectively. The device delivered a maximum energy density of 16.4 W h kg−1 at 187.5 W kg−1. A Mn3O4//Bi2O3 ASC device can drive a mini–fan, indicating that Mn3O4 nanoframework is a potential positive electrode material for ASCs.
