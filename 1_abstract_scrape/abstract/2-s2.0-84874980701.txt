Nickel hydroxide mesoporous structures are synthesized by a simple method in the presence of different additives (oxalic acid, aminoacetic acid, and sulfosalicylic acid). Structural characterizations reveal that the additives can affect the crystal structure, increase the specific surface area, and reduce the pore size of the products. The electrochemical properties of the synthesized Ni(OH)2 samples are dependent on their crystal phase, surface area, and pore size distribution. Mesoporous β-Ni(OH)2 with poor crystallinity shows high specific capacitances at different current densities and excellent cycling ability. A highest specific capacitance of 1,693 F g-1 can be achieved at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1. The results suggest its potential application in electrochemical supercapacitors. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
