Titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx, where Tx refers to -Cl, –F, –OH and ​= ​O) shows ultrahigh electronic conductivity but restricted rate performance for supercapacitors due to prolonged ion transport caused by the restacking of 2D materials. In this work, an ultrafast laser writing technique is used for alleviating the restacking issue by opening up the restacked layers and creating pores through instantaneous photothermal gasification of interlayer water and partial surface groups. The rate performance of Ti3C2Tx film is effectively improved after laser writing. By tuning the line density of laser scanning path, the electrochemical performance can be well controlled and an optimized high capacitance of 322 ​F ​g−1 at 10 ​mV ​s−1 is obtained at relative high rate performance, showing a high capacitance retention of 48% as the scan rate increased by 200-fold. As a result, the symmetric microsupercapacitor with laser written Ti3C2Tx electrodes exhibits a high areal capacitance of 15.03 ​mF ​cm−2 at 10 ​mV ​s−1 with ultrahigh capacitance retention of 33% at 2000 ​mV ​s−1. Moreover, the laser writing process takes only ~1 ​s for an 1 ​cm ​× ​1 ​cm square film, showing superior advantages over other methods and potentials in scale-up production.
