The MnO2 electrodeposited on the surface of the carbon nanofiber mats (MnO2-LCNFM) were prepared from electrospun lignin-g-PAN copolymer via heat treatments and subsequent MnO2 electrodeposition method. The resulting MnO2-LCNFM was evaluateed for its potential use in a supercapicitor electrode. The increase of MnO2 electric deposition time was revealed to increase diameter of carbon nanofibers as well as MnO2 content on the surface of carbon nanofiber mats as confirmed by scanning electon microscope (SEM) analysis. The electrochemical properties of MnO2-LCNFM electrodes are evaluated through cyclic voltammetry test. It was shown that MnO2-LCNFM electrode exhibited good electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 168.0 mF.cm-2. The MnO2-LCNFM supercapacitor successfully fabricated using the gel electrolyte (H3PO4/Polyvinyl alcohol) showed to have the capacitance efficiency of âˆ¼90%, and stable behavior during 1,000 charging/discharging cycles.
