Lithium ion capacitors (LICs), which elaborately integrate the feature of supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries have recently aroused extensive research attentions. Nevertheless, balancing the discrepancy of electrochemical kinetics between capacitive-type cathode and battery-type anode materials plays the pivotal role in constructing high-performance of LICs. Additionally, the cathode and anode of LICs usually adopt various material synthesis routes, making the fabrication procedures complicated and expensive from the perspective of energy storage devices. Herein, the one‑carbon dual-purpose strategy is proposed for simultaneous manipulation of MoSe2/layered microporous carbon heterostructure anode (MoSe2@LMC-1.5) and amorphous microporous carbon cathode (LMC) by using maize stalks precursor. The Mo–C bond formed on the interface of MoSe2 and LMC favors electron and Li-ion transfer in the composite. The amorphous microporous carbon substrate can not only ameliorate electrical conductivity of molybdenum selenide, but also tremendously suppress serious agglomeration of MoSe2 nanoparticles. The optimized mass ratio MoSe2@LMC-1.5 heterostructure remarkably improves the lithium ion storage performance. More importantly, in the potential window (0–4.5 V), LIC (MoSe2@LMC-1.5//LMC) device displays a higher energy/power output (maximum 108 Wh kg−1/221 W kg−1 and 68 Wh kg−1/2295 W kg−1) along with good cycling life.
