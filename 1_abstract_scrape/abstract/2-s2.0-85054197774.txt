The aim of this work refers to study the effect of electro-polymerization method on supercapacitive properties of a known polymer nanocomposite. Herein, poly (o-Anisidine)/multi-walled carbon nanotube (POA/CNT) nanocomposites for supercapacitor applications are prepared by various electrochemical techniques including potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and galvanostatic. The electrochemical response of the prepared POA/CNT by potentiostatic method, is higher than those which are prepared by other methods. The scanning electron microscopy images show that as the preparation method changes from galvanostatic to potentiostatic, the nanocomposite possesses more pronounced porosity. Also, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that with changing the electro-polymerization method from galvanostatic to potentiostatic, the charge transfer resistance decreases. The obtained specific capacitances by galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements for the nanocomposites which are prepared by potentiodynamic, potentiostatic and galvanostatic methods at 0.6 A g−1 are evaluated at about 177, 323 and 81 F g−1, respectively. Moreover, energy densities for the composite which are prepared by potentiostatic, potentiodynamic and galvanostatic methods at 0.6 A g−1, are calculated at about 16, 8.8 and 4 Wh kg−1, respectively. The results indicate that the electrode material prepared by the potentiostatic method, exhibits a better supercapacitive performance.
