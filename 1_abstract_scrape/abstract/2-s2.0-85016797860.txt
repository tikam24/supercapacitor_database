Recently, the preparation of flexible graphene-based micro-supercapacitors has attracted considerable attention. In this paper, a flexible and all-solid-state micro-supercapacitor was fabricated by LightScribe technology. Additionally, the influences of the drop-cast amount of graphene oxide (GO) and the numbers of LightScribe times on the performance of the supercapacitor were systematically investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge. It was determined that the electrochemical performance of the micro-supercapacitor was optimal when the drop-cast amount was 0.38 mg cm2. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the capacitance and the number of LightScribe times. The maximum capacitance was 2.9 mF cm2, which was reached with 20 rounds of LightScribe.
