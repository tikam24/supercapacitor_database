Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and Vulcan carbon (VC) decorated with SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized using a facile and versatile sonochemical procedure. The as-prepared nanocomposites were characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infra red spectroscopy. It was evidenced that SnO2 nanoparticles were uniformly distributed on both carbon surfaces, tightly decorating the MWCNTs and VC. The electrochemical performance of the nanocomposites was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. The as-synthesized SnO2/MWCNTs nanocomposites show a higher capacity than the SnO2/VC nanocomposites. Concretely, the SnO2/MWCNTs electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance of 133.33 F g-1, whereas SnO2/VC electrodes exhibit a specific capacitance of 112.14 F g-1 measured at 0.5 mA cm-2 in 1 M Na2SO4.
