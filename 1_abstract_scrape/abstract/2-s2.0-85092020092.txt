Nowadays battery is used to stabilize the DC bus voltage but battery has low power density and high energy density. Whereas the supercapacitor has high power density but low energy density. So, for high energy and power density the integration of battery and supercapacitor is more efficient. It is more challenging to integrate the different sources. So it is required a control strategy to integrate the battery and supercapacitor and provide continuous power to the load. It has also shown that the battery and supercapacitor charged in access mode of power and discharged in deficit mode of power. In this paper proposed a new approach to control the power and dc bus voltage.
