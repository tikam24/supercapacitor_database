The work explains the development of the optical and electrochemical properties of Yttrium oxide (Y2O3) nanoparticles (NPs) via the incorporation with the modified membrane of graphene oxide /carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (GO@CMC) to form the modified nanomaterials (GO@CMC.Y2O3). The nanohybrid materials (NHM) were characterized and the improvement properties were tested with UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis) and potentiostat apparatus. The optical properties of (GO@CMC.Y2O3) NHM have been studied with improving in the efficiency of the electron transfer through the photocatalytic process, where NHM was tested with degradation efficiency of the methylene blue dye (MB) and calculation the efficiency. The rate constant of the degradation process (kob) with different times was recorded at 12×10−4, 16×10−4, 25×10−4, and 40×10−4 min−1 for Y2O3 NPs, CMC@Y2O3, GO@Y2O3, and GO@CMC.Y2O3, respectively. The efficiency of photodegradation with MB were 9%, 32%, 43%, and 52% for Y2O3 NPs, CMC@Y2O3, GO@Y2O3, and GO@CMC.Y2O3, respectively after exposure to the source of light for 80 min. The improved optical properties enable the NHM to promise a candidate modified membrane for removal the organic pollutant. The improved electrochemical properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry technique, where cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel plot, and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been detected, the results enable the NHM to promise candidate for energy storage and supercapacitors application.
