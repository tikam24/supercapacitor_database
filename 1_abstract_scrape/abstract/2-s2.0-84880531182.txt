The present study represents a simple and scalable method that involves in situ polymerization of cobalt chloride (CoCl2·6H2O) doped aniline in the presence of graphene nanoplates (GNPs) in HCl medium, for the preparation of CoCl2 doped polyaniline (PANI)/GNP composites (PGC) as a supercapacitor electrode material with noteworthy performance. The maximum specific capacitance and energy density of the PGC composites were found to be ≈634 F g-1 and ≈427 W h kg-1, respectively, at a 10 mV s-1 scan rate. Through judicious control of the GNP content and CoCl2 doped PANI in the composites, a very high electrical conductivity (≈12.2 S cm-1) was achieved at unprecedented low GNP content. The PGC composites also exhibited high alternating current (AC) electrical conductivity in the frequency region of ∼101 to ∼107 Hz. The morphology of the composites was successfully studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013.
