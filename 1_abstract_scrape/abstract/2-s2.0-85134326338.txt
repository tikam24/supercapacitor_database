This investigation is motivated by increasing interest in ferrimagnetic materials and composites, which exhibit electrical capacitance. It addresses the need for the development of magnetic materials with enhanced capacitive properties and low electrical resistance. γ-Fe2O3-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites are developed by colloidal processing and studied for energy storage in negative electrodes of supercapacitors. High energy ball milling (HEBM) of ferrimagnetic γ-Fe2O3 nanoparticles results in enhanced capacitive properties. The effect of HEBM on particle morphology is analyzed. Gallocyanine is used as a co-dispersant for γ-Fe2O3 and MWCNTs. The polyaromatic structure and catechol ligand of gallocyanine facilitated its adsorption on γ-Fe2O3 and MWCNTs, respectively, and facilitated their electrostatic dispersion and mixing. The adsorption mechanisms are discussed. The highest capacitance of 1.53 F·cm−2 is achieved in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for composites, containing γ-Fe2O3, which is high energy ball milled and co-dispersed with MWCNTs using gallocyanine. HEBM and colloidal processing strategies allow high capacitance at low electrical resistance, which facilitates efficient charge–discharge. Obtained composites are promising for fabrication of multifunctional devices based on mutual interaction of ferrimagnetic and capacitive properties.
