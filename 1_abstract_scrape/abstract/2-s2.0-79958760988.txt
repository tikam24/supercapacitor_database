This paper presents a method for improving the dynamic behavior of power supply (batteries) used to power equipment with wide range of load current. It shows the calculation and the performance of the battery and circuit SC hybrid source (battery) - supercapacitor designed for small portable power supply circuits such as SSB, transmitters GSM and GPRS. It is presented the results in a hybrid circuit battery and supercapacitor tested.
