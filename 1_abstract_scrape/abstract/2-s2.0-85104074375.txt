Ultrafine porous carbon nanofiber network with ~40 nm fiber diameter is realized for the first time utilizing a biobased polymer as carbon precursor. A simple one-step carbonization procedure is applied to convert the electrospun chitosan/poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers to self-N-doped ultrafine hierarchically porous carbon nanofiber interconnected web. The pore formation process is governed by the immiscible nature of the two polymers and the sacrificial character of poly(ethylene oxide) with low carbon yield at the carbonization temperature (800 °C). The obtained porous scaffold has a high specific surface area (564 m2 g−1), high micro (0.22 cm3 g−1) as well as meso/macropore volume (0.28 cm3 g−1). Structural analysis indicates high graphitic content and the existence of turbostratic carbon typical for carbon fibers derived from otherwise synthetic polymer precursors. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of an N-doped structure with dominating graphitic N, together with a smaller amount of pyridinic N. The prepared electrode exhibits good electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor device. The excellent charge storage characteristics are attributed to the unique ultrafine hierarchical nanoarchitecture and the interconnected N-doped carbon structure. This green material holds great promise for the realization of more sustainable high-performance energy storage devices.
