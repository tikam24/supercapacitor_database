Electronic conducting polymers are a polymer family able to reversibly switch from a doped (conducting) state to a dedoped (semi-conducting) state. This feature leads to polymer properties modifications (conductivity, absorbance, volume) which are functions of their doping level but also of their molecular and macromolecular structures. This paper is purposed to demonstrate how the diversity of conjugated monomers (commercially available or synthetized) and the diversity of polymerization pathways allow to perfectly control and adapt the properties of these materials to the applications. This point will be depicted through the development of electroactive devices that can be used as supercapacitors (energy storage), as mechanical actuators (precursors of artificial muscles) or electrochromic devices (smart windows or displays).
