In this work we have carried out synthesis of porous three dimensional nickel hydroxide (3D-β-Ni(OH)2) microflowers by chemical bath deposition. The structure of the porous 3D-β-Ni(OH)2 microflowers characterized by using FT-IR, TGA, XRD, FE-SEM, TEM and XPS. The specific capacitance of the porous 3D-β-Ni(OH)2 microflowers were showing around 249F/g from cyclic voltammetry. The discharge specific capacitance of the porous 3D-β-Ni(OH)2 microflowers were found to be 170 and 245F/g for the 1st and 8000th cycles, respectively. The energy and power density of the porous 3D-β-Ni(OH)2 microflowers found to be 8.5Wh/kg and 2497.9W/kg, respectively at the discharge current density of 0.05A/g.
