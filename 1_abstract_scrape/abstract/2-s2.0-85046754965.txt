The influence of ultrasonic radiation in the cavitation regime on the properties of wood activated carbon has been studied. The optimum mode of ultrasound treatment that leads to increase of specific capacity of supercapacitors from 52 F/g to 151 F/g was determined. It was shown that ultrasound treatment does not cause significant changes in porous structure of activated carbon, but reduces the amount of surface groups. The impedance dependencies for the supercapacitors made both of the original and modified carbon have been analyzed. The equivalent electrical circuits modelling the impedance hodographs have been constructed. De Levie impedance model, modified by series connection of parallel RSCCSC-links, was used. It has been shown that ultrasonic radiation changes the properties of the surface and the Fermi level position shifts to the energy region with high states density of delocalised electrons.
