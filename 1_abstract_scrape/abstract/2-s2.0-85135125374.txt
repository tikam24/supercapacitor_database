Battery-like electrode materials have a high theoretical capacity but suffer from low electrical conductivity and poor structural stability, which are expected to be solved by revealing bulk reaction kinetics of crystal structure to improve the electrochemical performance. Herein, we grow NiCo-LDH single-crystal nanowires along the [0 0 3] crystal plane on the surface of amorphous SiO2 hollow spheres. This heterostructured architecture provides a synergistic effect among different components and enlarges the interlayer spacing of the grown NiCo-LDH single-crystal, offering more reactive sites and improving electrical conductivity. The prepared NiCo-LDH@SiO2/C electrode demonstrates ultra-high rate capability with 78.1 % capacitance retention even after a 40-fold increase in the current density. The asymmetric supercapacitors with NiCo-LDH@SiO2/C cathode and active carbon anode could deliver a maximum energy density of 47.6 Wh/g at 1383 W/kg. This work presents a new method to guide the design of NiCo-LDH electrode materials and opens up a new opportunity to develop high-performance battery-type electrode materials for pseudocapacitors.
