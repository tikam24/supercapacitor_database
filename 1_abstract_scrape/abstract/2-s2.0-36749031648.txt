The need to improve fuel economy and reduce the emission of CO2 and other harmful pollution from internalcombustion-engine vehicles has led to engine downsizing. However, downsized turbocharged engines exhibit a relatively low torque capability at low engine speeds. To overcome this problem, an electrical torque boost may be employed while accelerating and changing gear and to facilitate energy recovery during regenerative braking. This paper describes the operational requirements of a supercapacitor-based torque-boost system, outlines the design and sizing of the electrical drive-train components, and presents experimental characterization of a demonstrator system.
