The demand of efficient energy harvesting and storage devices is continuously increasing with ever-escalating consumption of energy. The sustainability of the energy production depends upon the effectiveness of the storage devices. Among various alternative energy storage devices, batteries and supercapacitors are gaining recent research attention due to their extraordinary energy storage performance. In recent years, Perovskite compounds have become the materials of choice for the development of next-generation energy storage devices. Perovskites possess the desirable material features like high catalytic activity, large oxygen vacancies, ionic mobility, lattice defects, and tunable and stable crystal lattice which makes it a suitable candidate to be used as an alternate electrode material for energy storage devices. In this chapter, a critical outlook has been provided on the emerging research and development trends toward the applications of Perovskites and their composites as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The discussion has been extended to outline the influence of parameters like crystal structure, synthesis method, doping, and morphology on the energy storage performance of Perovskites based supercapacitors.
