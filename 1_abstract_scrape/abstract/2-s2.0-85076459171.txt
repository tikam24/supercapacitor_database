Functionalization of graphene-based materials using chemical moieties not only modify the electronic structure of the underlying graphene but also enable in limited enhancement of targeted properties. Surface modification of graphene-based materials using other nanostructures enhances the effective properties by minimally modifying the properties of pristine graphene backbone. In this pursuit, we have synthesized bio-inspired hierarchical nanostructures based on Ni–Co layered double hydroxide on reduced graphene oxide core–shells using template based wet chemical approach. The material synthesized have been characterized structurally and electrochemically. The fabricated dendritic morphology of the composite delivers a high specific capacity of 1056 Cg−1. A cost effective solid state hybrid supercapacitor device was also fabricated using the synthesized electrode material which shows excellent performance with high energy density and fast charging capability.
