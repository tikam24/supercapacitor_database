In this paper, the incorporation of a highly conductive material (polypyrrole) into a binary metal-oxide core-shell structured composite is adopted to optimize the charge transfer process to further improve electrochemical performance. Because of enhanced electron transfer capability, charge transfer resistances of the ternary core-shell structured composites are reduced and the electrochemical performances are improved. For example, the Co3O4@PPy@MnO2 ternary core-shell heterostructured composite exhibits high specific capacitance and excellent rate capability (53% of capacity retention rate at 40 A g-1 compared with 782 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1). The composite shows good cycling stability with 97.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 A g-1. These results demonstrate the potential of core-shell composites to further improve the performance in supercapacitor electrodes. Â© 2014 the Partner Organisations.
