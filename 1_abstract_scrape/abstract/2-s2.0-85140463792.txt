The development of a supercapacitor management system (SMS) for clean energy applications is crucial to addressing carbon emissions problems. Consequently, state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), and remaining useful life (RUL) for SMS must be developed to evaluate supercapacitor robustness and reliability for mitigating supercapacitor issues related to safety and economic loss. State estimation of SMS results in safe operation and eliminates undesirable event occurrences and malfunctions. However, state estimations of SMS are challenging and tedious, as SMS is subject to various internal and external factors such as internal degradation mechanism and environmental factors. This review presents a comprehensive discussion and analysis of model-based and data-driven-based techniques for SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations of SMS concerning outcomes, advantages, disadvantages, and research gaps. The work also investigates various key implementation factors such as a supercapacitor test bench platform, experiments, a supercapacitor cell, data pre-processing, data size, model operation, functions, hyperparameter adjustments, and computational capability. Several key limitations, challenges, and issues regarding SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations are outlined. Lastly, effective suggestions are outlined for future research improvements towards delivering accurate and effective SOC, SOH, and RUL estimations of SMS. Critical analysis and discussion would be useful for developing accurate SMS technology for state estimation of a supercapacitor with clean energy and high reliability, and will provide significant contributions towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) to achieve global collaboration and sustainable development goals (SDGs).
