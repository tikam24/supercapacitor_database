As a new type of two-dimensional material, antimonene, which was first reported in 2015, has attracted widely attention from scientific community because of the unique optical properties, crumpled structure, large interlamellar channel size, fast ion diffusion performance, and excellent environmental stability. Its preparation method and application has been an international hot research topic in recent years. In practical application, the design of preparation method of high quality antimonene is the key to realize its unique performance. To better prepare antimonene and use its properties, in this paper, the preparation methods for antimonene reported in recent years are introduced in detail, including mechanical stripping method, liquid phase stripping method, electrochemical stripping method, wet chemical method, epitaxy method, and other methods. The application of antimonene in the fields of electrocatalysis and energy storage are introduced in detail. And the corresponding summary and prospect are discussed. The problems existing in the application of antimonene in supercapacitors are analyzed in detail, which provides ideas for the further exploration of antimonene in supercapacitors. This paper is helpful for researchers to quickly understand and master the different preparation methods of antimonene and its application in the fields of electrocatalysis and energy storage, and provides a reference for researchers to understand and utilize the unique properties of antimonene.
