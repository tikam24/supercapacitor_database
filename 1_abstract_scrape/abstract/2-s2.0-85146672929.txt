The marine controlled-source electromagnetic (MCSEM) transmitter has been an effective tool for identifying various electrically resistive structures. This study proposes a supercapacitor (SC) based energy storage system that can produce high pulsed power signals with a constant current for 10 seconds. An electrical equivalent model is to characterize the SC behavior and to facilitate a design for the SC module to improve the terminal voltage gain. However, overcoming the rapid terminal voltage drop during the SC discharge cycle is a challenging task. We use a PID-controlled DC/DC boost converter coupled with the SC module to control the time-varying terminal voltage during both charging and discharging cycles. A dual active bridge (DAB) converter is used to generate high-power pulsed waveforms. Finally, the generated pulsed output is used to simulate an electromagnetic (EM) transmitter based on the SEG/EAGE salt model. The EM fields show that the SC-based transmitter is effective for a practical application.
