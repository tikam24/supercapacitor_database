2D decorated nanostructures are fast emerging as efficient electrode materials for electrochemical devices. Au decorated SnO2, synthesized using co-precipitation and hydrothermal methods, can become a useful electrode material for supercapacitors. Au incorporation helps to mitigate the conductivity issues of SnO2 nanostructures. The superior 2D-flake like morphology leads to appreciable performance enhancement, with specific capacitance of 234 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 current density, which is much larger than that observed in pristine SnO2. The high cycling stability of Au-decorated SnO2 clearly shows its usefulness for high-performance supercapacitors. A theoretical model is also reported to explain the electrochemical results.
