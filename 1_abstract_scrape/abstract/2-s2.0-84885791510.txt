This study reports the preparation of nitrogen doped graphene (NG) by hydrothermal synthesis. The morphology, structure, and composition of the prepared NG were confirmed with SEM, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The material was tested for supercapacitive behavior. Our emphasis here is focused on the method of synthesis as an energy saving process, compared to other methods utilizing high temperatures or plasma techniques. The results confirmed that 2.77% nitrogen was chemically doped to graphene. Furthermore, it was found that doping with nitrogen increased the supercapacitance of graphene by 45%, reaching 131 F/g. An equivalent two electrode cell fabricated from NG material could provide energy density as high as 4.55 Wh/kg and a stable average power density of 2.46 kW/kg. Â© The Electrochemical Society.
