Wearable supercapacitors based on carbon materials have been emerging as an advanced technology for next-generation portable electronic devices with high performance. However, the application of these devices cannot be realized unless suitable flexible power sources are developed. Here, an effective electrospinning method was used to prepare the one-dimensional (1D) and nanoscale carbon fiber membrane based on potassium citrate/polyacrylonitrile (PAN), which exhibited potential applications in supercapacitors. The chemical and physical properties of carbon nanofibers were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and the Brunnauer–Emmett– Teller method. The fabricated carbon nanofiber membrane illustrates a high specific capacitance of 404 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The good electrochemical properties could be attributed to the small diameter and large specific surface area, which promoted a high capacity.
