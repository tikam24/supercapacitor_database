Growing active materials on conductive substrates and constructing three-dimensional structures are indispensable to prepare high energy density supercapacitors. Here, the composite material PANI/NiMn/NMP with a three-dimensional multi-layer structure and polyaniline as the interlayer was prepared on carbon cloth substrate by electrochemical deposition method. The interlayer of polyaniline strengthens the interface between the active material and the conductive substrate, which can effectively improve the cycle stability of the prepared integrated electrode. And the three-dimensional array structure provides abundant active sites and promotes the rapid transport of ions and electrons. NiMn-LDH that has been treated with electrochemical activation and the coating of NiMn phosphate with high conductivity can effectively improve the specific capacitance and cycling stability of the electrode material. The test results show that PANI/NiMn/NMP has high specific capacitance (2013 F g−1) and good cycling stability (retaining 87.38 % of the initial capacity after 5000 cycles). Furthermore, the asymmetric supercapacitor obtained by assembling PANI/NiMn/NMP and activated carbon has an energy density of 41.23 W h kg−1 at a power density of 673.2 W kg−1.
