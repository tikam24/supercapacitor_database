Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest material due to its well-defined pores, large surface areas and abundant coordinatable structures. Herein, a {[Zn(BTC)]·2H2O} n·MOF (ZB) (BTC = 1,3,5-Benzenetricarboxylic acid) was synthesized via high-temperature hydrothermal method, then direct carbonization of the combination of {[Zn(BTC)]·2H2O} n·MOF/potassium citrate with different mass ratios a porous carbon composite materials (ZBPC-T-A) was obtained (P refers potassium citrate, C refers porous carbon, T refers the carbonization temperature, and A refers the mass ratio of ZB crystals to potassium citrate). The ZBPC-800-1:5 with mesoporous structure shows a high specific surface area of 1592 ± 36 m2 g–1. To further illustrate the properties of ZBPCs, the MOF-derived porous carbon materials ZBPCs was applied as electrode material for supercapacitor, the results indicate the excellent electrochemical properties, stable multiplicity and cycling performance of ZBPCs. The specific capacitances were 157 ± 3 F g–1 for ZBC-800 and 201 ± 2 F g–1 for ZBPC-800-1:5 at a current density of 1.0 A g–1, respectively. The specific capacitance decay rates were 22.39% for ZBC-800 and 21.90% for ZBPC-800-1:5 when the current density was increased from 1.0 to 10.0 A g–1, respectively. After 5000 cycles, the capacitance retention rate was still 90.41% for ZBPC-800-1:5 at a current density of 1.0 A g–1. The experiments show that the porous carbon composite materials can be used for energy storage, and it provides a new way to prepare porous carbon composite materials derived from MOFs.
