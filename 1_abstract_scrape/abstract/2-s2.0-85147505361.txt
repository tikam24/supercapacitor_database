Supercapacitors (SCs) have demonstrated great potential for integration into future wearable and implantable electronics, yet the insufficient environmental adaption and biosafety limit their further development. To this regard, application of biodegradable polymers is considered as an ideal solution strategy for the environmentally sound disposal of SCs. The biodegradable polymers with satisfactory degradability and excellent biocompatibility demonstrate an irreplaceable role in the future development of SCs and provide an ideal solution strategy for its environmentally sound disposal. In this review, the research progress and challenges of biodegradable polymers in the field of SCs are discussed and analyzed. First, the classification of existing biodegradable polymers and their typical structure, properties, and preparation processes are elucidated. Subsequently, the main applications of biodegradable polymers in different components of SCs, including electrodes, electrolytes, substrate, and encapsulation materials, are summarized. In addition, the research progress of biodegradable polymer-based SCs in terms of preparation strategies and modification methods is summarized, and the key role of biodegradable polymers in the development process of green SCs is deeply discussed. Finally, the future perspectives and challenges faced by the biodegradable polymer-based SCs are briefly proposed.
