A strategy is proposed to harvest enhanced capacitive performances using successive reaction mechanism in ternary manganese oxide composite electrodes. Manganese oxide composite electrodes in KOH aqueous electrolyte with various weight ratio are studied by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge techniques. The results show that weight ratio in composite electrodes exerts great influence on capacitive behavior and that composite electrodes deliver higher specific capacitance than pure oxide ones. In MnO2/Mn2O3 binary oxide electrodes, 1:1 is the optimal weight ratio. For MnO2/Mn2O3/Mn3O4 ternary oxide electrodes, 1:1:2 electrode displays double capacitance of MnO2/Mn2O3 electrode (1:1), benefiting from the successive reactions due to the variable valence of manganese element in the composite electrode.
