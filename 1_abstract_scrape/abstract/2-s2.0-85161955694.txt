The evolution of energy storage devices that have specific capacitance, high power density, and high energy density is an important for human life. Supercapacitor is a complimentary of replacement a battery that has been extensively developed. The supercapacitor shows the high capacity and power density. The disadvantage of energy density of supercapacitor may be overcome by combining with the advantage of battery in supercapattery. Supercapattery is an ideal type of energy storage because it has a good energy density of batteries and a greater power density of supercapacitors. Cobalt and Zinc are transition metal electrodes that have been widely studied as supercapacitor electrode materials because they have high conductivity and electrochemical activity. Here, Mn2O3 material has high redox and is non-toxic, so it has the potential to be used as electrode material in supercapattery. Initially, the two materials were synthesized into a composite paste which was then deposited on the substrate using the doctor blade method. Furthermore, the electrode M/Mn2O3 (M = Zn, Co) was arranged with a separator and the 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte to forms a supercapattery. In this work, we have the specific capacitance of 46.95 F·g-1 for supercapattery (Zn/AC/Mn2O3//AC) and 21.83 F·g-1 for (Co/AC/Mn2O3//AC).
