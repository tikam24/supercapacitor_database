In this work, Ag anchored ZnSb 2 O 6 nanostructured electrode materials have been prepared by facile ultrasonication assisted chemical reduction approach. The diverse properties of Ag anchored ZnSb 2 O 6 electrode materials were characterized through XRD, FT-IR, FE-SEM, UV visible spectroscopy, PL, XPS and BET analysis. The results suggest that Ag nanoparticles are homogeneously distributed on ZnSb 2 O 6 nanorods. While evaluating as a supercapacitor electrode material, Ag anchored ZnSb 2 O 6 electrode exhibits pseudocapacitance with fast faradaic reactions with the maximum specific capacitance of 165.9 F g −1 at a charge/discharge current density of 1.0 A g −1 with 98.0% initial capacitance retained after 2000 cycles. The superior pseudocapacitive properties of Ag anchored ZnSb 2 O 6 are attributed to its unique structure, large surface area to volume for easy access of electrolyte ions and Ag anchored on ZnSb 2 O 6 nanorod has improved the electrical conductivity of the as-prepared electrode and also provided fast electron transfer kinetics for better electrochemical reactions. The results confirm that Ag anchored ZnSb 2 O 6 are advantageous as potential electrochemical energy storage materials in supercapacitors.
