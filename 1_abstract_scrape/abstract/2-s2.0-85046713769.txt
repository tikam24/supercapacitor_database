A common but important problem of carbon-based supercapacitors unresolved is the difficulty of achieving high specific capacitance over a wide voltage window when the electrodes are assembled into devices. Adjusting the structure of carbon materials is expected to tune the electrode potential and the surface charge density of the electrode materials, and thus further enhance the energy density of carbon-based supercapacitors. Herein, an efficient surface charge control strategy was developed to remarkably enhance the energy density of porous N, O codoped vertically aligned carbon nanosheets (VACNs) based solid-state symmetric supercapacitors through unzipping N, O codoped carbon tubes by transition metal atoms. Originating from the synergetic effect of vertically aligned structure and the doped N, O atoms, the assembled solid-state symmetric supercapacitor based on N, O codoped VACNs electrodes exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. The synthesis strategy may enlighten the design and fabrication of well-defined carbon-based nanomaterials that have potential applications in energy storage and other area.
