This paper presents control of hybrid energy storage system for electric vehicle using battery and ultracapacitor for effective power and energy support for an urban drive cycle. The mathematical vehicle model is developed in MATLAB/Simulink to obtain the tractive power and energy requirement for the urban drive cycle. This HESS system is implemented with a dual bidirectional DC-DC converter configuration with their individual control to integrate the battery and UC across a common DC link. A rule-based energy management strategy is formulated for sharing of the tractive power demand between the two sources by maintaining State of Charges within a desired limit. Experiments were carried out under various test conditions and the results were presented. A significant reduction in battery stress, especially during acceleration and sudden braking is observed due to the pulse power support from ultracapacitor.
