Bi2O3 nanoparticles coupled with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanostructure were synthesized through liquid-phase precipitation and calcination method, and their supercapacitor properties were studied as negative electrode materials. The as-prepared Bi2O3/rGO achieved a maximum specific capacitance of 1423 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, excellent electrochemical stability (capacity retention of 81.8% from 1 A g−1 to 10 A g−1), and long-cycle stability (capacity retention of 63% over 5000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performance should be due to the abundant active sites provided by rGO combined with proper loading of Bi2O3 nanoparticles. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
