Hypothesis: Three-dimensional layered layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanostructure materials grow in-situ on excellent conductive and flexible carbon cloth (CC) substrate not only reduce the ability of binders in resisting ions transfer, but also make them to be quasi-vertically arranged well on substrates without aggregation. This would result in enough electroactive sites, to obtain superior electrochemical performance. Experiments: A hierarchical CoAl-LDH@NiCo-LDH composite was prepared on a surface-modified carbon cloth by a simple two-step hydrothermal process. In this process, CoAl-LDH nanosheets (NSs)/CC acting as the inner core were wrapped up in NiCo-LDH nanoneedle arrays (NNAs) evenly. Also, a flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor device was constructed using CoAl-LDH@NiCo-LDH/CC and activated carbon (AC) as a positive electrode and a negative electrode, respectively. Findings: The CoAl-LDH@NiCo-LDH/CC developed had an excellent specific capacitance (2633.6F/g at 1 A/g) with remarkable cyclic performance (92.5% retention of its incipient over 5000 cycles at 4 A/g). The flexible quasi-solid-state supercapacitor device CoAl-LDH@NiCo-LDH/CC//AC/CC yielded a splendid energy density of 57.8 Wh/kg at a power density of 0.81 kW/kg and a brilliant power density of 16.09 kW/kg at 38.0 Wh/kg in a broad potential window of 1.55 V. Furthermore, the exceptional cyclic stability and excellent flexibility of the device show it can be applied in flexible energy storage systems.
