Discotic hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (HBC) molecules are synthesized by electrochemical cyclodehydrogenation reaction and in situ self-assembled to π-electronic, discrete nanofibular objects with an average diameter about 70 nm, which are deposited directly onto the electrode. The nanofibers consist of columnar arrays of the π-stacked HBC molecules and the intercolumnar distance is determined to be 1.19 nm by X-ray diffraction, which corresponds well to the distance of 1.1 nm observed by high-resolution transmitting electron microscopy. The diameter of the molecular columns matches the size of the discotic HBC molecule indicating face-to-face π-stacking of HBC units in the column. The HBC nanofibers on electrode are redox active, and the nanosized columnar structures provide a huge surface area, which is a great benefit for the charging/discharging process, delivering excellent capacitance of 155 F g-1. The described electrochemical deposition method shows great advantage for self-assembling the family of insoluble and structurally designable graphene-like nano materials, which constitutes an important step toward molecular electronics.
