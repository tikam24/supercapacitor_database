Transition metal cobaltites and their composite materials have high charge storage and electron transport capacities due to their multidimensional morphological structures. In recent years, transition metal cobaltites have become a research hotspot in the field of electrochemistry due to their natural abundance, safety and low cost. In this paper, recent advances in the electrochemical application of transition metal cobaltites and their composites as electrode materials or as electrocatalysts in electrochemistry, such as supercapacitors (SCs), lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), electrocatalysts and electrochemical sensors, are introduced. The effects of the nanostructures of transition metal cobaltites on their electrochemical properties and other development strategies are discussed. Finally, the problems that need to be overcome to further improve the electrochemical properties of cobaltites are summarized, and developmental directions for transition metal cobaltites and their composites in the field of electrochemistry are proposed.
