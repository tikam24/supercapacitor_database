Graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), have been widely used as promising two-dimensional nanoscale building blocks due to their fascinating properties, cost-effective production, and good processability. Understanding the intrinsic self-assembling, colloidal, and rheological features of graphene derivatives is of critical importance to establish the formation-structure-property relationship of graphene-based materials. This article reviews recent progresses in our studies of these interesting properties of graphene derivatives for developing high performance supercapacitors. The content is organized to include characteristics of the dispersions of graphene derivatives, self-assembly of nanosheets from liquid medium, colloidal behavior, rheological properties of the dispersions, processing methods based on the properties, and performance of the fabricated supercapacitors. GO and RGO nanosheets are proved to form different types of assembled structures with unique morphologies, such as ultrathin layer-by-layer films, porous aggregates, and nanoscrolls. The unique rheological properties of GO dispersions and hydrogels, feasible for both the traditional wet-processing and newly-developed technology like three-dimensional printing, are highlighted for their potential in structural manipulation and scalable fabrication of graphene-based devices. The research devoted to up-grading the performance of supercapacitors is presented in some details, which could be applicable for fabricating other graphene-based energy storage devices. Some challenges and perspectives in our point of view are given in the last part of this feature article.
