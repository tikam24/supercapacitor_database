As anionic insertion pseudopotential electrode, perovskite oxides have attracted more and more attention due to their high electrical conductivity and oxygen vacancy concentration. In this study, double perovskite PrBaCo2O5+δ (PBCO) oxide was synthesized by simple sol-gel method. Phase composition, porous structure and surface chemistry were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves were used to explore the electrochemical performance. The tests show that the PBCO electrodes exhibit good capacitance performance with the high specific capacity value of 428.2 C g−1 at 1 mV s−1. Furthermore, the capacitance retention still achieves 93% after 2000 cycles, showing excellent cycling stability. This paper analyzes the capacitance behavior of PBCO electrodes, and demonstrates the insertion mechanism that oxygen vacancies are filled by oxygen ions. All these prove that PrBaCo2O5+δ has potential applications in supercapacitors.
