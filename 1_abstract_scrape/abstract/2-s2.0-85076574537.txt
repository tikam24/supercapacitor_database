Hierarchical MnO2 arrays with nanowire-built multitripod structures were successfully deposited on porous carbon nanofibers (PCNFs) by a simple electrospinning followed by redox reaction. The unique multitripod architectures of MnO2 nanowire arrays pave well-developed network for rapid electron transfer and improve entire mechanical stability. Additionally, this hierarchical porosity of PCNFs substrate is favorable for guaranteeing sufficient penetration of electrolyte ions. Benefiting from all synergistic effects, the as-prepared MnO2/PCNFs flexible electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 512 F g− 1 at 1 mA cm− 2, a super rate capability (460 F g− 1 at 50 mA cm− 2) and cycling stability. Moreover, a fabricated symmetrical coin device delivers a specific energy density of 51.2 Wh kg− 1 maintaining the power density of 585.3 W kg− 1 and still keep 15.2 Wh kg− 1 even at the ultra-high power density of 59.7 kW kg− 1. These hierarchical MnO2 arrays comprising unique nanowire-built multitripod structures show potential prospects for future advanced energy storage devices.
