Vanadium nitride (VN) with an appropriate negative potential working window, has been identified as a promising electrode material candidate for supercapacitors due to the high specific capacitance and the excellent electrical conductivity. Herein, the VN/C nanocomposite materials have been successfully prepared by an ultrafast (within two minutes) and large-scale solution combustion synthesis method, and followed ammonia reduction technique. The as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits a unique 2D sheet nanostructure of interconnected VN nanoparticles homogeneously adhering on in-situ generated porous carbon sheet. The as-prepared VN/C nanocomposites present the mesoporous structure with the average pore size of 5.70 nm and the high specific surface area of 36.32 m 2 g âˆ’1 . Such a unique nanostructure can be expected to facilitate the transport of electrolyte ions, enhance the electrical conductivity and improve the stability of the electrode material. As the anode material for supercapacitors, the VN/C nanocomposite display good electrochemical performances. Moreover, the proposed process has the potential for large-scale production of other metal nitride/carbon nanocomposites as high-performance electrode materials.
