The recent advancements in living standards impose massive pressure on existing energy resources such as fossil fuels. Also, the increasing number of inhabitants arises the need to develop eco-friendly and sustainable energy storage systems. In this regard, a large number of researchers have paid increasing attention to the different methods for sustainable energy like the use of solar cells, LEDs, energy-efficient electronic devices, and supercapacitor technology. Since supercapacitors belong to the class of energy storage systems that provides high capacitive performance and charging-discharging stability during long cycles. They also offer higher power density than batteries and higher energy density than capacitors. Since the selection of electrode material and its electrochemical performance is the most determined parameter for supercapacitor performance. The present review focuses on the different types of aqueous electrolyte based electrode material which is differentiated based on energy storage mechanisms for aqueous supercapacitors. Furthermore, the latest nanocomposites reported have been reviewed and differentiated based on their electrochemical performance for aqueous supercapacitor applications. Their future implications have also been discussed.
