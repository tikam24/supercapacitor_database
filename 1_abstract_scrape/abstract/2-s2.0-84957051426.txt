In this work, ultrafine nickel-copper carbonate hydroxide nanowire arrays on copper foam are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method without any adscititious surfactant and binder. The fabricated nickel-copper carbonate hydroxide hierarchical nanowire networks electrodes for supercapacitors in aqueous electrolyte exhibit a significantly enhanced specific capacitance (971 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and energy density (48.55 Wh kg-1 at 541 W kg-1). Meanwhile, the nickel-copper carbonate hydroxide hierarchical nanowire networks as electrode materials have excellent long-life cycling stability, retaining 91.5% of the initial capacitance after 2000 cycles. Thereby, the nickel-copper carbonate hydroxide hierarchical nanowire networks are promising electrode materials for high-energy-density long-life cycling supercapacitor application.
