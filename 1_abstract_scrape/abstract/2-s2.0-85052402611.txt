Different morphology CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (nano random particles, nanospheres, solid nanocubes) are successfully synthesized via a facile one-step method, by controlling the amount of the surfactant. The solid nanocube morphology CoFe2O4 is annealed at 350 Â°C to form porous and hollow structure. The interesting porous hollow nanostructural CoFe2O4 has excellent electrochemical properties.
