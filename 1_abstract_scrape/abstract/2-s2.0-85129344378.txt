Benefitting from the abundance and inexpensive nature of potassium resources, potassium-ion energy storage technology is considered a potential alternative to current lithium-ion systems. Potassium-ion capacitors (PICs) as a burgeoning K-ion electrochemical energy storage device, are capable of delivering high energy at high power without sacrificing lifespan. However, owing to the sluggish kinetics and significant volume change induced by the large K+-diameter, matched electrode materials with good ion accessibility and fast K+ intercalation/deintercalation capability are urgently desired. In this work, pine needles and graphene oxide (GO) are utilized as precursors to fabricate oxygen-doped activated carbon/graphene (OAC/G) porous nanosheet composites. The introduction of GO not only induces the generation of interconnected nanosheet network, but also increases the oxygen-doping content of the composite, thus expanding the graphite interlayer spacing. Experimental analysis combined with first-principle calculations reveal the transport/storage mechanism of K+ in the OAC/G composite anode, demonstrating that the high surface area, sufficient reactive sites, enlarged interlayer distance and open channels in the porous nanosheet network contribute to rapid and effective K+ diffusion and storage. When incorporated with pine needle-activated carbon as cathode, the assembled dual-carbon PICs can function at a high voltage of 5 V, exhibiting a high energy density of 156.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 500 W kg−1 along with a satisfied cycle life, which highlights their potential application in economic and advanced PICs.
