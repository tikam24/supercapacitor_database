Powering a data center is a challenge due to high demand for cloud market and the increasing power density of servers. All major cloud service providers are moving towards energy-wise self-sustained datacenters powered by renewable energy sources. However, when a DC-microgrid solely depends on these sources, power output fluctuations need to be tackled by suitable energy storage devices. The supercapacitor assisted DC-DC converter design presented here is aimed at higher power density server racks supplied by DC-microgrid. In this new power converter topology, a supercapacitor (SC) bank is introduced series to the isolation transformer to temporarily storing energy. The output stage is based on the supercapacitor assisted low dropout regulator (SCALDO) technique to enhance the power quality and efficiency. This new converter is high power, maintenance free alternative to existing battery-based UPS systems.
