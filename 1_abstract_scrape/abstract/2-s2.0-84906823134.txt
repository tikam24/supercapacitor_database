In this work, activated carbon was prepared from Indonesian local orange peel using ZnCl2 activation method at various chemical ratio. Carbonization was done for 1 h at 500°C. The structural and morphological characteristics of orange peel based activated carbons were investigated using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunaeuer-Emmett-Teller surface analyzer. The highest surface area was found about 1200 m2/gr, obtained from the mass ratio of 1:2 (biomass: ZnCl2). Electrochemical measurement was examined by half cells, using 1 M LiPF6 in EC/EMC/DMC solution (1:1:1 v/v) as electrolyte, and Li/Li+ as reference electrode. It was shown from cyclic voltammetry (CV) results that activated carbon from orange peel demonstrated a stable electrochemical characteristics, with specific capacitance of 56 F/g at scan rate of 1mVs-1 at voltage window between 2.5 and 4 V. © The Electrochemical Society.
