In this paper, one-pot approach was used to produce the highly exfoliated reduced graphene oxide-manganese oxide nanocomposites (rGO-MnOx and rGO-Mn3O4) and systematically analyzed by spectral, thermal, elemental and electron microscope. From the FE-SEM analysis confirms the exfoliated reduced graphene oxide-manganese oxide nanocomposites formation. In the nanocomposites, manganese oxide nanoparticles present in the spherical (rGO-Mn3O4), spherical and cube shape (rGO-MnOx). The electrochemical properties of the rGO-MnOx and rGO-Mn3O4 nanocomposites were analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge study. The highly exfoliated rGO-MnOx nanocomposite show the higher electrochemical capacitive responsive than rGO-Mn3O4 nanocomposite. The rGO-MnOx nanocomposite exhibiting the utmost capacitance of 398.8 F g−1 at a sweep rate of 5 mV s−1, the energy density of 23.3 Wh kg−1 and power density of 2001 W kg−1, owing to the synergistic effect of reduced graphene oxide and spherical and cubical shape of manganese oxide nanoparticles.
