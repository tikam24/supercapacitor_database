In this review, a new hybrid system, which comprises of the fuel cell, battery, and supercapacitor is studied by modeling and power management design and optimization. Each device is given a specific role for the overall Optimized power management system. The operation of supercapacitor contains the peak power demand. The transient power demand, which can be controlled by the state of energy of supercapacitor, is assisted by the battery, which is controlled by the fuel cell by virtue of its slow dynamics. This study's parameters are obtained by an optimized framework, which is done by monitoring the level of hydrogen consumption, loading on battery, and quick performance required.
