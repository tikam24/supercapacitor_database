The presence of distributed generation resources in the microgrid, in addition to the many advantages that have been able to optimize performance of power system, decreased the total inertia of the system. It caused that frequency relays will operate in sudden events such as outage of the lines. Battery system with an inverter is a way to tackle this problem. He reacted with an appropriate response while changing frequency and preventing severe frequency changes. In this paper, the effect of the combination of ultracapacitors and lead acid batteries to increase system inertia has been studied. Increasing or decreasing the amount of battery storage system impacts on the cost and stability indices of the microgrid. The optimum sizing of battery storage systems is being redesigned to maintain stability during disruption and minimize implementation and operating costs of the microgrid. It has shown that the combination of lead-acid battery and ultracapacitor has higher performance and lower operating costs than the case of a centralized battery.
