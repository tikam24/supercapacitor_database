This book chapter presents an overview on the electrode materials and electrolytes used in supercapacitors. The working principles, the mechanisms of charge storage, and the configuration of supercapacitors are briefly discussed. A first focus is on electrode materials relying on different charge storage mechanisms, that is, electrochemical double-layer carbon materials and pseudocapacitive transition-metal oxides and metal-sulfides materials. The last part focuses on the electrolytes used in supercapacitors. Classical liquid electrolytes are reviewed and the development of gel- and solid-like electrolytes is presented. The advantages, current limitations, and challenges of electrodes and electrolytes are also addressed.
