Highly conductive polypyrrole/graphene nanosheets/NiO (PPy/GNS/NiO) composites are fabricated via ultrasound technique using p-toluenesulfonic acid as a dopant and FeCl3 as an oxidant. The effects of the GNS and NiO loading on the electrical conductivity are investigated. The maximum conductivity of PPy/GNS/NiO composites about 24.39 S/cm found with 3 wt% GNS and 48.7 wt% NiO at room temperature. The results showed that the high-aspect-ratio structure of GNS played an important role in forming a conducting network in PPy matrix. The microstructures of PPy/GNS/NiO are evidenced by the scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope examinations. The cyclic voltammetry curves can be seen that the PPy/GNS/NiO composites also have good electrochemical performance, and it can be used as a supercapacitor electrode material.
