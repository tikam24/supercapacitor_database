In the present study, microporous activated carbon with high surface area is prepared from a wasteland weed i.e. Saccharum spontaneum by chemical activation with ZnCl2. Input parameters are varied at different impregnation (ZnCl2/sample) ratios (0.5–1) and carbonization temperatures (400–600 °C). Under continuous N2 flow of about 100 ml/min with holding time for (10–60 min), carbonization is carried out. The activated samples are analyzed in terms of surface area, pore-volume, micro and mesopore volume by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Identification of process parameters, that is statistically significant, is done using ANOVA. To determine the optimal activation conditions up to a useful level of accuracy, signal to noise ratio and ANOVA analysis is applied. The surface area obtained within the range of 304.08–1205.71 m2/g, achieving maximum pore volume up-to 0.943 cm3/g. Under the varied parameters, as per the design of experiment (DOE), using Taguchi analysis, optimal condition for control factors to produce high surface area, are 600 °C, 60 min, and 1 chemical ratio. Saccharum spontaneum has been proved to be a precursor for activated carbon with a microporous structure. It is found from this study that, the impregnation ratio and carbonization temperature are the most effective parameters, among all others, those affect the surface area and yield%, respectively. Surface morphology of all the samples has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The appropriateness of activated samples is analyzed and could prove that the synthesized samples are suitable for energy storage applications.
