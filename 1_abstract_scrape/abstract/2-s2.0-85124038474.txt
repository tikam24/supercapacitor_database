MnCo2O4 microspheres were synthesized via the solvothermal method by employing ethylene glycol as a solvent and these synthesized materials were characterized by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), Energy Dispersive Analysis of X-rays (EDAX), X-ray Diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The morphology and structural conformation of MnCo2O4 microspheres were confirmed by FESEM and XRD. The electrochemical performance of MnCo2O4 @ 18 h electrode material was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. Impressively, the MnCo2O4 @ 18 h microspheres achieved remarkable results in pseudocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 439 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1 and exhibits excellent cyclic stability of 80.6% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 1 Ag−1.
