This paper introduces a Lithium Ion (Li-ion) battery storage scheme provided with a supercapacitor as a backup interface to AC/DC power system that can be utilized during maximum demand circumstances. Distributed FACTS based-switched filter compensator (SFC) is proposed to ensure efficient utilization of vehicle-To-grid battery chargers. A dynamic multi-level error-driven control strategy is proposed to safeguard a best performance of power quality (PQ) towards fast charging of the storage system, voltage improvement and stabilization of the DC and AC nodes, improvement of power factor of AC buses, inrush current minimization and harmonic distortion reduction. The proposed SFC is controlled via a multi-level functional error-driven inter-coupled weighted modified proportional-integral-derivative (WM-PID) controller. A comparative study of the proposed SFC and a conventional D-STATCOM is presented by applying a recent bio-inspired algorithm for optimizing the self-Tuning of the PID controllers' gains in terms of change at state of charge (SOC) to reflect the performance of the storage system. Matlab/Simulink software is utilized to simulate the distributed FACTS schemes. The results attained show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed SFC topology.
