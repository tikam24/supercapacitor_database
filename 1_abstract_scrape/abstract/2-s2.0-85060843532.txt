Herein, we present the synthesis of oxygen vacancies-rich α-MoO 3-x nanobelts through a novel defect-engineering strategy. The oxygen-vacancies could not only greatly increase the interlayer spacing and the electrical conductivity of MoO 3 , but also significantly enhance the electrochemical activity, which promotes faster charge storage kinetics. Meanwhile, to further facilitate the electron transfer and ion transport, a graphene nanomesh-carbon nanotube/MoO 3-x (GC/MoO 3-x ) nanocomposite with three-dimensional sandwiched structure was fabricated, which displays high specific capacity up to 306 C g −1 as well as high volumetric capacity of 692 C cm −3 . Our fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with the GC/MoO 3-x and GC/MnO 2 nanocomposites as anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits an ultrahigh energy of 150 Wh kg −1 , corresponding to an impressive volumetric energy density of 319 Wh L −1 . Notably, both the gravimetric and volumetric energy densities are much higher than most of the previously reported metal oxide based ASCs in aqueous electrolytes. Furthermore, the ASC displays an ultra-long lifespan with 101% retention ratio after 30,000 cycles. The outstanding performances of GC/MoO 3-x composite render it a highly promising candidate for next-generation supercapacitors with both high energy and power densities in future applications, especially in greatly limited space.
