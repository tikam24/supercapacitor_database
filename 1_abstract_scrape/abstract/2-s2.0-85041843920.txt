Although graphene has emerged as a promising candidate for constructing a high-performance supercapacitor electrode, its electrochemical performance has been restricted by the irreversible layer-restacking or aggregation. Here we report that a simple solid-phase pyrolysis approach to fabricate 3D highly porous and self-supporting graphene sheets under the assistance of thermal sensitive amidinourea phosphate served as the inserting and sacrificing template. The as-synthesized 3D graphene architecture features with ultralight, fire-resistant, heteroatoms incorporated and hierarchically porous characteristics as well as other specific properties, being a very promising metal-free material for various applications. Employing as an electrode material in supercapacitor, the 3D architecture combines wrinkled graphene layers, hierarchical interlayer pores, and defects or vacancies in graphene sheets, are very beneficial to resist layer stacking, minimize ions diffusion resistance and enhance intrinsic capacitance. By introducing phosphorus sacrificing template, the product delivered an approximate 2.7 folds higher specific capacitance with faster ionic and electronic transport than that of the counterpart synthesized without phosphorus participation.
