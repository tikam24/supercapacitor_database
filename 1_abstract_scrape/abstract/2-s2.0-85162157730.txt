Herein, the synthesis of MnO2 nanowires decorated with transition metal-doped carbon quantum dots (MCQDs) is described for use as binder-free flexible solid-state supercapacitors. In particular, the water-soluble Fe and N co-doped MCQDs prepared by amidation reaction with ferric ammonium citrate and urea had ultrafine particle morphologies and showed super-hydrophilicity in aqueous solution, which greatly improved the contact probability between the electrode and the electrolyte. In addition, the co-doped MCQDs increased both the electrical conductivity and specific capacitance of the MnO2/carbon-based nanocomposites and limited the collapse and exfoliation of the MnO2 structure during extended cycling. Compared with pristine MnO2 electrode, the MCQDs/MnO2 composite electrode exhibited faster charge-discharge rate and improved cycle stability with increased specific capacitance. The flexible symmetric supercapacitor constructed from the MCQDs/MnO2 composite had a capacitance retention of 85.6 % after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 2 mA cm−2. In addition, the device showed a maximum power density of 4.8 W cm−2 at an energy density of 2.3 mW h cm−2, and a maximum energy density of 11.16 mW h cm−2 at a power density of 311.6 mW cm−2.
