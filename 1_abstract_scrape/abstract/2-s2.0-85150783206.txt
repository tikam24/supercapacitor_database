Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) are attracting attention as rational energy storage platforms owing to their rapid and reversible charge adsorption/desorption at the electrode interface. Despite these advantages, EDLCs still face challenges in improving their ultrafast-rate capability for realizing its tailored applicability. In this study, tailored functional group vitalization was introduced on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) using chemical interactions between poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid), thiourea, and phosphorus red during thermal activation of electrospun polymer fibers. The tailored functional group vitalization effects include a simultaneous introduction of sulfur and phosphorus co-incorporated heterostructures from surface to interior of the CNFs (SPD-PCNF). In the surface region, sulfur and phosphorus containing functional groups are developed, which promotes electrolyte wettability and fast ionic diffusion kinetics at the CNFs/electrolyte interface. In the interior region, sulfur (2.4 at%) and phosphorus (2.0 at%) atoms are co-doped inside the carbon lattice, which improves electrical conductivity. In both the surface and interior region, accelerated specific mesopore area (1318.9 m2/g) and proportion are developed throughout the CNFs, which accommodates increased amounts and favorable ionic transport routes for charge adsorption/desorption. With these synergistic effects on charge transfer kinetics, SPD-PCNF electrode exhibited ultrafast-rate capability (112.8 F/g at 20 A/g and 14.0 Wh/kg at 36,000 W/kg).
