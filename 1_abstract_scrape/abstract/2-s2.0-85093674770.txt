This study based on ZIF-67, which was grown on the surface of GO to make GO/ZIF-67 as a template. After etching by nickel nitrate, carbonizing and treating by hydrothermal with sodium sulfide, the final product of rGO/NiCo2S4composite was obtained. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the structure and morphology of the composite which confirmed the expected product was obtained. Subsequently, the rGO/NiCo2S4composite material was made into a positive electrode material and tested the electrochemical performance. The test results show that the rGO/NiCo2S4-1.5 h electrode material has a specific capacitance of 1 577 F·g-1at current density of 1 A·g-1. When the current density reached 10 A·g-1, the rate performance was 86.4%. After 2 000 cycles at a current density of 10 A·g-1, the capacitance retention rate of rGO/NiCo2S4-1.5 h was 76.9%. In addition, an asymmetric capacitor of AC//rGO/NiCo2S4-1.5 h was assembled in a 6 mol·L-1KOH electrolyte. It delivered an energy density of 33 Wh·kg-1at a power density of 723 W·kg-1, and it remained as high as 23 Wh·kg-1even at 7 277 W·kg-1
