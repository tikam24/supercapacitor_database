Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have been successfully deposited onto the three-dimensional graphene (3DG) by a benign electrochemical method and the ordered 3DG structure remains intact after the uniform deposition of GQDs. In addition, the capacitive properties of the as-formed GQD-3DG composites are evaluated in symmetrical supercapacitors. It is found that the supercapacitor fabricated from the GQD-3DG composite is highly stable and exhibits a high specific capacitance of 268 F g-1, representing a more than 90% improvement over that of the supercapacitor made from pure 3DG electrodes (136 F g-1). Owing to the convenience of the current method, it can be further used in other well-defined electrode materials, such as carbon nanotubes, carbon aerogels and conjugated polymers to improve the performance of the supercapacitors.
