Ni0.25Co0.75(OH)2 hierarchical nanowire@nanoplatelet arrays were prepared by an in situ conversion from Ni 0.5Co1.5(OH)2CO3 nanowire arrays in a highly concentrated basic solution at room temperature. These unique hierarchical nanoarrays showed a 7 times larger areal capacitance and better rate capability than the precursive one-dimensional nanowire arrays. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
