Converting waste plastic into valuable carbon materials as the electrode for supercapacitors represents a sustainable way to deal with the severe waste plastic-related environmental issues. However, ideal carbon materials for supercapacitors require not only a large specific surface area but also abundant meso/macropores, which is still challenging for conventional synthesis methods. Herein, MgO-templated pyrolysis with chemical activation was demonstrated as an effective approach to convert waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles into 3D meso/macroporous carbon (MMPC) with both large total surface area (1863.55 m2/g) and meso/macropore surface area (1478.46 m2/g). Furthermore, it exhibited a high capacitance of 191.4 F/g and an excellent rate capability (86.3% retention from 0.5 to 10 A/g) for supercapacitor. This work provides not only a facile approach to synthesize 3D meso/macroporous carbon materials but also a sustainable way to mitigate plastic-derived pollution.
