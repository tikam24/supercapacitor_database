We report the fabrication of high-performance CNT-AC supercapacitor electrodes. CNTs are also added in the electrode preparation in this work because of high microporosity of activated carbon. The bigger ions can hardly be diffused and adsorbed onto the smaller micropores of activated carbon. The mesoporous nature of CNTs can enhance the ion adsorption through its unique and well-defined hollow core. The as prepared CNT-AC was then used as additive material to study the electrochemical properties of activated carbon based electric double layered supercapacitors (EDLCs). The physiochemical properties of CNT-AC were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopic techniques, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Coin-type EDLC cells with two symmetrical carbon electrodes were using the synthesized carbon materials for the decrease of resistance. The electrochemical performance of the carbon electrodes was measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge and cyclic voltammetry methods.
