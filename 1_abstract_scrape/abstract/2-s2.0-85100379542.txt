Metal selenides of were synthesized for various weight percentage of Mn (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 wt %). MnSe2-CoSe2 emerged as the novel-energy storing material for the supercapacitor application and guaranteed the improved electrochemical performance in asymmetric configuration. As prepared metal selenide composite was explored for standard characterization studies. XRD reveals the highly crystalline in nature of the as prepared samples. Se bonding with Mn-Co is confirmed from the sharp peak obtained at 470 cmâˆ’1. The chemical elemental composition was evaluated by the XPS, hence the characterization outcome confirm the successful growth of the material. The specific capacitance of Mn3 (0.15 wt %) is 373 Fg-1 in 1 M KOH; Mn1 (0.05 wt %-184 Fg-1) and Mn2 (0.1 wt %-295 Fg-1). The electrode shows excellent capacity retention of 95.86% at 5 Ag-1 even after 5000 cycles. Furthermore, asymmetric configuration of Mn3 (0.15 wt %)//AC device delivered significant value of power density even at high energy density. Thus, the as-prepared asymmetric device easily illumines the green light emitting diode which indicates the Mn3 (0.15 wt %) is an acceptable product.
