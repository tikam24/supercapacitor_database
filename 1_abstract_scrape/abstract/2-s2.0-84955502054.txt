Wire-shaped devices, such as solar cells and supercapacitors, have attracted great attentions due to their unique structure and promise to be integrated into textiles as portable energy source. To date, most reported wire-shaped supercapacitors were developed based on carbon nanomaterial-derived fiber electrodes whereas titania was much less used, though with excellent pseudocapacitvie properties. In this work, we used a titanium wire sheathed with radially aligned titania nanotubes as one of the electrodes to construct all-solid-state microsupercapacitors, in which the second electrode was carbon nanotube fiber or sheet. The capacitance of the resulting microsupercapacitor with a CNT sheet electrode (1.84 mF cm-2) is about three time of that for the corresponding device with the second electrode based on a single CNT yarn. The unique wire-shaped structure makes it possible for the wire-shaped microsupercapacitors to be woven into various textiles and connected in series or parallel to meet a large variety of specific energy demands.
