Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) has been regarded as a potential next-generation electrode material for supercapacitor owing to its attractive high theoretical capacitance. However, practical application of Ni(OH)2 is hindered by its lower cycling life. To overcome the inherent defects, herein we demonstrate a unique interconnected honeycomb structure of g-C3N4 and Ni(OH)2 synthesized by an environmentally friendly one-step method. In this work, g-C3N4 has excellent chemical stability and supports a perpendicular charge-transporting direction in charge-discharge process, facilitating electron transportation along that direction. The as-prepared composite exhibits higher specific capacities (1768.7 F g-1 at 7 A g-1 and 2667 F g-1 at 3 mV s-1, respectively) compared to Ni(OH)2 aggregations (968.9 F g-1 at 7 A g-1) and g-C3N4 (416.5 F g-1 at 7 A g-1), as well as better cycling performance (âˆ¼84% retentions after 4000 cycles). As asymmetric supercapacitor, g-C3N4@Ni(OH)2//graphene exhibits high capacitance (51 F g-1) and long cycle life (72% retentions after 8000 cycles). Moreover, high energy density of 43.1 Wh kg-1 and power density of 9126 W kg-1 has been achieved. This attractive performance reveals that g-C3N4@Ni(OH)2 with honeycomb architecture could find potential application as an electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
