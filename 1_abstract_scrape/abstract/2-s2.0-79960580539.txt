Polyaniline (PANI)/ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) composites were prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline. The effects of PANI loading on the electrochemical properties were tested by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and AC impedance. It was found that the composites showed higher specific capacitances than pure OMC or PANI. They also had good charge-discharge cycling stability. The capacitance of the composite containing 60% PANI could reach 409 F·g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A·g-1.
