Electrochemical characteristics of carbide-derived micro/mesoporous carbon material C(TiC) (prepared from TiC) have been studied in 1 M LiClO4, 0.5 M LiClO4 + 0.5 M LiPF6, and 1 M LiPF6 electrolyte solutions in ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate solvent mixture (1:1 by volume), by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), constant current charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Region of ideal polarizability, values of series capacitance and resistance, charge transfer resistance and capacitance, and other characteristics dependent on the electrolyte anion chemical composition have been established. The dependence of Li+ ion intercalation characteristics and solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation on the salt anion composition have been established and discussed. It was found that the three electrolytes studied are comparatively weak candidates for long-lasting high energy and power density supercapacitors. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
