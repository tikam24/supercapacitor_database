A series of activated carbon hollow fibers doped with charcoal powder (WC-ACHFs) were prepared from wood waste by liquefaction, melt spinning and steam activation methods. When evaluated as electrodes, activated carbon hollow fibers doped with charcoal powder exhibited an outstanding gravimetric specific capacitance of 481 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and cyclic stability with 98.8% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles. In addition, the multiple heteroatoms-doping of N and P from wood waste liquefaction have synergistic effect on electrochemical properties of WC-ACHFs, which is due to its combined merits of pseudocapacitance for sufficient charge storage and the good wettability for efficient ion diffusion. These results display that a facile method is promising for the preparation of wood-derived activated carbon hollow fibers from forestry and agricultural residues in the application of electrochemical energy storage.
