In this study, uniform iron manganese trioxide (FeMnO3) microspheres were characterized as electrode for supercapacitor applications. The microspheres were synthesized by hydrothermal method in the presence of different molar ratios of sucrose. X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed that the obtained microsphere has body-centered lattice structure of space group 1213(199). The Raman peak observed at 640 cm-1 might be attributed to the stretching mode of vibration of Mn-O bonds perpendicular to the direction of MnO6 octahedral double chains. The photoluminescence peak at the 536 nm corresponded to Fe2+ ions in FeMnO3 lattice point of body-centered cubic structure. The characteristic strong infrared (IR) bands observed at 669 cm-1 corresponded to Fe-O stretching. The electrochemical characterization of the obtained FeMnO3 products could be understood by carrying out cyclic voltammeter, electroimpedance spectra, and galvanostatic charging and discharge studies in a three-cell setup that demonstrates the exceptional specific capacitance of 773.5 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 and 763.4 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.
