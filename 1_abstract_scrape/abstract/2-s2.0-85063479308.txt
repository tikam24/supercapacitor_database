The experimental capacitance of manganese oxide (MnO 2 ) is ordinarily less than 100 F/g due to their poor electronic conductivity and low structural stability. Herein, we demonstrate the design and synthesis of doped δ-MnO 2 with enhanced electronic conductivity by the introduction of transitional metal Fe, Co and Ni. Structural characterizations shown that the Raman spectra of doped MnO 2 has obviously blue shifted, as well as the separation values of Mn 3s XPS spectra has expanded, which indicate the transitional metal doping successfully changes the crystal lattice of δ-MnO 2 . The I-V measurements confirm that the electronic conductivity of MnO 2 is significantly improved after doping. As a result, the Fe doped δ-MnO 2 with a 0.5% doping amount displays the highest specific capacitance of 157 F/g at 0.5 A/g, by increasing 50.4% of the specific capacity than non-doped MnO 2 . Simultaneously, the Co doped δ-MnO 2 exhibits the superb cycling stability (almost no degradation). Furthermore, the assembled 0.5% FeMO//AC, 1% CoMO//AC and 1% NiMO//AC asymmetric supercapacitor provide a specific energy densities of 30.3, 25.2 and 23.6 Wh/kg at a power density of 1000 Wh/kg. The excellent properties of as-prepared MnO 2 are due to the enhanced conductivity after doping, which can ascribed to the forming of intermediate bands, or changing the intensity of valence band/conduction band as demonstrated by spin-polarized density functional (DFT) calculations. Thus, the current work will provide a pathway for the development of high-performance pseudocapacitive materials, as well as for other energy storage systems.
