GO: SnSbS thin films were produced by Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) method on ITO substrates at different deposition temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C). Structural characteristics of the films were determined by XRD, FTIR, EDX, FESEM and AFM and their optical properties were analyzed. Time-dependent current-voltage (I-V) measurements were performed for each sample at 5 mV/s, 10 mV/s and 20 mV/s in the range of −0.2 Vto 0.8 V and specific capacitance values and energy densities were calculated. At the lowest scanning rates of 5 mV/s, they were found to be 243 F/g, 575 F/g, 224 F/g and 94 F/g for different deposition temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C).
