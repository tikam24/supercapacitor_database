Three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen-doped graphene hydrogels (NGHs) with a controlled pore structure were synthesized by inventively employing formamide as a modulator of their pore structure and surface properties. As expected, the optimized NGH showed a remarkable enhancement in its supercapacitor performance compared with traditional 3D graphene.
