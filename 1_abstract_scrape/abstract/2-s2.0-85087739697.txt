In this work, the binder-free CC@g-C3N4–900 electrode is prepared through coating graphite carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanosheets onto the flexible substrate of carbon cloth (CC) by a facile strategy. The CC@g-C3N4–900 electrode delivers a remarkable specific capacitance (499 F g−1 at 1 A g−1), an excellent rate capability (292 F g−1 at 20 A g−1) and outstanding cyclic performance (capacitance loss of only 4.4% after 10,000 cycles). The symmetric supercapacitor device based on CC@g-C3N4–900 exhibits decent energy density at ultrahigh power density (10.1 Wh kg−1 at 10000 W kg−1), and superb cyclic performance (without capacitance reduction after 10,000 cycles). The superior electrochemical performance of the CC@g-C3N4–900 electrode can be ascribed to its self-supported binder-free character, high nitrogen doping and strong coupling between CC and g-C3N4 nanosheets, which results in a small charge transfer resistance, highly stable electrode structure and remarkable pseudocapacitance.
