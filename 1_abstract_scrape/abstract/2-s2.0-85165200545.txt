Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS) are now being explored the most for performance improvement of EVs. HESS utilizes one or more energy storage systems, taking advantage of each. A hybrid topology of sources with complementary characteristics and an adaptive control strategy reduces battery-powered EVs' frequent charging and discharging need. In this context, a battery and supercapacitor combination with a fuzzy control strategy is proposed in this paper. Supercapacitors can handle peak power in short time intervals. The battery can supply loads continuously for extended periods. A tiny battery with a lower peak power output is all needed when using a hybrid system. The high power density of SC results in performance improvement with reduced battery size. The results show that the proposed fuzzy controller operates satisfactorily with a supercapacitor-assisted battery-powered EV. The frequent charging and discharging of the battery can be reduced, thereby improving the life span of the battery.
