Due to its unique features, laser-induced graphene (LIG) can be considered as disruptive technology for creating a few-layer graphene-based film that received much attention in the field of flexible electronics. Among all, energy storage, catalysis, sensing, and separation are the main applications that have been investigated in recent years with large improvements in the respective device performance. In particular, miniaturized supercapacitor - usually called a micro-supercapacitor (μSC) - is the most investigated field in which LIG can strongly provide outstanding results concerning the state of the art simplification of the fabrication procedure and intrinsically allowing the flexibility of the device. However, many open points still limit the possible full exploitation of this technology in the energy storage sector. This paper provides a concise overview of the LIG application in μSCs suggesting where the community should direct efforts to enhance the results together with associated challenges.
