A facile hydrothermal method is adopted for the synthesis of hierarchical flowerlike nickel sulfide nanostructure materials and their composite with carbon quantum dot (NiS/C-dot) composite. The composite material exhibited good performance for electrochemical energy-storage devices as supercapacitor with a specific capacity of 880 F g-1 at a current density of 2 A g-1. The material remained stable up to the tested 2000 charge-discharge cycles. Carbon quantum dots of size 1.3 nm were synthesized from natural sources and the favorable electronic and surface property of C-dots were utilized for improvement of the supercapacitor performance of NiS. The results from Tafel analysis, double-layer capacitance, and the impedance measurement reveal that the incorporation of C-dots inside the NiS matrix has improved the charge-transfer process, which is mainly responsible for the enhancement of the supercapacitive property of the composite materials.
