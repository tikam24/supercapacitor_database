In recent decades, investigations on eco-friendly energy storage devices to cope with the energy crisis and alleviate environmental pollution have garnered immense attention. Moreover, supercapacitors commercialization requires finding affordable, stable electrode nanomaterials of sufficient capacitance. Recent research has shown new hope for using two metal oxides together. Therefore, the present study introduced MnCo2O4/NiCo2O4 with star morphology on a nickel foam substrate as a cost-effective electrode for the first time. This electrode was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method in which MnCo and NiCo2O4 were deposited on nickel foam via a two-stage synthesis process. Furthermore, a particular star-like morphology was obtained by altering the synthesis temperature and time. The galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to assess the electrochemical properties of the electrodes by the three-electrodes system in a 3 M KOH solution. The synergistic effect of MnCo2O4 with NiCo2O4 led to an excellent capacitance of 1276 F/g and stability of 96.4% following 5000 consecutive CV cycles. Finally, the NiCo2O4/MnCo2O4 supercapacitor application was investigated in an asymmetric supercapacitor as the positive electrode, with rGO being the negative electrode. The results indicated satisfactory performance with a power density of 540 W/kg and an energy density of 68 W h//kg.
