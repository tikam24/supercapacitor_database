The two-dimensional material MXene with layered structure has attracted the attention of most researchers due to its outstanding conductivity, good hydrophilicity and rich surface chemical structure. This paper focuses on the advanced preparation methods and processes of transition metal carbonitrides, and reviews the research progress of their electrical aspects (including supercapacitors, battery materials and electrocatalysis). In MXene supercapacitors, compared with conventional aqueous electrolytes, organic electrolytes or ionic electrolytes can often provide higher output voltage, resulting in higher energy density. At the same time, the chemical properties of solvents also have a great influence on the molecular/ionic arrangement in MXene. As far as mxene based battery materials are concerned, the layered structure prepared by changing the assembly method of mxene sheet and electrode manufacturing method can prevent aggregation and reaccumulation, and the introduction of cation vacancy can also effectively improve the performance of MXene based battery materials. In addition, several strategies to improve the performance of MXene based materials for electrocatalytic water decomposition are discussed. The purpose of this paper is to review the preparation, structure, application and optimization of MXene in electricity, and to discuss the future research direction and possible challenges.
