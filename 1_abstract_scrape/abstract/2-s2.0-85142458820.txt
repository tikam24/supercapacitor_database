Modern technological trends in smart electronic devices demand more intelligent automation. Simultaneous integration of energy storage and multicolor electrochromism in a single device improves user-device interfacing based on a salient human-readable output. In this work, primarily metal-organic framework (MOF) derived V2O5 was synthesized which, as an electrochromic material, shows high optical modulation of 35% at 485 nm, with very fast switching speeds (2.9/3.4 s for coloring/bleaching). The multiple coloration states of the V2O5 electrode make it worthy for further integration as a smart negative electrode in a multicolored electrochromic asymmetric supercapacitor, where the electrochromic polyaniline electrode serves as the counter electrode. The device demonstrates a high coloration efficiency of 137.2 cm2 C−1 and an areal capacitance of 12.27 mF cm−2 and an energy density of 2.21 × 10−3 mW h cm−2 at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2. By virtue of its different chromatic states during charging and discharging, smart visual tracking of the state of charge of the supercapacitor can be realized. Such a design of energy storage devices will have promising practical application in futuristic smart multifunctional electronic devices.
