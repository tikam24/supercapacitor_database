In this study, five parts of Nelumbo nucifera (the lotus stem, lotus leaf, lotus seedpod, lotus seed and lotus root) were used to prepare super activated carbon with an ultra-high specific surface area. All five activated carbons were assembled into button-type supercapacitors as the electrode material. Constant current charge and discharge tests showed that under the same current density and charge/discharge voltage, the activated carbon prepared with the lotus stem has a relatively high specific capacitance of 238.52 F/g, a specific energy density of 13.7 Wh/kg and a voltage drop of less than 30 mV. After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance remains at 89%, and the energy charge efficiency is 81%. Moreover, different MnO2 contents (mass fractions) were loaded on the activated carbon of the lotus stem to fabricate electrode materials for a supercapacitor. The test revealed that among the tested supercapacitors, the supercapacitor with 10% MnO2-loaded activated carbon from the lotus stem as an electrode material has the highest specific capacitance (323.66 F/g), which is 46.23% higher than that of a pure carbon supercapacitor, and the material resistance of this load ratio is small. The electrode prepared with a lotus stem as the carbon source has good electrochemical performance and is expected to become a new source of carbon materials for supercapacitors and low-cost energy storage devices.
