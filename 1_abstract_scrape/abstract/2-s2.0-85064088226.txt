A novel hierarchically ZIF-67 derived Co3O4/carbon aerogel (CA) composite has been successfully synthesized by an in situ deposition and calcination method. The unique 3D nanoarchitecture provides an effective pathway for the rapid transport of electrons and ions. As a result, the ZIF-67 derived Co3O4/CA composite electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 298.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, excellent rate capability and outstanding cycling stability (82% retention after 1000 cycles). These results suggest that such a composite electrode possesses great potential for electrochemical supercapacitor applications.
