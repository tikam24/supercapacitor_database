One-dimensional Zn1−xNixO nanorods were synthesized via a low-temperature hydrothermal route. The crystallographic analysis evidenced the successful incorporation of Ni2+ ions into the ZnO lattice with the wurtzite phase. FESEM images show rod-shaped morphology for all samples. Optical studies confirm the increasing concentration of defect states in the material. The synthesized samples were also used as electrode materials to examine their supercapacitive behavior. The electrochemical studies revealed improved electrochemical performance with an excellent specific capacitance of 273 F/g for × = 0.06 sample.
