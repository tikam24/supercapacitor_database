This paper proposes four different cost-effective configurations of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in an electric city bus. A comparison is presented between a battery powered bus (battery bus) and supercapacitor powered bus in two configurations in terms of initial and operational costs. The lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery type was used in the battery bus and three of the hybrids. In the first hybrid the battery module was the same size as in the battery bus, in the second it was half the size and in the third it was one third the size. The fourth hybrid used a lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) battery type with the same energy as the LFP battery module in the battery bus. The model of LFP battery degradation is used in the calculation of its lifetime range and operational costs. For the NMC battery and supercapacitor, the manufacturers' data have been adopted. The results show that it is profitable to use HESS in an electric city bus from both the producer and consumer point of view. The reduction of battery size and added supercapacitor module generates up to a 36% reduction of the initial energy storage system (ESS) price and up to a 29% reduction of operational costs when compared to the battery ESS. By using an NMC battery type in HESS, it is possible to reduce operational costs by up to 50% compared to an LFP battery ESS.
