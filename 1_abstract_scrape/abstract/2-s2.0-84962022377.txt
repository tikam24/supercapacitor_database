Carbonized Zn-(Metal-Organic Framework)MOF- polyaniline composites for high performance of supercapacitor have been developed from zinc acetate, 8-Hydroxyquinoline, and aniline via a simple process. The as-synthesized product has been characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy(SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), Transmission electron microscope (TEM). The electrochemical properties of carbonized Zn-MOF/polyaniline electrode were investigated by current charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry. The specific capacitance of MOF/PANI has been approach to be as high as 477 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1.
