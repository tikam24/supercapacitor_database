Platanus fruit-like nickel cobalt ammonium phosphate/MWCNTs composites for high-performance supercapacitors were successfully prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method using NiSO4.6H2O, CoSO4.7H2O, (NH4)H2PO4 and MWCNTs as raw materials, respectively. The effects of MWCNTs addition on the structure and properties of the composites were investigated. The results showed that when the doped amount of MWCNTs is 7.3wt.%, the as-prepared NCAP/M7.3 composite presented an obvious platanus fruit likeness, its surface is rough and porous with a diameter of 3-5Î¼m. Compared with the other MWCNTs contents, the NCAP/M7.3 electrode obtained under this condition showed the best capacitive performance. The discharge specific capacity was up to 1270Fg-1 at current density of 1Ag-1, which remains to be 902Fg-1 even at a high density of 10Ag-1. The results show that the target sample can be the ideal electrode material for supercapacitor.
