The voltage of single supercapacitor is relatively low; therefore, multiple supercapacitors (SCs) constituting a serial-parallel structure are usually used as energy storage system. In the discharging process, there will be voltage imbalance among SCs caused by their different parameters, which will affect the system's discharge efficiency and energy utilization ratio, and even the service life of the SCs. To solve this problem, a voltage balance controlling strategy is proposed to minimize the voltage imbalance and to achieve high efficiency and high energy utilization ratio of the SCs. Through theoretical analysis and experiment, the feasibility of the strategy is verified, the voltages of all the SCs in the system are always kept uniform during the discharging process, and the energy utilization ratio is up to 93%.
