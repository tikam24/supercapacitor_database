At present, the preparation of highly porous graphitic activated carbons (HPGACs) using the usual physical and chemical activation methods has met a bottleneck. In this study, HPGACs are directly synthesized from lignite at 900 Â°C. The whole process is completed by a microwave pretreatment, a graphitization conversion of the carbon framework at a low temperature using a small amount of FeCl3 (10-30 wt%), and a subsequent physical activation using CO2. Consequently, the dispersed and mobile iron species, in the absence of oxygen functional groups (removed during the microwave pretreatment), can greatly promote catalytic graphitization during pyrolysis, and, as an activating catalyst, can further facilitate the porosity development during activation. The as-obtained AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) presents a low defect density, high purity, and specific surface area of 1852.43 m2 g-1, which is far greater than the AC-HLH-5-55.6(H) obtained solely by physical activation. AC-2FeHLH-5-41.4(H) as a supercapacitor electrode presents an excellent performance in the further electrochemical measurements. Such a convenient and practical method with low cost proves a scalable method to prepare HPGACs from a wide range of coal/biomass materials for industrial scale-up and applications.
