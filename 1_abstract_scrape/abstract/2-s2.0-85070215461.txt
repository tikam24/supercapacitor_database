In this paper, we report a complete solution for enhanced sludge treatment involving the removal of toxic metal (Cu(II)) from waste waters, subsequent pyrolytic conversion of these sludge to Cu-doped porous carbon, and their application in energy storage systems. The morphology, composition, and pore structure of the resultant Cu-doped porous carbon could be readily modulated by varying the flocculation capacity of Cu(II). The results demonstrated that it exhibited outstanding performance for supercapacitor electrode applications. The Cu(II) removal effciency has been evaluated and compared to the possible energy benefits. The flocculant dosage up to 200 mg·L−1 was an equilibrium point existing between environmental impact and energy, at which more than 99% Cu(II) removal effciency was achieved, while the resulting annealed product showed a high specific capacity (389.9·F·g−1 at 1·A·g−1) and good cycling stability (4% loss after 2500 cycles) as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
