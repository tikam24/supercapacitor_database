A facile synthesis of nickel cobalt sulfide (NCS) nanoflowers have been deposited successfully onto binder free 3D nickel foam electrodes using simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method for supercapacitor applications. The obtained NCS nanoflowers manifest ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1899 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The NCS nanoflowers exhibit a prominent energy density of 55.16 Wh kg−1 at power density of 495 W kg−1 and superior cyclic stability of 94% after 10000 cycles. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is fabricated using NCS nanoflower as positive and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as negative electrodes, respectively. The ASC (NCS//rGO) delivered good capacity with excellent energy and power densities within 1.6 V wider potential window. Hence, NCS nanoflowers are an outstanding material for energy storage applications in near future.
