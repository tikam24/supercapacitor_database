A series of Ni-doped carbon aerogels with different Ni loadings were prepared and extensively characterized from a textural, chemical and electro-chemical point of view. The formation of graphitic clusters on nickel particles was specially analysed by XPS and Raman spectroscopy. Electro-capacitive properties were studied by cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in a three and two-electrode cell, and in acidic media and non-aqueous aprotic electrolyte. The use of Ni as a polymerization catalyst slightly decreases the micropore volume of the carbon aerogels but on the contrary, a great increase in their mesopore volume was obtained. All samples present high gravimetric capacitances, ranging from 182 to 219 F g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, and from 49 to 63 F g−1 in 1 M tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate. Results show that the equivalent series resistances decrease as the Ni content increases and the capacitance increases in the same sense. This trend is directly related to the presence of a good developed mesopore network in Ni-doped carbon aerogels and a better electrical conductivity due to the formation of the graphitic clusters around the Ni particles. The stability of the charge-discharge cycles, studied by floating tests, showed a very good performance of the doped-carbon aerogels.
