Background and Objective: RF energy harvesting is the method of extraction of useful electrical energy from Radio Frequency waves. Methods: This method of energy harvesting provides the least power than that of other energy harvesting techniques from natural resources like solar, thermal, etc. An efficient architecture of RF energy harvesting is needed due to its feature of energy on demand and independence to natural resources. Results and Discussion: In this paper, different stages of the RF to DC converters are designed, implemented and investigated. This is investigated after simulation, that there is some tradeoff in finding maximum efficiency and maximum power transfer i.e. matching circuit. Conclusion: In this research, it is found that during simulation when the matching circuit is obtained for good reflection coefficient (S11) then efficiency of the circuit is dropped down. While the value of the parameters on which the efficiency of the circuit is found better the S11, does not hold good value. In this work, one to nine stage voltage multipliers have been simulated, implemented and analyzed. An RF energy harvester design strategy is also discussed which helps the researcher to design good quality RF energy harvesting circuit.
