Coal tar pitch (CTP) with high carbon content and wide source of raw materials was an excellent precursor for the preparation of porous carbons (PCs). CTP was composed of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with complex molecular size and chemical structure, the separation of CTP into several fractions with relatively narrow molecular weight by solvent extraction was of significance for CTP utilization. In this paper, CTP was treated by single-solvent extraction (carbon disulfide, acetone and ethyl acetate), and the six fractions were used as raw materials to prepare PCs as electrode material for electric double layer capacitor. The fractions were well characterized and the effect of mass distribution of different narrow fractions on structure property and electrochemical performance of the PCs was studied. The PCs prepared by carbon disulfide extract, acetone raffinate and ethyl acetate extract, containing more PAHs, exhibited the excellent specific capacitance performance in comparison with its residual components. The remarkable performance might contribute in the enhanced transport of electrolyte ions via the molecular graphene structure of PAHs. Additionally, the PC prepared by carbon disulfide raffinate showed outstanding cycling performance (99.7% at 2 A gâˆ’1 after 15,000 cycles) which was related to its unique layered porous structure.
