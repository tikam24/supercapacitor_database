This research presents a suggestion to improve the efficiency of grid-connected photovoltaic system by integrating hybrid energy storage sources. They are used to improve the quality of output power from the photovoltaic system. The variation of output power depends heavily on weather conditions, leading to adversely affect the power systemâ€™s stability to which they are linked. This model is built in Matlab/Simulink environment by utilizing mathematical models. The simulation results show that this hybrid model helps photovoltaic system becoming a dispatchable power source which can quickly meet the power requirements of the grid thanks to the utilization of battery-supercapacitor based system. Moreover, the system can operate in the smoothing mode of the output power from the photovoltaic system when only supercapacitor is used. The control scheme of this hybrid system is successfully demonstrated to guarantee the quality and stability of the power system integrated with renewable sources. This model is essential for photovoltaic systems, especially when they are connected to a poor grid.
