Supercapacitors are widely used in wearable electronic devices because of high power density, fast charge-discharge speed, and extremely long cycle life. However, low energy density is one of its shortcomings. In order to improve the energy density, in this paper, a flexible substrate having the micro-structure surface was fabricated by inkjet printing, which increased the specific surface of the electrode. Then the micro-structure surface was modified by plasma and promoted the deposition of graphene oxide(GO)/silver nitrate(AgNO3) solution on the micro-structure surface. For the micro-structure electrode prepared after vapor phase reduction of hydrated hydrazine, the area specific capacitance could reach 120 mF/cm2 at the scanning rate of 0.05 v/s, which increased the specific capacitance.
