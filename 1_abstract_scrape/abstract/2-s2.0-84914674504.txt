The promise of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) for supercapacitor electrodes remains unfulfilled due to their poor energy density, which is limited by their redox inactivity. Here, we show a simple, alternative path to achieve Faradaic charge storage by harnessing intrinsic heterogeneity (e.g., Fe catalyst) of as-synthesized MWNTs, obviating the challenges of combining disparate materials in hybrid composite electrodes. In acidic solutions, MWNTs are ruptured by voltammetric cycling beyond the electrolysis limit, thereby exposing residual catalyst nanoparticles. The addition of Faradaic charge storage associated with the Fe2+/Fe3+ transition, results in a 4-fold increase in peak capacitance of MWNT electrodes (290 F/g) compared to purified MWNT electrodes (70 F/g), along with a 60% increase in charge capacity.
