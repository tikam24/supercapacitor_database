This paper present experiment made to compare the charging and discharging capability between lithium-ion battery and super-capacitor for slow charge rate. The lithium ion battery and super-capacitor were both discharge to 0% state of charge, SOC and charged up to 63% SOC. DC supply and photovoltaic solar panel as the power source for charging. The trends in charging characteristics for both energy storage devices were observed. It is observed that the super-capacitor can act as an energy storage based on the charge and discharge pattern from the experiment. Â© 2012 Universitas Indonesia.
