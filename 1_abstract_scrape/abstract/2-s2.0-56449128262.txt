Storage of energy is one of the main problem of contemporary technology. Currently used manners of the energy store are listed below: the magnetic accumulator - the energy is kept in the magnetic field of superconductive inductor, the accumulator with supercapacitors. The low voltage (1,6-2,5V) is the fault of this one, the accumulator with lead-acid or alkaline accumulator. The fault of this solution is very low charging and discharging efficiency, the electromechanical accumulator. Flywheels store energy mechanically in the form of kinetic energy. In this article the flywheel energy storage will be described precisely and compared with other energystorage technologies. Â© 2008 IEEE.
