The supercapacitor is an energy storage device that has the potential to replace traditional energy storage technologies such as batteries. Fast charge and discharge cycle, high power density, high operating temperature range, long cycle lifetime, and economic properties make supercapacitors unique. The supercapacitor has been widely used in different applications like hybrid vehicles, renewable energy storage, medical equipment, and electronic devices. With the advancement of current wearable electronic gadgets, a flexible and self-healing supercapacitor is required. Flexible supercapacitors can often endure some bending and stretching stains, so mechanical damage or micro-cracks can degrade the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. Micro-crack diagnosis and self-healing prevent sudden failure and economic losses. Intrinsic and extrinsic self-healing mechanisms are used during repairing. Since self-healing supercapacitors are developing rapidly, but still, these are in infancy because of many limitations like high cost and lower performance. Despite the constraints of self-healing supercapacitors, the research potential for self-healing supercapacitors is unlimited. This article will discuss various fabrication methods of self-healing electrode material and self-healing electrolyte materials with their electrochemical performances in supercapacitor.
