The excellent cyclic efficiency, superior reversible charge/discharge rate, and high specific power density have made supercapacitors an important class of energy storage systems in recent time. In this study, two nano-ceria-based composites were developed to use as electrode materials in supercapacitor applications. The composites were synthesized by combining ceria with conductive polyaniline (PANI) and doped with HCl and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA). The materials were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, and XPS techniques. Electrochemical studies were performed by cyclic voltammetry, galvanometric charge-discharge, and AC impedance spectroscopy. The CeO2-PANI doped with HCl and PTSA composites displayed ideal supercapacitor behavior showing higher capacitances up to 504 F g−1 and 454 F g−1, respectively, at current density of 1 A g−1 in comparison with pristine ceria (109 F g−1). Both the composites exhibited excellent specific energy (up to 100.8 W h kg−1) as well as outstanding specific power (up to 830 W kg−1). These findings support the possibility of these composites for practical applicability as electrode materials in energy storage devices.
