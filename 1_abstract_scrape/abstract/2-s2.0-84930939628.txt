Abstract In this work, we synthesized the hierarchical core/shell hybrid electrode composed of well-aligned Co3O4 nanowire arrays on three-dimensional nickel foam with ultrathin PPy nanoflakes wrapped each nanowire. Supercapacitor based on this unique Co3O4@PPy core/shell nanowire arrays exhibits the specific capacitance as high as 2017 F g-1 (areal capacitance of 4.90 F cm-2) at a current density of 1 mA cm-2. After 1000 cycles, 60% capacitance can be maintained with a areal capacitance of 2.45 F cm-2. The superior electrochemical performances of Co3O4@PPy core/shell hybrid electrode confirm its great potential application for electrochemical energy storage.
