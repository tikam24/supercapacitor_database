Nanostructured metal oxides, hydroxides, and chalcogenides have attracted tremendous attention these days as electrode materials in supercapacitor. Their extraordinary high performance is mainly due to the Faradaic redox reactions involving metal cations apart from EDLC mechanism. The morphology of materials in nanoscale plays important role in performance providing large number of active sites and also by facilitating ionic transportation. The current chapter discusses the properties as well as electrochemical mechanisms of different electroactive materials responsible for their extraordinary high performances. Furthermore, advancement of electrodes based on these materials as well as the fabrication of supercapacitor devices with various combinations have also been conferred as next generation energy storage devices.
