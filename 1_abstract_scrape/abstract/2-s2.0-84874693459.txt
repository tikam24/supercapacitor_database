A supercapacitor in a flexible wire format has potential advantages that are described in this paper. Polyaniline composite fibers incorporated with aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes are first synthesized with high mechanical strength and electrical conductivity through an easy electrodeposition process, and two robust composite fibers have then been twisted to produce microsupercapacitor wires with a specific capacitance of 274 F g-1 or 263 mF cm-1. These energy storage wires are light-weight, flexible, strong and weavable for promising applications in various fields. Â© 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
