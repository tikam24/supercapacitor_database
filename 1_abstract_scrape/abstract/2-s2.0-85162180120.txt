The CeNiO3 (CNO) is perceived as a promising anode material for supercapacitor applications because of its stable structure and prolonged cycle life. A series of CNO nanospheres anchored on a chain-like structure of VS4 (VS) with high sulphur content are successfully synthesized by in situ hydrothermal reaction. The CNO nanosphere anchoring on the layered VS structure of optimised sample exhibits an enhanced specific capacity by ≈2.76 times over pristine CNO and ≈9.75 times over pristine VS. When the CNO nanosphere is decorated over the layered surface of VS, which reduces the stacking of the nanosheet and diminishes volume expansion and contraction during the long charge-discharge cycles. Importantly, our research study suggests that the sulphur-oxide combination facilitates a diffusion-driven charge storage mechanism via a redox reaction, while higher sulphur content enhances surface-controlled charge storage. Additionally, an asymmetric supercapacitor is fabricated using CNO@VS10 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, which exhibits maximum specific energy of 84.6 W h kg−1 with a specific power of 1094 W kg−1. In addition, DFT studies are utilized to support the experimental observations. Moreover, an array of LEDs displaying NML in printed circuit board (PCB) is lit up by utilizing CR2032 coin-cells connected in series.
