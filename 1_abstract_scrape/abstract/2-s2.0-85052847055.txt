A three-dimensional conductive network-based ordered polyaniline (PANI) nanorods/graphitic mesoporous carbon (GMC) composite is successfully fabricated by the introduction of PANI into a low-cost GMC with a highly fluffy and porous structure, and the effects of the GMC content on the electrochemical performance are investigated using the as-prepared composite as active material. Results show that the unique structure of the composite is beneficial to ion and electron transport as well as redox reactions during charge–discharge process. The composite containing 15 wt% GMC exhibits a high specific capacitance of 715 F g–1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and remains 429 F g–1 at 10 A g−1 (60.0% retention). Furthermore, the composite shows excellent cycling stability with a high capacitance retention of up to 93.6% at 100 mV s−1 after 10000 cycles, and exhibits a coulombic efficiency in excess of 90% after 2500 cycles at a current density of 3 A g−1. More importantly, the composite presents a high energy density of 24.64 W h kg−1 at a power density of 250 W kg−1 and 13.79 W h kg−1 at 5000 W kg−1, which is highly competitive with other reported PANI/carbon composite electrodes.
