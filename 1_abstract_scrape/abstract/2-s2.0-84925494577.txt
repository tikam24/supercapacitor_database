Each Co(OH)2 and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-intercalated Co(OH)2 was potentiodynamically deposited from nitrate bath and their supercapacitor performances examined. The deposited hydroxides were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy. The supercapacitor behaviour of the hydroxides was examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies in 1 M KOH electrolyte. It was observed that the specific capacitance of Co(OH)2 could be tuned from 440 to 710 F g−1 at a current of 0.5 A g−1 by intercalating PEG into the interlayers of Co(OH)2. In addition, the 5 vol.% PEG-intercalated Co(OH)2 electrode exhibited highest specific capacitance and excellent cycle life with good retention of specific capacitance even up to 1000 charge–discharge cycles. The high specific capacitance and excellent cycle life of 5 vol.% PEG-intercalated Co(OH)2 were attributed to the better electrode/electrolyte interaction due to well-defined nano-flake morphology.
