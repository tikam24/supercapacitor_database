Hybrid energy storage systems(HESSs) with advantages of high power density and high energy density have been widely adopted in electric vehicles(EVs). An event-triggered deadbeat control method is proposed for the battery-supercapacitor HESS of EVs, aiming at solving the contradiction between fast dynamic response and computational burden in the traditional control methods. The proposed method inherits the advantages of fast response and small overshot of deadbeat control method, it can generate the optimal control signal within one control cycle to make full use of HESS to cope with complex working conditions for stabilizing the bus voltage. Meanwhile, the event-triggered control strategy is introduced to eliminate the unnecessary calculations based on the system state, which can significantly reduce the calculation burden on the premise of maintaining regulation performance. A digital simulation system of the battery-supercapacitor HESS is built in Matlab/Simulink, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed method has the advantages as follows: ① it can regulate the DC bus voltage with the variation of 1.4%, which is close to 1% of traditional deadbeat control method; ② its average number of operations is about 61.2% of the traditional deadbeat control method, and the computational burden can be reduced by 39.8%; ③ it introduces event-triggered control mechanism to eliminate redundant switching actions and improve the overall efficiency of HESS. Finally, considering the driving cycling of EVs in China, the effectiveness of the event-triggered no-beat control method in the battery-supercapacitor HESS is further verified based on the hardware-in-loop experimental platform based on OPAL-RT real-time simulator. The proposed method provides a reference of the control strategy design for the HESS of EVs.
