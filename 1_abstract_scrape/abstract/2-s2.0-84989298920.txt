Fiber-shaped supercapacitors, which are energy-storage devices that feature flexibility and wearability, could realize further gains in energy-storage performance if their electrodes are properly designed. Herein, we present a high energy-performance and flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitor by using PEDOT@MnO2 and C@Fe3O4 composites as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively. The as-fabricated fiber-shaped supercapacitor with a high working voltage of 2 V exhibits a high areal specific capacitance of 60 mF cm-2 and a large energy density of 0.0335 mW h cm-2. This fiber-shaped supercapacitor exhibits good flexibility and particularly can be deformed without energy-performance decay. Furthermore, this fiber-shaped supercapacitor woven into a wristband in series can successfully power a LED, indicating its promising practical application in wearable electronics.
