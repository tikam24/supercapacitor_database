Networked branched nanowire heterostructure (BNH) hybrid materials are very promising for supercapacitor electrodes, providing enhanced electrochemical performance compared with electrodes comprising a single constituent or core/shell nanowire heterostructures. Herein, by using a one-step hydrothermal reaction followed by a post-annealing treatment, we synthesized networked NiCo2O4/MnO2 BNH arrays on Ni foam substrates and applied them as electrodes in supercapacitors. The as-prepared electrodes exhibit ultrahigh specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and superb cycling stability at a high charge/discharge current density. This outstanding overall electrochemical performance is attributed to the effective conductive transport path between component materials, reduced electron- and ion-transport pathways, enhanced surface area, and facile electrolyte infiltration into the 3D networked BNH. The networked BNH design may provide a universal approach for the development of new electrode materials for high-performance pseudocapacitors. This journal is
