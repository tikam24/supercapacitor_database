Using paratoluenesulfonic acid(TSA) as dopant and emulsifier, and ammonium persulfate(APS) as initiator, the composites of polyaniline, TSA and neutral red(TSA-PANI/PNR) were synthesized by emulsion polymerization. The structure and morphology of the composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction(XRD) and scanning electron microscopy(SEM). Symmetric redox supercapacitor was assembled with TSA-PANI/PNR as active electrode material and an l mol/L H2SO4 aqueous solution as electrolyte. The electrochemical performances of the supercapacitors were characterized by galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic voltammetry and A.C. impedance spectroscopy. The results show that TSA-PANI/PNR composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical capacitor performance compared with TSA/PANI electrode. The specific capacitance measured from cyclic voltammetry is 1350 F/g for TSA-PANI/PNR composite material and 1038 F/g for TSA/PANI at 1 mV/s scan rate; the initial specific capacitance of the TSA-PANI/PNR supercapacitor is about 348 F/g at a constant current of 5 mA. Meanwhile, the retention of the capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles was 87%.
