Ni(OH)2/MnO2 core-shell nanowires with a nanoflake surface have been designed and synthesized, and can be applied not only in neutral electrolytes (355 F g−1, 70.4 wt% MnO2) but are also appropriate for alkaline electrolytes (487.4 F g−1, 35.5 wt% MnO2), with high cycling stability due to the synergistic effect between the core and shell. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
