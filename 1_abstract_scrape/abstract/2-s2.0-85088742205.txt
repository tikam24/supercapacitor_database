Nickel diselenide (NiSe2) had been conflated from the reaction of nickel acetate tetra hydrate (C4H14NiO8) with selenium (Se) powder by simple hydrothermal method at 200 °C for 5 hrs. The structural analysis revealed that the synthesized samples are consists of cubic structure. The electrochemical performance was obtained from the cyclic voltammetery (CV) and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) profiles. The prepared NiSe2 exhibited the specific capacitance value of 384 Fg−1 at scan rate of 2 mVs−1. The obtained results ensure that the NiSe2 nanoparticles could act as an enhanced working electrode for the upcoming generation of supercapacitors.
