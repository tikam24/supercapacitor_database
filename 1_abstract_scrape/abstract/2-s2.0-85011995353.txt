Paper-like electrodes with high conductivity and flexibility hold great potential for assembling high-performance flexible electronic devices. In this study, a flexible conductive film was fabricated via vacuum filtration using highly conductive MoO3−x ultralong nanobelts. This film has low sheet resistance of 5.1 Ω sq−1 and exhibits a stable three-dimensional structure even under 1000 times of bending test. Significantly, this free-standing film has a high volumetric capacitance of 652 F cm−3. Moreover, a symmetric device based on this electrode demonstrates good cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 85.7% after 25 000 cycles. We anticipate that this strategy can also be applied to other three-dimensional flexible porous films based on one-dimensional conductive nanostructure, which could open up new opportunities for energy storage and conversion.
