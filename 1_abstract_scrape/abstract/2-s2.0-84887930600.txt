A grapheme/NiO and grapheme/NiO-MnO2 nano-composites were prepared by simple chemical precipitation followed by thermal annealing and using a chelating agent and Ni and Mn hydroxides on graphene. The graphene/NiO-MnO2 was pretreated by ultrasonication followed by thermal annealing at 300°C for 2 h. Graphene/MoO2-MoS2 composites were prepared by a hydrothermal reaction of molybdenum(IV) oxide with sodium sulfide and subsequent ball-milling with graphene. The results of XRD, FE-SEM, and FE-TEM analyses confirmed the presence of NiO, MnO2, Mo0 2-MoS2 nanoparticles on the graphene surface. In the properties of anodes in lithium-ion batteries, the discharge capacities of graphene, graphenelNiO (59 wt.%) are about 302 and 856 mAh g-1 at 5000 rnA g-1 (5 C), respectively. The cells containing 59 wt.% NiO show the best performance, and the graphene nanocomposite materials have high rate properties that are comparable to some of the good results reported in the literature using NiO. The mole ratios of Mo02 and MoS2 in the synthesized Mo02-MoS2 powder were found to be approximately 62.3:37.7. The graphene/Mo0 2-MoS2 composite anodes showed a high discharge capacity (-974 mAh g-l) after 20 cycles and superior high-rate capability. In the properties of electrode in supercapacitor, the maximum specific capacitance of the graphenelNiO-MnO2 electrode was 242.15 F g -1 by cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 0.2 m V s -l, which was significantly higher than that of a graphene electrode. © 2013 IEEE.
