In order to detect the conductivity of electrode materials for supercapacitors, a new method is used in this paper, which is called Magnetically Mediated Thermoacoustic Detecting Method (MMTDM). Firstly, the principle of Magnetically Mediated Thermoacoustic Detecting Method is studied. Secondly, the simulation model of Magnetically Mediated Thermoacoustic Detecting Method is built, and the ultrasonic signal of the model is obtained. Finally, the self-made supercapacitor electrode material and pure aluminum foil were used as experimental targets for detection and comparison. The results of numerical simulations and physical experiments show that the Magnetically Mediated Thermoacoustic Detecting Method can realize the non-contact detection of the conductivity of energy storage materials. This paper provides a good theoretical and experimental basis for the application of Magnetically Mediated Thermoacoustic Detecting Method in the non-contact detection of energy storage materials.
