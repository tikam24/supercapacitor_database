The electrochemical performance of flexible carbon-nanotube (CN) based supercapacitors (SCs) is reported in this research. A mixture of Boron nitride (BN), graphene (G) and lithium titanate (Li2TiO3, LiTi) was added on the SC electrodes to enhance their capacitance/energy-density. SC devices were fabricated with the names of CN-SC, CN/BNG-SC and CN/BNG + LiTi-SC and generated a capacitance/energy density of 329.7 F g−1/7.3 Wh kg−1, 890.2 F g−1/35.2 Wh kg−1 and 1662.6 F g−1/124.2 Wh kg−1, respectively. From those last values, we realize that adding BN, G and LiTi (CN/BNG + LiTi-SC), enhanced the capacitance and the energy density by ~ 4 and ≈ 16 times, respectively. Interestingly, the output voltage of the SCs also increased from 0.1 to 0.4 V after adding these three compounds to their electrodes. The SC electrodes were analyzed by UV–vis absorbance, Raman and XPS and found the presence of defects (oxygen vacancies) and Ti3+/Ti4+ species, which worked as redox centers for the charge storage. Moreover, the best CN/BNG + LiTi-SC device was subjected to 500 bending/charging-discharging cycles and maintained a capacitance of 86–97% despite the mechanical deformations. Finally, we demonstrated that the incorporation of the BN and LiTi materials on the SC electrodes produced a widening of the operating voltage window from 1.2 to 2.2 V, which is of particular interest to increase the lifetime of portable energy sources.
