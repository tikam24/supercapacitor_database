A symmetric redox supercapacitor has been fabricated based on n and p doped Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)(PEDOT) coated on stainless steel (SS) electrodes. The characterization and performance of the supercapacitor has been studied by FTIR, Cyclic Voltammetry and AC Impedance spectroscopy. The supercapacitor showed a maximum specific capacitance of 121 F g-1 at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The time constant calculated for the supercapacitor through the active-reactive power behavior measurement was 12 milliseconds indicating the suitability of the system for efficient use at low frequency range.
