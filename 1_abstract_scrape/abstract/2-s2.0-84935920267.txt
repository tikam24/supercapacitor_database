In this study, porous Co3O4 nanospheres were controllably synthesized by applying metal Cu2+ ions as structure-inducing agents. The growth of the Co3O4 nanostructures was induced by the metal ions without the addition of any surfactants. The porous Co3O4 nanospheres were composed of nanosheets. When used as electrode materials in a supercapacitor, the porous Co3O4 nanospheres exhibited a much better capacity of 246.7 F g-1 than commercial Co3O4 powder at a current density of 0.5 A g-1, maintaining 86% of the initial capacity at a current density of 1 A g-1 after 500 cycles. Such high performance can be attributed to the desirable morphology. The results manifest that porous Co3O4 nanospheres composed of nanosheets are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors.
