Mn-doped ZnCo 2 O 4 nanoparticle has been synthesized by hydrothermal method without adding any surfactants. Structural, morphological and electrochemical performances have been studied for the pure and various concentration of Mn-doped ZnCo 2 O 4 nanoparticles. XRD and Raman studies demonstrate the crystalline structure of the material. Specific capacitance of the 10 wt% Mn doped ZnCo 2 O 4 nanomaterial is analysed using the three-electrode system. 10 wt% Mn-doped ZnCo 2 O 4 has a maximum capacitance of 707.4 F g −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Coulombic efficiency of the material is 96.3% for 500 cycles in the KOH electrolyte medium. A two-electrode device using 10 wt% Mn-doped ZnCo 2 O 4 exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 6.5 F g −1 at a current density of 0.03 A g −1 which is the suitable material for supercapacitor application.
