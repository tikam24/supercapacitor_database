Mixed Nickel Cobalt Manganese oxide (NiCoMn-Oxide) is a new class of excellent material for supercapacitor application. Here, hydrothermal synthesis technique has been employed to prepare mixed NiCoMn-Oxide nanorods. The elemental composition and morphology of this material were validated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and EDX techniques. To analyze the capacitive performance of this material, cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed. A maximum specific capacitance of ~500 F/g was obtained for the mixed NiCoMn-oxide material within a potential range of-0.5 to 0.5 V (Vs. Ag/AgCl) in 2 M aqueous KOH solution.
