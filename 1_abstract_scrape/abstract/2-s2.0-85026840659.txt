The chemical nature of electrolytes has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the charge storage of electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), whereas primary mechanisms are still partially resolved but controversial. In this work, a systematic exploration into EDL structures and kinetics of representative aqueous electrolytes is performed with numerical simulation and experimental research. Unusually, a novel charging mechanism exclusively predominated by kinetics is recognized, going beyond traditional views of manipulating capacitances preferentially via interfacial structural variations. Specifically, strikingly distinctive EDL structures stimulated by diverse ion sizes, valences, and mixtures manifest a virtually identical EDL capacitance, where the dielectric nature of solvents attenuates ionic effects on electrolyte redistributions, in stark contradiction with solvent-free counterpart and traditional Helmholtz theory. Meanwhile, corresponding kinetics evolve conspicuously with ionic species, intimately correlated with ion-solvent interactions. The achieved mechanisms are subsequently illuminated by electrochemical measurements, highlighting the crucial interplay between ions and solvents in regulating EDLC performances.
