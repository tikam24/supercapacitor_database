Considering the increasing demands in energy storage systems (ESS), the nitrogen doped porous carbons with high volume properties are urgently needed in practical applications. Herein, we develop a new strategy for the fabrication of the high density and nitrogen-doped porous carbons (DNPCs) via low-temperature pyrolysis of phytic acid (PA)-doped polyaniline (PANI) coated on graphene, representing a high volumetric performance as supercapacitor electrode materials. PA is used to form the graphene oxide/polyaniline (GO/PANI) precursor, protect GO from agglomeration, reduce the porosity and regulate the heteroatoms contents of porous carbon. Benefiting from PA-inducing and low-temperature pyrolysis, the DNPC-500 performs a high volumetric capacitance of 643.7 F cm−3 at 0.5 A g − 1, and outstanding rate performance respectively. In a symmetric supercapacitor, the DNPC-500 device possesses a high volumetric energy density of 14.6 W L − 1 at the power density of 79.8 kW L − 1. Thus, this result exhibits a novel design of high density and nitrogen doped porous carbon materials for supercapacitors.
