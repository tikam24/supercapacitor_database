MoS2, a typical two-dimensional transition metal sulfide nanomaterial, has attracted much attention for supercapacitor electrode materials due to its high theoretical capacity. Herein, MoS2 nanosheets grown on a hierarchical porous carbon (HPGC) derived from pomelo peel are prepared via hydrothermal method. The curled MoS2 nanosheets grow and uniformly distribute on the conductive hierarchical porous carbon matrix, which made the electrodes materials possess a high specific surface area (320.2 m2 g?1). Simultaneously, the novel structure enhances the conductivity of MoS2, alleviates capacity attenuation and guarantees the interface stability. Furthermore, the MoS2/HPGC shows a great enhancement in supercapacitor performance and deliver a remarkable specific capacitance of 411.4 F g?1 at the current density of 0.5 A g?1. The initial capacitance retention rate is approximately 94.3% after 2000 cycles. It turns out that the synergistic effects between the MoS2 nanosheets and HPGC contribute to high specific capacity, excellent rate performance and ultra-long cycle life. This work provides a new idea for the design and development of MoS2 composites as the electrode materials of supercapacitors.
