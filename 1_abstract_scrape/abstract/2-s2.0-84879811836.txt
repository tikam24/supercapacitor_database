Graphene/spacer nanoparticle composites were prepared by reducing graphene oxide with hydrazine in the presence of different contents of polyaniline nanoparticles. In-situ cryo-TEM image of GO-spacer solution shows that spacer nanoparticles are anchored on GO sheets. During the reduction, as-adsorbed spacer nanoparticles were sandwiched between layers of graphene. These spacer nanoparticles act as spacers to create gaps between neighboring graphene sheets, resulting in higher surface area. Graphene/spacer nanocomposites exhibited highest specific surface area of 1500 m2/g. Utilizing this composite material, a supercapacitor with specific capacitance of 267 F/g at a current density of 0.1 A/g was achieved. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.
