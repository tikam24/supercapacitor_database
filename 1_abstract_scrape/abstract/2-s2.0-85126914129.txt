On November the 20th 2020 the paper titled “Lambert W function based closed-form expressions of supercapacitor electrical variables in constant power applications” [which we now refer to as ‘Paper A’] was published in the journal “Energy”. On August the 2nd 2021, our paper “Towards accurate calculation of supercapacitor electrical variables inconstant power applications using new analytical closed-form expressions” was published in the Journal of Energy Storage, [which we now refer to as Paper B]. Although our paper does have a novelty in applying Special Trans Function Theory to calculate the Lambert W function, paper A owns the originality of introducing the “thorough mathematical analysis which, by using the Lambert W function, accomplishes the explicit calculation of all the electrical variables involved in the charge/discharge processes of supercapacitors operated at constant power as a function of time.” So, we acknowledge the priority of Paper A and apologize to the authors J.F. Pedrayes, M.G. Melero, J.M. Cano, J.G. Norniella, S.B. Duque, C.H. Rojas, and G. A. Orcajo for any inconvenience.
