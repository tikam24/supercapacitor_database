Controllable synthesis of high-capacity cathode is the research hotspot in the field of supercapacitors. In this work, with the help of sacrificial ZnO template, MnO2/C nanotube arrays are formed by hydrothermal synthesis plus glucose carbonization. MnO2/C composite nanotubes of 120–130 nm are formed and grow vertically to the substrate forming the final nanotube arrays. Fast ion/electron transfer is realized in this unique porous nanotube architecture. As cathode of supercapacitors, the MnO2/C nanotube arrays exhibit high specific capacitance (790 F g−1 at 5 A g−1), excellent rate performance (570 F g−1 at 30 A g−1) and long-term cycling stability (90.7% capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles). The proposed electrode construction strategy is favorable for fabrication of other capacitive cathodes for energy storage.
