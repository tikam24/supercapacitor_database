Rich surface functionalization properties and ion diffusion behavior make MXene a promising material for better self-discharge properties for Supercapacitor application. Utilizing a new electrode material for the renewable energy storage device is a very important factor for the environmental safety from the threatening fossil fuels. Herein, we report a highly capacitive and fast charge-discharge electrode material assembled by tightly anchoring SnO2 over Ti3C2Tx flakes (graphite sheet as a current collector) and the electrolyte Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) as a new promising material for supercapacitor electrode. XRD analysis with FESEM imaging showed that the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2 nanoparticles was uniformly grown on the surface of sheet-like Ti3C2Tx. By optimizing Ti3C2Tx through delamination using TMAOH (Tetramethylammonium Hydroxide) and introducing SnO2 nanoparticles onto it by simple sonication, the developed electrode material delivered a maximum of specific capacitance (669 Fgâˆ’1 in the alkaline electrolyte) with stable cyclic performances (90% of retainability over Six thousand cycles) and shows a good rate performance. The comparison of delaminated and without delaminated samples reveals that the delaminated electrode can avoid the restacking of 2D MXene sheets and hence improve ion migration and electron transport in energy storage devices. This predominant performance demonstrated that Delaminated MXene/ SnO2 can effectively advance the future of electrode material for next-level supercapacitor applications.
