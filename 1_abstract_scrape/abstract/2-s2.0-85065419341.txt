The supercapacitor electrode material MnCo2O4 was successfully prepared by a facile solution combustion method. XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRS, SEM and TEM instruments were employed to study the physico-chemical and surface properties of the MnCo2O4. The electrochemical performance of the MnCo2O4 electrode was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. The modified electrode shows an excellent cyclic behaviour with a wide potential window of −1.2 to 1.5V. The highest specific capacitance value of MnCo2O4 at the scan rate of 10 mVs−1 was 270 Fg-1 and it shows the enhanced capacitive character of the electrode material. The measured capacitance fading after 1000 cycles was only about 7.6% and this shows the excellent cyclic stability of the material. The maximum energy and power density calculated from the constant charge-discharge cycles were 14.85 Wkg-1 and 495 Whkg−1 respectively. The electrochemistry of MnCo2O4 proves that it can be used as a high energy and power density electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.
