Three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based hydrogel or sponges have received increasing attention in recent years. High porosity combined with mechanical durability in graphene based sponges is in high demand in energy storage field. However, pure rGO sponges are generally delicate and fragile, which is hard to handle and process. Moreover, low package density of graphene based material leads to low volumetric energy density, which limits its further commercial application, although it has already achieved high gravimetric energy storage in supercapacitor. Herein, we came up with a method to improve the volumetric capacity by simply pressing fluffy rGO sponge into dense film. Self-assembly of rGO and polymer-assisted cross-linking are cooperated to fabricate the rGO based hydrogel with higher plastic property. Poly acrylic acid (PAA) could enhance the mechanical integrity of the rGO sponges, thus could be pressed into freestanding integral film. In this case, addition of carbon nanotube (CNT) could enhance the conductivity and prevent the sharp decline of surface area by pi-pi interaction between CNT and rGO sheets preventing the restacking problem. Unlike the rGO sponges which cannot be pressed, the compressed rGO-CNT-PAA film still maintains intensive porous structure with the trace of squeezing in microstructure and achieves gravimetric and volumetric capacity of 140 mAh g−1 and 73 mAh cm−3.
