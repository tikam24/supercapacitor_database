In this work, nanostructured ultrathin K-birnessite type MnO 2 nanosheets are successfully prepared by a rapid and environmently friendly hydrothermal method, which involves only a facile redox reaction between KMnO 4 and nano-network structured bacterial cellulose with abundant hydroxyl groups. The results show that the unique three-dimensional interwoven structured bacterial cellulose acts as not only reductant but also bridging ligands for assembling nanoscaled building units to control the desired morphology of prepared MnO 2 . Furthermore, electrochemical performances of prepared MnO 2 are investigated as electrode materials for supercapacitors by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectrum in 1.0 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte. The resulting ultrathin K-birnessite type MnO 2 nanosheets based electrode exhibits higher capacitance (328.2 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 ), excellent rate capability (328.2 F g −1 and 200.4 F g −1 at 0.2 A g −1 and 2.0 A g −1 , respectively) and satisfactory cyclic stability (91.6% of initial capacitance even after 2000 cycles at 3.0 A g −1 ). This work suggests that bacterial cellulose as reductant is a promising candidate in the development of nanostructures of metal oxides.
