A self-assembled composite of bimorph 1-D akaganeite (β-FeOOH) into 2-D graphene-carbon nanotube matrix (GC) is prepared via hydrothermal method. The well ordered, chemically bonded structure results in low resistance and improved ion diffusion which enables the composite to deliver a specific capacitance of 533 F g−1 at current density of 1 A g−1. An asymmetric supercapacitor has also been assembled using GC as cathode and GC-FeOOH as anode which exhibits a high energy density of 36.6 W h kg−1 at the power density of 1.2 kW kg−1.
