Wood based activated carbons synthesized by two-stage thermocatalytical synthesis with NaOH activator were studied and used as supercapacitor electrodes (sulphuric acid electrolyte). Porous structure and electrochemical properties of carbons vs synthesis conditions were assessed. It was found that there are correlations between carbons synthesis variables, their porosity and supercapacitors functional characteristics. At the temperature 600Â°C and activator/precursor ratio 1.25 porosity decreased, however energy capacitance of supercapacitor increased calculating on elementary cell mass.
