Hierarchical CuSe interconnected nanosheet arrays (NSAs)-like structures are grow on nickel foam via a facile and low-cost chemical bath deposition technique. These CuSe electrodes are used as an efficient electrode material for supercapacitor without using any binders or conducting polymer additives. The structural, composition and morphological behaviors of the CuSe electrodes are characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy methods. The CuSe NSAs provide the abundant active sites, high conductivity and rapid charge transport, which resulting the low-charge transfer resistance at the interface of electrode-electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge plateaus from the CuSe electrode exhibit the Faradic battery-type redox behavior, which is distinct form the profiles of carbon based materials. As a battery-type electrode, the NSAs-like CuSe nanoarchitectures exhibits the outstanding electrochemical performances with a high specific capacity (∼192.93 mA h g-1at2Ag-1) and excellent cycling life(∼95.23% at 6Ag-1over3000cycles), respectively. Therefore, with the above findings, CuSe material has remarkable application potential in supercapacitors and could be effectively applied in other energy storage technologies.
