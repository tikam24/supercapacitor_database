The world is observing a tremendous transition from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to EVs lately. In the urban commute sector, two-wheelers play an important role as it reduces traffic congestion and saves time. With the adoption of two-wheeler E-bikes, the emission, noise and cost of maintenance are reduced. To enable higher efficiency and range of E-bike drive systems, a hybrid power source is essential. In this work, a novel algorithm is designed and developed for a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) comprising of battery and supercapacitor (SC) for BLDC drive in E-bike. The control algorithm design involves motoring and regenerative braking operation while incorporating five different riding modes using the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The efficiency, speed and torque tracking of the system are considered for variable loading of the motor to verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for HESS employed to E-bikes.
