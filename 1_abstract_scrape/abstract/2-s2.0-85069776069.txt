The Cu doped ZnCo2O4 nanostructures were synthesized by simple hydrothermal approach. Structural and morphological properties of pure and Cu-doped ZnCo2O4 have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD data confirm the pure phase of samples. Electron microscopic studies show the nanostructure morphology of Zn0.9Cu0.1Co2O4. The runauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of Zn0.9Cu0.1Co2O4 nanostructure is found to be 36m2g-1 with an average pore size of 5nm. The electrochemical properties of the samples were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) measurement in three-electrode configuration with 6M KOH as the electrolyte. Zn0.9Cu0.1Co2O4 exhibits maximum specific capacitance of 1228 Fg-1 at a current density of 2 Ag-1. Besides, electrochemical cycling stability of nanostructures is examined by GCD measurements and is found to be admirable cyclic stability of âˆ¼95 % up to 2000 charge discharge cycles.
