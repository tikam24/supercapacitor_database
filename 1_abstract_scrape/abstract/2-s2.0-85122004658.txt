Diamond composites have gained increasing interests because of their outstanding properties (e.g. robust mechanical properties, high conductivity and activity, good chemical and thermal stability, as well as excellent electrochemical properties) and their promising applications in a wide range of different fields. In this perspective, recent advances on the synthesis of diamond composites are summarized together with state-of-the-art progress in their electrochemical applications. Metal-diamond, alloyâ€“diamond, oxide/carbide/nitride-diamond, sp2 carbon/sp3 diamond, and organic-diamond composites are covered in the context of enhancing their performance of electrocatalysis, sensing, water treatment, supercapacitor, and photoelectrochemistry. Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of the synthesis and electrochemical applications of diamond composites are outlined and discussed.
