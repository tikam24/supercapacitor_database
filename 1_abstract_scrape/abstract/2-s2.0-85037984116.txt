Nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (NiCo-LDH) were successfully deposited on nickel foam by a facile hydrothermal method using polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) as the structure-directing reagent. The effect of PVP on the morphology and electrochemical performance of binder-free NiCo-LDH electrode for supercapacitor were investigated in detail. The prepared NiCo-LDH presented good dispersivity and appeared different flower-like structure via the addition of PVP. Specially, the NiCo-LDH electrode using 1 g of PVP exhibited a superior performance with a high-specific capacity of 724.9 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and 577.1 C g−1 at 10 A g−1. In addition, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on the optimized NiCo-LDH as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode was assembled with 6 M KOH as the electrolyte. The HSC device can deliver an energy density of 32.3 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 387.1 W kg−1. Moreover, the HSC device exhibited a good cycling stability with a retention rate of 94.0% after 2000-cycle charge-discharge test at 3 A g−1.
