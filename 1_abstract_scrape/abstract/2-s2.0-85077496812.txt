As an advanced anode materials for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors, the N-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) derived from tubular polypyrrole nanotube is decorated with Fe2O3 to produce the mesoporous 3D Fe2O3/N-CNT frameworks. The crystal structures and morphologies of the obtained products are investigated by XRD and FE-SEM. The electrochemical performances are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and impedance studies. The obtained Fe2O3/N-CNT composite electrode delivers a maximum specific capacitance of 264 F g−1 at 1 mA cm−2, high rate capability with a capacitance retention of 79% at 10 mA cm−2 and good cycling stability with 84% capacitance loss after 10000 cycles at 7 mA cm−2. The asymmetric Fe2O3/N-CNT//CuCo2O4 nanowires device exhibits at a high energy density 22.8 Wh kg−1 at the power density 216 W kg−1 in 2 M KOH aqueous electrolyte.
