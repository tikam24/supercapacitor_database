The most promising development direction of polymorphous supercapacitors is to find a scalable and inexpensive strategy to fabricate textile electrodes besides endowing a flexible device with a high areal capacitance. Herein, we explore an interesting scalable fabrication of cost-effective composite textile electrodes by promoting the in situ nucleation and growth of a polyaniline nanofiber array on carbon cloth under an electric field and then ensuring enough monomers and moist condition for the successive growth of the array. The assembled all-solid-state supercapacitor possesses a maximum energy density of 86.3 Î¼Wh cm-2 at 0.42 mW cm-2 and excellent structural stability.
