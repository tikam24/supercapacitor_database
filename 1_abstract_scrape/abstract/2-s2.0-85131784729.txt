Battery capacitor hybrid power supply system is widely used in DC microgrid. According to the characteristics of battery and capacitor hybrid energy supply system, a battery capacitor hybrid energy supply system based on medium and small power electric vehicle platform was proposed. The system includes hardware circuit and software control strategy. The battery capacitor hybrid power supply system is used in the field of electric vehicles. Through the reasonable power distribution of the battery and capacitor, the protection of vehicle battery and the improvement of vehicle performance under low electric power are realized. The whole system is simulated by PLECS, and the effectiveness of the application is verified.
