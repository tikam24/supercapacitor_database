In this paper, controversial views on the use of an integer- and fractional-order derivatives in the theory and practice of electric circuits are discussed. Maxwell's equations are definitely useful in classical circuit analyses but empirical, fractional-order modeling is advocated in specific applications, including an exemplary supercapacitor charging circuit. Thus, both methodologies can be employed in various, application-specific modeling tasks.
