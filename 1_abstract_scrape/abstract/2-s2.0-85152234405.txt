Due to developing technologies, the demand for energy devices has peaked rapidly which can be met with the help of energy harvesting and storage devices. The piezo-supercapacitors (PSCs) can simultaneously act as an energy harvester and storage unit in a single device that can be used in the application of wearable and biomedical electronics. This review envisages the types of piezoelectric separators, electrolytes, and electrodes that have been developed in recent times. Also, the mechanism of energy production via the self-charging process is elucidated. For the fabrication of such devices, there arises a necessity to dive deep into the physical properties of the materials used in the electrodes and the separators. Moreover, the practical applications of the PSCs harvesting energy from spontaneous processes to function in several biomedical and wearable devices are explored.
