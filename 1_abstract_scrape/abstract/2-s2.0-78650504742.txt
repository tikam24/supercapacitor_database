This paper describes the high efficiency drive unit for an EV, which is designed with accessible solutions for the efficiency increasing. Synchronous utilization of ultracapacitors and three-level inverter brings considerable power savings and enhancement longevity for a lithium battery pack. The total loss and EMI comparison between the two-level and three-level inverter and power measurements on the EV drive unit are presented at the conclusion part of this paper. Â© 2010 IEEE.
