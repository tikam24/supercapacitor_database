The electrochemical performance of the carbon-coated Li3V 2(PO4)3(LVP/C) composite prepared through a carbon thermal reduction route has been investigated. The results show that the LVP/C composite exhibits reversible Li+ de-intercalating/ intercalating behaviors with the swing potential in the range of -0.2 to 0.8 V vs. SCE in a neutral Li2SO4 aqueous solution. It has also been found that the activated carbon (AC)//LVP/C asymmetric hybrid capacitor exhibits good electrochemical properties. The asymmetric hybrid capacitor shows sloping profiles in the galvanostatic charge-discharge curves with the operating voltage in the range of 0-1.7 V and can work steadily. Both of the capacity retention and coulombic efficiency of the asymmetric hybrid capacitor can retain more than 90% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles at a current density of 250 mA g-1. At the power density of 102 W kg-1, the energy density of the asymmetric hybrid capacitor is 35Whkg-1, and even at 2000 Wkg-1, the energy density can achieve 5Whkg-1. In addition, we have found that the conductive additive such as acetylene black is not required during the electrode fabricating process with the LVP/C composite as an electrode material, and this will serve the interest of saving cost. This work could provide an evidence for the development of aqueous asymmetric hybrid capacitors using LVP/C as electrode materials. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
