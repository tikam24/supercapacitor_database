Customer acceptance of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) depends strongly on the performance of the Energy Storage System (ESS). Energy density, power density and lifetime of ESSs are three key parameters to be optimized in a BEV. For this purpose the use of a hybrid energy source on board of electric vehicles has been proposed and analyzed in literature. However, most of the previous studies have been limited to simulation or to test bench experiments of the ESS. This paper focuses on the implementation and use of the association of high energy NiCd battery and high power supercapacitors on board of a 3.5. t urban bus. An uncomplicated and efficient energy management strategy has been implemented and tested. The behavior of the vehicle has been investigated by experiment on a roller test bench for two different driving cycles, highlighting the effects of the hybridization: reduction of losses within the battery with consequent expected lifetime extension, improved dynamic of the vehicle and a possible driving range extension.
