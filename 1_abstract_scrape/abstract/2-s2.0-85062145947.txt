A totally new hybrid ternary (polyaniline-acetylene black-copper ferrite) system reported in the present work. The formation of materials was confirmed by XRD (X-ray diffraction), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), UV (Ultra-violet spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning electron microscopy), and EDS (Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy) analysis. The interconnected structure of ternary system favored different electrochemical activities. Ternary PACF electrode showed the highest specific capacitance of 732.35 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Symmetric supercapacitor fabricated using hybrid PACF electrode exhibited a specific capacitance of 192.64 F/g at 0.5 A/g. The obtained specific energy and specific power of ternary hybrid system were 26.757 Wh/kg and 3165.25 W/kg, respectively. Ternary composite provides fascinating results due to the synergistic effects between individual components and can be used successfully in the field of supercapacitors. EIS analysis was carried out to obtain the resistances of electrode material.
