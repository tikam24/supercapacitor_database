Quantum dots based supercapacitors created a dramatic improvement in energy storage system. Herein, we reports a novel member of fluorescent supercapacitor has been fabricated from rhodamine b dye. In this work, Potassium ferrocyanide doped in the polymeric rhodamine b nanodots which were directly grown at the surface of graphite electrodes using cyclic voltammetry. Potassium ferrocyanide doped polymeric rhodamine b nanodots enhanced the specific conductance (320.0 F/g), and better long term cycling stability which are 2 to 3 times higher than individual polymeric rhodamine b nanodots as well as potassium ferrocyanide modified graphite electrodes. Interestingly, the electrochemical activity of the fluorescent Potassium ferrocyanide doped in the polymeric rhodamine b nanodots could be easily monitored by photoluminescence as well as voltammetric methods. These unique features of proposed hybrid fluorescent nanodots makes it smart nanomaterial to enhance the performance of supercapacitors. This organicinorganic composite nanodots material based electrode shows a promising future for energy storage with high energy density, high power density and excellent cycle life.
