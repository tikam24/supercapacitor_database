The precise synthesis of interconnected and porous microstructured electrode materials for supercapacitor application is always challenging to obtain maximum surface area for electrode–electrolyte interaction. Herein, the interconnected microstructured morphology of NiCo2O4 is synthesized via an inexpensive chemical route viz hydrothermal method. Synthesized NiCo2O4 nanomaterial is characterized for structural, morphological, electrochemical characteristics by XRD, SEM, CV, GCD, and EIS measurements. The XRD pattern reveals that nanostructured material is polycrystalline with a cubic phase. The average crystallite size of NiCo2O4 is 10.85 nm. The SEM analysis confirms interconnected plates microstructures with surface aea of 34 m2g−1. The NiCo2O4 electrodes are fabricated and their specific capacitance was measured using CV and GCD data. The maximum specific capacitance of the NiCo2O4 electrode is 550 F/g. Furthermore, an as-fabricated asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) has an energy density of 3.81 Wh/kg, a power density of 789 W/kg at 4 mAcm−2, and capacitance retention of 87% after 2,000 cycle. An interconnected plate-like microstructure of NiCo2O4 material is a potential candidate for energy storage application.
