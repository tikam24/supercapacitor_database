This article described a facile solvothermal synthesis method for γ-Fe2O3/graphite composite preparation with liquid phase exfoliated graphite (Gp), Fe3+ (FeCl3•6H2O), and NaOH precipitants. The γ-Fe2O3/graphite composite was characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The electrochemical properties of γ-Fe2O3/graphite composite as electrode materials for supercapacitor were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests. The results showed that specific capacity of γ-Fe2O3/graphite composite is 520 F g-1 at 3A g-1 in 1M KOH aqueous electrolyte and capacity retention is 91.3% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
