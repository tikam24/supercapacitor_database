The development of waste-derived functional materials for environmental and energy applications is a sustainable approach to fight global warming, and address energy and materials challenges. In this regard, many scientists are interested in the supercapacitor, adsorbent, and catalyst applications of nitrogen-doped biochars. In this article, we report the data that was collected as a part of our research on the effects of different external nitrogenous sources on the properties of biochar [1]. The data on infrared spectra of the modified samples at various temperatures is valuable to study the changes in functional groups on biochar as a function of temperature as well as nitrogen precursors. Raw data from Time-of-flight Secondary ion mass spectroscopy, surface profilometry, and scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are also provided. We expect that the data will benefit researchers around the world working in the field of nitrogen modifications of biochar.
