NiMn2O4 on reduced graphene oxide (NiMn2O4/rGO) was prepared by the hydrothermal method. The effects of graphene on the microstructure, specific surface area, and capacitance performance of CoMn2O4/rGO materials were studied. The results show that NiMn2O4 nanosheets are deposited on the surface of graphene sheets and the aggregation phenomenon disappeared. Compared with pure NiMn2O4, NiMn2O4/rGO has a high specific surface area and excellent electrochemical properties. It has a specific capacitance of 1375F/g at 1A/g, while that of pure NiMn2O4 is 924F/g. After 5000 charge and discharge, the specific capacitance retention rate of NiMn2O4/rGO at 5A/g is 90%, while that of NiMn2O4 is 78%. NiMn2O4/rGO shows good capacitive properties and has a wide application prospect as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
