When the cascaded H-bridge topology is used in the hybrid energy storage system (HESS), the asymmetry of the energy storage components' types and voltages and the coupled AC current makes it difficult for the traditional modulation methods to realize independent power control of each energy storage unit. Thus, these methods can not be applied to the realization of the complex working modes of HESS. Therefore, this paper proposed an asymmetric cascaded HESS hybrid level shifted PWM (HLS-PWM) modulation technique. According to the direction of supercapacitors' output power and the total output power of the energy storage system, the HLS-PWM was divided into the two fundamental modes - the same (MP) and opposite (MN) modes. And then the supercapacitor charge and discharge control under unit power factor and non-unit power factor was analyzed based on the two modes. Furthermore, the five operation modes and power control method of HESS was implemented through the charge and discharge control of the supercapacitor. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed HLS-PWM can realize the power control of asymmetric cascaded HESS.
