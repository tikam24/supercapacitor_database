Redox-active and conductive polymers and transition metal oxides are appearing group of faradaic battery-type electrode materials that exhibit improved electrochemical properties in supercapacitors. Herein, we report a new class of ferrocenyl-based nanocomposite electrodes for the development of high-performance supercapacitors using a simple physical mixing method of redox active ferrocenyl modified GQDs with conductive polymer including PANI and Fe3O4. Having the popular redox-active organometallic compound like (Fc), PANI, and Fe3O4 as integrated constituent components, the obtained electrode materials exhibit remarkably charge storage and delivery capabilities. The structural properties of the electrode materials investigate by appropriate analyses. The highest capacity, energy density, and power density are to be 295 mAh g−1, 62.1 Wh kg−1 and 4140 W kg−1 for the nanocomposite, respectively. These results which can be attributed to the synergistic behavior of the different types of electrode materials in the hybrid nanocomposites, leading to the improved electrochemical performance. In addition, the cycling performance is tested with 5000 long cycles. The retention of charge storage (91.45%) after 5000 cycles at a current density of 1 A g−1 shows the great potential of GQDs-PolyFc/Fe3O4/PANI nanocomposites as electrode materials for future energy storage technologies. Finally, we conclude with some suggestions for future work.
