This paper presents a control scheme for the charge and discharge operations of a hybrid energy storage system comprised of batteries and supercapacitors. The benefits of high-power density of supercapacitors and high-energy density of batteries have a potential to improve the dynamic performance of a power system and improve the battery life when combined. Bidirectional dc-dc converters are integrated with the hybrid energy storage system to control the charge and discharge operations of the energy storage system. A model and simulation of the system is developed in Matlab/Simulink and the results are presented.
