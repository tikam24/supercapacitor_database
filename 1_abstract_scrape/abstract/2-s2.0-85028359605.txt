Two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially graphene and MoS2 sheets, have gained much attention and shown great promise for the application in supercapacitors. To widely use the 2D materials for supercapacitors, highly efficient, low cost, and environmentally friendly synthetic methods for the preparation of 2D materials should be developed. Here, we will review recently developed solution-based processes for preparing 2D materials for supercapacitors. Chemical exfoliation-reduction, chemical intercalation, and liquid phase exfoliation methods will be introduced. Moreover, the electrochemical characteristics of graphene and MoS2-based electrodes for supercapacitors are summarized. In addition to solution-based processes, other challenges and opportunities are discussed in terms of controlling nanosheet compositions, sizes, and thicknesses.
