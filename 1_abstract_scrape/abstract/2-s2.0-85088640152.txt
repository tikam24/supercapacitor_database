A coordination smoothing strategy of source (gas turbine), load (heat pump group) and storage (liquid heat storage and supercapacitor) was proposed to solve the problem of peak-to-valley difference and short-term fluctuation of tie-line power flow in heat-power coordinated microgrid with high penetration of renewable energy. By analogy with battery, a set containing elements which describ the state of each power flattening device was established. The power regulation coefficient and control coefficient of the gas turbine were set up by analyzing the electro-thermal coupling characteristics. Also, a time mark of heat pump group's status and a minimum open-close algorithm for heat pumps were proposed to control the heat pumps' switch status. Finally, the power smoothing potential of each device was tracked in real time, and the tie-line power smoothing target was adjusted relatively. Fuzzy control and composite filtering method were used to distribute the power smoothing task. Gas turbine, heat pump groups and supercapacitors stabilized the low, medium and high frequency parts of power fluctuations synergistically. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and economy of the proposed smoothing strategy.
