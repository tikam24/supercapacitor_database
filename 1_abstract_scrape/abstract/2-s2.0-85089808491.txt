There are remarkedly increasing demands in electronic devices including the portable electronic devices and electric vehicles (EVs). Therefore, the energy storages that can store energy efficiently with both high energy and power densities with good cyclability as display in batteries and supercapacitors are needed. The hybrid energy storages are one of the energy storage devices merging the advantages of both batteries and supercapacitors to overcome those lacking properties in each device. Thus, the lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LICs) are introduced consisting battery-type as negative electrode and supercapacitors-type as positive electrode. There are many selections of electrode materials that can be used in the LICs such as carbonaceous materials and lithium titanate (LTO). The cell configuration was developed and fabricated in organic electrolyte since coin-cell to cylindrical cell. Herein, the 18650 configuration is introduced as hybrid energy storage consisting LTO and activated carbon as negative and positive electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the additional additives in electrolyte are also studied and investigated to improve the electrochemical performances to the hybrid capacitors.
