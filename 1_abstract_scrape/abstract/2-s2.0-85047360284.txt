3D printing is a fast-emerging technology, and a shape is fabricated using layer-by-layer deposition of a material in a bottom-up manufacturing operation. Here a porous nickel/polyaniline nanocages multiscale supercapacitor synthesized using 3D printing technology is fabricated. The porous structure of iron-nickel and polyaniline nanocages can increase the specific surface area which lead to enhance the specific capacitance. 3D printing technology is presented in energy devices to accurately fabricate the delicate structure.
