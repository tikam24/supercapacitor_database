This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) based energy management strategy (EMS), combined with power filtering for a pure electric vehicle. The electrical power supply is provided by a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including Li-Ion battery and supercapacitors (SCs), adopting a fully active parallel topology. The vehicle model was organized and constructed using the energetic macroscopic representation (EMR). The main objective of this work is to ensure an efficient power distribution in the proposed dual source, in order to reduce the battery degradation. To evaluate the impact of the developed design and the efficiency of the developed EMS, the proposed FLC strategy is compared to a classical EMS using SCs-filtering strategy and architecture based on battery storage model. To validate the proposed topology, simulation results are provided for the new European driving cycle (NEDC) using MATLAB/Simulink environment.
