Flake-like NiCo bimetal-organic framework (NiCo-MOF) is prepared via a simple one-step hydrothermal process. By combining the advantages of composition designing and distinctive micro/nanostructures, the flake-like NiCo-MOF constructed with two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets can be a promising candidate as active material for high-performance supercapacitors (SCs) in the aspect of enhanced specific capacitance and stability. In a three-electrode system using 1 m KOH as electrolyte, the fabricated flake-like NiCo-MOF electrode exhibits high-specific capacitance (1107.3 F g− 1 at 1 A g− 1), good rate performance (76.7% retention of its highest capacitance at 10 A g− 1) and long-term cycling stability (70.1% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 15 A g− 1). Furthermore, an energy storage device based on reduced graphene oxide and flake-like NiCo-MOF shows a maximum energy density of 30.81 Wh kg− 1 at a power density of 749.9 W kg− 1 with high capacitance retention of ~ 85.3% (up to 5000 cycles at 15 A g− 1).
