A self-supported nickel nanowire array coated with Ni(OH)2 (Ni(OH)2@SNWA) with enhanced electrochemical performance was successfully fabricated by template-directed electrodeposition and oxidation treatment. Porous polycarbonate membrane was used as the template for the preparation of self-supported nickel nanowire array with a small wire diameter and high wire density. The Ni(OH)2 on the surface formed through oxidation treatment is in close contact with the inside nickel wire. Due to its self-supported and integrated coreâ€“shell structure, the Ni(OH)2@SNWA has excellent ionic and electrical conductivities, and shows enhanced electrochemical performance at high current densities.
