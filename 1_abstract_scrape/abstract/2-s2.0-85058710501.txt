The Carbon sphere@Nickel sulfide core-shell nanocomposites for different mole ratios of Carbon sphere (0:1; 0.5:1 and 1:1) have been synthesized by a facile low temperature water-bath method without any further calcination. XRD studies on the core-shell nanocomposites show that characteristic peaks associated with rhombohedral phase structure of nickel sulfide have been retained. TEM morphology presents the interlinked core-shell of Carbon sphere@Nickel sulfide composite with grass-leaf dexterity for better ionic diffusion. BET study confirms the formation of mesoporous structure with high surface area. The existence of elements and its electronic configuration is noted through XPS. The electrochemical studies on pristine nickel sulfide and its Carbon sphere@Nickel sulfide core-shell composites reveal that Carbon sphere@Nickel sulfide (0.5:1) exhibits high specific capacitance of 1022 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. It shows good cyclic performance even beyond 4000 consecutive charge/discharge cycles at a relatively high current density of 20 A g−1 with the ∼83% of retention.
