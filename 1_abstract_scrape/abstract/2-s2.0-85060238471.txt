It remains a challenge to fabricate a suitable electrode with high specific capacitance (Csp) and excellent cyclic stability that can enhance the electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor. In the present work, Ce2Zr2O7/PbS nanocomposite has been synthesized and its electrochemical properties has been evaluated for supercapacitor electrode application. The high BET surface area (46 m2/g) and small pore size (11.15 nm) enable better intercalation of electrolyte and confer better capacitive performance on the surface of the nanocomposite electrode. The nanocomposite electrode exhibits an excellent pseudocapacitive performance in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte having specific capacitance of 219 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. Furthermore, it presents an excellent cycling stability and retains âˆ¼100% Csp after 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. The better electrochemical performance and 100% retention of Csp up to 1000 cycles is attributed to the unique microstructure of nanocomposite i. e., due to the combination of the conductive nature of sulfide and stability of the oxide nanomaterials. These results suggest that Ce2Zr2O7/PbS nanocomposite can be an excellent candidate to be used as an electrode material in supercapacitor devices.
