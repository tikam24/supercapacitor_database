This article presents the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of bimetallic Au–Cu/g–C3N4 nanocomposites as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. The electrochemical analysis revealed that the bimetallic composite uncovered a superior electrochemical response than the base material g-C3N4. The goal of this research was to determine the performance of pseudocapacitance electrodes by designing an equivalent circuit from the Nyquist plot with the EIS spectrum. From this equivalent circuit, an equivalent series resistance of Au–Cu/g-C3N4 and g-C3N4 sheets was found as 1.52 Ω and 2.19 Ω, respectively. The significant improvement in supercapacitor behavior of Au–Cu/g-C3N4 compared to all other synthesized material was accredited to synergistic effects of composites over the g-C3N4 sheets, and here, mass ratio composition plays a significant role in analyzing the synergy phenomenon.
