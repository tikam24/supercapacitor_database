Two-dimensional transition metal carbon/nitride (MXene) has a graphene-like structure, and microscopically exhibits lamellar and various surface groups. It has good electrical conductivity, ion transport and high hydrophilic properties, and becomes ideal electrode material for supercapacitor. The MXene layer and layer, which are prone to collapse and stacking, and the presence of functional groups are detrimental to the performance as an electrode material. It would have great application prospects, if its electrochemical performance could be improved by heat treatment, ion intercalation and carbon composites. In this paper, the preparation methods of MXene materials were firstly introduced, and then the effects of surface modification and structure optimization on the electrochemical performance of MXene supercapacitors were summarized. Finally, the research prospects of MXene materials on supercapacitors were prospected.
