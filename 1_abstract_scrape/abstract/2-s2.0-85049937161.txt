Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), serving as a promising electrode material in the supercapacitors, have attracted tremendous interests in recent years. Here, through modifying the molar ratio of the Ni2+ and Co2+, we have successfully fabricated Ni-MOF and Ni/Co-MOF by a facile hydrothermal method. The Ni/Co-MOF with a dandelion-like hollow structure shows an excellent specific capacitance of 758 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in the three-electrode system. Comparing with Ni-MOF, the obtained Ni/Co-MOF has a better rate capacitance (89% retention at 10 A g−1) and cycling life (75% retention after 5000 circulations). Besides, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor based on Ni/Co-MOF and active carbon exhibits a high specific energy density of 20.9 W h kg−1 at the power density of 800 W kg−1. All these results demonstrate that the mixed-metal strategy is an effective way to optimize the morphology and improve the electrochemical property of the MOFs.
