This chapter aims to present the current practices, challenges, and opportunities for various energy storage technologies for utilization in electrical networks. Renewable energy sources (RERs) power output cannot meet the immediate demand of customers due to their intermittent behavior and hence there is a requirement for energy storage systems (ESSs). The ESS plays a deciding role in the effective utilization of electric vehicles (EVs). In comparison with the existing technologies in ESSs such as ultracapacitors, fuel cells, and battery packs, the most economically viable option is considered as the battery packs. There are different types of ESSs such as supercapacitors, fuel cells, flywheels, and various electrochemical and non-electrochemical storages. This chapter discusses and analyzes the characteristics, size, functions, applications, stability, cost, etc. of various ESSs.
