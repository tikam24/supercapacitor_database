This paper deals with supercapacitor embedded model and its online identification procedure for Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) application. To take into account its non-linear behavior, the strategy used in this paper consists, in a first step, in modeling a supercapacitor by a set of fractional linear systems. Each element of this set represents the behavior of the supercapacitor only around one operating voltage. A global non-linear model is then deduced through an integration method. An online identification procedure has been developed for this non-linear model. Its time behavior has been compared with that of a supercapacitor cell. Â© 2009 by ASME.
