A novel composite (Ni/Mn-HCF) was directly synthesized on carbon cloth (CC) with a facile hydrothermal method following the galvanostatic electrodeposition of Ni. Ni/Mn-HCF on CC (Ni/Mn-HCF/CC) demonstrates a unique morphology with nanorods uniformly distributed on microcubes, which endows Ni/Mn-HCF/CC enormous surface to facilitate rapid charge/ion transportation on the electrode/electrolyte interface and provides more active sites for ions adsorption/exchange. Ni/Mn-HCF/CC demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performances such as high areal capacity, extraordinary rate performance and excellent cycling stability. A wide operational voltage window of 2.0 V, high energy density of 3.2 W h m−2 at 49.8 W m−2, and 109.24% capacity retention after 2000 cycles were realized on the as-fabricated novel asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The notable supercapacitive performances suggest that the ASC device has a great perspective for future energy storage applications.
