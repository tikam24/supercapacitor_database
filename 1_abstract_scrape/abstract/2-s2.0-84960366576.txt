Polypyrrole were prepared via in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of multisulfonate acid dye (acid violet 19). In this work, acid violet 19 could play the role as dopant, surfactant and physical cross-linker for pyrrole polymerization, and had impact on the morphology, dispersion stability, thermal stability, electrical conductivity and electrochemical behavior of the samples. The thermal stability of the dye doped polypyrrole was enhanced than pure polypyrrole due to the strong interactions between polypyrrole and acid violet 19. The dispersion stability of the samples in water was also improved by incorporating an appropriate amount of acid violet 19. The sample with 20% of acid violet 19 showed granular morphology with the smallest diameter of âˆ¼50 nm and possessed the maximum electrical conductivity of 39.09 S/cm. The as-prepared multifunctional dye doped polypyrrole samples were used to fabricate electrodes and exhibited a mass specific capacitance of 379-206 F/g in the current density range of 0.2-1.0 A/g. The results indicated that the multifunctional dye could improve the performances of polypyrrole as electrode material for supercapacitors.
