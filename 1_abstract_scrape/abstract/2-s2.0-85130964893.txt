As an important component of electrode materials, cobalt is crucial in electrochemical energy storage devices including Li ion battery and supercapacitor. It has been acknowledged that the addition of cobalt enables high-rate performance and significantly enhances the cycle stability. However, the electrochemical mechanism remains elusive due to the complexity of material microstructure and diversity of electrode processing. In this work, a series of nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxide (Ni-Co LDH) nanosheets with designed ratios of Ni/Co and controlled morphologies have been in-situ synthesized. In the light of experimental analyses and density functional theory calculations, the effect of cobalt in determining the crystal structure, morphology, ion diffusion, ion absorption ability of Ni-Co LDH nanosheets has been unambiguously demonstrated. Especially, both ratio and valence state of cobalt plays a significant role in the electrochemical performance. The Ni-Co LDH nanosheets with the ratio of Ni:Co = 3:1 shows the highest specific capacitance of 2875 F g − 1 (4.95 F cm−2) at a current density of 2 mA cm−2 and 88.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles
