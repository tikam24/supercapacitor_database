This work reveals a facile synthesis of gadolinium ions adsorbed 2D-graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (Gd3+/2D-gCN NSs) via a chemical-adsorption method for supercapacitor electrode materials. The structural, microstructural, and electrochemical properties of Gd3+/2D-gCN NSs and pristine 2D-gCN NSs are ascertained. The calculated capacitance for Gd3+/2D-gCN NSs is almost three times higher than the pristine one. The Nyquist and Bode plots exhibit the capacitance mechanism. Gd+ intercalation between the electrical double layers of adjacent 2D-gCN nanosheets increase the Van der Waals gap, which enhances it's specific capacitance. There is almost 100% retention of capacitance for Gd3+/2D-gCN NSs based device over 1000th cycle.
