An electrochemically active composite material consisting of zinc vanadate (Zn3V2O8) and nitrogen doped multi wall carbon nanotubes (N-MWNCT) was prepared using simple hydrothermal procedure. This attractive composite material was exploited as an electrode for the supercapacitor application. The multiple oxidation states of vanadium and stable zinc rendered wide range of redox reaction with MWCNT which was explored with K2SO4 neutral electrolyte. The electron microscopic analysis along with XRD and XPS confirmed the formation of ternary composite. The unique combination of Zn3V2O8 and N-MWNCT showed a specific capacitance of 403 F g−1 with better stability of 79% for 5000 cycles. The presence of N-MWCNT enhanced the performance of the ZVC composite by providing structural support which significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance Rct (1.3 Ω) and series resistance Rs (1.8 Ω) by providing synergetic effects. The results have demonstrated the potential scope of ZVC for the energy storage device.
