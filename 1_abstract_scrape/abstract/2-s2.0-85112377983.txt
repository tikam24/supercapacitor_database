For wireless sensor network (WSN) nodes with an extremely tight energy supply, herein, an adaptive energy management strategy based on a hybrid energy system composed of a photovoltaic device, Li battery, and supercapacitor is proposed. According to information fusion of the irradiation intensity, load consumption and the state of charge of the battery and supercapacitor, the estimation of energy shortage caused by future wake-up pulses is carried out. Based on this, the charge/predischarge power of the Li battery is adaptively adjusted. Simulations validate that much lower Li battery capacity loss than the previous strategies is achieved without sacrificing the wake-up success rate, thereby extending the life of the hybrid energy module in a WSN node by an order of magnitude. In addition, the proposed strategy has excellent robustness in the double-random environmental and working conditions including the irradiation intensity, driving event frequency, etc., and can always maintain excellent performance while these parameters are changing within a wide range. Therefore, an effective energy guarantee for long life and high wake-up success rate of WSN nodes under double-random environmental and working conditions is provided and the practical application of WSN nodes in such scenarios is promoted.
