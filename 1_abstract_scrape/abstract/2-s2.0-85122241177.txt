Synergetic impact of metal inorganic into conducting polymer is an efficient way to enhance the energy storage capacity and tailor surface property of the product. Therefore, a novel composite of Ag3O4/polyaniline has synthesized via a facile chemical oxidative polymerization method with varying concentration of inorganic filler. Mesoporous Ag3O4 nanoflakes decorated polyaniline fibres like architecture help to achieve better capacitance and electrical conductivity. A binder-free pure electrode material of Ag3O4/polyaniline was prepared and analyzed in a three-electrode cell system using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements had performed to optimize the concentration of Ag3O4, with the increasing amount of Ag3O4 into PANI. Ag3O4 /polyaniline (AGP 2.0) nanocomposite led to highest gravimetric and volumetric capacitance of 1735 F g−1 and 562.2 F cm−3 associated with 94% specific capacitance retention and 84% coulombic efficiency. The equivalent series resistance with 2.2 Ω provides good electrical conductivity. The mentioned outcomes suggest that Ag3O4/polyaniline nanocomposites can be used as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors.
