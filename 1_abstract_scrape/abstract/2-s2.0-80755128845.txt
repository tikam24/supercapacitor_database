Manganese oxide/carbon aerogel composite electrodes are prepared by a selflimiting anodic-electrochemical deposition of manganese oxide into a binderenriched carbon aerogel layer, drop-cast on a graphite substrate, using 0.1 M Mn(CH 3COO) 2·4H 2O as the electrolyte. Manganese oxide grows in the form of thin nanofibers along the backbone of the carbon aerogel, leaving adequate working space for the electrolyte and enabling a fuller extent of the utilization of the manganese oxide to make the composite an outstanding supercapacitor electrode material. The manganese oxide is determined to be Mn 3O 4 with the Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The rectangularity of the cyclic-voltammogram loops of the composite electrode is excellent and remains that way for scan rates up to a very-high value of 500 mVs -1, indicating extremely good redox reversibility and cycle efficiency. At a scan rate of 25 mVs -1, the specific capacitance, as measured in 0.5 M Na 2SO 4 for a potential window of 0.1-0.9 V vs. Ag/AgCl, reaches a maximum value of 503 Fg -1 and experiences only a negligible decay of less than 1% at the 6000th cycle, implying an extraordinary cycling stability. The cycling efficiency is as high as 98% at a current density of 8 Ag -1 cm -2, showing an almost-ideal capacitive behavior. The power density reaches 48.5 kW kg -1 and the energy density 21.6 Wh kg -1 at a scan rate of 500 mVs -1, well above the specifications of current state-of-the-art supercapacitors. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
