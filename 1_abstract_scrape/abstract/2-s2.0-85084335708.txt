In this work, CdS quantum dots were fabricated through the ionic liquid assisted wet chemical method to investigate the structural, optical response, electrochemical behaviour, photo catalytic activity, hemocompatibility and antibacterial studies for optoelectronic devices, supercapacitors, photocatalytic and biological applications. The synthesis powder has confirmed the formation of the cubic structure of the CdS material using the powder XRD pattern. Further, the Raman and FT-IR studies have supported the formation of the CdS synthesis. The XRD data and TEM image were employed to examine the lattice parameters like crystallite size, crystalline nature, lattice constant, d-spacing and volume of the unit cell and particle size. The broad optical absorption has been seen in the visible portion in the optical spectra. Using the Tauc plot from the optical absorption spectrum data, the optical band gap value of CdS NPs is computed as 2.74 eV and proved to be a narrow band gap material. Examining the electrochemical properties of CdS NPs revealed the redox behaviour, using CV characterization. The effect of the Indigo carmine (IC) and Congo red (CR) dye on the optical absorption, degradation irradiation time and photocatalytic efficiency of CdS NPs have been discussed. Antimicrobial studies of CdS NPs have been investigated.
