The nickel oxide microtubes with high surface-to-volume ratio have been achieved using the Bacillus subtilis bacteria. Surface properties of the metal-oxide nanostructured materials were investigated by electron microscopy. The surface area of that was also studied by the Brunauer Emmett Teller analysis method. The materials were used at the construction of supercapacitor as an electrode active material.
