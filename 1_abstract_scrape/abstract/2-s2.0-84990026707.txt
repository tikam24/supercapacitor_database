Ni(OH)2, as a promising supercapacitor electrode material, has attracted numerous research attention to design well-organized structures and hybrid materials. Herein, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) decorated hierarchical Ni(OH)2 with lamellar structure (similar to a dessert of dragon eye pastry in Sichuan, China) was successfully fabricated by a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method. The CQDs induces a great enhancement in electrochemical energy storage. The hybrid exhibits a specific capacitance of 2900 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and good rate capability. Such remarkable electrochemical properties can be primarily ascribed to the uniform structure of hierarchical Ni(OH)2 and the significantly enhanced utilization of CQDs.
