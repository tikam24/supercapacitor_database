Graphitic carbon materials have excellent intrinsic characteristics for charge conduction with high stability and reliability. However, pure graphite is not suitable for supercapacitor applications due to inferior active surface area. For this purpose, numerous porous carbon architectures have been synthesized and examined for maximizing the charge storage capacity and performance in electrochemical supercapacitors (ESCs). It has been observed that nanoporous architectures are suitable for efficient charge storage in ESCs. The nanoporous carbon materials, containing pores ranging from micropores (<2nm) to mesopores (2â€“50nm), are suitable for efficient access and transport of ions from the electrolytes. However, serious attention is required in fabrication of electrode materials for ensuring further advancement in this field. This chapter gives a detailed overview of carbon-based materials for various kinds of ESCs exploring the materials perspectives and device characteristics along with an emphasis on integrated energy systems and prospects.
