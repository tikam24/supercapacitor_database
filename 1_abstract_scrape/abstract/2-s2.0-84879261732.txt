The electrode is the key part of the electrochemical supercapacitor (ES) and its materials for determining the properties of ES are very important. Metal oxide electrodes not only have double-layer capacitance but also possess pseudocapacitance. Together with the much larger specific capacitance, long service life, and facile maintenance, they have recently attracted extensive attention of researchers for their potential applications in novel, efficient, and practical energy storage devices. In this paper, the storage mechanism, preparation, and electrochemical performance of ES based on metal oxide are summarized. And their future research directions and development perspective are outlooked.
