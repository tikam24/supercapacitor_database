CoMn LDH electrode is successfully prepared via facile and cost-effective electrodeposition method. The effect of Co2+/Mn2+ molar ratio on supercapacitive performance is systematically investigated. It is found that the presence of Mn(OH)6 unit in CoMn LDH offers an excellent reversibility as well as highly electrochemical activity for supercapacitor application. The CoMn LDH film with a Co2+/Mn2+ molar ratio of 9:1 loaded on Ni foam electrode exhibits the maximum specific capacitance of 1062.6 F/g at the current density of 0.7 A/g with an excellent cyclic stability of 96.3% over 5000 CD cycles. It indicates that CoMn LDH nanoflakes loaded on Ni foam can minimize the lattice mismatch which leads to an excellent cyclic stability. The asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with CoMn LDH/Ni foam and AC electrodes shows an excellent cyclic life of 84.2% and an energy density of 4.4 Wh/kg with a power density of 2500 W/kg.
