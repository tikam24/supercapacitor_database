Activated carbon (AC) samples as electrode materials were prepared by means of simultaneous physical-chemical activation using walnut shells as precursors. The porosity and surface chemistry of the resultant AC samples were studied by the nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, and FTIR spectrum. The testing supercapacitors were assembled with resultant carbon electrode and electrolyte of 6 mol·L-1 KOH solution. Their electrochemical properties were investigated by charge-discharge of constant current, cyclic voltammogram, impedance spectrum and so on. The results showed that the capacitor had low inner resistance, low leakage current, high stability, and capacitance retainability. The specific capacitance of AC increased with increasing BET specific surface area. The specific capacitance of the AC sample with a specific area of 1197 m2·g-1 could be as high as 292 F·g-1. At a discharge current of 80 mA, the corresponding specific energy density, power density, and maximum power of the supercapacitor are 7.3 Wh·kg-1, 770 W·kg-1, and 5.1 W·g-1, respectively. © 2008 Chinese Chemical Society and College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University.
