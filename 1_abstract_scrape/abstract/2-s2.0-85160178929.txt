Recently, the development of flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) has recognized considerable attention owing to their simple fabrication process, low price, supple incorporation into textile, extended durability, quick charge/discharge profile, outstanding efficacy, and ability to bond the energy and power break between traditional capacitors and fuel cells and batteries. This present chapter summarizes all the crucial parameters associated with the mechanism of energy storage and fabrication particulars of FSC electrode materials. This present chapter comprises a short review of often employed nanostructured materials, including metalâ€“organic frameworks and MXene-based supercapacitor electrodes based on recently existing literature. Furthermore, a comprehensive list of FSCs based on the graphic design and construction procedure is provided, highlighting the importance of various components that contribute to mechanical stretchability. Hence, the present chapter searches the concepts of supreme reputation to encounter the severe necessities for the aforementioned application, associated with the strategy and construction of flexible electrode materials to enhance the electrochemical behavior of the state-of-the-art supercapacitors.
