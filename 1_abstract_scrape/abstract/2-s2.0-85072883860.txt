The problem of synthesis of quasi-optimal control laws of an electric shutdown valves by the criterion of minimum energy consumption is solved. Electric shutdown valves under consideration are the ones in which the DC actuator by means of a sliderâ€“crank mechanism closes the valve bore. The actuator is powered by a self-contained battery of supercapacitors. The required control law ensures the closing of the valve for a given time with minimal energy consumption and shock-free stop. Mathematical description of the problem and its solution method are proposed. The method is based on reducing the problem to be solved to the problem of finite-dimensional optimization. Limitations on the maximum possible current and supply voltage, mechanical stops in the valve design, and the variability of the supply voltage and pressure of the working medium in the valve are taken into account. An example of application of the proposed method is provided.
