Environmentally friendly water-based composite material has been investigated as a novel binder for manufacturing supercapacitor electrodes. The performance of these electrodes and those with the conventional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder were studied. Results obtained from cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectrometry, and charge/discharge measurements showed that the electrodes with the new binder performed significantly better than the electrodes with the conventional PVDF binder; the specific capacitance increased by 51 % in an aqueous electrolyte while in an organic electrolyte, it increased by 15 %. This increase in capacitance was attributed to the electrophilic and hydrophilic nature of the new binding composite. The main reason for the improvement in capacitance was ascribed to reduction of equivalent series resistance (ESR). The presence of highly amorphous polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), a polymeric component of the new composite binder, was responsible for the reduction in ESR.
