Electrical sensors, flexible displays, and health monitors are examples of wearable electronic gadgets that have recently received high impact and have moved continuously in the direction of progress. Wearable supercapacitors have piqued attention because of their high steadiness, cheap cost, rapid charging/discharging, and high efficiency, all of which make them perfect for producing completely flexible electronics. This concept focuses on the potential performance of yarn-shaped and planar supercapacitors, as well as recent advances and triumphs in flexible and wearable supercapacitors. The working mechanisms of electrode materials such as carbon-based materials, different types of metal oxide-based materials, and conductive polymers are discussed, with a focus on performance improvement. A summary of the most recent representative techniques and active materials of freshly created high-performance supercapacitors is presented. Furthermore, the electrically conductive supporting materials for 1D and 2D electrode designs are investigated.
