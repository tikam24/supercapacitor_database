Supercapacitors have exhibited the proper characteristics and advantages in many applications such as medical and electronic usages. Among electrolytes used in the supercapacitor structures, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based ones have especially attracted many attentions from researchers and industrial men that this can be attributed to the solubility, biodegradability, and biocompatibility of this hydrophile polymer. For these reasons, we aimed to review the reported studies on PVA usages in supercapacitors because PVA and its composites, blends, and derivatives were frequently applied in the structure of supercapacitors as both the suitable gel electrolyte and electrode.
