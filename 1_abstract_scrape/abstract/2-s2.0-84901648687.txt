Ternary Ag/MnO2/PANI (silver/manganese oxide/polyaniline) nanocomposite thin films were synthesized for supercapacitor applications using a new synthetic strategy including a pulsed potential electrodeposition technique. The agglomerated nanoscale-vermicular-like structure of the pure PANI is converted into more uniform vermicular morphology containing Ag and MnO2. The electrochemical supercapacitor properties of the ternary nanocomposite films are investigated in a 0.5M LiClO4+PC electrolyte. The current density of the Ag/MnO2/PANI nanocomposite film obtained from the CV (cyclic voltammogram) is much higher than that of the pure PANI. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the ternary Ag/MnO2/PANI nanocomposite is calculated to be 621F/g and 800F/g from CV and CD (charge-discharge) measurements, respectively. The cycling stability of the ternary nanocomposites (as high as ~83%) is significantly enhanced compared to that of a pure PANI (~66%) sample. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
