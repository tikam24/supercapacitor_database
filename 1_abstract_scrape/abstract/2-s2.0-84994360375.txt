Binder-free graphene oxide (GO)-polyaniline (PANI) nanocomposites with three-dimensional structures and good capacitive characteristics were prepared by pulse reverse electrodeposition of PANI and GO onto the previously formed TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2NTs). In the composite, interconnected reduced graphene oxide sheets constitute a high-efficient conductive network to improve the capacitive behavior of PANI. Furthermore, the network structure of the nanocomposites facilitates fast diffusion of electrolytes, which can significantly improve the parameters effectively influencing the capacitive behavior such as electrical conductivity and specific capacitance. The electrochemical data demonstrated that the specific capacitance of these electrodes was around 132 mF cm−2 in 1.0 M H2SO4 electrolyte as measured at a constant current of 0.66 mA cm−2, whereas it was 34 and 77 mF cm−2 for the GO/TiO2NT and PANI/TiO2NT electrodes, respectively.
