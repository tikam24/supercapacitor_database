Bio-based carbon has become the promising material for the device of energy storage due to sustainability. By direct pyrolysis of biomass generally have a low carbon yield and poor porosity. Tannin has a large number of phenolic rings and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is a renewable platform chemical from glucose or fructose. Herein, the tannin-HMF-derived resin is directly fabricated via thermal polymerization, which is further pyrolyzed to prepare carbon materials. This green and simple method can obtain carbon materials with high carbon yield and high C[dbnd]C to C–O ratio. The Zinc ion hybrid supercapacitor delivers a considerable discharge capacity of 107 mAh·g−1 at 1 A·g−1and decent rate capability (54.6% at 10 A g−1). The device reaches 110.8 Wh·kg−1 of energy density at 1055 W kg−1 of power density. The work develops an environmentally friendly and simple route of bio-based carbon materials with high carbon yield for energy storage.
