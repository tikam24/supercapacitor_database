Supercapacitor properties of rGO, CuO, PEDOT and rGO/CuO at [rGO]o/[CuO]o = 1:1; 1:1.5; 1:2 and rGO/CuO/PEDOT nanocomposite at [rGO]o/[CuO]o/[EDOT]o = 1:1:1; 1:1:3; 1:1:5 were investigated using chemical reduction of GO and in-situ polymerisation process. SEM-EDX, HRTEM, BET surface area analysis confirm the nanocomposite formations. Nanocomposite materials are also analysed through FTIR-ATR, Raman, TGA-DTA, GCD, CV and EIS. The highest specific capacitance of C sp = 156.7 F/g at 2 mV/s is determined as rGO/CuO/PEDOT at [rGO]o/[CuO]o/[EDOT]o = 1:1:5. In addition, two-electrode supercapacitor device for rGO/CuO/PEDOT at [rGO]o/[CuO]o/[EDOT]o = 1:1:5 are found to provide a maximum specific energy (E = 14.15 Wh/kg at 20 mA) and specific power (P = 24730 W/kg at 50 mA), electrical serial resistance (ESR = 13.33 Î©) with good capacity retention after 3000 cycles. An equivalent circuit model of LR1(CR2)(QR3) is proposed to interpret the EIS data. The supercapacitor performance of the rGO/CuO/PEDOT nanocomposite electrode indicates the synergistic effect of hybrid supercapacitors.
