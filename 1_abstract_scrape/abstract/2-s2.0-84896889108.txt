In this study, free standing NiO nanostructures for supercapacitors were obtained by means of chemically depositing of nickel oxide on Ni foam and then they were annealed at various temperatures. The morphological properties of densely covered Ni foams were studied by scanning electron microscopy. Supercapacitor characteristics, such as charging/discharging and impedance characteristics, were also examined.
