The structural and electrochemical properties of manganese oxide (MnO<inf>2</inf>) electrodeposited by potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions are studied. X-ray diffraction analyses confirm identical MnO<inf>2</inf> phase (ramsdellite) are deposited under potentiostatic and galvanostatic conditions. Under comparable current density during electrodeposition, MnO<inf>2</inf> deposited by galvanostatic condition shows smaller crystallite size, less compact layered structure, higher surface area and wider band gap, in comparison to the potentiostatic deposition. The MnO<inf>2</inf> morphology difference under different electrodeposition conditions contributes to different capacitive behaviors. The lower compactness of MnO<inf>2</inf> deposited galvanostatically renders facile ions diffusion, leading to higher specific capacitance with low equivalent series resistance. The findings suggest galvanostatic electrodeposition is suitable to produce MnO<inf>2</inf> nanostructure for supercapacitor application.
