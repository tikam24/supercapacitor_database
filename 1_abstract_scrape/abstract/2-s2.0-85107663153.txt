The supercapattery, an ideal electrochemical energy storage device, which can deliver high energy like battery and high power like supercapacitor. Transition metal sulphidesâ€™ energy storage capabilities have unfurled beyond the realm of ruthenium and manganese-based oxides by the versatile affordable sulphospinel transition metal sulphides such as MnCo2S4 (MCS). The advancement of synergistic nano-architectures of these transition metal sulphides with two-dimensional MXene material adulated the conductivity and highly reversible redox nature. The hybrid MCS-MXene was synthesised through facile cost effective hydrothermal method and the material were characterised using basic X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) to advanced tools as like electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). The electrochemical results depict that the supercapattery electrode of 2D synergistic MCS-MXene hybrid architectures shows highly improved specific capacitance of 600 C/g at 1 A/g current density than pristine MXene and MCS. The fabricated asymmetric supercapattery using hybrid MCS-MXene and bio-derived activated carbon (AC) shows a high specific energy and power density of 25.6 Wh/kg and 6400 W/kg, respectively with excellent cycling stability of 100% capacitance retention after 12,000 cycles.
