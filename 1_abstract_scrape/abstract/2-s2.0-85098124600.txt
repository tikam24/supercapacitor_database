The operation of an asynchronous electric drive for mining production in the regions of Central and Middle Asia is complicated by the fact that these facilities are located in remote from industrial networks areas. Because of this, the length of power lines can exceed the permissible length and there is a significant voltage drop in the network. In this paper the model of three-phase frequency-controlled asynchronous electric drive is developed using Simulink Matlab 2018 and converted into a two-phase model. It is proposed to compensate the voltage drop in the network for electric driveâ€™s starting modes with load by using Supercapacitors as a buffer power supply connected to the output of a DC link in a frequency converter. Simulation modeling was done at various supply voltages and various methods of connecting the Supercapacitor unit. It was found that such a principle of implementing an additional source of electrical energy allows to start asynchronous electric drives in areas remote from industrial networks without significantly affecting their static and dynamic characteristics.
