An electrophoretic deposition system was used to deposit graphene oxide (GO) or alkali-functionalized GO (GONa) on the surface of graphite fiber cloth (GFC). The morphology and structure of the obtained products were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectrum. The SEM images showed the GO or GONa sheets tightly covered on GFC. However, the GONa was easier to be deposited on the GFC than GO and the loading ratio could be up to 20.58 wt%. The composites showed the best electrochemical performance with specific capacitance of 27.32 F/g at 0.5 A/g when loading ratio of GONa was 8.54 wt%, synthesized at 27 V in 0.35 g/L GONa solution for 2.5 h. Moreover, the specific capacitance of the composites decreased slower with increasing current and was higher than that of the GO at 5.0 A/g. The relative specific capacitance of the GO or GONa in their composites was respectively a dozen times higher than that of the GO alone (33.39 F/g at 0.5 A/g), i.e. 427.63 F/g in GO-GFC and 355.41 F/g in GONa-GFC at 0.5 A/g. After the reduction, the specific capacitance of the reduced GO-GFC was enhanced while the reduced GO lowered, indicating that the composites prevented the most GO molecules agglomerating or restacking.
