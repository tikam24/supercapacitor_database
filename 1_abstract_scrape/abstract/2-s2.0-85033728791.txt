In fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHV) with a supercapacitor (SC) used as auxiliary source of hybridization, classical SC converters limit the current tracking performance due to the presence of a large input inductance. A hardware solution to this issue consists in using an interleaved converter topology that enables considerably reducing the input inductance. To optimize interleaved converters usage, an intelligent control scheme that maximizes closed-loop performance in current tracking must be designed. For that purpose, we design two controllers: a transient-state controller and a steady-state one. The first controller is a bang-bang one that guaranties a fast transition from the initial condition to some closed region around the reference. The second controller ensures the local asymptotic stabilization of a certain desired limit cycle and is based on switching surfaces design. The proposed control scheme performances and robustness are evaluated through simulations with piece-wise constant source and reference current. Performances are also evaluated on a battery-like supercapacitor vehicle using an urban driving cycle.
