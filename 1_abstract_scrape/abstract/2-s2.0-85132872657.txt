High-performance supercapacitor electrodes were prepared using activated carbon from Palmyra palm shells. The raw biomass was carbonized at 800 Â°C under argon atmosphere, followed by a microwave refluxing process with a mixture of HNO3/H2SO4 as catalytic solution. The activated carbons with and without reflux treatment were characterized by XRD, Raman, SEM, BET-BJH, FT-IR and XPS techniques. The electrochemical properties of the as-prepared materials were studied in a potential range from -1 to 0 V in a 6 M KOH solution. The results showed that the highest specific capacitance, 182 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, was obtained in a sample with microwave-assisted reflux. This value is 1.5 times higher than that of an identical sample without reflux modification. Microwave reflux produces materials with a high specific surface area and promotes the formation of active functional groups on the surfaces of the carbon materials.
