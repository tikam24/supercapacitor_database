Compared with batteries, supercapacitors have high density, and it can work in a wider range of climatic conditions. In addition, ultracapacitors have lower internal resistance and longer life span. Our study aims to design a new energy hybrid management system to solve the problem of the combination of batteries and supercapacitors in the most efficient way. Also, by using the real driving data, we can test how the system interact with the drivers on different roads. The efficient multi-energy power management system based on supercapacitors and batteries includes: bidirectional DC/DC (Direct Current to Direct Current) converters, battery modules and supercapacitor modules, ECUs (Electronic Control Units), motor controllers, motors, etc. We used models created in the existing DSpace-based simulation environment to detect and control the power flow in various driving scenarios. As a result, the hybrid energy vehicle effectively improves the steep acceleration, reduces the instantaneous high current output of lead-acid batteries, and effectively protects the power battery. We obtained a complete set of intelligent control strategies for energy management and verified the effectiveness of the designed optimal energy management control algorithm.
