The coreâ€“shell carbon microspheres (Fe2O3@CM) were prepared from iron chloride (FeCl3) and cotton pulp fibers by hydrothermal carbonization method. The carbonized fibers are intertwined and gradually covered on the surface of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Herein, Fe2O3 nanoparticles as cores can increase the electrical conductivity and reactive sites, the porous and functional carbonized fibers as shells are favourable for the improvement of structure stability. The optimal Fe2O3@CM-2 samples were used as supercapacitor electrodes. A considerable specific capacitance of 282.8 F/g was thus achieved. Simultaneously, the excellent cycling stability of 97.5% was obtained. This study broadens high-valued utilization of cellulose and provides new ideas for the development of renewable and environment-friendly flexible energy storage devices.
