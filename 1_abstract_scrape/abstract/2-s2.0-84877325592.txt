In this paper we report the use of triethylene glycol reduced graphene oxide (TRGO) as an electrode material for non-aqueous energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and Li-ion batteries. TRGO based non-aqueous symmetric supercapacitor is constructed and shown to deliver maximum energy and power densities of 60.4 Wh kg-1 and 0.15 kW kg-1, respectively. More importantly, symmetric supercapacitor shows an extraordinary cycleability (5000 cycles) with over 80% of capacitance retention. In addition, Li-storage properties of TRGO are also evaluated in half-cell configuration (Li/TRGO) and shown to deliver a reversible capacity of ∼705 mAh g-1 with good cycleability at constant current density of 37 mA g-1. This result clearly suggests that green-synthesized graphene can be effectively used as a prospective electrode material for non-aqueous energy storage systems such as Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. © 2013 © 2013 Author(s).
