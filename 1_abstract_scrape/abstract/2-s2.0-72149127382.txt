This paper presents research motivated by industrial demand for energy storage system for city transport vehicles. Our city transport has problems with stability of the trolley line voltage at the several places in the city a therefore this research has been started. Energy storage system with supercapacitors is one solution. The kinetic energy is accumulated into the supercapacitor during vehicle braking. This energy can be used to accelerating again. It is important to save the energy in the vehicles, which accelerate very often (we can think about stabile or mobile version). Â© 2009 IEEE.
