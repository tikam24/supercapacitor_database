Crumpled graphene oxide (GO)/graphene is a new type of carbon nanostructure that has drawn growing attention due to its three-dimensional open structure and excellent stability in an aqueous solution. Here we report a general and one-step approach to produce crumpled graphene (CG)-nanocrystal hybrids, which are produced by direct aerosolization of a GO suspension mixed with precursor ions. Nanocrystals spontaneously grow from precursor ions and assemble on both external and internal surfaces of CG balls during the solvent evaporation and GO crumpling process. More importantly, CG-nanocrystal hybrids can be directly deposited onto various current-collecting substrates, enabling their tremendous potential for energy applications. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the use of hybrid electrodes of CG-Mn 3O 4 and CG-SnO 2 in an electrochemical supercapacitor and a lithium-ion battery, respectively. The performance of the resulting capacitor/battery is attractive and outperforms conventional flat graphene-based hybrid devices. This study provides a new and facile route to fabricating high-performance hybrid CG-nanocrystal electrodes for various energy systems. Â© 2012 American Chemical Society.
