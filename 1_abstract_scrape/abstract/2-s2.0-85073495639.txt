Energy storage systems (ESS) have been attracted significant attention for improving the reliability of the entire power system (generation, transmission, and distribution), mainly when associated with electric generation from intermittent renewable energies (RE). In particular, ESS combined with RE can provided a set of grid services for future power grid operators, including tension and load level regulation, energy (from peak to off-peak) and contingency reserves management as well as providing power quality and reactive power support. In this work, some those storage technologies are considered for future Brazilian power system, such as (i) pumped hydro storage, (ii) compressed air energy storage, (iii) flywheel, (iv) battery, (v) regenerative fuel cell and (vi) supercapacitor. Hence, this paper presents a detailed conceptual map of EES technologies attractive for application in Brazil, supported by a range of ranking tools (Brazilian entire grid peculiarities, future grid design and ESS already demonstrated on site). The technologies are conceptualized in three large group: unsuitable, possible or suitable, considering its application. Before any deployment, however, there is need for further development and field tests to prove its feasibility and safety at power electrical system level.
