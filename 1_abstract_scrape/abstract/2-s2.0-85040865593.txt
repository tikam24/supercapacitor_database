Orthorhombic vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowires with uniform morphology were successfully fabricated via a facile hydrothermal process. The effect of disodium citrate dosage on the crystallinity, morphology and electrochemical properties of the products was analyzed. Experimental results indicate that orthorhombic V2O5 nanowires with high crystallinity and diameter of about 20 nm can be obtained at 180 Â°C for 24 h when the dosage of disodium citrate is 0.236 g. Furthermore, the prepared V2O5 nanowires demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 528.2 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 and capacitance retention of 85% after 1000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles at 1 A g-1 when used as supercapacitors electrode in 0.5 M K2SO4.
