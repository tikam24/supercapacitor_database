In practice power system network is composing miscellaneous loads with different magnitude and nature. The nature of the loads is either lagging in nature or non-linear in nature. The very common characteristics of the non-linear devices are modern semi-conductor technology type and these devices cause some impact on the network. The integration of the Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC) is corrects the issues raised and it avoids the need of installing extra device. The supercapacitor implementation results in correcting the voltage profile and reduces the harmonic content of the system.
