The uniformly arranged MgO/NiCo2O4 as synthesized with a simple co-precipitation method and it pursues heat treatment up to 300 οC and 600 οC. Furthermore, the synthesized MgO/NiCo2O4 as extensively investigated through physicochemical, electrochemical, and microscopic analysis. Interestingly, Due to addition of magnesium oxide with NiCo2O4–600 οC nanocomposite demonstrates excellent specific capacitance of 1367 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1for supercapacitor in 6 mol potassium Hydroxide (KOH) as an electrolyte in a three-electrode system. Moreover, the fabricated asymmetric system provides the highest electrochemical performance through an energy density of 28.90 w/kg and an extraordinary power density of 1.56 KWh/Kg at the utmost current density of 2.0 A/g. Remarkably, the supercapacitor provides long life cycle stability without any absorbable material degradation (99.5% up to 50,000 cycles at 5 Ag−1) which is much higher than the early reported NiCo2O4 material and the assembled 2 sets of devices can illuminate a 3 V LED light. The excellent results suggest the fabricated device shows it becomes a high-performance electrode material for next-generation portable electronics applications.
