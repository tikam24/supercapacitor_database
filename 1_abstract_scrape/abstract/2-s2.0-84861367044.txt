This study describes the preparation, characterization and application of [Et 3NH][TFSA], either neat or mixed with acetonitrile, as an electrolyte for supercapacitors. Thermal and transport properties were evaluated for the neat [Et 3NH][TFSA], and the temperature dependence of viscosity and conductivity can be described by the VTF equation. The evolution of conductivity with the addition of acetonitrile rendered it possible to determine the optimal mixture at 25 °C, with a weight fraction of acetonitrile of 0.5. This mixture was also evaluated for transport properties, and showed a Newtonian behavior, as the neat PIL. An electrochemical study demonstrated, at first, a passivation on Al after the second cyclic voltammogram. Subsequently, the electrochemical window was estimated using a three-electrode cell to 4 V on a platinum electrode, and to 2.5 V on activated carbon. Finally, the neat PIL was found to exhibit good performances as promising electrolyte for supercapacitor applications. © 2012 the Owner Societies.
