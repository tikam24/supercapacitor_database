We show that natural abundance, solid-state MAS-NMR 13C INADEQUATE spectra can be recorded for crystallized C 70, using the through-bond J-coupling for the magnetization transfer. The effect of strong J-coupling can be lessened at high magnetic fields, allowing the observation of cross-peaks between close resonances. DFT calculations of the chemical shifts show an excellent agreement with the experimental values. A correlation is observed between the average CCC bond angles and the 13C chemical shift, offering a way to understand the dispersion of 13C chemical shifts in nanoporous activated carbons in terms of local deviations from planarity.
