A novel NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF nanocomposite is facilely grown on nickel foam (NF) via hydrothermal reaction and high-temperature calcination methods. The NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF possesses a specific nanorods@nanosheets core–shell structure, greatly facilitating the transfer of electrons and ions. So, the NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF shows excellent electrochemical performance. When a current density is 1 A g−1, the specific capacity (C p) of NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF reaches 1996 C g−1, which is 7 times that of single NiMoO4/NF, and its C p is higher than the C p of other Ni-Mo-based electrode materials reported in the literatures. Moreover, the NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF has a long cycling life, and its capacity retention rate reaches 83.1% after 5000 cycles at 20 A g−1. The hybrid supercapacitor—NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF-2//AC with NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF as the positive electrode and AC as the negative electrode has an energy density of 32.75 Wh kg−1 and a power density of 725.09 W kg−1. So the NiMoO4@NiMoS4/NF is a promising high-performance electrode material for battery-type hybrid supercapacitors.
