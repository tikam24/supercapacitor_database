Herein, hierarchical CuCo2O4@NiMoO4 core-shell nanowire arrays were successfully synthesized on Ni foam via hydrothermal processes as a battery-like electrode. Owing to the unique core-shell structure and the synergetic effect from CuCo2O4 and NiMoO4, the resulting CuCo2O4@NiMoO4 core-shell arrays exhibit a high specific capacitance of 2207 F g-1 at 1.25 A g-1 and good rate capability with only about 4.4% capacitance loss after cycling tests. Furthermore, we assemble the corresponding asymmetric supercapacitor using CuCo2O4@NiMoO4 (positive electrode) and activated carbon (negative electrode), which delivers a high energy density (about 40 W h kg-1) and good cycle stability. Thereby, these electrochemical performances demonstrated that as-fabricated CuCo2O4@NiMoO4 core-shell arrays are promising candidates as electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
