Hierarchical carbon with a three-dimensional (3D) structure has become a promising electrode material for supercapacitors due to its excellent rate capability. High surface area hierarchical structure carbon nanocages (HHNCs) were prepared using magnesium oxide as a template with in situ chemical activation. These materials feature a 3D network structure interconnected by carbon nanocages, a high specific surface area (2073 m2 g-1), a high pore volume (3.17 cm3 g-1) and a multiscale pore size distribution. Because of the synergistic effects of these advantages, as supercapacitor electrode materials, HHNCs show excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance (276 F g-1 at 0.05 A g-1) and an excellent rate capability (205 F g-1 at 20 A g-1). This makes HHNCs promising supercapacitor electrode materials with many potential applications.
