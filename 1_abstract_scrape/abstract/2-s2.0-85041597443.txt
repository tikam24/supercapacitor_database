Hierarchically porous carbon nanomaterials with well-defined architecture can afford a promising platform for effectively addressing energy and environmental concerns. Herein, a totally green and straightforward synthesis strategy for the fabrication of hierarchically porous carbon nanotubes (HPCNTs) by a simple carbonization treatment without any assistance of soft/hard templates and activation procedures is demonstrated. A high specific surface area of 1419 m2 g−1 and hierarchical micro-/meso-/macroporosity can be achieved for the HPCNTs. The unique porous architecture enables the HPCNTs serving as excellent electrode/host materials for high-performance supercapacitors and Li–sulfur batteries. The design strategy may pave a new avenue for the rational synthesis of hierarchically porous carbon nanostructures for high-efficient energy storage applications.
