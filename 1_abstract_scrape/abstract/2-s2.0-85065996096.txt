In the present work, bare nickel molybdate (NiMoO4) and polyaniline enfolded nickel molybdate (NiMoO4/PANI) nanocomposite hybrid electrode materials were prepared by sonochemical and in situ oxidative polymerization techniques, respectively. The phase formation, microstructure and surface morphology of all the freshly prepared bare and hybrid nanocomposite samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), confocal Raman spectroscopy, High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies, respectively. XRD characterization confirmed that the polyaniline polymer does not hinder the crystallization of the NiMoO4 nanocrystals. Fourier transform infrared spectra and confocal Raman spectra were indicating that the NiMoO4/PANI nanocomposite was successfully prepared. The electrochemical performances of bare NiMoO4 nanocrystals and NiMoO4/polyaniline nanocomposite electrodes were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and cyclic stability studies. The observed results demonstrated that the newly prepared NiMoO4/polyaniline nanocomposite electrode exhibits higher specific capacitance of 285 Fgâˆ’1 and good cyclic stability of 92% retention even after 500 cycles than that of bare NiMoO4 nanocrystals. Thus, the NiMoO4/PANI nanocomposite could be a promising electrode for supercapacitor applications.
