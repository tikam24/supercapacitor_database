The proceedings contain 10 papers. The topics discussed include: zinc oxide nanotetrapods for room temperature UV sensors by spraycoating; preparation of carbon cloth/MnO2 doped with different metal ions for supercapacitor electrode; heated rebar effects on corrosion performance of reinforced concrete; a new principle of briquetting machine kinematics; paradigm changes in power electronics caused by emerging materials; FEM-analysis of fracture behavior of ZrO2-ceramics; limits and use of polymeric hollow fibers as material for heat transfer surfaces; synthesis of advanced metal-oxide thin films by plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic application in environmental science; multichannel polarization optical fiber sensors in wavelength-division multiplexing technology; and strain-detecting properties of strain-hardening cement composite (SHCC) sensors embedded at the compressive stress zone of SFRC notched beams in flexure.
