The pursuit of long life, high rate and low-cost anode materials is of great significance for potassium-ion hybrid capacitors (PIHCs). Here, the bead-like coal-derived carbon films (BCCFs-800) for PIHCs were synthesized with low-cost coal as precursor. Benefiting from the well-designed composite structure, the wettability on the electrode surface was enhanced and the diffusion of electrolyte ions was also facilitated, thereby improving the electrochemical performance of the electrode. A potassium ion hybrid capacitor was fabricated with BCCFs-800 as battery-type anode and active carbon as capacitor-type cathode, and it delivered promising energy and power densities (119 Wh kg−1 at 186 W kg−1 and 2187 W kg−1 at 52 Wh kg−1). The as-obtained earth-abundant and high performance electrodes will promote the green and clean utilization of coal and accelerate the development of potassium ion electrochemical storage technology.
