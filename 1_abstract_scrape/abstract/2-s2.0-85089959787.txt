Flexible electrode with high electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance are desirable today to meet the energy demand in portable electronics. Here we designed a flexible electrode, polyaniline-sulfate-titanium dioxide-multiwalled carbon nanotubes (PANI-SA⋅TiO2⋅MWCNT) to improve the electrochemical performance. This is achieved by following a synthetic strategy via the synthesis of PANI-SA⋅TiO2⋅MWCNT by a two-step process; initially, PANI-SA⋅TiO2 synthesized by aqueous polymerization using two oxidants, namely peroxotitanium acid (PTiA) and ammonium persulfate (APS). Wherein, PTiA acts both as oxidant and source of TiO2. In the second step, emulsion polymerization of PANI-SA⋅TiO2 with a small amount of MWCNT by benzoyl peroxide as oxidant. Formed PANI-SA⋅TiO2⋅MWCNT was coated on a stainless steel foil without using any binder. Electrochemical performances of the electrodes of both PANI-SA⋅TiO2 and PANI-SA⋅TiO2⋅MWCNT were carried in symmetric cell supercapacitor configuration in aq. 1 M sulfuric acid electrolyte by cyclic voltammetry and charge-discharge measurements. This composite exhibits an excellent rate capability, and no degradation was observed in specific capacitance over 5,000 charge-discharge cycles carried even at a higher current density of 1.6 A g−1. The electrochemical performance of PANI-SA⋅TiO2, including cycle life, is enhanced with the use of MWCNT.
