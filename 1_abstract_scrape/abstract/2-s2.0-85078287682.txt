The synthesis of promising nanocomposite materials can always be tricky and depends a lot on the method of synthesis itself. Developing such synthesis routes, which are not only simple but also can effectively catch up the synergy of the compositing material, is definitely a worthy contribution towards nanomaterial science. Carbon-based materials, such as graphene oxide, and conjugative polymers, such as conductive polyaniline, are considered materials of the 21st century. This study involves a simple one pot synthesis route for obtaining a nanocomposite of polyaniline and graphene oxide with synergistic effects. The study was carried out in a systematic way by gradually changing the composition of the ingredients in the reaction bath until the formation of nanocomposite took place at some particular reaction parameters. These nanocomposites were then utilized for the fabrication of electrodes for aqueous symmetric supercapacitor devices utilizing gold or copper as current collectors. The device manifested a good capacitance value of 264 F/g at 1 A/g, magnificent rate performance, and capacitance retention of 84.09% at a high current density (10 A/g) when gold sheet electrodes were used as the current collectors. It also showed a capacitance retention of 79.83% and columbic efficiency of 99.83% after 2000 cycles.
