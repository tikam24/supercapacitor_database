Vanadium pentoxide-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) free-standing electrodes are used as electrodes for supercapacitor applications, eliminating the need for current collectors or additives and reducing resistance (sheet resistance 29.1 Ω □-1). The effective exfoliation of rGO allows improved electrolyte ions interaction, achieving high areal capacitance (511.7 mF cm -2) coupled with high mass loadings. A fabricated asymmetric flexible device based on rGO/V2O5-rGO (VGO) consists of approximately 20 mg of active mass and still delivers a low equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 3.36 Ω with excellent cycling stability. A prototype unit of the assembled device with organic electrolyte is shown to light up eight commercial light-emitting diode bulbs. Flexible, free-standing, and binder-free graphene-based V2O5 composite electrodes that do not require current collectors are fabricated into a prototype supercapacitor device exhibiting a performance of 52.5 mF cm-2 (157.51 mF), with the total electrode mass reaching up to 20 mg. One unit of the assembled prototype device is capable of powering up a commercial gadget consisting of eight light-emitting diodes. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.
