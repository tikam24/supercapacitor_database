The purpose of this work is to present new technology of acquiring energy from the Ultra-wideband (UWB) station and stored in a super-capacitor to charge any electronic device. Many electronic devices operate in critical conditions where it is costly, inaccessible to replace the battery. Examples include sensors of cardiovascular diseases [1][2], aircraft or structural building tracks, oil, and gas platform [3][4]. The research is developing and design a t-shirt it contains a circuit can harvesting the radiofrequency energy around us from many radio station and store this scavenging power in super-capacitor. The evident system of acquiring RF energy is to design spiral antennas are tuned to scavenge RF energy from the ultra-wideband. The device is installed into the jacket, as shown in Figure 1. This device consists of an antenna connected to a small circuit that can collect the harvested signals for charging many electronic devices.
