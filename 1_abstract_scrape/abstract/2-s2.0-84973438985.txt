An effective approach for increasing the life cycle of poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) as a p-type conductive polymers is combining conventional conductive polymers and nanomaterials to fabricate hybrid electrodes. In this paper, functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) has first been synthesized using a chemical approach. Hybrid POAP/FGO films have then been fabricated by POAP electropolymerization in the presence of FGO nanoparticles as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. Based on the atomic scale study results, it seems that H3PO4- oxygen atoms and terminal pyridine ring nitrogen atoms play a crucial role in the intramolecular charge and energy transfer in the FGO molecular systems. Theoretical studies, surface and electrochemical analyses have been used for characterization of POAP/FGO composite films. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been applied to study the system performance. This work introduces new nanocomposite materials for electrochemical redox capacitors with such advantages as the ease of synthesis, high active surface area and stability in an aqueous electrolyte.
