MXenes-two-dimensional (2D) compounds generated from layered bulk materials, have attracted significant attention in energy storage fields. However, low mass loading of MXenes results in low areal capacity and impedes the practical use of MXenes electrodes. Inspired by natural basswood, an ideal architecture with natural, three-dimensionally (3D) aligned open microchannels was developed for high Ti3C2Tx mass loading. Compared with reported Ti3C2Tx electrode structure, the 3D porous carbon matrix has several advantages including low tortuosity, high conductivity and good structure stability. The Ti3C2Tx assembled with the wood carbon can deliver a high areal capacity of 1983 mF/cm2 at 2 mV/s with a high Ti3C2Tx mass loading of 17.9 mg/cm2 when used as electrode for supercapacitors. This work provides a new strategy to develop 3D porous electrodes for MXenes, which can achieve high areal capacity.
