To meet the growing demand for efficient and sustainable power sources, it is crucial to develop high-performance energy storage systems. Additionally, they should be cost-effective and able to operate without any detrimental environmental side effects. In this study, rice husk-activated carbon (RHAC), which is known for its abundance, low cost, and excellent electrochemical performance, was combined with MnFe2O4 nanostructures to improve the overall capacitance of asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) and their energy density. A series of activation and carbonization steps are involved in the fabrication process for RHAC from rice husk. Furthermore, the BET surface area for RHAC was determined to be 980 m2 g−1 and superior porosities (average pore diameter of 7.2 nm) provide abundant active sites for charge storage. Additionally, MnFe2O4 nanostructures were effective pseudocapacitive electrode materials due to their combined Faradic and non-Faradic capacitances. In order to assess the electrochemical performance of ASCs extensively, several characterization techniques were employed, including galvanostatic charge –discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Comparatively, the ASC demonstrated a maximum specific capacitance of ~420 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g. The as-fabricated ASC possesses remarkable electrochemical characteristics, including high specific capacitance, superior rate capability, and long-term cycle stability. The developed asymmetric configuration retained 98% of its capacitance even after 12,000 cycles performed at a current density of 6A/g, demonstrating its stability and reliability for supercapacitors. The present study demonstrates the potential of synergistic combinations of RHAC and MnFe2O4 nanostructures in improving supercapacitor performance, as well as providing a sustainable method of using agricultural waste for energy storage.
