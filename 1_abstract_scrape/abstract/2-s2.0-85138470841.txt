The 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene are promising supercapacitor electrode materials due to their considerable high conductivity, surface functional groups, and redox reactions, however, also subjected to compact restack of multi-layered structure. In this study, monolayer Ti3C2Tx modified by NiCo2O4 nanocones (s-Ti3C2/NiCo2O4) with large specific surface area (158.8 m2∙g−1) were designed and obtained by a facile method. Then an asymmetric device was assembled based on positive s-Ti3C2/NiCo2O4 electrode and negative active carbon electrode for the first time. Then, a widened voltage window of 1.6 V for asymmetric device is realized, which is almost twice wider than that of the common symmetric device. The device deliveries a maximum specific capacitance of 73.8F∙g−1 at 1A∙g−1 with a good stability. More importantly, the energy density of device also is significantly enhanced to 94.46 Wh∙kg−1 at a power density of 2882.0 W∙kg−1, supporting a substantial promise for energy storage applications.
