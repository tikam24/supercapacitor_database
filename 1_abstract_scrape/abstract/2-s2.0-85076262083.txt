Graphene and graphene-based materials have a high potential, especially in energy storage technology. Thanks to the three-dimensional (3D) structures developed with this material, their importance in the production and application of energy storage devices has increased. Studies on supercapacitor applications of graphene-based aerogels have begun to arouse interest in recent years. In this study, recent studies on aerogel supercapacitors, in which researchers have shown great interest, have been compiled and collected. In this study, production methods and properties of graphene oxide, properties and production of aerogels, production and applications of graphene/graphene oxide aerogels are discussed. In this way, the data is presented and discussed in an organized way for the researchers who study or who want to study in this field.
