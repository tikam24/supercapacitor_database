A supercapacitor control strategy is proposed in this paper to improve the DFIG wind turbine low voltage or fault ride through capability. The use of supercapacitor as one of the energy storage devices is very vital in wind energy applications. The grid disturbances during transient state could be compensated using this topology. In this paper, a new technique of connecting supercapacitor to the DFIG wind turbine, during transient state was investigated. The DFIG is tied to a fixed speed squirrel cage induction generator wind turbine and both were connected to an infinite bus bar. The salient part of this study was to examine the parameters and switching strategies considering different scenarios of operation of the supercapacitor, for better performance of the DFIG wind turbine. The obtained results were compared based on the resistance, inductance, and capacitance of the supercapacitor. Furthermore, the DC-link voltage and grid voltage were the two switching strategies employed for the supercapacitor system.
