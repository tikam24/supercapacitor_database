This article will propose different energy storage systems, ranging from 0.91 kWh to 1.56 kWh, suitable for a 30 m long tram. To configure the system regarding energy content, voltage variation, maximum current and power losses, a model of the tram, network and substations power flow has been developed in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Results obtained in energy savings at substation level vary from 24% to 27,6% under the same driving profile and auxiliaries load; while at the end-of-life of supercapacitors, the range varies from 18,1% to 25,1% depending on the supercapacitor module used and vehicle load.
