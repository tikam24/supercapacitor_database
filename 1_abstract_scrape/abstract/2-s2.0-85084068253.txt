Metal molybdate compounds have attracted considerable attentions for their applications in supercapacitors. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable synthesis of cobalt molybdate (CoMoO4) nanoarrays on nickel foam (NF). The synthesis mechanism and the influencing factors of the morphology and electrochemical properties of CoMoO4 were investigated. It is found that the growth of CoMoO4 nanosheets need sufficient heat and a ‘contact surface’ provided by the conductive substrate for nucleation. Different fabricated conditions make the electrodes exhibit different morphologies and compositions so as to different performances. The CM-140 electrode prepared at 140 °C exhibits the best electrochemical performance due to its unique chemical composition and appropriate nanostructure. It delivers a high capacity of 527.3C g−1 at the current density of 3 mA cm−2. The alkaline battery-supercapacitor hybrid (BSH) device assembled with CM-140 electrode and activated carbon (AC) electrode exhibits high energy density of 40.0 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 685.8 W kg−1 and excellent cycling stability with 86.9% capacitance retention after 5000 successive charge-discharge cycles at the current density of 10 mA cm−2. This work reveals the growth mechanism of CoMoO4 nanosheet arrays, and realizes the controllable synthesis of CoMoO4 nanoarray electrodes with exceptional electrochemical properties for advanced energy storage devices.
