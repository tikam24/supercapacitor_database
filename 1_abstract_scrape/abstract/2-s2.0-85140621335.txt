Abstract: The process of forming planar electrodes of the composition NiCo2O4 using high-performance high-resolution microplotter printing technology with functional inks based on nanopowders (average size of the coherent scattering region 14 nm) of a similar composition obtained by the method of programmable chemical coprecipitation of metal hydroxides has been studied. The thermal and spectral characteristics of the intermediate and the target oxide, as well as the features of their crystal structure and microstructure, have been studied using a set of methods of physicochemical analysis. According to X-ray phase analysis and Raman spectroscopy, the resulting coatings are single-phase and are characterized by a cubic spinel-type crystal structure. The results of scanning electron microscopy show that the resulting hierarchically organized coatings are homogeneous and contain no defects in the form of gaps or delaminations. The prospects of the developed technology for the manufacture of modern electrode materials of the composition NiCo2O4 are shown.
