How to simply adjust the porosity of carbon materials and largely elevate the capacitive performance of supercapacitors remains interesting but challenging for us. In the present work, we have realized the two purposes by the following steps: firstly, introducing MgO as hard template into potassium hydrogen phthalate can result in the formation of hierarchical pore structures containing micropores and mesopores, whilst individually carbonizing potassium hydrogen phthalate leads to nearly complete micropores; secondly, incorporating rutin as effective redox additive into H2SO4 electrolyte can largely improve the capacitances as well as the energy densities by the gain/loss of two electrons and two protons. For example, the capacitances can increase 1.92 fold when carried out in a two-electrode system. Furthermore, adding 0.15mmol L-1 rutin into 1mol L-1 H2SO4 can achieve the maximum energy density up to 20.84Wh kg-1 towards the MgO-Templated carbon materials. More importantly, it is also inferred that higher porosity of carbon materials indeed benefits for obtaining larger pseudo-capacitive efficiency. Thereby, understanding the matching degree of redox additive's size and that of pore within carbon matrix will help us facilitate the capacitive increase of supercapacitors.
