Among several methodologies to improve the solution processing of graphene-based materials, noncovalent functionalization has been considered as the simplest and nondestructive method. Herein, we show that molecular self-assembly process can be used as a useful tool to exfoliate reduced graphene oxide (RGO), resulting in hybrid materials with improved physical properties. Upon interacting with a π-gelator, the dispersing ability of the RGO increased significantly in most of nonpolar and polar aprotic solvents when compared to the bare one. The amount of RGO dispersed was 1.7-1.8 mg mL-1 in solvents such as toluene, o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Morphological studies revealed that aggregation of π-gelator over RGO helps to exfoliate graphene layers to remain as individual sheets with higher surface area. Experimental studies revealed enhanced surface area (250 m2 g-1) and better conductivity (3.7 S m-1) of the hybrid materials with 30% of RGO content resulting in excellent electrochemical performance (specific capacitance of 181 F g-1) as electrodes for supercapacitors.
