The plethora of efficient energy storage systems created a jolt in the enhancement of exploration of the renewable energy resources and thereby reduced the extinction of the non-renewable energy resources. In contrast from other energy storage devices, lithium ion rechargeable batteries gained much attention owing to its distinctively superior electrochemical energy density and prolonged cycling stability. The gradual technological development to the advanced lithium ion batteries was a consequence that initiated from the non-rechargeable systems. The advancement in lithium ion batteries made an indelible mark in the field of energy storage systems and paved the way toward the advanced applications such as electronic devices especially the portable electronic gadgets and wearable electronic devices, electric/hybrid vehicles that can limit the environmental pollution up to a great extent, etc. The inevitable discovery of lithium ion batteries revolutionized the telecommunication as well as surface transportation technology. Thus, understanding the spectacular pace created by lithium ion battery technology and its historical development is vital. The current chapter is a voyage through the different energy storage systems and summarizes the historical milestones in the successful development of lithium ion batteries and their commercialization. The chapter is also fortified with brief ideas about different lithium-based batteries as well as a consolidated description about the honorable scientists dedicated their intellectual journey for the birth of lithium ion batteries, including the most prestigious awards, the “Nobel Prize of 2019” and “Draper prize of 2014,” awarded to honor the great brains fueled in the development of these portable energy storage devices.
