The severe self-restacking of MXene film restricts its development for supercapacitors. Herein, the synthesis of Ti3C2Tx decorated with WO3−x hybrid nanostructures by a one-step solvothermal method was reported in this work, which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance due to the increased interlayer spacing and synergistic effects. As a result, the optimal Ti3C2Tx/WO3−x nanocomposite electrode shows excellent gravimetric capacitance of 442.0 F g−1 at 2 mV s−1, excellent rate capability, and good flexibility. Moreover, the cycling stability retains at 91.21% after 10,000 cycles (at 10 A g−1). This work provides a new strategy for the development of MXene-based flexible film electrodes with high electrochemical performance.
