In recent years, transition metal disulfide MoS2 has received much attention in the field of supercapacitor electrode materials. In this paper, in order to enhance its electrical conductivity, the composite of MoS2 and nitrogen-phosphorus co-doped graphene (MoS2/NPG) nanoflowers is prepared successfully by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, and characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectrometer. The electrochemical tests display prominent specific capacitance of 588 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. The symmetric supercapacitor device, assembled by two identical MoS2/NPG electrodes both as the positive electrode and as the negative electrode, exhibits high energy density of 24.34 Wh kg−1 and outstanding cycling performance with 91.67% retention of specific capacitance at 3 A g−1 for 5000 cycles, which demonstrates its potential ability as supercapacitor electrode materials.
