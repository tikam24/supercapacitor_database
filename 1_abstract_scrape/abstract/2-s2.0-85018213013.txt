Fibre supercapacitors were designed and manufactured using a dip-coating method. Their electrochemical properties were characterized using a VersaSTAT 3 workstation. Chinese ink with a fine dispersion of carbon and binder was coated as the electrode material. The specific capacitance per unit length of a copper fibre supercapacitor with the length of 41 cm reached 34.5 mF/cm. When this fibre supercapacitor was bent on rods with a diameter of 10.5 cm, the specific capacitance per length was 93% of the original value (without bending). It showed that these fibre supercapacitors have good flexibility and energy storage capacity. Furthermore, the fibre supercapacitor in the fabric showed the same capacitance before and after weaving.
