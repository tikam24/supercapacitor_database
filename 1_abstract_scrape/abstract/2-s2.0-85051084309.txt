A single-objective optimization energy management strategy (EMS) for an onboard hybrid energy storage system(HESS) for light rail (LR) vehicles is proposed. TheHESS uses batteries and supercapacitors (SCs). The main objective of the proposed optimization is to reduce the battery and SC losses while maintaining the SC state of charge (SOC) within specific limits based on the distance between consecutive LR stations. To do this, a series of optimized SOC limits is used to prevent the SC from becoming exhausted prematurely instead of the standard SC SOC penalty term in the cost function. Meanwhile, a rule-based EMS (RB-EMS) is used to give the SCs charging priority over the batteries when the vehicle is braking. Moreover, a simplified method for the optimization is proposed to reduce the computational burden. Simulation and experimental results for the proposed EMS and a standard SC SOC penalty-based cost function optimization are provided to evaluate losses. As a result, it is shown that the proposed EMS, compared with standard SC SOC penalty-based cost function optimization, decreases losses and prevents the SOC from reach the discharging limits.
