The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and growing alarm about global warming have motivated scientists to focus on renewable energy and energy storage devices. There are several energy storage devices, among which supercapacitors comply with our energy demands and are compatible with our environment. In the present work, we prepared two-dimensional (2D) layered cobalt hydroxide through a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. The structural and functional properties of the acquired material were validated by x-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The material exhibited strong hydroxide bond vibration alongside nitrate ions that were intercalated in the basal spacing between the hydroxide layers. Field emission scanning electron microscopic images confirmed the formation of nanorods that were organized into whisker-like morphology. The electrochemical analysis was performed using a three-electrode system with the prepared material coated on commercial graphite foil as the working electrode. The study reveals the pseudocapacitive nature of the prepared material. The specific capacity (capacitance) of the as-prepared material was estimated as 142 C g−1 (314 F g−1) at a specific current of 0.5 A g−1, using galvanostatic charge–discharge studies. The superior electrochemical properties of the prepared 2D layered cobalt hydroxide suggest that it is an interesting candidate for futuristic supercapacitor electrodes.
