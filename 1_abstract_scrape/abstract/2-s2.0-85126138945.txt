Recently, the application of nickel oxide (NiO) is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity and cycling stability. Herein, a versatile method is developed to synthesize NiO hybridized porous poly(p-phenylenediamine) carbon spheres (NiO@PPCSs) as the electrode of supercapacitors. The NiO@PPCSs electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance (up to 580 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and durable cycle stability (over 90% retention rate after 8000 cycles at 5 A g−1). The excellent electrochemical properties of the NiO@PPCSs is attributed to the hybridization of NiO providing reversible redox reaction between Ni2+ and Ni3+as well as the hierarchical porous structure for fast ion diffusion.
