Here, we report a heterostructured core–shell electrode consists of cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) nanowire core and nickel aluminum (NiAl)-layered double hydroxide (NiAl-LDH; herein Co 3 O 4 @LDH) nanosheet shell grown on nickel foam as advanced electrode for supercapacitor. Benefiting from the core–shell configuration and smart hybridization, the optimized Co 3 O 4 @LDH core–shell electrode exhibits a high capacitance of 2011 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 and remains 1455 F g −1 at 40 A g −1 , which outperforms the electrochemical performance of individual component of Co 3 O 4 (720 F g −1 at 2 A g −1 ). A hybrid supercapacitor using Co 3 O 4 @LDH as positive electrode and carbon nanotube as negative electrode delivers an energy density of 18.1 Wh kg −1 at a power density of 375 kW kg −1 at a current density of 0.5 A g −1 . Smart hybridization of core–shell electrode shows great promise as advanced electrode materials for supercapacitor with high electrochemical performance.
