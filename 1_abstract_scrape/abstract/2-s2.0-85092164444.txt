The design is a wireless charging system with the microcomputer of MSP430 as the main controller, a super capacitor group as the energy storage device, and a dynamic wireless charging as the core technology. The system is divided into main controller based on the chip of MSP430, wireless charging module, the module for detecting charge, the module for vehicle to track, super capacitor group and the module for detecting the voltage of capacitor. The wireless charging piles are laid on the driving path of the vehicle. After the vehicle enters the charging area, the charging detection module sends a charging signal to the main controller to make the vehicle slow to obtain sufficient charging time. Experimental data shows that dynamic wireless charging can improve the endurance of intelligent vehicle.
