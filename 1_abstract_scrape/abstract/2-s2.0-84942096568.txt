Mesoporous NiMoO4 nanorods grown on the surface of reduced graphene oxide composites (NiMoO4-rGO) were synthesized via a simple, rapidly, and environment-friendly microwave-solvothermal method. The structure and morphology of the composites were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The NiMoO4-rGO composite exhibited high performance as an electrode material for supercapacitors. At a current density of 1 A g-1, the specific capacitance reached 1274 F g-1, which is higher than that of pure NiMoO4 (800 F g-1). NiMoO4-rGO can retain about 81.1% of its initial capacitance after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Remarkably, NiMoO4-rGO composites can be applied in asymmetric supercapacitors with ultrahigh energy density of 30.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 187 W kg-1. The enhanced electrochemical performance of NiMoO4-rGO is mainly ascribed to the mesoporous-NiMoO4 nanorods with large specific surface area, as well as high coupling with conductive rGO.
