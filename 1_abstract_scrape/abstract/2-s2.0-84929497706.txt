Novel properties of graphene have been well documented, whereas the importance of nanosheets of MoS2 and other chalcogenides is increasingly being recognized over the last two to three years. Borocarbonitrides, BxCyNz, with insulating BN and conducting graphene on either side are new materials whose properties have been attracting attention. These two-dimensional (2D) materials contain certain common features. Thus, graphene, MoS2, and borocarbonitrides have all been used in supercapacitor applications, oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs), and lithium-ion batteries. It is instructive, therefore, to make a comparative study of some of the important properties of these layered materials. In this article, we discuss properties related to energy devices at length. We examine the hydrogen evolution reaction facilitated by graphene, MoS2, and related materials. We also discuss gas and radiation sensors based on graphene and MoS2 as well as gas storage properties of graphene and borocarbonitrides. The article should be useful in making a judicious choice of which 2D material to use for a particular application.
