Here, we report the preparation of hydrogen-bonded complex fibers of graphene oxide (GO) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) and their reduction to conductive fiber. The complexation behaviors of PEO and GO at different pH values are investigated. When pH is below 2.0, PEO and GO will form the complex which precipitates out from the solution quickly. When pH is higher than 5.0, GO and PEO mixed solution will be homogenous. At pH 6.0 the GO/PEO solution shows good fluidity and pre-orientation of GO sheets. The solution is extruded into 1.0 M HCl solution where hydrogen bonding between PEO and GO is constructed and hence the fiber forms. After reduction, the fibers show good mechanical and electrical properties, and the mechanical strength is close to 500 MPa while the conductivity is more than 200 S/cm. The reduced fibers can be assembled into flexible supercapacitor, exhibiting potential for wearable electronics.
