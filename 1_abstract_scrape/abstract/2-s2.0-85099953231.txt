Activated carbons (ACs) are obtained from coconut shell (endocarp) through chemical activation using H3PO4 as activating agent. Ground coconut shell is impregnated with H3PO4 for 24 and 48 h; then pyrolyzed at 600 and 800 °C. Some ACs are additionally mixed with nickel oxide (NiO) for obtaining NiO/AC composites. The morphological characteristics are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). The chemical composition is analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). With both types of samples, ACs and NiO/AC, electrodes are processed as pellets. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes is carried out in a three-electrode configuration, in which an aqueous 1 M KOH solution is the electrolyte. Two charge storage mechanisms are found: (i) supercapacitor response including double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance for the ACs and reaching specific capacitances up to 142 F g−1 at 6 mA g−1 and (ii) battery response, due to reversible redox reactions of NiO and reaching specific capacities up to 19 C g−1 at 7 mA g−1. The relative contribution of the AC and NiO components to the composites' specific capacity is also discussed. The specific energy and specific power are compared for the two types of samples, AC and NiO/AC.
