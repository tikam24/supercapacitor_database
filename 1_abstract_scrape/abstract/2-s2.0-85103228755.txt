This paper presents an investigation of the potential to use aligned discontinuous carbon fiber dry prepregs as electrodes in structural supercapacitors (SSCs). The high fiber-matrix interfacial bonding of the structural composite was achieved by adopting a solid polymer electrolyte, consisting of poly(vinylidene), lithium triflate, and epoxy. Processing of the SSC was carried out via dip-coating of the polymer electrolyte and then cured using a vacuum bag. The electrochemical performance of the SSCs was measured before and after mechanical loading. The microstructures of the SSCs as-fabricated and damaged under flexural loading were identified by Î¼-CT imaging. An SSC with a specific capacitance of 0.128 mF/cm2 (11.62 mF/g), a flexural strength of 47.49 MPa, and a flexural modulus of 8.48 GPa has been achieved, demonstrating significant improvements in mechanical properties over those of SSCs based on woven carbon fiber fabric-based electrodes. The mechanical behavior of the supercapacitors was evaluated by both quasi-static and cyclic flexural loading tests. The excellent electrochemical stability of the supercapacitors was validated by a capacitance retention of above 96% under galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling tests. The knowledge gained in this work will benefit future research in the optimization of SSC performance.
