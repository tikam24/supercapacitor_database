Nanoflakes Co(OH)2 porous films were successfully synthesized by a facile electrochemical technique. The morphology was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostaitc charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to study the effects of deposition temperatures on the capacitance of the films. The results exhibited that the Co(OH) 2 films single electrode had high specific capacitance in KOH electrolyte. A maximum specific capacitance of 2780 F/g could be achieved for the Co(OH)2 film deposited at 50Â°C in 2 M aqueous KOH with 0 to 0.4V potential at a charge-discharge current density of 4 mA/cm2. Therefore, the obtained nanoflakes Co(OH)2 porous films can be a potential application electrode material for supercapacitors.
