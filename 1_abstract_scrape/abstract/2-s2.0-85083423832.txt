In the present work, Nickel ferrite and graphene nanocomposite has been synthesized and investigated as flexible electrodes for supercapacitor application in an aqueous electrolyte with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The structural properties of the as-prepared nanocomposite electrode were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the surface morphology and particles size in the nanocomposite. Elemental analysis of the electrode was performed using Energy dispersive spectroscopy. Supercapacitor performance of the nickel ferrite/graphene nanocomposite was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry. We have observed that specific capacitance depends significantly on the charging/discharging voltage window of the device. A maximum specific capacitance of 22 mF/cm2 (73 F/gm) was achieved between voltage range of − 0.5 to + 0.5 V. Nanocomposite electrodes showed the power density in the range of 200–900 W/kg.
