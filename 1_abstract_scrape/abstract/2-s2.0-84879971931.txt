With the application and development of the supercapacitor energy storage (SCES) system, energy storage technology has been greatly improved in modern power systems. The SCES provides required energy buffer for a photovoltaic power system and plays an important role in improving the operation stability of a power system. This paper designs a stand-alone photovoltaic system with a supercapacitor as the energy storage device. In particular a Stand-alone PV system constituted by photovoltaic and supercapacitor sources is simulated in PSIM with DC to DC buck boost converter to prove that supercapacitor as a power supply device. The PSIM simulation results reflect that system stability was validated when the input power of photovoltaic array fluctuates greatly. The designed system offers a preferable reference for applications of the supercapacitor in the field of regeneration energy and quality improvement of electricity power.
