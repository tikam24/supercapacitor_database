Herein, we applied the idea of layered preparation, using nickel foam as the prepared substrate, carbon nanotubes as the structural stabilizer, and using the pseudocapacity performance advantage of Ni-Co bimetallic sulfide to prepare multistage NF/CNTs/Ni-Co-S composite electrode materials step by step. After the electrochemical performance test, the specific capacitance of NF/CNTs/Ni-Co-S electrode was 2952F/g at 1A/g, and the capacitance value remains 82.9% after 6000 cycles, showing good electrochemical performance. After assembly into NF/CNTs/Ni-Co-S//AC device, the maximum energy density was 76.37 Wh/kg at 799.99 W/kg power density, which indicates that the research and preparation of NF/CNTs/Ni-Co-S composite materials not only are useful for the practical application of electrode materials but also provides a novel idea to construct nanomaterials with a double-layer heterojunction.
