Alcohol soluble phenolic resin was prepared by using phenol and formaldehyde as starting materials, and hydrochloric acid as catalyst. Carbon microbeads (CMBs) were obtained by decomposition of the phenolic resin at different carbonized temperatures. The as-prepared product was treated in 3 mol/L HNO3 in order to gain the highly activated carbon microbeads (ACMBs), then the physical and electrochemical properties were studied by infrared spectrometer (IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cyclic voltammetry, constant current charge-discharge and cycle life measurements. The results show that CMBs with part graphitization have amorphous carbon structure and good spherical morphology at the optimal carbonized temperature of 750Â°C. The electrode made of them has good electrochemical performance and the specific capacitance of ACMB-750 is 247.8 F/g at a scanning rate of 1 mV/s. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance of the button supercapacitor is up to 60 F/g at a charge/discharge current density of 0.5 A/g and the loss of specific capacitance is nearly neglectable after 5000 cycles.
