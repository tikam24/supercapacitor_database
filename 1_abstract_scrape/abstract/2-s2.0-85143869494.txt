The present work deals with the fabrication of four different electrode materials, that is, nitrogen-rich porous carbon (NRPC), NRPC/Mn, NRPC/Ni, and NRPC/NiMn, with a three-dimensional architecture following a simple strategic method. Polybenzoxazine is used as the precursor to prepare NRPC that serves both as a support and a electron collector. The inclusion of mono- and bimetallic transition compounds into the NRPC backbone, that is, NRPC/Mn, NRPC/Ni, and NRPC/NiMn, serves as the electrochemically active species. Several spectroscopic and microscopic methods are used to characterize the fabricated electrode materials. The prepared materials possess pore volume between 0.18 and 0.42 cm3/g. Scanning electron microscopy images of NRPC/NiMn show a 3D flowerlike structure. The formation of this 3D flower morphology depicts stable architecture showing improved electrochemical performance. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy are used to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the prepared electrode materials. The electrochemical study reveals a high specific capacitance of 1825 F/g for NRPC/NiMn, with an efficiency of 78% maintained even after 2500 cycles.
