Redox activity and electrons/ions mobilities of electrode material are significant prerequisites for faradaic charge storage, the compositing of battery materials with different dimensionalities can satisfy the above two requirements simultaneously. Herein, a unique heterostructured Co3O4@Ni3S4 composite battery electrode with the coating of Ni3S4 nanosheets around/onto Co3O4 nanowires array was prepared via tandem hydrothermal reaction of Co salt, pyrolysis and followed sulfidation etching of Ni foam substrate. The different dimensionalities of Co3O4 core and Ni3S4 shell created porous network composite with high faradaic activity, sufficient exposure of surface sites, efficient electrons/ions migration and robust structural tenacity, therefore could offer high areal capacity (CA, 2.46C cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2), slow self-discharge rate and good cycleability (91% CA maintaining ratio undergoes 5000 charge-discharge cycles). Furthermore, the hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) based on the Co3O4@Ni3S4 composite battery electrode exported high energy density (Ecell, 0.13 mW h cm−2 at 1.6 mW cm−2), slow self-discharge rate and good cycleability, showing the potential of heterostructured Co3O4@Ni3S4 composite electrode in faradaic energy storage.
