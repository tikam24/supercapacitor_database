Ni-Co sulfide nanotubes/graphene oxide porous nanotubes are synthesized by chemical replacement method and MOF-based template method at room temperature. Experiments show that the graphene oxide effectively reduces the inactive material and increases the electroactive surface area, which is quite effective for achieving high utilization efficiency under high electroactive materials mass loading. When used as an electrochemical supercapacitor electrode material, the prepared composite has high specific capacitance (2506 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), excellent rate performance (51.8% of capacitance retention ranges from 0.5 to 10 A g−1), and good cycle stability (58% of capacitance retention after 6000 cycles). Its excellent electrochemical properties are mainly due to the synergistic effect of Ni-Co sulfide nanotubes and GO, which the former could deliver abundant active sites and the latter could have excellent electron conductivity. Then, it could deliver a new way to prepare high electrochemical performance of electrode materials.
