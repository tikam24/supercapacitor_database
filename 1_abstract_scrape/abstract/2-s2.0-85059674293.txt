Rapid growth of electronic textile increases the demand for textile-based power sources, which should have comparable lightweight, flexibility, and comfort. In this work, a self-charging power textile interwoven by all-yarn-based energy-harvesting triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) and energy-storing yarn-type asymmetric supercapacitors (Y-ASC) is reported. Common polyester yarns with conformal Ni/Cu coating are utilized as 1D current collectors in Y-ASCs and electrodes in TENGs. The solid-state Y-ASC achieves high areal energy density (≈78.1 µWh cm−2), high power density (14 mW cm−2), stable cycling performance (82.7% for 5000 cycles), and excellent flexibility (1000 cycles bending for 180°). The TENG yarn can be woven into common fabrics with desired stylish designs to harvest energy from human daily motions at high output (≈60 V open-circuit voltage and ≈3 µA short-circuit current). The integrated self-charging power textile is demonstrated to power an electronic watch without extra recharging by other power sources, suggesting its promising applications in electronic textiles and wearable electronics.
