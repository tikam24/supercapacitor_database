Particular precursors with controllable micromorphology and unique element composition were prepared by hyper-cross-linked (naphthoxylic/trifluoroethoxylic) cyclotriphosphazenes (NTFCPn). The hyper-cross-linked NTFCPn displayed certain porous structure and large specific surface area which benefit to the electrochemical performance of derived carbon materials. The structure and electrochemical properties of multi-heteroatom-doped porous carbons were optimized by adjusting the side group ratio of NTFCP and the carbonization temperature. The obtained carbon material cNTFCP65-600 possessed a large specific surface area up to 2006 m2/g with high proportion of mesopores (25%). Meanwhile, the synergistic effects of improved surface wettability and rich active sites by oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous doping rendered the cNTFCP65-600 with excellent electrochemical performance. In the two-electrode system, cNTFCP65-600 with a nitrogen content of 4.82% exhibited high specific capacitance of 412 F/g at the current density of 0.1 A/g, and maintained 264 F/g at current density of 20 A/g.
