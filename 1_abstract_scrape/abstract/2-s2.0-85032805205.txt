An amorphous metal-organic framework (aMOF) UiO-66 (Zr-MOF) was prepared directly from synthesis, different from experiments involving heating, pressure, and ball-milling by other researchers. The as-prepared amorphous UiO-66 has been successfully used as a supercapacitor electrode material, exhibiting a high specific capacitance (920 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1) superior to crystalline UiO-66. It has been verified that the material after reaction can still remain amorphous state by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The capacitance of amorphous UiO-66 can maintain 610 F g−1 after 5000 cycles, suggesting its promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode material.
