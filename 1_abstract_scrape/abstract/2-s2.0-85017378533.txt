A supercapacitor based static synchronous compensator, STATCOM, is proposed to control both reactive and active power exchange with the grid side. It aims to provide a comprehensive control for a distributed network, and improve the stability. However, due to its low cell voltage, long time constant, and voltage dependent energy storage, applying the supercapacitor to grid level applications is challenging. This paper examines the steady state performance of three types of supercapacitor based energy storage system, which used as the DC link capacitor part in STATCOM application. The simulation results shown that, even at steady-state, the dc link has a high ripple current. In order to tolerate the high ripple current, the supercapacitor based energy storage system should be carefully designed. Two types of parallel hybrid capacitor systems are developed in comparison with the pure supercapacitor system, which provide an improved performance in terms of efficiency, volume, thermal, cost, and lifetime under the same STATCOM operating condition.
