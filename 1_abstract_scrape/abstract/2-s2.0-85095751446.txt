In this paper, we report significant recycled efficiency of nickel molybdenum oxide (NMO) nanorods for multi-functional catalytic activities in photo-catalysis, electrochemical glucose sensing and asymmetric supercapacitors. Initially, we have used NMO nanorods as the photo-catalysts for organic dye degradation reactions using visible light source. The NMO nanorods show momentous photocatalytic activity in degradation of organic dye (~90% in 160 min) and also exhibit excellent regeneration efficiency. Consequently, the photo-catalysts were recovered via batch experiments for further use in other applications including electrochemical glucose sensing and asymmetric supercapacitors. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microscopic experiments were conducted before and after photo-catalysis for the materials stability. The recovered NMO nanorods show significant electrochemical detection of glucose in 0.1 M KOH. Moreover, the recovered NMO nanorods show promising nature for supercapacitors. The specific capacitance of recovered NMO nanorods was found to be ~660 F/g at 2 mV/s in 5 M KOH. Charge-discharge and stability of the electrodes were also studied for the commercial purpose.
