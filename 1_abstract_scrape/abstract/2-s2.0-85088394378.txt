Abstract: The flexible and rechargeable energy storage device with excellent performance is highly desired due to the demands of portable and wearable devices. Herein, by integrating the bendability and stretchability of Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), pseudocapacitance of Polyaniline (PANI), and the charge transport ability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), PVA/CNT/PANI flexible film was fabricated as supercapacitor electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. Full-solid supercapacitor is prepared based on PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte and as-prepared film electrodes. The device achieves an areal capacitance of 196.5 mF cm-2 with high cycling stability. The flexible properties of PVA, the conductivity of CNT, and the pseudo-capacitance of PANI contribute to the superior performance. Present work develops a facile and effective way for preparing flexible electrode materials.
