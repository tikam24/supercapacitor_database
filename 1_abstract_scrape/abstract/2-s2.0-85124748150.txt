Nitrogen-doped porous carbon materials are a new type of electrode material with safety, nontoxicity, high conductivity and good electrochemical performance, which have recently attracted extensive attention due to its wide application in supercapacitors. In this work, carbon-based materials named ZBK-n were prepared (where n represents the different ratios of KNO3 used in the synthesis), using the nitrogen-containing organic molecule benzotriazole as a carbon and nitrogen source, and ZnCl2 and KNO3 as activators. These materials were mixed and heated at 350°C for 1h and 750°C for 2h under N2 to prepared porous carbon materials with a higher nitrogen content. The result had shown that material (ZBK-4) had a larger specific surface area (2292.47m2/g) and higher nitrogen and oxygen contents (4.88%N and 5.99% O). At the current density of 1A/g, the specific capacitance of ZBK-4 was 300F/g, indicating good rate capability. In addition, the specific capacitance of the material after 8000 cycles remained at 93.05%, indicating good cycle stability. Therefore, these experimental results have confirmed that the obtained nitrogen-doped porous carbon material has good electrochemical performance, and good prospects for application in the field of supercapacitors.
