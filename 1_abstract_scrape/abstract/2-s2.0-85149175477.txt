Designing the rough surface of nanoplates is of great implication to enhance the energy storage performance of supercapacitor. In this report, CuCo2O4 nanoplates with rough surface are synthesized by fast and easiest co-precipitation route. Further, the prepared material is characterized by a variety of characteristic techniques. The band gap of prepared material is calculated to be 1.41 eV. Further, the synthesized material is used as electrode material for supercapacitor. The high specific capacitance of the 528 F g−1 is obtained at 2 A g−1 from CuCo2O4 nanoplates. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of CuCo2O4 nanoplates is improved by adding the small amount of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and, 1053 F g−1 of specific capacitance is observed at 2 A g−1 from MWCNT/CuCo2O4 composite. In addition, aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor is also assembled from activated carbon and MWCNT/CuCo2O4 composite. The device delivers the 52.72 W h kg−1 of energy density with the power density of 774 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. The twelve light emitting diodes (LEDs), kitchen timer and a small fan are also functionalized from series connected two asymmetric supercapacitor.
