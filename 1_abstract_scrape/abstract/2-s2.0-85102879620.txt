A composite with low crystallinitynickel manganate (NiMn2O4) on reduced graphene oxide(rGO) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. Velvet-like NiMn2O4 was deposited evenly on rGO nanosheets. The coverage of NiMn2O4 effectively prevents agglomeration between graphene flakes. The NiMn2O4/rGO composite has a large specific surface area and an excellent electrical conductivity due to the unique structure, and the specific capacitance is 1675F•g-1 at 1A•g-1. The specific capacitance retention rate of NiMn2O4/rGO nanoflowers composite is 91% at 5A•g-1 after 2000 cycles.
