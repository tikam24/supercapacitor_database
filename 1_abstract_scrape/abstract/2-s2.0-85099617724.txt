Two-dimensional carbon nanosheets have recently become spotlight in the electrochemical energy storage fields. Herein, an effective and environmental-friendly strategy was developed to prepare ginkgo leaf derived N/S co-doped porous carbon nanosheets (PCNSs) using CaCl2/KCl molten salt as activating/template agent. The CaCl2/KCl as a green and non-toxic template can regulate the pore structure and microstructure of carbon materials. Benefiting from interconnected sheet-like morphology and plenty of heteroatoms (N, S, O) doping, the fabricated carbon-based supercapacitor exhibit good specific capacitance of 150.4 F g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 and splendid cycling performance with 94.2% capacity retention after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 1 A g−1.This facile and environmental-friendly activation strategy provides a new way of thinking for developing N, S-doped two-dimensional porous carbon nanosheets for high-performance energy storage devices.
