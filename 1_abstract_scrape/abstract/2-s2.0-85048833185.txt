Relatively high energy and high power are the main advantages of Lithium-Ion Capacitors (LICs). Both criteria are considered fundamental when designing a system that needs an Energy Storage System (ESS). Another important factor is the lifetime of LICs that is not yet well investigated in the literature. It is influenced by the operation of the LIC and the environmental conditions. This is mainly related to the change in the electrochemical phenomena responsible for the storage of energy due to aging. Since the LIC has a hybrid composition that combines the ones in Lithium-Ion Batteries (LIBs) and Supercapacitors (SCs), it seemed interesting to study the effects of each composition on the lifetime of LICs. For this purpose, different continuous cycling tests that consider the two compositions were applied to eight samples. This paper focuses on the effects of each current profile on the degradation of LICs. Results showed that the phenomena related to LIBs had the most significant influence on the performance degradation of LICs.
