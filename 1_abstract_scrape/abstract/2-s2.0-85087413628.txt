Two-dimensional (2D) graphene and its outstanding properties such as, enormous conductivities, mechanical strength, optical and electrical properties brought it one of the most studied materials for the production of energy using renewable resources. The composites of graphene with the same morphological materials such as layered transition metal oxides will be the most aspiring combination to boost their conducting, optoelectronic and mechanical properties. Furthermore, the transition metal chalcogenides materials attracted significant attention due to their atomically thin layers and enormous optical, conducting and electrical properties. The layered materials offer mostly atomically thin 2D plane to the charge carrier with superior conducting properties. The thickness at atomic level, band gap, spin orbit coupling electronic and optoelectronics properties of transition metal dichalcogenides makes them one of the promising entities in energy harvesting technologies. The review suggests some strategies to improve the transition metals-composites stability conducting properties to be tailored in various applications.
