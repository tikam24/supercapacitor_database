A simple capacitor is perceived as being capable of discharge (or recharge) at high rates, limited only by a small equivalent series resistance. However, in the case of electrochemical capacitors, based on high specific area porous electrode materials, power limitations arise due to the complex-distribution of electrolyte internal resistance, coupled with double-layer or pseudo-capacitative elements. The present paper quantitatively examines both numerically and experimentally the effects of internal electrolyte resistance as evaluated by the current-response functions for porous capacitor electrodes, generated in cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments and for voltage versus time responses in dc charge/discharge regimes.
