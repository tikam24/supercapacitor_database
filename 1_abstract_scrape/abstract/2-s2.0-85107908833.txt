The rigorous fabrication of electrode materials using upper-ranked porous precursor especially metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are challenging but appealing task to procure electrochemical energy storage and conversion system with altitudinous performance. Herein, we replenish the rational construction of atypical electrode of hollow Zn-Ni-Co-oxide (ZNCO) nanosheet arrays onto rGO garnished Ni foam (rGO/NF) via two step solution based method. Firstly, 2D Zn-Co-MOFs derived nanoleave arrays are prepared by co-precipitation method. Next, hollow and porous ZNCO nanostructure from 2D solid nanoleave arrays are achieved by ion-exchange and etching process conjoined with post annealing treatment. The as-fabricated hierarchical ZNCO nanosheet arrays offer large numbers of electroactive sites with short ion-diffusion pathways, reflecting the outstanding electrochemical performance in-terms of excellent specific capacity (267 mAh g−1) ultra-high rate capability (83.82% at 50 A/g) and long-term cycling life (~90.16%) in three electrode configuration for supercapacitor (SCs). Moreover, the hollow and porous ZNCO nanostructure responds as immensely active and substantial electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation with lowest onset potential of 0.27 V. To demonstrate the practicability, hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) device is constructed using ZNCO@rGO-NF nanostructure as positive and rGO decorated MOF derived porous carbon (rGO-MDPC) as negative electrode. The as-assembled ZNCO//rGO-MDPC ASC device delivers higher energy density of 61.25 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 750 W kg−1 with long-term cyclic stability (<6% to its initial specific capacity value) after 6000 cycles.
