Zn ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to its combination of supercapacitor and battery type electrodes. However, the energy density of ZHSCs are still unsatisfying. In this work, we develop porous carbon via molten salt method as high performance ZHSCs cathode. The as-obtained porous carbon shows high specific area as well as abundant mesopores. Consequently, the as-fabricated ZHSCs exhibit a high energy density of 36.5 W h kg−1 obtaining at the power density of 376.6 W kg−1 as well as good cycling stability (85.4 % capacitance retention after 10000 cycles).
