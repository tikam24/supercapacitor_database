Supercapacitors are promising candidates for alternative energy storage applications since they can store and deliver energy at relatively high rates. In this work, we integrated large area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown three dimensional graphene heterostructures with high capacitance metal oxides (MnO2) to fabricate highly conductive, large surface-area composite thin films. Uniform, large area 3D graphene heterostructures layers were produced by a one-step CVD on nickel foams. MnO2 nanowires were deposited on the as-obtained 3D graphene heterostructures film by a simple chemical bath depostion process. The oxide loading of the 3D graphene/MWNTs/MnO2 nanowires (GMM) composite films can be simply controlled by deposition time and nanowire solution concentration. The surface morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed to characterize the MnO2 on the surface of the film. By introducing the fast surface redox reactions into the graphene heterostructures film via integrating pseudocapacitive material like MnO2, the capacitive ability of the system enhanced dramatically. Supercapacitor was fabricated based on the 3D graphene heterostructures /MnO2 hybrid film electrodes; the measurements of cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are conducted to determine its performance for the electrodes of supercapacitors.
