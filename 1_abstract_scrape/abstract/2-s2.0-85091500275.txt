Electric vehicles, when it is running in frequent start and stop pattern in urban road condition, significant amount of energy is wasted in wheels during braking. Instead of wasting energy, the kinetic energy can be converted into electrical energy and stored in super capacitors. The super capacitors are electric double layer capacitors with rating of farads. The stored energy can be re used, thus supporting batteries to supply the peak power demand. The bidirectional converter is proposed to charge and discharge the super capacitor. By using proposed method, the energy recovery and efficiency of overalldrivehasbeenimproved. The simulation has been done and results were plotted to verify the proposedtopology.
