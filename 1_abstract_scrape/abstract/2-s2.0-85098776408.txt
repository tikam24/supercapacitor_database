Lithium-ion hybrid capacitors (LICs) are regarded as one of the most promising next generation energy storage devices. Commercial activated carbon materials with low cost and excellent cycling stability are widely used as cathode materials for LICs, however, their low energy density remains a significant challenge for the practical applications of LICs. Herein, Na0.76V6O15 nanobelts (NaVO) were prepared and combined with commercial activated carbon YP50D to form hybrid cathode materials. Credit to the synergism of its capacitive effect and diffusion-controlled faradaic effect, NaVO/C hybrid cathode displays both superior cyclability and enhanced capacity. LICs were assembled with the as-prepared NaVO/C hybrid cathode and artificial graphite anode which was pre-lithiated. Furthermore, 10-NaVO/C//AG LIC delivers a high energy density of 118.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 220.6 W kg−1 and retains 43.7 Wh kg−1 even at a high power density of 21,793.0 W kg−1. The LIC can also maintain long-term cycling stability with capacitance retention of approximately 70% after 5000 cycles at 1 A g−1. Accordingly, hybrid cathodes composed of commercial activated carbon and a small amount of high energy battery-type materials are expected to be a candidate for low-cost advanced LICs with both high energy density and power density.
