Increasing energy storage capacity through the use of novel nano-ranged structures is advantageous for the generation of high-rate performing supercapacitors. Designing metal electrodes that are easily available on earth, cheap, and have better charge transfer characteristics with high stability is still challenging. Current article assesses the first study to explore the synthesis of Mn nanoparticles with spongy nano flakes-like surface architecture using simple, room temperature electroless route to serve as an active electrode for supercapacitive energy storage device. Interestingly, Mn thin film electrode attained a capacitance of 663 F g−1 with a cyclic retention of 103% at 5000 cycles. Designed bendable solid-state symmetric device exhibits an extraordinary specific power of 1.2 kW kg−1 and an exceptional deformation endurance (96% at 170°), indicating its suitability for advanced flexible energy storage applications.
