The inherent properties of kapok fiber were summarized, such as light weight, high degree of hollowness up to 80%-90%, and super-hydrophobic surface, etc. Meanwhile, physical and chemical modification methods which could be widely used to improve the application characteristics of kapok fiber were introduced. The recent research progress focused on the application of kapok fiber and/or its modified treatment as eco-friendly oil-absorbing material, lithium-sulfur battery anode material and supercapacitor electrode material as well as the development of kapok fiber/polyester composite for sound absorbing material was presented. Based on the comprehensive research status of kapok fiber at home and abroad, the current challenges and future prospects on kapok fiber exploitation with respect to expanding new uses and high value-added utilization were highlighted.
