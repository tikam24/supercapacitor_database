The experiment was designed by using the catalytic etching method to prepare porous graphene hrGO, which was applied in the production of supercapacitors. The experimental results showed that in the application of supercapacitors prepared by porous graphene, the specific capacitance of porous graphene was 33mF/cm2 at the scanning rate of 10mV/s. When the current is 0.2 mA/cm2, the electrode modified by porous graphene has a specific capacitance of 37 mF/cm2, and the specific capacitance can reach 87% after 3 000 cycles of constant current charge-discharge test. This study shows that porous graphene is of great value in the preparation and application of supercapacitors, and can be used as the negative electrode material of supercapacitors.
