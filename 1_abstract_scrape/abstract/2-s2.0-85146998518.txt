The electrode composition material in the supercapacitor affects the storage performance of the supercapacitor. In this study, the electrodes were made from coconut shell activated carbon and Fe3O4 from iron sand. To be used as electrodes, the two materials are mixed with PVDF and a solution of Dimethylacetamide at a temperature of 70Â°C; then, a coating process is carried out by layering the electrode material onto aluminium foil to obtain an electrode sheet. The coin cell assembling process was then carried out by arranging the electrode sheets and the Celgard Li-ion battery separator in the glove box and then tested for charge/discharge with a current density of 5-81 mA/g and cycle stability at a current of 20 mA/g. The study results show that the activated carbon/5 wt% Fe3O4 supercapacitor has the best capacitance value for charging at 8.03 F/g and discharging at 8.55 F/g at a current density of 5 mA/g. The activated carbon/5 wt% Fe3O4 supercapacitor has cycle stability of up to 200 cycles and can withstand up to 95% with a capacitance of 6.6 F/g.
