In this paper, a motor drive application powered with battery along with super capacitor is analyzed. For electric drives (vehicles) battery is the main source of energy during all operations. Staring and acceleration period of motor demands excessive current from the battery. The battery must supply the current which is high in amplitude and will produce energy dissipation due to high currents. It may affect the health and life span of the battery. To overcome this problem high power rating batteries are required which are highly expensive. The remedy for this problem is ultra capacitor. Ultra-capacitor will help the battery to improve its health and life span. Ultra capacitor can supply peak current in transient period because of its high-power density, high charging and discharging cycles along with longer life.
