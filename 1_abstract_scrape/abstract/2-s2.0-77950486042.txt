Carbon-based micro-supercapacitors dedicated to energy storage in self-powered modules were fabricated with inkjet printing technology on silicon substrate. The ink containing activated carbon with particles size ranging from 1 μm to 10 μm, mixed with PTFE and glycol was stabilised with a surfactant, Triton X100. After functionalising the electrodes surroundings with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS), the ink was deposited by inkjet on the electrodes with the substrate heated at 140°C in order to assure a good homogeneity. The resulting structures have a resolution of 10 μm. Micro-supercapacitors with the carbon electrodes were tested in acetonitrile and Et4NBF4 dried salts: the capacitance density obtained was 50 μF.cm-2. The newly developed technology will allow the integration of the storage device as close as possible as the MEMS-based energy harvesting device, minimising power losses through connections. © 2009 Materials Research Society.
