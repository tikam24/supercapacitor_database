The second sentence in the first full paragraph in the right column of page M90 should read "The energy and power densities of NDG were calculated from the following formula,23,27 Energy density =1/2CV2/4 â€¢ 1000/3600 where C is the specific capacitance and V the potential window, and Power density = E/t where E is the energy density and t the discharge time in seconds." As a consequence of this correction, the energy density is estimated to be 27 Wh/kg. However, the specific capacitance of NDG is higher than that of GO.
