In present work, for improving the electrochemical performance of conductive polymer, POAP/3-methyl-1-[2-(2-{2-[2-[(3-methyl-1-H-imidazol-3-ium-1-yl)ethoxy]ethoxy}-ethoxy)ethyl]-1-H-imidazol-3-ium dichloride (MIEID) composite films have been fabricated by poly ortho aminophenol (POAP) electropolymerization in the presence of MIEID as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been applied to study the system performance. Analysis of density functional theory (DFT) results show that the atomic-scale electronic properties are generally depend on the bonding and electronic molecular structures (and thus their variation with the external bias in real nano-electrochemical circuits). Composite film kept more than 90% percent of its capacitance after 1000 charging–discharging cycles, while the coulombic efficiency (η) is as high as 95%. Results suggesting composite film can be used as supercapacitor electrode material with excellent specific capacitance (487 F g−1) which indicates this material is a promising electrode material used in high power applications.
