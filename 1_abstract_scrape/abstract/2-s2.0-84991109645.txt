The present study, lead mercury tetraiodide/mercury iodide (PbHgI4/HgI2) nanocomposites have been synthesized successfully by a simple co-precipitation method. The effect of various parameters including: Pb+2/Hg+2 molar ratio, type of capping agent, and reaction temperature on morphology, size and purity of products were investigated. The obtained products were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmittance electron microscopy, and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis. Application of this product as photocatalyst and supercapacitor was confirmed by UV–Vis spectroscopy and its estimated band gap and cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The shape of CV loop of PbHgI4/HgI2 nanocomposite is quasi-rectangular along the current–potential axis without obvious redox peaks, indicating that this sample can be used in supercapacitors and the its estimated band gap confirmed that this product is a semi-conductor that can be used as a photocatalyst.
