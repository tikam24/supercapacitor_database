Features of carbon nanotube electrodes for fabricating supercapacitors were analyzed to provide data for the practical application of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotube electrodes exhibit unique pore structure and high utilization efficiency of specific surface areas. Carbon nanotubes have excellent absorption characteristics due to the abundant surface functional groups. In addition, some processes were proposed for breaking the carbon nanotubes to enhance the utilization efficiency of their inner cavity. The results show that carbon nanotubes will have many advantages in this field.
