Doping or substitution of non-metallic ions is considered to be an effective way to improve the rate capability and cyclic stability of metal oxide electrodes. Nevertheless, current research lacks in-depth studies on the effect of doping on the rate capability. Herein, P-doped MnCo2O4 nanotubes with vertical array structure are rationally synthesized on carbon fibers via mild solution method and chemical heat treatment strategy. The density functional theory calculation and impedance test indicate that the introduced P atoms in MnCo2O4 are conducive to boost the conductivity and surface reactivity, as well as reaction kinetics. The electrochemical measurement show that the novel P-doped MnCo2O4 nanotube electrodes deliver a highest specific capacitance of 996.7 F g−1. It also exhibits excellent rate performance of 81.7% original capacitance retention when the current density is increased by 30 times. An asymmetric supercapacitor P-doped MnCo2O4//activated carbon can realize a high energy density of 42.7 Wh kg−1 at 750 W kg−1. Moreover, the device also exhibits a comparable cyclic retention of 81.9% at the end of the 8000th cycle. This work not only offers a potential electrode for energy storage but also provides a strategy for the preparation of hollow nanotubes structure with high electrochemical activities.
