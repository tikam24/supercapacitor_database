A novel hierarchical nanoarray material based on a two-dimensional metal-organic framework (Ni-CAT) and a layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) was fabricated on a nickel foam substrate. By taking advantage of the regular nanostructure and making full use of the high porosity and excellent conductivity, the hybrid material exhibits a high areal capacitance for a supercapacitor (3200 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2).
