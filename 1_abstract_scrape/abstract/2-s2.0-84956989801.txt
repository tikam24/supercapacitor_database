The supercapacitance behavior of hydrothermally reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was investigated for the first time. The capacitive behavior of RGO was characterized by using cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge methods. The specific capacitance of hydrothermally reduced RGO at 1 A/g was 367 F/g in 1 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte, which was higher than that of RGO synthesized via the hydrazine reduction method. The RGO-modified glassy carbon electrode showed excellent stability. After 1000 cycles, the supercapacitance was 107.7% of that achieved in the 1st cycle, which suggests that RGO has excellent electrochemical stability as a supercapacitor electrode material. The energy density of hydrothermal RGO reached 44.4 W h/kg at a power density of 40 kW/kg.
