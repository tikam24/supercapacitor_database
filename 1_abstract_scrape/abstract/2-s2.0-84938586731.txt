Network-like mesoporous NiCo2O4 arrays were grown on flexible carbon cloth via a hydrothermal method first assisted by polyethylene oxide-polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide and ethylene glycol followed by thermal treatment. These arrays were made up of nanoflakes (thickness varies from 5 to 15 nm) and multilevel pores, giving a vast specific surface area of 130.2 m2 g-1. The as-prepared products were fabricated into electrodes to conduct electrochemical experiments. The results showed a high capacitance of 1843.3 F g-1 (volume capacitance of 33.8 F cm-3) at 1 A g-1, satisfied constant rate performance of 80% shifting from 1 to 32 A g-1 (1481 F g-1), and only a 10% loss of its capacitance even after 4000 recycles at a consistent current density of 10 A g-1. A symmetric supercapacitor based on NWM NiCo2O4 was assembled and it exhibited a high specific capacitance of 269 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a preferable energy density of 38.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 396 W kg-1. The optimum overall performance of both high rate capability and cycle stability make the network-like mesoporous NiCo2O4 the prime candidate for application in electrochemical supercapacitors.
