Hollow micro- and nanostructured materials with controllable shapes are appealing materials for electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy and power densities. Herein, double-shelled hollow nickel sulfides with controlled shape (cube-, ellipsoid- and capsule-shaped) were successfully synthesized by using different morphological α-Fe2O3 templates. The as-obtained nickel sulfides have uniform size and well-defined double shells that consist of crossed ultrathin NiS nanosheets. When evaluated as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the capsule-shaped structure exhibits the highest specific capacitance of 1159 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 due to its high specific surface area (100.2 m2 g−1), low equivalent series resistance (0.80 Ω) and ion diffusive resistance. More importantly, the asymmetric capacitor NiS (capsule-shaped)||RGO@Fe3O4 shows a high energy density of 43.7 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 664 W kg−1 (21.8 Wh kg−1 at 8000 W kg−1), and after 5000 charge–discharge cycles, 83.3% of its capacitance is remained at the current density of 5 A g−1.
