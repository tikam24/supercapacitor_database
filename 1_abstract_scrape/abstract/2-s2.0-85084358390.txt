As Isolated DC microgrids (IDCMG) rely on renewable energy resources (RES) to reduce carbon emissions, running cost, etc., the reliability become serious issue due to their intermittency and uncertainty. Diesel generators (DG) are used as prevalent alternatives to suppress this issue. However, they suffer from startup delay, frequent switching, and uneven loading when embedded with RES that results in increased maintenance and carbon footprint. Besides, their fuel efficiency and emission characteristic vary with loading since most of DGs are driven by constant speed engines. Effective power management techniques play crucial role in conquering above issues. Hence, an exhaustive power management scheme (PMS) is proposed in this paper by considering the hybrid energy storage system. Further, this strategy includes the extreme scenarios like DG failure/scheduled maintenance, low power generation and battery charge. This paper considers AC bus coupled IDCMG as study system so that it can enclose both AC and DC loads/buses simultaneously. This makes system more comprehensive to resemble various practical isolated DC grids behavior. Simulation of the system is explored in real time digital simulator (RTDS) platform to show efficacy of proposed strategy.
