A supercapacitor (SC), also known as an electrochemical capacitor or ultracapacitor, is a charge storage device manufactured in a similar way to batteries. It usually consists of two electrodes, an electrolyte, and a separator. Compared with batteries, which store electrical energy in chemical bonds in a bulk material, 1, 2 SCs store charges in the electrode/electrolyte interface with distribution of equal and opposite charges on each plate; 3, 4 thus, an SC can be treated as a capacitor with an electrical double-layer capacitance. As illustrated in Figure 6.1, the Ragone plot (energy density against power density) of various energy storage devices indicates that SCs provide high power density, a fast charge/discharge rate (a few seconds), and a long cycling time. They currently fill the gap between batteries and conventional solid-state and electrolytic capacitors. 5 One of their main advantages is the ability to rapidly provide the energy necessary for accelerating a vehicle at the startup. 6, 7 Moreover, the efficiency and reversibility of SCs usually can exceed 90% even at very high discharge rates. 8
