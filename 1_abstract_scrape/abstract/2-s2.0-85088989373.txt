In the modern era of technology urging of urban traveling is notably increase. One of the best solutions is to fulfill this requirement of urbanized transportation Electric Vehicles that could be the best in all. The key problems associated with the short life span and less cost-effectiveness of batteries lead to the constrain in the expansion and establishment of electric vehicles in the market. Over the years to resolve these preceding problems regarding enhancement of both range and lifespan of battery, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) which using both battery and supercapacitor was propound to achieve maximum efficiency. Hybrid Energy Storage System appears promising due to its potential utilization of each operational benefit of both (battery and supercapacitor). As on the fact, the technology of storage such as the power of continuous supply of energy over a long period by the battery is due to its high density of energy, and peak power with rapid response by supercapacitor is due to its high density of power. For the designing and development of multisource Electric vehicles, Hybrid Energy Storage System regulated by a new generation smart energy management strategy plays a vital role. Ruled based filter method and Particle swarm optimization technique are used to raise the sizing of battery and supercapacitor and also to decrease battery power stress with improvement throughout its lifespan.
