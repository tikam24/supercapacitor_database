In battery-operated electric vehicles, a regenerative brake system is an additional feature that recovers kinetic energy back to the battery energy storage. Due to losses in the cyclic charge/discharge of battery characteristics such processes give low energy conversion efficiency. Supercapacitor, on the other hand, has an advantage over battery in terms of recovering an intermittent energy like a regenerative braking. This work aims to examine charging/discharging efficiencies of supercapacitor in both stand-alone and hybrid modes. Experimental results have verified that supercapacitor is suitable for a storage device in electric vehicle. Â© 2014 IEEE.
