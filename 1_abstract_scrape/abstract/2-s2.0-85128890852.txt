As the requirements for energy storage devices in wearable electronic devices continue to increase, graphene-based supercapacitors have attracted attention because of their high conductivity, high specific surface area, and high double-layer capacity. Compared with two-dimensional planar graphene capacitors, 3D supercapacitors perfectly exploit the double-layer capacitance characteristics of graphene itself. Due to the π-π interaction between carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide sheets, they can be combined with graphene sheets to increase the viscosity of graphene oxide ink to a certain extent, and it can be well dispersed when combined with hydrophilic graphene oxide. At the same time, carbon nanotubes as a one-dimensional spacer layer prevent the accumulation of reduced graphene oxide sheets to a certain extent. In this work, a graphene oxide/multi-walled carbon nanotube (GO/MWCNT) composite ink with good printability was first prepared, and a 3D electrode structure was prepared by direct writing and printing. The assembled RGO/MWNT three-dimensional supercapacitor has a maximum area specific capacitance of 54 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. This experiment explores the application of GO/MWCNT composite ink in direct writing printing for the first time, which is of great significance and value for the development of high-performance wearable printed electronic devices.
