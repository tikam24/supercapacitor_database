Active nanostructures decorated on a conducting substrate with good electrical conductivity and controlled porosity are essentially required for supercapacitors. The way to enhance the energy and power densities is by creating catalytically active electrodes of a large surface area that are made by binder-less incorporation of hierarchical nanostructures on the electrode surface. Any technique that produces such electrodes must be simple, low cost, and easily scalable for mass production. Here a facile one-step synthesis is reported to grow nickel sulfide nano-architectures on Ni foam at room temperature as supercapacitor electrodes, the studied devices show a high capability rate and excellent cyclability (tested for more than 4000 charge/discharge cycles) with a high specific capacitance of 1442 Fg-1. The designed electrodes offer a faster ion and electron transfer, a larger surface area, and a high degree of structural integrity. Hence, such electrodes form an efficient supercapacitor and hence are important for energy storage applications.
