Lithium-ion capacitor (LIC) is a type of hybrid energy storage device, bridging the gaps between lithium-ion battery (LIB) and electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) owing to the internal series combination of capacitive cathode electrode and battery-like anode electrode. In order to develop LICs with higher energy density, improving the working voltage of the device is an effective choice. However, the increase in operating voltage of LIC cell will reduce the coulomb efficiency, cycle life and aggravate the leakage current, which can be attributed to the irreversible redox reaction mainly occurred on the interface between the capacitive electrode and electrolyte. Up to now, there is few study on the determination of reliable operating voltage of LICs, and currently the predominant method to evaluate operating voltage range depends on the observation of abrupt current increase of the i-V polarization curve obtained via linear or cyclic sweep voltammogram. Therefore, the quantifiable evaluation criterion of operating potential of activated carbon electrode in practical LICs has been studied, i.e., the Faradaic fraction is less than 0.01 (S â‰¤ 0.01) or the second derivative of Faradaic fraction S versus vertex potential is less than 0.05 (d2S/dV2 < 0.05). Then the upper and the lower potential limits can be determined accordingly. It is noted that the cathodic part and the anodic part of cyclic voltammetric curves for activated carbon electrode should be treated separately. LIC cells with various electrolytes have been tested and the determination methods have been verified as well. This work shed a new light on the guideline for developing high-voltage practical LIC systems.
