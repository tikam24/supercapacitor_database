Cubic CoMn2O4 particles directly grown on Ni foam are developed for asymmetric supercapacitors via a simple hydrothermal method. During electrochemical study, CoMn2O4 electrode exhibits a high capacity of 140.6 mAh g−1 at 1 mA cm−2. A asymmetric supercapacitor containing CoMn2O4 electrode demonstrates a high capacitance of 77.8 F g−1 at 2 mA cm−2. The electrode developed has good potential for practical applications in asymmetric supercapacitors.
