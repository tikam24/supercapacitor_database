Nanoporous carbon (CMK-3-150) functionalized with different amounts of cobalt oxide (CoO) nanoparticles was synthesized by an incipient wetness impregnation technique for supercapacitor application. The characterization results reveal that the specific surface area and pore volume of the CoO functionalized CMK-3-150 marginally decrease upon increasing the amount of the CoO whereas the pore diameter and the structure of the CMK-3-150 were not affected even after the functionalization. The electrochemical measurements show that the specific capacitance of the electrodes was enhanced after the functionalization with CoO. Among the electrodes studied, CMK-3-150 functionalized with 15 wt% CoO shows an excellent cycling stability and specific capacitance of 331 F g-1, which is ca. two times higher than that of the pure nanoporous carbon. This enhanced performance is due to the combined contribution of electrical double layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. A symmetric supercapacitor device based on the CMK-3-150-15Co electrode gives the maximum energy density of 29.67 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.07 kW kg-1. This journal is
