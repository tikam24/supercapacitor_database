Current scenario of energy crisis and recent development of renewable energy resources have triggered a rapid development of energy storage materials for rechargeable metal ion batteries and supercapacitors. In this regard, two dimensional materials like graphene based spinel oxide nanocomposites have great potential for the above purpose. Hetero-atom doping modifies the electronic and electrical properties of conductive materials. Hence, to understand the effect of nitrogen doping on the supercapacitive properties, we have synthesized nitrogen doped graphene (NG)/CuCr2O4 nanocomposites for high-performance supercapacitors with specific capacitance of 530.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. The composites which have been synthesized using a simple one step sonication-assisted mechanical mixing method using pre-synthesized CuCr2O4 and NG, have scope for scale up. We have noticed the effect of nitrogen doping on coulombic efficiency of the composites, which comes due to the deformed local structures around nitrogen.
