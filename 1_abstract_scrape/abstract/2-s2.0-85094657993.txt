The integration of metal oxide composite nanostructures has attracted great attention in supercapacitor (SC) applications. Herein, we fabricated a series of metal oxide composite nanostructures, including ZnO nanowires, NiO nanosheets, ZnO/CuO nanowire arrays, ZnO/FeO nanocrystals, ZnO/NiO nanosheets and ZnO/PbO nanotubes, via a simple and cost-effective chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. The electrochemical properties of the produced SCs were examined by performing cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Of the different metal oxides and metal oxide composites tested, the unique surface morphology of the ZnO/NiO nanosheets most effectively increased the electron transfer rate and electrical conductivity, which resulted in improved energy storage properties. The binder-free ZnO/NiO electrode delivered a high specific capacitance/capacity of 1248 F g-1 (599 mA h g-1) at 8 mA cm-2 and long-term cycling stability over the course of 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 79%. These results suggested a superiority in performance of the ZnO/NiO nanosheets relative to the nanowires, nanowire arrays, nanocrystals, and nanotubes. Thus, the present work has provided an opportunity to fabricate new metal oxide composite nanostructures with high-performance energy storage devices. This journal is
