In order to improve the asymmetric fault ride-through capability of wind power generation system, asymmetric voltage and current can be decomposed into positive sequence, negative sequence and zero sequence components respectively via symmetrical component method. The mathematical models of grid side converter in static coordinate system and synchronous rotating coordinate system were given; predictive current control strategy proposed can achieve no static error tracking of current in each switching cycle, can eliminate the negative sequence current in asymmetric fault and wipe off the secondary ripple of the dc side capacitor voltage. The dc side supercapacitor circuit can prevent the dc side from over-voltage. The methods introduced in this study can improve the large grid asymmetric fault ride through capability of wind power generation system. Effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified by the numerical simulations. Â© Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2013.
