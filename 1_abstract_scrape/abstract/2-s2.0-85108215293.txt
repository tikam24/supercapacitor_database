Metal ionic capacitors (MICs) are a new type of hybrid electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices that integrate the advantages of high-power output in supercapacitors and high energy density in batteries. These materials show potential to be commercialized, but their practical application is still limited due to the imbalance of kinetics and capacity between the electrodes, the slow ion/electron diffusion rate and the poor structural stability of the electrodes. 3D graphene-based materials with unique structure and appealing properties have recently received attentions for application in MICs due to their remarkable improvement from charge storage capacity to reaction kinetics. In this article, we reviewed the research progress of 3D graphene-based materials in lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) and sodium ion capacitors (SICs). Firstly, the energy storage principle and development requirements of LICs and SICs are introduced. The fabrication of 3D graphene materials is then summarized. The key advantages and important roles of 3D graphene-based materials in the construction of LICs and SICs are discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects regarding the application of 3D graphene-based materials in high-performance LICs and SICs are presented.
