In recent years, storage systems for energy obtained from renewable energy sources have attracted more and more interest. The basic solution is a system in which a set of accumulators is used as energy storage. A hybrid system is rarely used in practice, in which a supercapacitor buffer is used, whose primary task is to take over the current surge. The presented solution is an innovative approach to the use of supercapacitors as the main energy storage. The article presents an engineering solution of an electric energy storage system in supercapacitors charged from silicon photovoltaic cells.
