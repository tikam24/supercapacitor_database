The aim of this work is demonstration of a solid polymer electrolyte based on choline chloride/lactic acid deep eutectic solvent (DES) entrapped in chitosan (CS) matrix as potential separator for electrochemical energy storage devices. This full bio-based material demonstrates the high ionic conductivity up to 2.5 mS cm−1 and electrochemical stability window of 1.6 V. The polypyrrole-based film electrodes were prepared using CS/DES films as a supporting matrix for vapor phase polymerization of pyrrole. That allows assembling of a supercapacitor with the specific capacitance of 194 mF cm−2 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2.
