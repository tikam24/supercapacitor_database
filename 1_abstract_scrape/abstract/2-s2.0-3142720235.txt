The electrochemical measurement of carbon aerogel electrods show that carbon aerogels exhibit excellent properties of high efficiency, good electrochemical behavior as electrode materials. Both surface area and pore volume of carbon aerogels determine their specific capacitance. High pore volume and wide pore distribution contribute to increasing the capacitance. Activated carbon mixed with different ratio of carbon aerogels increases the capacitance of the electrode, while the capacitance is the highest when the content of carbon aerogels in the composites is 15 percent.
