Herein, the manganese cobalt sulfide nanoparticles (MnCo2S4 NPs) were successfully prepared by a hydrothermal strategy. The TEM result demonstrates that the size of the MnCo2S4 NPs is approximately 50 nm. The BET results indicate that such MnCo2S4 NPs have a large specific surface area that offers abundant reaction active sites during the electrochemical reaction procedure. Further, we assessed the electrochemical behavior of the MnCo2S4 NPs in a three-electrode system, demonstrating it possesses an excellent electrochemical capacitance of 1150 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1. Particularly, after 5000 cycles, 88.2% of the initial electrochemical capacitance was maintained, suggesting its extraordinary cycling stability. These outstanding electrochemical properties demonstrate the MnCo2S4 NPs would be an exceptional electrode material for advanced energy storage devices.
