Flexible and wearable supercapacitor (SC) fabrics have received considerable research interests recently. However, their high hydrophobicity, poor conductivity, inferior capacitance, and low energy density remain a bottleneck to be solved. Herein, a highly flexible and conductive carbonized cotton fabric (CCF) covered by a unique nanostructured Ni(OH) 2 layer is fabricated via a facile high-temperature carbonization process, followed by an electrochemical deposition (ED) treatment. The nanostructured Ni(OH) 2 greatly improves the hydrophilicity of CCF to promote electrolyte penetration and offers abundant electroactive sites, leading to dramatically increased specific capacitance and operating potential window (OPW). The resultant Ni(OH) 2 @CCF is then applied as the electrode for an aqueous symmetric SC device. This device has an OPW of 1.4 V and exhibits a high specific capacitance of 131.43 F g -1 at the current density of 0.25 A g -1 with a high energy density (35.78 Wh kg -1 at a power density of 0.35 kW kg -1 , and it can reach 18.28 Wh kg -1 at a high power density of 14.00 kW kg -1 ), which outperforms the performance of most aqueous symmetric SCs. In addition, the SC demonstrates excellent capacitance stability under various bending conditions, suggesting its potentials in flexible and wearable energy-storage devices.
