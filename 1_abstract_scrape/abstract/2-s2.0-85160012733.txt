Hierarchical ZnO@metal–organic framework@polypyrrole (ZnO@MOF@PPy) heterostructure arrays have been prepared by combining hydrothermal and chemical polymerisation processes. The structural properties and morphology of samples were determined using XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, XPS, and BET techniques. The energy storage capability of ZnO, ZnO@MOF, and ZnO@MOF@PPy was investigated using electrochemical techniques such as cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. ZnO@MOF@PPy displayed an excellent capacitance of 1181 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1 and a respectable rate capacity of 463 Fg−1 at 10 Ag−1 in a 2 M potassium hydroxide electrolyte. According to the GCD cycles’ stability investigation, the ZnO@MOF@PPy has 92%t excellent stability after 10,000 cycles at 10 Ag−1. Additionally, the use of ZnO@MOF@PPy as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode in an asymmetric supercapacitor was studied. The device demonstrated a high capacity of 172 Fg−1 at 2 Ag−1 in the potential window of 0.0–1.6 V with suitable cycling stability of 81% and columbic efficiency of 72% after 10,000 continuous cycles in the current density of 10 Ag−1, according to the results. This study demonstrated ZnO@MOF@PPy supercapacitive potential as a potential electrode for supercapacitors.
