Holey Fe-Anderson-type polyoxometalate/polyaniline/graphene (PPG) hybrid materials were first prepared by anchoring Anderson-type polyoxometalates [FeMo 6 O24H 6 ]3- (FeMo6) onto graphene modified with polyaniline via a facile hydrothermal treatment. The as-prepared materials exhibited an excellent electrochemical performance with a high specific capacitance of 1366 F g -1 at 1 A g -1 and outstanding cycling stability (97.6% capacitance retention after 5000 cycle times). The uptake of polyaniline/FeMo 6 nanoparticles on graphene not only provided the pseudocapacitance but also weakened the aggregation between the graphene layers, resulting in a higher surface area compared with pure graphene. In addition, the AC//PPG-15 asymmetric supercapacitor device showed a high energy density of 24.65W h kg -1 at a low power density of 326.25W kg -1 and good cycling stability (94.82% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). Hence, the as-prepared PPG hybrid materials in this work possess tremendous potential as electrodes for high-performance supercapacitors.
