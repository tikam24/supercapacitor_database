Electronic waste (e-waste) is a growing problem in the world due to increasing consumption and subsequent discarding of electronic devices. One of the ways to address this problem is to develop electronics made up of biodegradable components. Leaves are readily available, biodegradable and can be found with various types of architecture of the vascular conduits within. We investigated the possibility of developing electronic components based on leaves of a monocotyledon plant by introducing a conducting polymer inside the vascular conduits. We were able to construct conducting wires in those conduits extending to centimeters in length within a leaf. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the construction of a supercapacitor within a leaf by using the conducting conduits as electrodes. These results suggest the possibility of constructing embedded electronic components within leaves which may provide an alternative towards the development of biodegradable electronics.
