Pseudocapacitors or redox capacitors that synergize the merits of batteries and double-layer capacitors are among the most promising candidates for high-energy and high-power energy storage applications. 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes), an emerging family of pseudocapacitive materials with ultrahigh rate capability and volumetric capacitance, have attracted much interest in recent years. However, MXenes have only been used as negative electrodes as they are easily oxidized at positive (anodic) potential. To construct a high-performance MXene-based asymmetric device, a positive electrode with a compatible performance is highly desired. Herein, an ultrafast polyaniline@MXene cathode prepared by casting a homogenous polyaniline layer onto a 3D porous Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported, which enables the stable operation of MXene at positive potentials because of the enlarged work function after compositing with polyaniline, according to the first-principle calculations. The resulting flexible polyaniline@MXene positive electrode demonstrates a high volumetric capacitance of 1632 F cm−3 and an ultrahigh rate capability with 827 F cm−3 at 5000 mV s−1, surpassing all reported positive electrodes. An asymmetric device is further fabricated with MXene as the anode and polyaniline@MXene as the cathode, which delivers a high energy density of 50.6 Wh L−1 and an ultrahigh power density of 127 kW L−1.
