This work represents the design of superior supercapacitor electrode that comprised of 3D cloud like silver cobalt oxide/cobalt oxide (AgCoO2−Co3O4) and carbon architecture. AgCoO2−Co3O4/C architecture can be fabricated from Co−Ag nitrate precursors with the addition of carboxymethyl cellulose followed by annealing. Mesoporous 3D cloudy architecture provides higher specific capacitance (575 F g−1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1) and rate performance (666 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1). The combined effect of AgCoO2 embedded Co3O4 and carboxymethyl cellulose (carbon) highly favors for outstanding cycle life (around 1 % capacitance degradation even after 5000 cycles). Presence of such porous 3D architecture with carbon backbone delivers admirable energy/power density. Also, an advanced asymmetric supercapacitor with an operating range of 1.2 V is designed by utilizing this porous 3D cloudy architecture as positive electrode and activated carbon as negative electrode. The fabricated design shows a robust energy density of 17 W h kg−1 with a high power density of 166 W kg−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. The findings of the current study underline the potential of AgCoO2−Co3O4/C electrodes for supercapacitor applications.
