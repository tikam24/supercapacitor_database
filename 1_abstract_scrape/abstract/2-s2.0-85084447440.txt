Ordered mesoporous carbons fiber webs (OMCWs) with 2-D hexagonal (p6mm) pore structure were prepared by the electrospinning method using low molecular resin as carbon precursors, F127 as structure directed agent and PVP (polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Mw = 1,300,000) as fiber forming agent under wide range various electrospinning speed (0.1–0.5 ml/h) and voltages (15–25 kv). The microstructure of OMCWs could be tunable from cylinder to nano ribbon by carefully controlling the amount of PVP. OMCWs could be directly used in supercapacitor as electrode materials without any binders or conductive additives. The specific capacitance of OMCWs could reach as high as 119 F/g under the current density of 0.5 A/g, demonstrating the great potential application for electrode for supercapacitor.
