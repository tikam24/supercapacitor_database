Using paper fibers (PFs) as matrix, whisker-like carbon nanotubes (WCNTs) and activated carbon (AC) as functional additives, a PF/WCNT/AC composite paper electrode was fabricated by traditional paper-making process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy were used for characterization, and a double-electrode system was employed to measure the performance of supercapacitor based on the PF/WCNT/AC composite paper electrode. The results showed that the supercapacitor with PF/WCNT/AC electrode exhibits a good charge and discharge performance, and a significantly increased specific capacitance compared to the supercapacitor with Al/WCNT/AC composite that has a metal current collector, as the former (325 F/g) was 199% higher than the latter (108.7 F/g) under a scan rate of 1 mV/s. PF/WCNT/AC supercapacitor had a specific capacitance of 95 F/g while the current density was 0.4 A/g, and its specific energy and specific power were respectively 36.76 Wh/kg, 5.52 kW/kg while the current density was 3.2 A/g.
