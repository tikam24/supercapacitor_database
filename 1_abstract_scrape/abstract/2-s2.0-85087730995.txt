With the continuous development of energy storage devices towards sustainability and versatility, the development of biomass-based multi-functional energy storage devices has become one of the important directions. In this study, a symmetric dual-function supercapacitor was constructed based on a cellulose network/polyacrylamide/polyaniline (CPP) composite hydrogel. The presented supercapacitor, with excellent electrochemical performance and an areal capacitance of 1.73 mF/cm2 at 5 mV/s, an energy density of 0.62 μW h/cm2 at a power density of 7.03 μW/cm2, a wide electrochemical window of 1.6 V and a promising cycling stability, can be achieved. The transmittance of the supercapacitor at 500 nm decreased by 9.6% after the electrification at 3 V, and the device can exhibit periodic transmittance change under the square potential input between 0.0 V and 3.0 V at regular intervals of 10 s. The present construction strategy provides a basis for the preparation of multifunctional devices with natural renewable materials and structures.
