Energy management control is essential to microgrids (MGs), especially to single-phase ones. To handle the variety of distributed generators (DGs) that can be found in a MG, e.g., renewable energy sources (RESs) and energy storage systems (ESSs), a coordinated power regulation is required. The latter are generally battery-based systems whose lifetime is directly related to charge/discharge processes, whereas the most common RESs in a MG are photovoltaic (PV) units. Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) extend batteries life expectancy, thanks to the effect of supercapacitors, but they also require more complex control strategies. Conventional droop methodologies are usually applied to provide autonomous and coordinated power control. This paper proposes a method for coordination of a single-phase MG composed by a number of sources (HESS, RES, etc.) using power line signaling (PLS). In this distributed control strategy, a signal whose frequency is higher than the grid is broadcasted to communicate with all DGs when the state of charge (SoC) of the batteries reaches a maximum value. This technique prevents batteries from overcharging and maximizes the power contribution of the RESs to the MG. Moreover, different commands apart from the SoC can be broadcasted, just by changing to other frequency bands. The HESS master unit operates as a grid-forming unit, whereas RESs act as grid followers. Supercapacitors in the HESS compensate for energy peaks, while batteries respond smoothly to changes in the load, also expanding its lifetime due to less aggressive power references. In this paper, a control structure that allows the implementation of this strategy in single-phase MGs is presented, with the analysis of the optimal range of PLS frequencies and the required self-adaptive proportional-resonant controllers.
