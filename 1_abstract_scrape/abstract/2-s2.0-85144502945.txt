Mn0.5Zn0.5Fe2O4 nanoparticles have been synthesized through co-precipitation technique and annealed up to 700 °C. The values of crystallite size and lattice constant ranges from 11 to 21 nm and 8.4550 to 8.4732 Å respectively for most prominent peak (3 1 1) with a switching at 400 °C. X-ray density ranges from 5.18 to 5.25 g/cm3, lattice strain decreases with the increase of annealing temperature and ranges from (10.39–5.55) × 10-3 which in turn affects the line defects to decrease with annealing temperature (8.18–2.33) × 1015 lines/m2. The high values of specific surface area emphasize on energy storage applications like in supercapacitor. Magnetic properties including magnetic moment (nB = 0.0967–3.441 μB), saturation magnetization (Ms = 2.2906–81.4769 emu/g), coercivity (Hc = 24.80–109.35 Oe), anisotropic field (Hk = 49.00–198.38 Oe) and magneto-crystalline anisotropy (K1 = 87.22–4570.59 erg/g) manifested overall improved magnetic trends. The value of exchange bias field has been observed up to 108.18 Oe. The higher values of band-gaps (2.45–2.62 eV and 2.22–2.46 eV) lead to prospective solar cell applications. The range of metallization criterion [0.49–0.42] along with high refractive index values (3–9.6) suggest that synthesized nanomaterial could be utilized for the new generation of nonlinear optical materials and hetero-laser applications. Nyquist/Cole-Cole plots confirm the non-Debye type relaxation process and their shape leads to the existence of multiple electrical responses in the prepared samples.4.
