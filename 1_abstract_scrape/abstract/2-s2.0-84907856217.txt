We have demonstrated a type of acicular manganese dioxide(MnO2) via a facile chemical method. By adding different proportions of acetylene black (AB) or Multi-walled carbon nanotubes(MWCNTs) in MnO2as conductive additives, the capacitance of the electrodes with AB and MWCNTs has substantially increased about 30% compared with AB only at 0.25A/g and in the 0.5M Na2SO4electrolyte. Moreover, the electrode with 15% MWCNTs shows the worst cyclic performance among those three electrode materials, which attribute to the rejection of the diffusion of ions in the electrolyte from the intensive conductive network of MWCNTs. However , the electrode with 5% MWCNTs and 10% AB has a great cycling performance at 78.3% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles. The morphology and structure of the MnO2/AB/MWCNTs are systematically characterized by scanning electron microscope(SEM) and X-ray diffraction(XRD).
