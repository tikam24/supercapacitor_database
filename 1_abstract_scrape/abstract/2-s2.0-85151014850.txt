A new Ni2P2O7@Polypyrrole composite synthesised using an abundant method can effectively enhance electrical mobility during electrochemical processes in supercapacitor applications. In this study, we generated bare Ni2P2O7 and Ni2P2O7@PPy nanocomposite nanomaterials using hydrothermal and chemical polymerization methods. The crystalline phase, morphological, and textures of the samples were investigated using XRD, FESEM, XPS, and BET surface analysis. A number of approaches, such cyclic voltammtery (CV), Galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with a 2 M KOH liquid electrolyte, were used to study the electrochemical behaviour of electrodes, including capacitive, cyclic, and resistive properties. The capacitive and cyclic performance of composite Ni2P2O7@PPy electrode exhibits high specific capacitance of 498 Fg−1 and long cyclic stability of 97.4 % after 10,000 cycles. The capacitance contribution of bare and composite electrodes at different scan rates were evaluated using the Trasatti method, which yields 52 % and 70 % at low current density of 1 Ag−1, respectively. The fabricated ASC devices offer electrochemical results of the high specific capacity of 79 Fg−1 at 1 Ag−1, cyclic stability of 99.3 % retention after 10,000 cycles at 5 Ag−1, with the energy density of 41 Whkg−1 at the power density of 1175 Wkg−1 for 1 Ag−1.
