The paper outlined through a comparative study on the electrode envisaged for the supercapacitor application prepared with polyaniline (PANI) and rare earth metal oxides (La2O3), with the hypothesis of achieving high specific capacitance, high strength, and high energy density. The characterization of samples was permitted differently by using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV–vis spectra), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS spectra). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests were performed to measure the electrochemical efficiency. PANI/La composite electrode exhibits a higher effective capacitance of 718 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1 at 1.0 M H2SO4 with a specific energy of 53.8 Wh/Kg at a current density of 1.0 A/g. The electrode has good power retention over 10,000 GCD cycles at a current density of 10 A/g. A well-capacitive supercapacitor electrode implies the better capacitance of the PANI/La electrode at a high mass loading.
