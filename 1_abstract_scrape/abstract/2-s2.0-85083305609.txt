Modern buildings exchange large amounts of heat with their surroundings through large area curtain wall windows. The integration of solar energy harvest system with smart windows that dynamically control of light and thermal loads in building has shown exiting future for “zero” emission green buildings. In this study, we design an integrated smart window by integrating a dye-sensitized solar cell and an electrochromic supercapacitor. This device shows synergic performance of solar energy harvest and storage, as well as light and thermal transmission control. Dense and mesoporous WO3 thin films are incorporated as electrochromic and energy storage layer. The device with mesoporous WO3 film exhibits modulation of ∼40% in visible light range and ∼50% in near infrared light range, suggesting excellent cooling effect of the smart window. Moreover, the device shows high specific capacitance of 147 F g−1 and stable cycling performance. The as-assembled solar-chargeable electrochromic supercapacitors provide a promising candidate for energy saving in modern buildings.
