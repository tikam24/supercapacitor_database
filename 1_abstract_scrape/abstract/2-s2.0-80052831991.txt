A highly uniform nanocomposite of MoO3 and carbon with a weight ratio of 1:1 is prepared by employing a simple procedure of ball milling. Such composite as electrochemical pseudocapacitor materials for potential energy storage applications exhibits a high specific capacitance of ~ 179 F/g at a charge and discharge current density of 50 mA/g with excellent cycling ability over 1000 cycles. Compared with the capacitance of pure milled graphite (~ 22 F/g) and MoO3 (< 10 F/g), an enhanced electrochemical performance of the composite with a weight ratio of 1:1 is attributed to its unique structure, in which MoO3 nanoparticles (with a size range of 1-180 nm) are uniformly dispersed in an electrically conductive carbon host.
