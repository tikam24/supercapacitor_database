For mixed storage with lithium battery and super capacitor energy system, proposed a coordinated control strategy based on state. According to the state of charge and discharge of battery lithium adjusted for super capacitor SOC, Two kinds of storage and coordinate the cooperation in the protection and restriction, combined with the transient simulation model and general steady-state model, analysis in the energy storage system can run mixed storage redundancy configuration condition, compared with the existing control strategy, and analysis the influence strategies on control effect through the operation curve.
