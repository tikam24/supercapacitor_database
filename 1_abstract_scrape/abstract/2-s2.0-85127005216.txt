This Paper describes the synthesis of nickel doped ZnO is planned by chemical co-precipitation techniques. The prepared nanostructured nickel doped zinc oxide samples were analyzed by thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infra red (FTIR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and cyclic voltametry (CV). Nanostructure nickel doped ZnO materials have developed as promising for the basis of its broad range of employing in diverse areas. The attractive properties of nickel doped ZnO materials are highly demanded in high-energy potential applications. The nickel doped zinc oxide materials are hexagonal wurtzite arrangement is confirmed by XRD. The morphological -features of FE-SEM show nickel doped zinc oxide NPs are the structure of spherical type with agglomeration. The calculated particle size 11 nm is confirmed by HR-TEM. EPR spectra of nickel doped zinc oxide nanoparticles are ferromagnetic nature. Further, CV studies of Ni doped ZnO materials of the specific capacitance value is 133 Fg-1 at the scan rate 10 mVsâˆ’1 it is suitable for super capacitor application. The quantum chemical calculations were done by using DFT techniques through B3LYP/LANL2DZ level of basis set.
