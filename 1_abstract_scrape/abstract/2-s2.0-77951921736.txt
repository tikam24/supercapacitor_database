Taking petroleum cokes as raw material, activated carbons CA and CB were prepared by chemical activation and chemical-physical activation. The BET specific surface area and the pore structure of activated carbons were analyzed by N2 adsorption method. Electrochemical properties of both samples, such as constant-current charge-discharge measurement, cyclic voltammogram, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were investigated in non-aqueous electrolytes. It can be found that CA shows higher yield, tap density and BET specific surface area, which are 61.28%, 0.35 g/cm3 and 2760 m2/g, respectively. However, CB has higher mesopore ratio of 24.1% and pore diameter of 2.3 nm. At the current density of 1 A/g, CA attains the highest specific capacitance of 137.8 F/g. CB shows good power discharge behavior with the capacitance loss of 4.7% at the current density of 20 A/g than that at 1 A/g.
