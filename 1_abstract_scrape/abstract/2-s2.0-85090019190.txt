Lead-carbon hybrid capacitor has been widely used in hybrid electrical vehicle, uninterruptible power supply, smart grid and other fields, with low prices, stable performance at high-low temperature and good security. However, it is difficult for lead-carbon hybrid capacitors to meet the requirements of high-performance electrochemical energy storage devices because the effective availability of the positive active materials is relatively low and the cycle life of this hybrid capacitor is also unsatisfactory. In this study, a 3D-Ti/SnO2-Sb2O5/F-PbO2 electrode was prepared in the co-electrodeposition method. The F doping in the corner of the PbO2 crystal is beneficial for the morphological transformation from enormous columnar to planar special structure, which can enhance the cycling stability and energy density. The lead-carbon hybrid capacitor with optimized F-PbO2 electrode electrodeposited at 1.50 V has high energy density (133 mAh g−1 at 1 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling stability (98.8% of original capacitance after 1000 cycles).
