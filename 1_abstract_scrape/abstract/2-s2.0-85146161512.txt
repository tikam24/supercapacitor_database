The ability of spectator metal ions such as vanadium to enhance the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors has been explained. Vanadium-incorporated CoO(OH) combined with NiMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH) yields a specific capacitance of 1700 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 96% retention after 5000 cycles. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 45.93 W h kg−1 and a power density of 752 W kg−1@1 A g−1
