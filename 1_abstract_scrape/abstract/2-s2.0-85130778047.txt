In this article, an event-triggered active disturbance rejection control (ET-ADRC) method is designed for the battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in electric vehicles (EVs). The proposed method combines the advantages of the ADRC method and the ET mechanism. It inherits the fast response from the ADRC-based control module, which has an inner proportional-integral (PI) current loop and an outer ADRC voltage loop. To improve the computational efficiency, an ET control module is adopted by utilizing the system state information at the last triggering and current sampling time. When the state error exceeds the preset range, the ADRC-based control module is triggered and the control signals are updated; otherwise, the ADRC-based control module is halted with unchanged control signals. A series of simulation cases have been conducted for the verification of the response speed and computational efficiency of the proposed method. A scaled-down hardware platform is set up to carry on the experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that under the similar voltage ripples (VRs), the proposed ET-ADRC method responses faster than the conventional PI method and reduces the computational burden to almost 60% of the original ADRC method.
