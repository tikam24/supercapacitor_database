A brand new silica-based copolymer template is developed by co-condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and (3-methacryloxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane (MPS). The framework morphology and size of this template can be tailored by tuning the MPS concentration. Thus, unimodal mesoporous, bimodal mesoporous and macroporous carbon can be easily obtained by varying the preparation techniques. Meanwhile, the pore size and BET surface area of this carbon can be tuned from 4.3 to 55.0 nm, and 779-1649 m2/g, respectively. The as-prepared carbon materials with well-controlled pore size distribution are then used as model to investigate the ion transport inside the nanopores. The electrochemical results reveal that the capacitances of carbon materials are positively related to the surface area and the large mesopore or macropore can accelerate ion transport and then lead to enhanced rate performance.
