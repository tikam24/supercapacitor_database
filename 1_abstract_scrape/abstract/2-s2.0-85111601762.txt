Herein, we report the syntheses of RuxV1-xO2/graphene hybrid nanocomposites using a one-step laser scribe approach for supercapacitors and energy storage devices. A series of RuxV1-xO2 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.05) nanowires decorated graphene were prepared. The effect of ruthenium ions (Ru) on the structure, morphology, elemental composition and oxidation state of the RuxV1-xO2/graphene hybrid nanocomposites was explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties were emphasized using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic Voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. The RuxV1-xO2/graphene hybrid nanocomposites showed a specific capacitance of 1210 F g−1 at a Ru-concentration of 5 mol%. The Ru0·05V0·95O2/LSG hybrid electrode exhibits excellent capacitance retention up to a current density of 350 A g−1, suggesting a good application prospect for energy storage devices.
