A current compensator for hybrid power plant is proposed in this paper. The exceeding current in the battery are compensated by using bidirectional multiphase dc-dc converter as supercapacitor charge - discharge controller. When the battery charging current exceeds the limit, the supercapacitor absorbs the exceeded charging current. Likewise, when the battery discharging current exceeds the limit, the supercapacitor is discharged to help the battery. Multiphase topology is selected to reduce switching current ripple and switch current rating. To verify the proposed application, simulation results are included. Â© 2012 IEEE.
