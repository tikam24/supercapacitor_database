Two new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), [Co(bcpp)(bbip)]·H2O (Co-MOF) and [Ni(bcpp)(bbip)]·H2O (Ni-MOF), have been generated based on a V-type flexible carboxylic ligand 3,5-bis(4-carboxyl phenoxy) pyridine (H2bcpp) and a rigid N-donor ligand 1,1′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1H-benzimidazole) (bbip) by a solvothermal method. Co-MOF and Ni-MOF are isostructural with a 2-fold interpenetrated layered structure. Moreover, a series of bimetallic CoxNiy-MOFs (x/y = 1:1, 2.5:1, 2.75:1, 3:1, 3.25:1, and 3.5:1) were obtained by using one-pot synthesis. Owing to their mixed metallic components and internal layered structure, the bimetallic CoxNiy-MOFs possess a remarkable electrochemical storage property. Significantly, the Co2.75Ni1-MOF has high specific capacitance (699 F g-1) at 0.5 A g-1 and good cycling durability (retained 72.7% over 3100 turns). Additionally, an asymmetrical ultra-capacitor based on Co2.75Ni1-MOF and activated carbon (AC) delivers a maximum energy density of 20.44 Wh kg-1 at 387.49 W kg-1 and a high cycle-to-cycle stability with 85.4% of the primary capacitance over 15,000 turns.
