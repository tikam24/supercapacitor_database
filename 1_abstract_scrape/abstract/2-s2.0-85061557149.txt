Metallic 1T phase molybdenum disulfide (1T-MoS2) holds great promise in energy storage applications due to its excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity. However, free 1T-MoS2 nanosheets are prone to agglomeration and convert to 2H-MoS2, resulting in a decrease in electrochemical performance. In this study, metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets are confined among TiO2 nanotube arrays (1T-MoS2@TiO2/Ti) via a facile hydrothermal process. The architecture in the glory of ultrathin 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and highly ordered pore tunnel of TiO2 nanotube arrays benefits fast electrolyte diffusion and electron transfer. As a result, the 1T-MoS2@TiO2/Ti composite shows a high specific capacitance of 428.1F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, high energy density of 48.2 Wh kg−1, high power density of 2481.7 W kg−1 and 97% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. This study proves an artful thought for designing electrode materials to enhance their electrochemical performances.
