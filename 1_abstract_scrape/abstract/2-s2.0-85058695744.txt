The hierarchical interpenetrating reduced holey graphene oxide (rHGO)-decorated NiCo 2 O 4 nanowires were constructed on carbon fibers (rHGO/NiCo 2 O 4 @CF) by a hydrothermal synthesis. Benefiting from the abundant nanopores and good conductivity of rHGO, the rHGO/NiCo 2 O 4 @CF delivered excellent specific capacitance of 1178 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 as supercapacitor electrode and outstanding rate capability of 93.4% capacitance retention even at 10 A g −1 . Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor by using rHGO/NiCo 2 O 4 @CF as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode has been assembled, which exhibited a high energy density of 74.88 Wh kg −1 with a power density of 799.9 W kg −1 and good cycle stability (82.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). These exciting results are attributed to the hierarchical porous interpenetrating network architecture and the synergistic effect between rHGO and NiCo 2 O 4 nanowires.
