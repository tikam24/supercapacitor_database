In this study, we report an enormously simple green approach for the synthesis of polyaniline hybrid (PANI-SO) nanofibers in emeraldine salt form. We have carried out the synthesis via an interfacial polymerization method using vegetable oil as an organic phase instead of the commonly used solvents like CHCl3, CCl4, etc. Characterization techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-visible, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have been used for studying the synthesized polyaniline hybrid nanofibers. An interesting observation is the crystallization of small organic molecules in the PANI matrix. PANI-SO shows a pseudocapacitance behavior with a capacitance value of 302 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. In addition, the material shows an energy density of 26.8 W h kg-1 and a maximum power density of 402.6 W kg-1. Furthermore, the PANI-SO electrode maintains about 84% of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles. Similarly, the PANI-SO symmetric solid-state supercapacitor shows an areal capacitance of 118.7 mF cm-2 and retains a stability of 80% even after 1000 cycles. Thus, the PANI-SO electrode shows a good cyclic performance, which implies the structural stability of PANI-SO nanofibers. The electrochemical properties of PANI-SO are compared with those of PANI nanofibers synthesized by taking CHCl3 as the organic phase and keeping all other parameters identical. PANI-SO is observed to be a superior material compared to the latter one. All electrochemical analyses show that the PANI synthesized using cooking soyabean oil (PANI-SO) is an effective supercapacitor material.
