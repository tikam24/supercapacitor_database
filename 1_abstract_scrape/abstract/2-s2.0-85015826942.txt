Super capacitors is an invention of material science that find its application in electronics. In this paper, a super capacitor is used as a power source for a boost converter to yield a constant output voltage for a current in the range of milliamps. Depending upon the output current draw the super capacitor voltage decays and we will to simulate this decay characteristic using dc-dc converter. In this paper firstly we discuss the methodology for designing PWM based constant output dc-dc boost converter powered by super capacitor i.e. the input voltage is varying and based on it we endeavor create the methodology for a test circuit which when connected to any circuit in place of super capacitor, will yield the almost same effect. In this paper it is also shown that if we know the power consumed by each and every component in a circuit powered by super capacitor along with the output power of that circuit, we can calculate rate at which the super capacitor voltage will decay and the time for which that circuit would operate when its powered by super capacitor, and thus we can find the voltage and current profile of super capacitor discharge characteristic when it is supplying a certain load, and also model it using a dc-dc converter.
