A set of identical Co3O4 nanosheets with different oxygen vacancy amounts are rationally designed by varied reduction treatments and comparison of their properties. Remarkably, the oxygen-vacancy-rich Co3O4 nanosheets (OVR-Co3O4 NSs) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance for their potential use as a promising candidate for the next generation of supercapacitors.
