We report a popcorn-derived activated carbon (PCs) from maize grains. Dispersed NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles of dozens of nanometers in diameter are anchored onto the PC surface to yield PCs/NiCo 2 S 4 composites. The adhesion of NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles to the porous carbon substrate provides the PCs/NiCo 2 S 4 composite electrode with an improved electrochemical performance. The highly electroconductive PCs substrate with porous structure and combination with dispersive NiCo 2 S 4 nanoparticles, yields PCs/NiCo 2 S 4 composites with a high specific capacitance of 605.2 F g −1 at the current density of 0.5 A g −1 in a voltage range of −0.1 to 0.4 V in 6 M KOH electrolyte, and an outstanding capacitance conservation of 91.3% after 5000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates high energy density of 23.3 W h kg −1 at the power density of 335.8 W kg −1 , and an excellent cycling stability of 92.7% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. This research supplies a novel method to exploit biomass-based electrode material candidates for promising application on high-performance supercapacitors.
