The development of modern technology toward energy production and storage is essential to support human life with wide impact on the environment, human health, and world's economy. Through the development of the advanced energy systems, human life can be ensure in a networked society even more conveniently. In the electric and energy field, secondary batteries will play a critical factor in reducing the environmental hazard and enable the effective construction of the green energy society. At present, high power density and high energy density are required as a power sources for the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV). As we know, Li-ion battery has high energy density but low power density. The energy density of Li-ion battery decreases with the increase in rate capability, but electric double-layer capacitor has high power density but low energy density. So, this chapter focuses on the advanced energy devices such as lithium-ion battery and high energy capacitors beginning with brief introduction. The importance of the solution process mainly including the hydrothermal and solvothermal method as sustainable chemistry toward the processing of the positive electrode materials for lithium-ion batteries has been discussed. The requirement and different techniques of the carbon coating using different carbon sources to improve the electrochemical property of the positive electrode materials have been focused. The electrochemical property of the olivinestructured cathode materials affected by different particles size and morphology has been addressed. The concept of using graphene-based compounds for the electric double-layer capacitor applications and electrochemical capacitor based on pseudocapacitance has been discussed. The hybrid capacitors such as metal oxide-doped graphene and PANI/graphene nanocomposites with their electrochemical performances have also been discussed.
