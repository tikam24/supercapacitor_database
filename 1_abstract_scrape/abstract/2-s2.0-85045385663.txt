In the present research, a multifunctional composite is manufactured which is based on the mechanism of supercapacitor by using Li1.4Al0.4Ti1.6(PO4)3 (LATP) ionic conductor as solid electrolyte. This device could store electrical energy, meanwhile bearing the mechanical loads. The LATP solid electrolyte is sintered and both round surfaces of the pellet are sputtered with gold in 90nm of thickness. Then, samples are embedded into composite systems by using RTM-6 as resin matrix. The capacitances of the sample before and after embedding are measured by cyclic voltammetry method. The results show a significant decrease of capacitance after embedding process. The reasons for this are systematically investigated by different methods, for example, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Different sputter methods are used for preparing the electrodes. Using various resins the impact of different thermal expansion coefficients and curing temperatures on the capacity is also investigated. The results indicate that the decrease should mainly come from the degradation of interfaces between LATP, sputtered gold layer and electrical collector. Finally, magnetron sputtering shows an obvious advantage in comparison to common deposition sputter methods, because the former one results in a stronger adhesion between sputtered metal layer and LATP pellet surface.
