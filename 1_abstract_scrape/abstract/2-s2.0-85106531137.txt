CuO nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and CuO/Activated Coconut Fiber Carbon nanocomposites (CuO/ACFC Ncps) with different ACFC loading of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 g (designated as CuO/ACFC-1, 2, 3, 4 Ncps, respectively) were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method. CuO NPs and all CuO/ACFC Ncps displayed a monoclinic phase of CuO with space group C2/c as confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed a lotus root-like shape with grooves on a rough surface of ACFC and an oval-like shape for CuO NPs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a bar-let shape of CuO NPs with average diagonal of 167.57 ± 2.32 nm. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed to probe the electrochemical properties of all samples. Interestingly, the specific capacitance (Cs) of 60.14 F g−1 for CuO NPs electrode was improved to 145.33 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 in CuO/ACFC-0.3 Ncps electrode with capacity retention of 85.24%. Moreover, an assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device with ACFC as a negative electrode and CuO/ACFC-3 Ncps as a positive electrode (ACFC//CuO/ACFC-3) could exhibit the Cs value of 24.94 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with the maximum energy density (Esp) and power density (Psp) of 7.78 Wh kg−1 and 3,000 W kg−1, respectively. Additionally, good capacitance retention of 75.2% was achieved in this device after 1500 continuous GCD cycling test.
