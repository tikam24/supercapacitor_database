Selenium is a non-metallic element of group IV, with relatively small electronegativity and high conductivity. Metal selenides show good capacitive properties, and the capacitive performance of RuSe2 is few reported. In this work, RuSe2 @ 250 nanoparticles are prepared at a temperature of 250 °C under N2 atmosphere, and those further calcined at 550 and 800 °C are defined as RuSe2 @ 550 and RuSe2 @ 800. The results show that RuSe2 @ 250 is in amorphous structures, RuSe2 @ 800 is in crystalline forms, and RuSe2 @ 550 is in between them. Different structures also make difference in their capacitance performances. Amorphous RuSe2 @ 250 has high specific capacitance (1123.9 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and high specific energy, but low cyclic stability and low rate capacity. RuSe2 @ 800 has lower specific capacitance but higher cyclic stability, and RuSe2 @ 550 is still in the between. Based on these results, a structure-dependent charge transfer mechanism is proposed. Further, an asymmetric supercapacitor with RuSe2 @ 550 as the anode and conducting carbon as the cathode is assembled. It shows the specific energy of 44.8 Wh kg−1 at the specific power of 400 W kg−1 and good cyclic stability of 96.2% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles, indicating that RuSe2 has a potential application prospect for electrochemical energy storage.
