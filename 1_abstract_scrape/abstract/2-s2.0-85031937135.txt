We report a cost-effective, facile chemical synthesis of γ-manganese sulfide (MnS) nanoparticles (NPs) and investigated its structural, morphology and electrochemical properties. For the first time, we have attempted to exploit a novel highly flexible electrodes for supercapacitor application via depositing the synthesized MnS NPs on home-made graphite/scotch tape, as binder-free flexible conducting electrode which demonstrated a specific capacitance of 112 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, with a cyclic stability of 93% after 2000 cycles. The results showed that the conducting flexible electrodes might be an ideal choice for cost-effective, next-generation high-performance supercapacitor application.
