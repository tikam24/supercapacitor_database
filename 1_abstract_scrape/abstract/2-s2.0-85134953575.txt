Graphene, a two-dimensional materials with single atom thickness, is considered as single sheet of graphite. Graphene oxide (GO) is prepared by oxidizing graphite, whereas reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is synthesized from the reduction of GO by chemical or biological methods. rGO is slightly different from graphene prepared from graphite by electrical, thermal, or chemical treatment. Graphene or rGO is used in many applications such as lithium-sulfur battery, pollutant removal from contaminated air and water, lithium ion batteries and polymer nanocomposites, methanol oxidation, detection of carbon monoxide at room temperature, both diagnostic and therapeutic applications, application in sensing, supercapacitor and electrocatalytic applications, electrochemical applications, dye-sensitized solar cells and chemical decontamination. Normally, modification/functionalization of GO surface is done for its different applications by using non-covalent and covalent approaches. Biofabrication is considered a greener approach to tune GO surfaces for its smart applications. Biofabrication is done by using bacteria, Shewanella cells, microbials such as bakerâ€™s yeast, Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus marisflavi, Ganoderma spp. and different plant extracts. In addition, other green agents such as proteins and peptides are used to modify GO surfaces. In this book chapter, different biofabrication approaches of GO nanosheets using different biomaterials will be discussed with their merits and demerits. Also, special emphasis will be highlighted on the advantages of biofabrication over chemical routes. Finally, a thorough discussion will be included for different characterization techniques used and applications of biofabricated GO nanosheets.
