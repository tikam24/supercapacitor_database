This work reports, the growth of nanobelts-like Ni(OH)2 on three-dimensional conductive nickel foam by using a simply modified chemical bath deposition method which was used as binder-free battery-type electrode for high-performance supercapacitor. The synthesised battery-type electrode Ni(OH)2/Ni tested as an electrode for supercapacitor which exhibited superior electrochemical performance. The maximum specific capacitance of 187.46 mAhg−1 demonstrated by Ni(OH)2/Ni at a scan rate of 10 mVs−1 and 50.29 mAhg−1 at 100 mVs−1 along with 96% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. The obtained excellent electrochemical performance is due to materials unique nanostructure where thin nanosheets build the nanobelt-like structure.
