Pseudocapacitive materials, e.g., MnO2 and Co3O4, can significantly enhance the energy density of supercapacitors because of Faradaic reactions that can take place with these materials. Single-component electrodes have shown insufficient performance due to limited variations in electrode structures. Herein, we report a hierarchical electrode through growing networked Co3O4@MnO2 hierarchical nanosheets (HNS) arrays directly on Ni foam. We adopt a one-step hydrothermal reaction followed by a simple staged post-annealing treatment which simplifies the synthesis procedure. When used as electrodes for supercapacitors, the Co3O4@MnO2 HNS electrode shows good electrochemical performance, such as high areal/specific capacitances of 2.85 F cm−2/2374 F g−1 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 and long-term cycling stability of 4500 cycles. These encouraging results demonstrate this electrode design strategy is promising for developing high capacitance electrode materials for high energy density supercapacitors.
