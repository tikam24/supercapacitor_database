Cosmetic brush-like Co3O4 nanowires grown on carbon cloth were prepared by regulating the addition of trisodium citrate by hydrothermal synthesis. Then a simple liquid-phase ion exchange was carried out to improve the electrochemical performance of Co3O4 by surface modification with Ni2+. After surface modification, at a current density of 4 A g-1, the specific capacity significantly increased from 276.1 C g-1 (720.5 F g-1) to 655.9 C g-1 (1525.4 F g-1). Meanwhile, the electrocatalytic oxidation performances of methanol and urea were also improved significantly. The enhanced electrochemical properties were attributed to the modification of the surface of Co3O4 with Ni2+.
