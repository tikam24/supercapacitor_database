â€”This paper proposes a distributed coordination control strategy for load sharing and energy balancing between heterogeneous energy storages. These control objectives are satisfied through a two-level control structure. At the primary level, the decentralized virtual impedance control, without the requirement of communication links, allocates the low frequency component of the loads to batteries, while the high frequency component is allocated to ultracapacitors. Distributed control strategy, introduced at the secondary level over a sparse communication network, achieves battery state of charge balancing and regulation of the local bus voltages. Two sets of data are exchanged via the communication links, the local bus voltages, and state of charges of batteries. The distributed controller for the restoration of local bus voltages implements an average consensus protocol, while the controller for energy balancing uses a cooperative protocol. In addition, the ultracapacitor voltages are locally restored at a slower time-scale. The proposed control strategy is resilient to communication link failures and features plug-and-play capability. Presented results demonstrate performance of the proposed control strategy for an islanded 380 VDC datacenter with variable loads. Different operating conditions are verified through the RTDS Technologies real-time digital power system simulator using switching converter models and nonlinear battery models.
