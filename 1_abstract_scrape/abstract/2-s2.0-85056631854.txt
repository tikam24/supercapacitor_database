In this work, Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55/Bi3.84W0.16O6.24 (BMW1) and Bi2MoO6/Bi2WO6 (BMW2) nanocomposite were successfully prepared by a facile hydrothermal method with different PH. The Synthesis of good crystallization BMW1 and BMW2 with nanoparticles and nanosheet-like morphology is revealed from XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS, respectively. The BMW1 and BMW2 nanocomposite affords an excellent structural stability and fast electron and ion transportation compared with pure Bi2Mo6 and Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55, which can beneficial for improving the electrochemical performance. The pseudocapacitive behaviour of nanocomposite is analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP) and AC impendence in the 1 M KOH electrolyte. The as-prepared materials specific capacitance reaches to 1056 F g−1 and 699 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, respectively. Moreover, the as-prepared nanocomposite exhibits high cycle stability, and 80% of its initial capacitance is retained after continuous 3000 cycles. Especially, the higher electrochemical performance of BMW1 compared with BMW2, which is possibly ascribed to the higher Bi content. These results demonstrated nanocomposite and high Bi content materials might be a promising electrode material for pseudocapacitor.
