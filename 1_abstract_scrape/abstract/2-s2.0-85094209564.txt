Li-ion cells are characterized by high energy density and low power availability. Supercapacitors are the contrary: they have low energy density and high power availability. A comprehensive approach to constructing a battery containing Liion cells and supercapacitors is presented. This results in better li-ion current discharge characteristics and high power density of such a hybrid energy bank. Mobile robots require a very efficient power electronic system. The better the system is the longer remote work can be performed which reduces cost and make the robot more flexible. Increased battery quality and performance are crucial in improving the whole mobile robot power system.
