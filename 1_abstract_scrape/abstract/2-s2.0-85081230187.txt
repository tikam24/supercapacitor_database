Carbon-based materials, as some of the most important electrode materials for supercapacitors (SC), have spurred enormous attentions. Now, it is highly desirable but remains an open challenge to design stable and high-capacity carbons for further enhancing supercapacitive function. Here, a facile chemical activation recipe is introduced to develop biomass-derived functional carbons using cheap and abundant natural resources, anthracite, as the heteroatom-rich carbon sources, and potassium hydroxide (KOH) as activator. These porous carbons have high BET surface areas of roughly 2814 m2 g-1, large pore volumes of up to 1.531 cm3 g-1, and a high porosity that combines micro-and small-sized mesopores. The optimal nanocarbon features two additional outstanding virtues: an appropriate N-doping level (2.77%) and a uniform pore size distribution in the narrow range of 1-4 nm. Synergy of the above unique structural traits and desirable chemical composition endows resultant samples with the much boosted supercapacitive property with remarkable specific capacitance at varied current densities (e.g., 325 F g-1 at 0.5 A/g), impressive energy/power density, and long cycling stability over 5000 cycles at 10 A g-1 (92% capacity retention). When constructing the symmetric supercapacitor utilizing a common neutral Na2SO4 electrolyte that can strongly circumvent the corrosion effect occurring in the strong acid/alkaline solutions, both an elevated operation voltage at 1.8 V and a fascinating energy density of 23.5 Wh kg-1 are attained. The current study paves the way to explore the stable, efficient, and high-voltage SC assembled by the anthracite-derived porous doped nanocarbons for a wide spectrum of applications like automobiles, vehicle devices, and so on.
