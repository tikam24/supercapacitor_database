The present investigation is focused on the solid-state supercapacitors which are fabricated with ionic liquid 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (BMPTFSI) modified multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) electrodes and ionic liquid incorporated gel polymer electrolyte (ILGPE). Furthermore, the incorporation of the Li-salt lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in ILGPE has been done and the effect of the Li-salt on the performance of supercapacitors is investigated. On the addition of Li-salt, a wider electrochemical window of ˜ 3 V is found at room temperature. The impact of the Li-salt in the gel polymer electrolyte and comparative performance with the EDLCs have been studied by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetric, and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies. It is found that bucky gelled MWCNT electrodes provide specific capacitance of ˜ 57 F/g with Li-salt incorporated ILGPE, which is higher as compared to ILGPE without Li-salt, showing the value of 51 F/g which as also reflect in CV profiles.
