Novel Mn-doped Co 3 O 4 oblique prisms (Mn@Co 3 O 4 OPs) were successfully fabricated via a simple solvothermal reaction in a mixed solvent of ethanol and water, and followed by a calcination treatment of the precursor at 550 °C in air. The Mn@Co 3 O 4 OPs exhibited a BET surface area of ca. 45 m 2 g −1 , a pore size distribution centered at 8.5 nm, and an average pore diameter of around 15.6 nm as well. The Mn@Co 3 O 4 -OPs-modified electrode possessed an exceptional electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance as high as 909 F g −1 at a current density of 1 A g −1 , a good rate capability with a capacity retention of 78.2% at 16 A g −1 , and a superior cycling durability with 71.2% of its original capacitance retained after 5000-cycling process at 5 A g −1 in potassium hydroxide aqueous electrolyte. The excellent electrochemical behaviors are probably ascribed to both the Mn doping into the Co 3 O 4 crystal structure and the mesoporous feature of electrode material which can provide an increased conductivity and fast transfer for ions and electrons. The results suggest that the Mn@Co 3 O 4 OPs may serve as a promising electrode material applicable to supercapacitors.
