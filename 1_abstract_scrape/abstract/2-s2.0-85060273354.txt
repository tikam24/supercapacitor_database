This paper presents a new control method for Supercapacitor (SC) to compensate the transient load current and support the system under the pulsed load. Moreover, the cooperative operation of the multiple SC in DC microgrid is also ensured by proportionally sharing the support current between the SC units. The current sharing between the SC units is achieved by means of the droop control concept which is innovated to adapt in SC control. The conventional droop control is modified so that it can adaptively change its operation mode and parameters in order to compensate the load transient current and regulate the state of charge of the SC. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated and evaluated by an experimental DC microgrid prototype. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve high performance and seamless control.
