Photo-supercapacitor (PSc) was an integration of photovoltaic as a device for harvesting light energy and supercapacitor as an energy storage device. Multifunctional harvesting device has increasing demand in the green energy industry sector. In this study, we demonstrate the integrated array of photovoltaic type dye-sensitized solar cells and carbon-based supercapacitors. The photo-supercapacitor integration will be arranged in a different arrangement, called series and parallel arrangement. DSSC photoanode was used TiO2material that deposited using screen printing method on FTO substrate. Activated Carbon/Carbon Black/SBR as a material composite of the electrode was deposited on the aluminium foil substrate using dr. blade technique. XRD characterization has identified the TiO2anatase. The morphology of mesoporous TiO2 and Ti element has been identified by SEM characterization and EDX of 64.30 wt%. The UV-Vis spectroscopy curve has identified the absorbance in the wavelength range of 200 - 900 nm and the absorbance area of 914.58. The J-V characterization shows that TiO2 photoanode has a efficiency of 2.15 %. The Charge-Discharge shows that AC/CB/SBR performance has capacitance specific of 61.33 F/g. The l - V characterization of photo-supercapacitor performance was arranged by series has voltage higher than parallel arrangement, because it produces a larger voltage (Vop ).
