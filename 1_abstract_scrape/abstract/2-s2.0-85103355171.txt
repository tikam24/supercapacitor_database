This work presents for the first time the systematic characterization and excellent supercapacitor performance of heteroatom-doped porous carbon materials (HPC) synthesized by direct pyrolysis of watermelon peel and urea via molten salt template route in air with non-toxic activating agent. The molten salt not only protects the derived carbon from burning during high-temperature pyrolysis, but can also be etched to generate abundant hierarchical pores in the final products. The obtained HPC exhibits a high specific surface area of 1660 m2 g−1 and shows high specific capacitances of up to 278 F g−1 in 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. The symmetrical device also demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of up to 226 F g−1 and ultrahigh initial capacitance retention of 98 % after 10,000 cycles of charge/discharge at the current density of 10 A g−1. The porous carbon produced via this green chemical activation route demonstrates great potential as electrode materials in supercapacitor.
