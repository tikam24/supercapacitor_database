The fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles have received widespread attention in recent years due to their zero-emission and long mileage. However, the durability of the fuel cell declines rapidly under frequent start and stop and power fluctuation. The fuel efficiency of the power system is affected by the power allocation strategy. For low hydrogen consumption and fuel cell durability, an energy management strategy based on the game theory is proposed in this paper, which considers the controller and the future driving condition as both sides of the game to enhance the operational stability in complex driving conditions. The interval forecast for driving conditions is realized by introducing the Markov chain method. To obtain the optimal power allocation strategy in the speed forecast window, it is reasonable to integrate the co-evolutionary algorithm with the game model to leverage its superior ability in solving the constrained min-max problem. In order to verify the robustness and the economic performance of this method, the comparison with other methods is conducted in the typical urban, highway and mixed driving conditions. What is more, the fuel cell degradation and operational stability of four energy management strategies are evaluated by the fuel cell degradation model. The results show that the proposed method can reduce hydrogen consumption by more than 6.82% and avoid fuel cell degradation caused by frequent start and stop and power fluctuation compared with other real-time strategies.
