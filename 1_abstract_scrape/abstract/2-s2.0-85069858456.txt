All-solid-state flexible asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are developed by utilization of graphene nanoribbon (GNR)/Co0.85Se composites as the positive electrode, GNR/Bi2Se3 composites as the negative electrode, and polymer-grafted-graphene oxide membranes as solid-state electrolytes. Both GNR/Co0.85Se and GNR/Bi2Se3 composite electrodes are developed by a facile one-step hydrothermal growth method from graphene oxide nanoribbons as the nucleation framework. The GNR/Co0.85Se composite electrode exhibits a specific capacity of 76.4 mAh g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and the GNR/Bi2Se3 composite electrode exhibits a specific capacity of 100.2 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. Moreover, the stretchable membrane solid-state electrolytes exhibit superior ionic conductivity of 108.7 mS cm−1. As a result, the flexible ASCs demonstrate an operating voltage of 1.6 V, an energy density of 30.9 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 559 W kg−1, and excellent cycling stability with 89% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles. All these results demonstrate that this study provides a simple, scalable, and efficient approach to fabricate high performance flexible all-solid-state ASCs for energy storage.
