The stable operation and energy balance of islanded microgrid and its traditional energy management strategy are analyzed and a strategy of adaptive power control is proposed for its hybrid battery-supercapacitor storage system. In order to meet the requirements of islanded microgrid for both power quality and load and enhance the system economics over lifetime, the output power of hybrid battery-supercapacitor storage system is reasonably allocated between supercapacitor and battery by its high-level energy management. A PSCAD/EMTDC model of islanded microgrid is built to verify the validity of the proposed strategy, which optimizes the working process of battery, prolongs its service life, cancels the data collection and communication and improves the operational reliability and stability of islanded microgrid.
