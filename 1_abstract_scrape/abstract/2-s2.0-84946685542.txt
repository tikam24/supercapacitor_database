This paper analyses the application of supercapacitors in a standalone off-grid solar PV system. The solar PV system at University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) was tested using a programmable load. The programmable load was used to apply various load values to the system. The results on the effect of using different loads will be analysed and tested with and without a supercapacitor bank. Results show that the supercapacitor can supply peak current demand and preserve battery state of charge during the day. This system can be implemented in rural areas or small industries.
