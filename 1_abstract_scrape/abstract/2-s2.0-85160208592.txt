According to the grid specification, the wind energy conversion System (WECS) shall have low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) capability. In order to improve the performance of LVRT, a coordinated control scheme of LVRT based on supercapacitor energy storage system (SC-ESS) is proposed. In this scheme, the machine-side converter (MSC), grid-side converter (GSC) and SC-ESS controller work together to deal with different low voltage sags (LVS). The positive- and negative-sequences reference of GSC current are obtained to reduce the double fundamental frequency pulsating power under unbalanced conditions. The LVRT control has four operating modes, which can adjust the control structure and improve the control effect. For three different degrees of faults, the feasibility of this LVRT control method is verified by the consequences of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments.
