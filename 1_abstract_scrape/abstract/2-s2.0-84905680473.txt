For a stand-alone application, and to demonstrate role of supercapacitors as a transient power source, a nonlinear control strategy based on the flatness approach is applied to manage energy flows in two systems: the first includes a photovoltaic (PV) source considered as a main source and lead-acid batteries used as storage unit; the second is obtained with the hybridization of the PV source, lead-acid batteries, and supercapacitors. The simulation results are presented and discussed when applying different solar illuminations and consumption profiles. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
