A rapid, simple and cost-effective approach to prepare hierarchical porous carbons (PCs) for supercapacitors is reported by microwave activation of abundant and low-cost waste palm, biochar (BC) and KOH. BCs from waste palm at different carbonization temperatures (300-700 °C), as catalysts and microwave receptors, were used here for the first time to facilitate the conversion of waste palm into hierarchical PCs. As a result, the high-graphitization PC obtained at a BC carbonization temperature of 300 °C (PC-300) possessed a high surface area (1755 m2 g-1), a high pore volume (0.942 cm3 g-1) and a moderate mesoporosity (37.79%). Besides their high-graphitization and hierarchical porous structure, the oxygen doping in PC-300 can also promote the rapid transport of electrolyte ions. The symmetric supercapacitor based on the PC-300 even in PVA/LiCl gel electrolyte exhibited a high specific capacitance of 164.8 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and retained a specific capacitance of 121.3 F g-1 at 10 A g-1, demonstrating a superior rate capacity of 73.6%. Additionally, the PC-300 supercapacitor delivered a high energy density of 14.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 398.9 W kg-1 and maintained an energy density of 10.8 W h kg-1 at a high power density of 8016.5 W kg-1, as well as an excellent cycling stability after 2000 cycles with a capacitance retention of 92.06%.
