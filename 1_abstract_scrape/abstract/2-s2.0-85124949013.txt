In this paper, distributed robust adaptive backstepping control algorithm is developed for the output synchronization of multiple strict feedback systems with dead-zone nonlinearity. No knowledge could be assumed on the dead-zone for the design and implementation of controller and also the unknown system parameters. By combining graph theory with backstepping method, a distributed controller is designed for each agent recursively in order to make its output synchronized with the output of its neighbors, meanwhile, the overall system maintains bounded. It is proven that the output of all agents in the network could be synchronized when we connects the undirected graph, i.e., cooperative output synchronization of the network can be realized. The voltage equalization control of ultra-capacitor is presented as a numerical example to prove the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.
