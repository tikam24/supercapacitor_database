Binary metal oxides have been broadly investigated as a new electrode material for supercapacitor applications owing to their high reversible performance and good conductivity. When compared to a single candidate, the composite's electrochemical performance is considerably improved by the unique mix of pseudo-material and carbon material. Herein, we report a facile and rational synthesis procedure to fabricate a high performance supercapacitor electrode. The prepared NiO/MnO2/ carbon nanotube (CNT) composite has wonderfully stratified flower-like morphology. The positive synergism among components and unique structure has enabled a high specific capacitance of 1320 F/g at 1 A gâˆ’1. After 3000 cycles, the supercapacitor maintains more than 90% of its initial capacitance. Moreover, we also successfully prepared a symmetrical supercapacitor which is made up of two pieces of composite electrode separated with a membrane. The findings highlight that NiO/MnO2/CNT composite is highly desirable for future hybrid energy storage applications.
