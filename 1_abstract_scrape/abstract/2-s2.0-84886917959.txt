Ultracapacitors are characterized by a high specific power and long life cycle, thus they are a very interesting design solution for on-board energy applications such as hybrid-electric vehicles. In this paper the analysis of ultracapacitors ageing in automotive application is discussed to investigate the optimal performances during the whole vehicle lifetime. To study the ageing effects on the ultracapacitors, calendar life tests and power cycling tests have been carried out. The degradation of the performance of the ultracapacitors was analyzed by means of impedance spectroscopy technique. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
