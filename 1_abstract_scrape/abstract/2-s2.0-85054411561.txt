Utilization of rice husk resources, the typical agricultural wastes, has attracted great interest. In this study, rice husk was used as raw material for synthesis of the magnetic nanofibers/porous carbon composites (M-NPCCs) through pyrolysis of pretreated and FeCl3-preloaded rice husk sample for the first time. The effects of hydrothermal and alkali pretreatment and FeCl3 preload on the properties of M-NPCCs obtained were evaluated. The results indicated that smooth and uniform nanofibers could be observed on the outer surfaces of carbon composites from pyrolysis of rice husk samples after combined hydrothermal and alkali pretreatment and FeCl3 preload. Meanwhile, combined hydrothermal and alkali pretreatment has an obvious promoting effect on the formation of pore structure of carbon materials. The XRD patterns, carbon crystallinity structure and magnetic measurement results of the M-NPCCs were characterized, and the results indicated that this carbon material had high graphitization degree. Furthermore, the mechanism of pretreatment and FeCl3 preload of rice husk sample on the synthesis of M-NPCCs was also explored in depth. The M-NPCCs obtained by the method have great potential for application in supercapacitor, which exhibited high charge storage capacity, excellent rate performance and outstanding stability and durability.
