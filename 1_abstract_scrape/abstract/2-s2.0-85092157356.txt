Environmentally friendly energy sources alternatives to fossil fuels such as solar and wind are strategic for meeting the needs of an increasingly energy demanding society, despite their periodic/intermittent nature. Thus, urge the development of clean and renewable energy sources such as based on solar energy and water in a cyclic way, by photoinduced water-splitting and regeneration in fuel cells. In this context, energy storage devices such as hybrid supercapacitors become fundamental for realization of a sustainable society. In this review, the early discovery and recent advances concerning synthetic strategies, hierarchical structures, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) catalytic performances of nickel-vanadium double hydroxides (NiV-LDHs) based nanomaterials are summarized. A discussion about the role of vanadium ions in HER/OER was also included, highlighting the recent progress in theoretical calculations in this field. Finally, some hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials based on NiV-LDHs are described, including the strategies to circumvent the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction during charge-discharge of those energy storage devices. In short, catalysts for HER/OER and hybrid supercapacitor electrode materials based on NiV-LDHs were reviewed considering their key multifunctional role in the way to a more sustainable society.
