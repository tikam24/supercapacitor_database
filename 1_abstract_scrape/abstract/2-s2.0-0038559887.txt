The nanophase MnO2 was synthesized by solid-phase reaction as electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitor and the MnO2 electrode was tested by cyclic voltammetry(CV), electrochemical impedance spectrometry (EIS) and constant charge-discharge curves. The result shows that MnO2 electrode has good performance of faradic pseudocapacitance in lmol·L-1 KOH between -0. 1 and 0. 6 V(vs Hg/HgO). The electrode can provide a specific capacitance of 240. 25 to 325. 21 F·g-1 at different current densities. After 5000 cycles of constant charge-discharge the capacitance reduces no more than 10%.
