Formation of transition metal oxide doped nanostructures with high surface area is highly desirable for electrochemical applications. Here, ultrafine MnO 2 nanoparticles dispersed nitrogen-doped porous carbons (MnO 2 /N-C) was synthesized using chitosan and Mn(NO 3 ) 2 as precursor. The MnO 2 /N-C demonstrates outstanding supercapacitive properties and great potential for real-world applications. The capacitance of the nanocomposite is as high as 340.1 F g -1 (1 A g -1 ) in 1 M KOH solution. The MnO 2 /N-C also shows high-rate capability, retaining a specific capacitance of 270.2 F g -1 at 10 A g -1 . The large specific surface area and highly-dispersed MnO 2 combined with its unique structural advantages, make it a very promising electrode material for energy storage devices.
