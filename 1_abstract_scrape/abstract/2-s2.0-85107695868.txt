Corresponding to the worldwide contribution of Renewable Energy Storage systems (RESs), an undeniable surge has been seen in the marine electrical system as well. Meanwhile, To cope with the intermittency of RESs; battery energy storage systems are being embedded in the systems. However, they suffer from low energy density, short life, increased space requirements, and elevated cost. To address these challenges, an ultra-capacitor is recommended to be equipped with battery energy storage. Thus, the integrated system can achieve better dynamic performance by employing comparatively reduced space and higher energy. In order to harness these benefits from this integrated system, optimum management of power generation and consumption must be achieved. This requires the development of an accurate and robust control algorithm. In this paper, an effective control technique is proposed, in which a PV fed Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) works in integration with a conventional diesel generator for feeding marine loads mainly lighting and heating. Furthermore, Various possible modes of operation to attain optimum performance such as, considering PV power generation discrepancy, are discussed and validated with simulation results. Whereas, some of the proposed control scheme's main contributions are, Maximum power extraction from PV panels, unity power factor operation of the utility grid, and increased reliability for the connected loads.
