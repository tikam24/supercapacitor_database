Energy storage has a key role in the penetration of renewable energy sources. Supercapacitors represent a new form of energy harvesters and their characteristics such as high power density, fast charge/discharge response, and long life cycle allow to use them for renewable energy applications. In this paper, we compare several models of supercapacitors using Matlab/Simulink environment and we assess their behaviors mainly in terms of charge/discharge cycles. Finally, we propose a first interface for the integration of a supercapacitor bank in the microgrid recently proposed for the integration of a novel power sharing model in the framework of the energy communities.
