There is a need to discover an increasing number of new, clean, and renewable materials and devices to ease the tension caused by environmental changes and energy problems. A supercapacitor (SC), also known as an electrochemical capacitor, is a new energy device that has prominent storage properties owing to its rapid surface redox reactions. Further, it has advantages such as higher energy density, longer cycle life, and larger surface area. The performance of a SC largely depends on the properties of its electrode materials, especially graphene. With a distinguished structure and excellent physicochemical properties, graphene has great application potential in the field of SCs. Recent research in the synthesis and application of porous electrode graphene materials in SCs are reviewed in the following.
