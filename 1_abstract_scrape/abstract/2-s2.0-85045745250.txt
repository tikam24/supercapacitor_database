Nanostructures have drawn great attentions for functional device applications. Among the various techniques developed for fabricating arrayed nanostructures of functional materials, nanostructuring technique with porous anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membrane as templates becomes more attractive owing to the superior geometrical characteristics and low-cost preparation process. In this mini review, we summarize our recent progress about functional nanostructuring based on perfectly-ordered AAO membrane to prepare perfectly-ordered nanostructure arrays of functional materials toward constructing high-performance energy conversion and storage devices. By employing the perfectly-ordered AAO membrane as templates, arrayed nanostructures in the form of nanodot, nanorod, nanotube and nanopore have been synthesized over a large area. These as-obtained nanostructure arrays have large specific surface area, high regularity, large-scale implementation, and tunable nanoscale features. All these advanced features enable them to be of great advantage for the performance improvement of energy conversion and storage devices, including photoelectrochemical water splitting cells, supercapacitors, and batteries, etc. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
