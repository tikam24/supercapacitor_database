Well adherent spray deposited electrode material with excellent physical and electrochemical properties are fascinating for researchers across the world for their application in the energy storage field. In this context, cluster like vanadium oxide (V2O5) deposited on the stainless steel substrate by using spray pyrolysis technique. For this deposition, the solution concentration of Ammonium metavanadate precursor was varied from 10 mM to 100 mM. The precursor solution 40 ml was sprayed at a fixed deposition temperature of 673 K by the automatic spray pyrolysis technique. The influence of the precursor concentration on the structural, morphological, and electrochemical characteristics of the deposited electrode material was studied by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The morphology of the obtained spray pyrolyzed V2O5 samples show spikes like grains. The V2O5 deposited samples show excellent supercapacitive properties, among that 70 mM precursor exhibits the absolute supercapacitive performance with the highest value of specific capacitance is 315 F/g at scan rate 5 mV/s, specific energy density 0.43 Wh/kg, specific power density 283.3 kW/kg and efficiency is 86.97%. Moreover, stability study shows 71% capacitance retention over 2000 cycles in 1 M KCl electrolyte. These results represent that the V2O5 electrode is the suitable electrode material and would be the most appropriate candidate for future energy storage applications.
