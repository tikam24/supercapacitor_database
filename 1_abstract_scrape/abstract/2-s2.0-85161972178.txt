The rapid development of flexible energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors, requires the creation of appropriate electrode materials with high capacitance and cycling stability. In this work, we propose a new method for the synthesis of hybrid electrode materials by depositing transition metal oxides on carbon fabrics using non-stationary electrolysis. An amorphous deposit with inclusions of Mo4O11, MoO3, MoO2, Mo8O23, Mo9O26, V2O5, and MnO2 nanocrystals was obtained on the carbon surface. The hybrid was used as a binder-free electrode and had a capacitance of 498 mF∙cm–2 in 2 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 4 mA∙cm–2. This value is comparable to or even higher than the values reported for similar materials. A long-term test of the two-electrode system showed a capacitance retention of 62% over 10,000 cycles. The power density and energy density of the hybrid electrode are 15∙10–4 W∙cm–2 and 6∙10–7 Wh∙cm–2, respectively. The synthesized metal oxide/carbon hybrids are promising electrode materials for symmetrical supercapacitors with alkaline electrolytes.
