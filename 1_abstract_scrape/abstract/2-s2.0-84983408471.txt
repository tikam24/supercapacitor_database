Supercapacitors are extremely versatile energy storage devices that store energy by the electrostatic separation of charged species at the interface between a solid electrode and an electrolyte forming the so called electric double layer (EDL). Although the supercapacitor market is rapidly growing, the continuous claim to improved energy and power storage pushes a lot of efforts to the synthesis of carbon based materials with tailored properties. Moreover, powering mobile/personal small-scale devices with on-chip integrated micro-supercapacitors is still a challenge that can only be addressed by the development of a scalable technique for the deposition and patterning of highly porous carbons in the form of thin films. Here the deposition of nanostructured carbon (ns-C) thin films and nanocomposites by Supersonic Cluster Beam Deposition (SCBD) is reported to be a viable route toward the fabrication of miniaturized and/or integrated electrochemical energy storage devices.
