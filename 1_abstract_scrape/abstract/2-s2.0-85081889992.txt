Various new nanohybrids consisting of 2,2-bis(ethylferrocenyl)propane [B-(EtFc)-Pr] as both battery-type electrode material and good candidate for intercalation between graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, and GO as a substrate were prepared. According to the electrochemical experiments data, GO-B-(EtFc)-Pr3 nanohybrid with the weight ratio of GO:B-(EtFc)-Pr (1:3) was regarded as the optimum nanohybrid with excellent electrochemical performance. Then, GO-B-(EtFc)-Pr3/PANI nanocomposites with different amounts of polyaniline (PANI) were prepared and investigated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge measurement (GCD), Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping, and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. Among different nanocomposites, GO-B-(EtFc)-Pr3/PANI0.5 exhibits a high charge storage capacity of 429 mAh gâˆ’1 and excellent cycle life with charge storage capacity retention of 89.13% after 3000 CV cycles.
