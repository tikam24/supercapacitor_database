Four different types of porous carbon nanofibers (CNFs), plain, hollow, multi-channel (MC), and hollowed MC, were fabricated using coaxial electrospinning and thermal treatment for supercapacitor electrodes. The influence of the porosity on the specific surface area (SSA), pore volumes, and electrochemical propoerties of porous CNFs were investigated. The comparisons of their properties are a valuable work with same methods, becuase electrochemical performances are depending on the measurement conditions. Among them, the hollowed MC CNF structure was indicated the highest SSA and pore volumes. In addition, their hybrid structures with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were analyzed in therms of their porosity, SSA, and electrochemical properties for supercapacitors (specific capacitance and long-term cycling). These hybrid structures can improve overall porosity and electrochemical propoerties due to the extra mesoporous structures formed by entangling MWCNTs. In conclusion, these porous CNFs have a promising potential for various fields which need high porosity and SSA, and can be used as the platforms for catalysts, sensors, or energy devices.
