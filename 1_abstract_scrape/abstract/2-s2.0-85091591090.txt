The properties of electrode materials are greatly determined by their structures including surface area, pore size distribution and conductivity. Aiming for the advanced structure, we successfully design and develop a core-shell nanocomposite of polydopamine based N-doped carbon spheres (NCSs) and CoxNi1-x(OH)2 by a fast and simple two-step method. Firstly, regular NCSs are directly derived from carbonization of polydopamine, which offer conductive cores for fast electronic transport. Then, flower-like shells consisting of interlinked CoxNi1-x(OH)2 ultrathin nanosheets are vertically and evenly grafted on the surface of NCSs substrate by a chemical bath deposition method, which is faster and more suitable for large-scale production than hydrothermal synthesis. To get the homogeneous bimetal hydroxides CoxNi1-x(OH)2 through this rapid precipitation process, the influences of Co doping content on the morphologies, structure and capacitance properties of hybrids are further analyzed. Results show that the obtained NCSs@CoxNi1-x(OH)2 nanocomposite with small amount of Co doping exhibits impressively enhanced specific capacitance (2065 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and rate capability (1429 F g−1 even at 45 A g−1) than NCSs@Ni(OH)2. The outstanding capacitive performance of this kind of nanocomposite is due to its large surface area, optimum porous size distribution and retained flower-like morphology, especially the high electrical conductivity originating from conductive skeleton of NCSs and Co ion doping. Furthermore, using the optimized NCSs@CoxNi1-x(OH)2 and activated carbon as a positive and negative electrode, the as-prepared energy storage device achieves higher energy (16–37 Wh kg−1) and power density (8−0.4 kW kg−1), along with satisfactory cycling stability.
