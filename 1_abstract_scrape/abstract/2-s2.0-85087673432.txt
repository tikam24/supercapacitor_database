In this study, a series of NiCoxFe1-x-PBA/NF (nickel foam) electrodes were successfully fabricated with different ratios of Co and Fe through an in situ chemical etching process. Their structures and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Remarkably, this novel series of composites exhibit excellent supercapacitor performance. Among them, the NiCo-PBA/NF electrode exhibits the best electrochemical performance with an area specific capacitance of 2242 mF cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2 in 3 M KOH solution and good cycling stability. Furthermore, asymmetric supercapacitor cells with NiCo-PBA/NF as the positive electrode and active carbon coated on the nickel foam as the negative electrode deliver a very high energy density of 39.4 W h kg-1 and a high power density of 4003 W kg-1, which far exceed those of other devices reported previously. This work highlights the designing strategy of such composite materials with an optimized synergistic effect, which greatly promotes the supercapacitor development. This journal is
