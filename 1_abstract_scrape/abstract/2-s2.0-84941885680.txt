In the present study, a simple, inexpensive and novel synthetic procedure was used for the preparation of Silver-Polyaniline/Graphene [Ag-PANI/Gr] nanocomposite as superior supercapacitor electrode material. The probable interaction of Ag with PANI and Gr were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, UV-visible, and Raman spectroscopies. The formation of Ag nanoparticles in the PANI coated Gr sheets were confirmed by morphological study. The maximum specific capacitance of 591 F/g has been achieved for the nanocomposite at 5 mV/s scan rate in 1 M KCl electrolyte. The nanocomposite also attained superior energy as well as power density. Here, both Ag nanoparticles and Gr take part for the increment of specific capacitance of the nanocomposite. The nanocomposite showed enhanced electrical conductivity of 5.17 S/cm and also reached nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. The higher thermal stability also observed for the nanocomposite. Depending on those superior properties the Ag-PANI/Gr nanocomposite can be used for supercapacitor electrode material.
