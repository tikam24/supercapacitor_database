Nickel compounds have been particularly explored for their excellent electrochemical properties. Attention is now placed on adding conductive materials to improve its electrochemical performance. Here, Ag/NiO composites are prepared from AgNiO2nanoparticle precursors through one galvanostatic charge/discharge cycle. The obtained Ag and NiO are grown epitaxially, producing large contact area, increasing the stability of the structure and decreasing the resistance between them. When Ag/NiO composites are employed as electrode materials and performed in the electrochemical experiments, they deliver a high capacity of 1166 C g−1at 2 A g−1, which is larger than that of the simple mixture of Ag and NiO. An excellent cyclic stability is also testified. Only 10% of the specific capacity lost is tested after 2000 galvanostatic charge/discharge cycles. Our study suggests that Ag/NiO composites with epitaxial-growth structure are an excellent candidate for high-performance hybrid asymmetric supercapacitors.
