This paper addresses the management of a Fuel Cell (FC) â€“ Supercapacitor (SC) hybrid power source for Electric Vehicle (EV) applications. The FC presents the main energy source and it is sustained with SCs energy storages in order to increase the FC source lifespan by mitigating harmful current transients. For this aim, the reported work proposes a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for an efficient power management of the studied hybrid power system. The key idea of the proposed approach is to incorporate the benefit of the GWO in terms of fast optimization and convergence accuracy, in order to achieve efficient energy sources exploitation and provide the desired driving performances. Simulations and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed management algorithm.
