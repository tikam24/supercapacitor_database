Currently, there is an increasing demand for portable and wearable electronics. This has necessitated the development of stretchable energy storage devices, while simultaneously maintaining performance. Hence, the electrodes and electrolyte materials used in stretchable supercapacitors should be robust under severe mechanical deformation. Polymers are widely used in the fabrication of stretchable supercapacitors. It is not only crucial to choose good polymer candidates with inherent advantages, but it is also important to design suitable polymer materials for both electrodes and electrolytes. This mini-review explains the concept of stretchable supercapacitors, the theoretical background of polymer-based electrodes for supercapacitors, and the fabrication strategies of stretchable electrodes for supercapacitors. Finally, we present the drawbacks and areas that still need to be developed.
