Honeycomb-like nickel-manganese sulfide (NMS) composite nanosheets have been grown on carbon cloth. The optimized NMS composite exhibits a high specific capacity of 205 mAh g−1 at 2 mA cm−2 with good rate capability of 78% at 20 mA cm−2. The hybrid supercapacitor based on NMS composite obtains a maximum energy density of 27.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 505.2 W kg−1 with excellent cycling stability of 75.3% over 6000 cycles at 8 mA cm−2.
