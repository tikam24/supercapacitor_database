Single layered MoS2/graphene nanosheets embedded in activated carbon nanofibers (MoS2@G/AC) are fabricated through an electrospinning process followed by carbonization and KOH activation. Characterization results demonstrate that the single layers of 2D MoS2 and graphene nanosheets were dispersed highly uniform in the activated carbon nanofibers which present a diameter approximately 100 nm and a specific surface area of 850.2 m2 g−1. It is found that the dosage of MoS2 in activated carbon nanofibers affects their electrochemical properties. Thereinto, the 0.5-MoS2@G/AC nanofibers as electrode material for supercapacitor show a high specific capacitance of 334 F g−1 and 246.3 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 and 10 A g−1, respectively, in 3 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The capacitance retention of the 0.5-MoS2@G/AC nanofibers is 83.8% after 5000 cycles. Electrochemical tests show good specific capacitance and stability for the MoS2@G/AC nanofibers due to the high specific surface area, suitable pore structure, and the synergy between the three different components.
