The synthesis of an efficient and economically viable supercapacitor material with a large areal capacitance for miniaturized consumer electronics is still a major challenge. Herein, densely packed 3D flower-like NiCo 2 O 4 @NiMoO 4 /reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites on Ni foam which can be directly utilized as a supercapacitor material are demonstrated. The overall electrochemical performance can be significantly enhanced by an increase in the packing density of 3D flower-like structure, highly porous spatial construction, and the synergistic effects of the three materials, which generates a larger areal capacitance of 9.41 F cm −2 and a superior cycling stability with 75% areal capacitance retention after 2000 charge–discharge cycles. This simple and low-cost supercapacitor material may have potential applications in energy storage devices.
