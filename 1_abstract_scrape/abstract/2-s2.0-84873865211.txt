Nanocrystalline VN was synthesized from the melamine reduction of V2O5 xerogel under a N2 atmosphere for supercapacitors. The structure, particle size and surface elemental composition are characterized by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical characterizations were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) test and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The XRD result indicates that the nanocrystalline VN belongs to the cubic crystal system. TEM images show the disperse nanocrystalline VN particles. FTIR and XPS results reveal that change in the oxide on nanocrystalline VN surface was the main factor leading to the electrochemical cycling-induced capacitance loss. In addition, the electrochemical results show that the nanocrystalline VN displayed exciting supercapacitive behaviors. A maximum specific capacitance of 413 F g-1 was recorded at the current density of 1 A g-1. A respectable rate capability was exhibited by the nanocrystalline VN electrode, showing about 88% of its maximal capacitance at a current load of 4 A g-1. The experimental results indicate that the nanocrystalline VN is promising electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. Â© 2013 by ESG.
