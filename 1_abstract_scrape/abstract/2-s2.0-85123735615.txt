The growing demand of portable as well as wearable electric devices necessitates the fabrication of energy storage devices (ESDs) in the form of flexible and wearable without sacrificing too much of their performance. In this work, a simple and efficient approach with one step recovery process of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) from discarded printed circuit boards is reported. Further, the as-recovered CuO NPs were used as electrode material for supercapacitors (SCs). Many spectral as well as analytical techniques were used to confirm the formation of CuO NPs. The electrochemical techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge measurements (GCD) were performed to measure the specific capacitance (Csp) of the as-fabricated electrode. As a result, the as-fabricated CuO NPs electrode delivered Csp of 408 F gâˆ’1 and capacitance retention of 93.1% after 3000 GCD cycles. The enhanced capacitive performance of the as-recovered CuO NPs mainly depends on the distinct structural features and abundant redox sites with high electrical conductivity. Hence, the proposed work is found to be an excellent method to recover CuO NPs and the fabrication of SCs.
