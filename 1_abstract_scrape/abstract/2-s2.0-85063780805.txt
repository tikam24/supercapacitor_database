In this study, a novel poly (acrylic acid-aniline)-grafted MCC conducting composite were synthesized by a simple two-step method. The radical copolymerization of MCC and AA was based on Electron Beam Irradiation Grafting. The synthesized MCC-AA matrix was further grafted with aniline through oxidative-radical copolymerization using APS in acidic media. The resultant MCC-PANI was characterized using X-ray diffraction, thermo gravimetric analysis, and electrical conductivity. It was found that acrylic acid was successfully grafted onto cellulose, and polyaniline was successfully coupled to modified cellulose. and the thermal stability of modified polyaniline composite cellulose was improved. The electrochemical activity of the composites was the best while the mass ratio of aniline monomer to MCC is 3:1. These novel nanorods are desirable for applications in supercapacitor devices.
