Dealloying, a famous ancient etching technique, has recently been revealed to produce transition metal oxides as well as nanoporous metals. In this paper, CuO, as a kind of transition metal oxides and a promising supercapacitor electrode material, is fabricated by a one-step dealloying method followed by spontaneous oxidation. It is found that CuO nanoplates/brass foil electrode materials with unique nanostructure and good flexibility are synthesized by dealloying a brass foil in oxygen-rich 10 % HNO3 solution at 40 °C for 20 min. The electrode exhibits excellent specific capacitance value of 308.6 mF cm−2 (934.2 F g−1) at 2 mA cm−2 and good cycling stability after 5000 cycles with the capacitance retention of 87.8 %. The binder-free CuO@brass foil electrode, with high electrochemical performance and cost effectiveness, is highly promising as a flexible electrode material in supercapacitors.
