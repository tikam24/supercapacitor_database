The electrospun carbon nanofibers (ECNFs) with the advantages of facile preparation method, excellent electrical conductivity and ease compounding are expected to be excellent electrode materials for supercapacitors. However, the tiny specific surface area and low specific capacitance prevent the further development of carbon nanofibers. In this work, the porous coal-based carbon nanofibers (PCCNFs-2) are fabricated via a facile dual-template method, which can be directly employed as a flexible electrode material for supercapacitors without the addition of any conductive agents and binders. As a result, the flexible self-supporting electrode (PCCNFs-2) achieves a specific capacitance of 262.0 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, excellent rate performance (81.0 % capacitance retention at a current density of 20 A g−1) and excellent cycling stability (after 10,000 cycles, 124 % capacity retention at 2 A g−1). Furthermore, the aqueous symmetrical supercapacitors (SCs) assembled with melamine foam as the storage electrolyte at an operating voltage of 1.2 V achieved an energy density of 18.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 150.5 W kg−1. The effective construction of this porous carbon nanofiber assures the structural integrity and achieves excellent electrochemical performance of the electrode material, which develops a new strategy for efficient utilization of porous coal-based carbon nanofibers in supercapacitors.
