An analysis of available and promising developments is carried out in the field of power elements based on Î² decay. The possible fabrication technologies are described, and the efficiency of the power sources manufactured with them is calculated. The possibility of designing a self-charging supercapacitor based on carbon nanotubes is considered with the use of 63Ni and 14C isotopes, and theoretical calculation confirms the promising nature of this line of research.
