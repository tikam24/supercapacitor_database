The new TrueData product line from FuelCon includes a variety of analytical tools and accessories to assist investigators in the field of fuel cell, battery, supercapacitor, or general electrochemistry research. The launch complements FuelCon's Evaluator® C050 and the TrueData-EIS® impedance analyzer. The TrueData accessories are specifically designed with a standard digital interface to operate within FuelCon's Evaluator series test stations using its FuelWork software, as a standalone device or within custom-build test equipment with compatible interfaces. The firm designed the accessories to operate specifically with LabView-VI for easy system integration. The new product line currently consists of the EIS, Load, CVM, and CDD. TrueData-EIS performs electrochemical impedance measurements within a frequency spectrum and current capability that is ideal for fuel cell and battery research. TrueData-Load is a newly developed electronic load with a unique modular design, allowing the load to be easily sized for any battery or fuel cell application. Under TrueData-CVM, FuelCon offers a new device to measure individual cell voltages within fuel cell stacks at rapid sampling rates. A compact housing allows the device to be positioned near the stack, reducing cable length and signal distortion.
