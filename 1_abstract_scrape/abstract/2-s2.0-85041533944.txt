In the present investigation, nickel sulphide nanostructures (M, H and MH) have been synthesized through three different methods viz., microwave, hydrothermal and a combination of microwave and hydrothermal. The effect of preparation method on nickel sulphide nanostructures has been investigated through structural, morphological and electrochemical studies. XRD patterns reveal orthorhombic phase of Ni 9 S 8 in the case of M while H and MH exhibit hexagonal NiS structure. SEM micrographs of M, H and MH indicate the nanoflake, spherical and layered structure, respectively. The electrochemical studies have been carried out via cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge studies and electrochemical impedance analysis. MH provides the largest specific capacitance of 964 F g −1 (from galvanostatic charge-discharge studies at a specific current of 1 A g −1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte) combined with a charge transfer resistance of 0.6 Ω. The MH electrode could provide undiminished capacity retention after 2000 cycles. A symmetric supercapacitor device provides maximum specific capacitance of 119 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 with energy and power densities of 16.5 W h kg −1 and 250 W kg −1 . These results imply that MH nanostructure is well suited as a supercapacitor electrode material.
