In this paper, the ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays (MCNAs), Nickel–Boron (Ni–B) amorphous alloys, and amorphous Ni–B/MCNAs composite for supercapacitor material have been successfully fabricated by a combination of templating method and chemical reduction process. The porous structure and large specific surface area (1270 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) of MCNAs favor the utilization of the active material Ni–B amorphous alloys and interfacial charge transport, and provide short diffusion paths for ions. X-ray diffraction, small-angle X-ray scattering, inductively coupled plasma. Transmission electron micrographs and selected area electronic diffraction were taken to characterize the structure of the ordered MCNAs, Ni–B amorphous alloy, and amorphous Ni–B/MCNAs. Electrochemical properties are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that the amorphous Ni–B/MCNAs display superior capacitive performance (733 F g<sup>−1</sup>) over Ni–B amorphous alloys (562 F g<sup>−1</sup>) at a scan rate of 5 mV s<sup>−1</sup> and a good cycling stability after 1000 cycles.
