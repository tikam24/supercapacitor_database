Defect engineering on nickel sulfurs is an effective method to promote electrochemical properties in terms of generating active sites and improving the intrinsic conductivity. In this work, a high-performance honeycomb-like Ni3S4−x is prepared by combined hydrothermal and solution reduction method. The Ni3S4−x exhibits enhanced charge carrier transport rate and electrical conductivity benefited from the existence of rich defects and sulfur vacancies. The Ni3S4−x electrode displays satisfying specific capacitance (1715 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), and the configured Ni3S4−x//AC supercapacitor possesses exemplary specific capacitance (1385 F g−1 at 0.1 A g−1) as well as superior cycling performance (nearly no capacitance decay after 15000 cycles). Notably, the assembled aqueous Ni3S4−x//Zn battery also shows superior electrochemical properties in terms of high capacity (245.6 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1) and cycling durability (89.4% retention after 1000 cycles). These outstanding electrochemical performances demonstrate that the generation of defects and sulfur vacancies in nickel sulfides is helpful for further development of advanced materials for aqueous energy storage device applications.
