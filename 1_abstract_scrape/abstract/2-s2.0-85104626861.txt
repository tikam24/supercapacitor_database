In order to increase the specific capacity of supercapacitor of electrode and reduce synthesis time, the accordion-like two-dimensional MXene titanium carbide Ti3C2 is fabricated by microwave-assisted selective etching from hexagonal Ti3AlC2. Ti3C2 can be spaced up to 900 nm apart with lithium fluoride and concentrated hydrochloric acid as etchant and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide as intercalator. The mechanism of the increase in specific capacity caused by structural change from Ti3AlC2 to Ti3C2 is described by means of scanning electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscope and molecular model established by Materials Studio material simulation software. The electrochemical properties of Ti3C2 electrodes for supercapacitor are tested and analyzed. The specific capacity of the electrode was 120.71 F/g at the current density of 1A/g. Steady Coulombic efficiency above 99.8% is also obtained after long cyclings. This shows good electrochemical performance and provides a new solution for the preparation of high specific capacity supercapacitors.
