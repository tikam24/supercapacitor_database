A simple and outstanding approach is provided to fabricate amorphous structure Ni-Co binary oxide as supercapacitors electrode materials. We can easily obtain porous Ni-Co oxides composite materials via chemical bath deposition and subsequent calcination without any template or complicate operation procedures. The amorphous porous Ni-Co binary oxide exhibits brilliant electrochemical performance: first, the peculiar porous structure can effectively transport electrolytes and shorten the ion diffusion path; second, binary composition and amorphous character introduce more surface defects for redox reactions. It shows a high specific capacitance up to 1607 F g-1 and can be cycled for 2000 cycles with 91% capacitance retention. In addition, the asymmetric supercapacitor delivers superior energy density of 28 W h kg-1, and the maximum power density of 3064 W kg-1 with a high energy density of 10 W h kg-1.
