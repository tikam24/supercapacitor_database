In this work, three dimensional PPy decorated MnCo2O4 urchins on Ni foam are fabricated via a hydrothermal strategy and an electro-polymerization process. The as-synthesized products are utilized as the electrode materials for hybrid capacitors. Due to the synergistic effect of PPy and MnCo2O4, the hybrid electrode exhibits excellent charge transport ability and cycling stability. The as-assembled device presents remarkable electrochemical performance with a high energy density of 0.785 mW h cm−3 at a power density of 7.49 W cm−3 and a maximum power density of 37.49 W cm−3 at an energy density of 0.488 mW h cm−3. The electrode materials reported here might present potential applications in next generation energy storage devices.
