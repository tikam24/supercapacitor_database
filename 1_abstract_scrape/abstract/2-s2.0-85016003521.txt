A novel iron nitride-activated carbon composite was synthesized via hydrothermal and ammonia treatments. The impregnation of mesoporous carbon with an iron precursor under hydrothermal conditions resulted in an outstanding specific capacitance of 507 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and a remarkable rate capability of 72% for the hybrid-based supercapacitor electrode.
