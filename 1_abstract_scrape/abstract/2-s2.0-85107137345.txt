Digitalization and the development of wireless communication technologies, mobile devices and smart systems are a key driver in modern society. While electronic circuits based on semiconductor technologies are widely established in technology, the human brain operates effectively in terms of energy consumption by employing ion- and molecule-based switching processes for performing logic operations and learning processes. Iontronics may play a crucial role to reduce energy consumption in computing and enable the communication of biological systems with artificial device structures. Nanoporous carbons and ion electroadsorption are the basis for novel devices using ion-based electrolytes for logic architectures. The development of smart and autonomous devices also pushes the research interest to multifunctional integrated units, combining different functions to construct logic architectures. Here we present an overview of new multifunctional ion-electroadsorption devices and their role in innovative sensor applications, biomedical systems and future computing architectures.
