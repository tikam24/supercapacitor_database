Hierarchical porous carbon materials with high surface area are facilely prepared by directly carbonizing carex meyeriana without any extra activation procedure. The as-prepared porous carbon samples possess high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas (in the ~ 518–742 m2 g−1 range) and unique hierarchical porous structure containing macropore channels and mesopores and micropores developed in the wall of macropores. These intriguing characteristics make the as-prepared hierarchical porous carbon samples a promising electrode material for supercapacitors. The capacitive performance was measured in the three-electrode system with 6 M KOH electrolyte. The hierarchical porous carbon prepared at the carbonization temperature of 1000 °C presents a high specific capacitance of 178.6 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, a good rate performance (about 65.2% retention ratio at the current density of 20 A g−1), and an excellent cycling stability (no obvious performance fading after 10,000 cycles). In addition, the fabricated two-electrode device achieves an energy density of 4.33 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 5 kW kg−1. These results provide a green and facile method to synthesize the electrode material from biomass for high-performance supercapacitors.
