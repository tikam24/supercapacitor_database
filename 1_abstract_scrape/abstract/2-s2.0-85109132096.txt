The cycling performance of supercapacitors sometimes becomes limited when electrode materials slough off during frequent charge–discharge cycles, due to weak bonding between the active material and the current collector. In this work, a flexible graphite foil substrate was successfully used as the current collector for supercapacitor electrodes. Graphite foil substrates were treated in different ways with different acid concentrations and temperatures before being coated with an active material (NiMoO4/nanographite). The electrode treated with HNO3 (65%) and H2SO4 (95%) in a 1:1 ratio at 24°C gave better electrochemical performance than did electrodes treated in other ways. This electrode had capacitances of 441 and 184 Fg–1 at current densities of 0.5 and 10 Ag-1, respectively, with a good rate capability over the current densities of the other treated electrodes. SEM observation of the electrodes revealed that NiMoO4 with a morphology of nanorods 100–120 nm long was properly accommodated on the graphite surface during the charge–discharge process. It also showed that treatment with high-concentration acid created an appropriately porous and rough surface on the graphite, enhancing the adhesion of NiMoO4/nanographite and boosting the electrochemical performance.
