Engineering novel transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials with three-dimensional (3D) porous nanostructures have demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance in energy storage due to their synergistic special morphological features and conductive metal ions. Herein, hetero-network-based MoS2@Cu2MoS4-210 (MS@CMS-210; obtained at 210 °C) 3D nanoflowers (NFs) and Co-nanoparticles-containing MS@CMS-210 (Co-MS@CMS-210) 3D NFs were prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method without calcination. We used uniform Cu2O nanospheres (NSs) obtained via a co-precipitation method as a template to synthesize the hierarchical MS@CMS-210 3D NFs. The unique MS@CMS-210 3D NF morphology was obtained due to the in situ sulfurization effect of Cu2O NSs at the reaction temperature of 210 °C and further detailed growth process was explored. The electrochemical performances of Cu2O NSs, sulfurized MS@CMS products prepared at the reaction temperatures of 180, 190, 200, and 210 °C, and Co-MS@CMS-210 hetero-network-based electrodes were investigated. The Co-nanoparticles introduced into the optimized MS@CMS-210 3D NFs provided a higher specific surface area of 128.58 m2 g−1, further exhibiting a greater specific capacity (220 mA h g−1 at 1 A g−1) and enhanced cycling stability (~96% retention at 10 A g−1) compared to the other electrodes. The better electrochemical results were obtained due to the developed rich electroactive sites and rapid redox reactions from the rational combination of Co-MS@CMS-210 3D NF morphology and conductive natured TMDC hybrid composite. Additionally, a pouch-type electrochemical hybrid capacitor (Co-MS@CMS-210//activated carbon) device was constructed and it provided maximum energy and power density values of 41.6 W h kg−1 and 6240 W kg−1, respectively, along with greater cycling stability. Finally, several portable electronics such as green/red light-emitting diodes and timer displays were successfully tested to demonstrate the practical utility of the device in the area of energy storage.
