When the power supply or load changes, the traditional control strategy of hybrid energy storage bidirectional DC-DC converter has the shortcomings of low inertia and weak damping, which has a great impact on the frequency and voltage of the system. To solve this problem, an improved adaptive VDG control with inertia damping is proposed, in which different adaptive control strategy is employed according to the working characteristics of the supercapacitor and the battery. The simulation results show that when system is disturbed, the improved control strategy effectively reduces the amplitude of bus voltage fluctuation and recovery time compared with other control strategies, which provides a conducive solution for the safe and stable operation of DC micro-grid hybrid storage system.
