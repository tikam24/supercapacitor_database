Thin, skin-conformal, transparent and stretchable energy devices are ideal for powering future wearable and implantable electronics. However, it is difficult to achieve such "unfeelable" and "invisible" devices with traditional materials and design methodologies because of the challenge of simultaneously achieving high optical transparency, high electrical conductivity and high mechanical stretchability. Here, we report a two-step nanowire growth approach for fabricating gold nanorime mesh conductors, enabling skin-thin, transparent and stretchable supercapacitors. Solution-state oleylamine-capped 2 nm-thin gold nanowires self-assemble into highly transparent nanomeshes, which then serve as templates for growing highly conductive vertically aligned nanowires. This two-step solution-plus-surface nanowire growth strategy leads to elastic gold nanorime mesh conductors with an optical transparency up to 90.3% at 550 nm, a low sheet resistance as low as 1.7 ± 0.8 Ω sq-1, and a stretchability of over 100% strain. Such elastic conductors are successfully used to construct symmetrical supercapacitors that can simultaneously achieve high areal capacitance and high stretchability, demonstrating the potential to power future bio-integratable electronics.
