Lanthanum cerium ferrite nanoparticles has been synthesized for the first time via hydrothermal and co-precipitation method. The structural and morphological study of the nanoparticles have been examined using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The electrochemical study of J1 and J2 electrodes have been examined using three electrode system in 6 M KOH electrolyte using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) and electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS). The highest specific capacitance of 1195 F/g has been obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV/s from hydrothermal synthesis nanomaterial electrode (J2) and long cycling life 92.3% retention after 2000th cycles. Furthermore, the energy density and power density of the J2 electrode at a current density of 5 A/g was 59 Wh/kg and 9234 W/kg, respectively. Hence, the fabricated J2 electrode is a favorable candidate for super-capacitor applications.
