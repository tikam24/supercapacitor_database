Chloroamide precursors generated via a simple two-step ammonolysis reaction of transition metal chloride in the liquid phase at room temperature were heat treated in ammonia at moderate temperature to yield nano-sized VN crystallites. Grain growth inhibited by lowering the synthesis temperature (≈400 °C) yielded agglomerated powders of spherical crystallites of cubic phase of VN with particle sizes as small as 6 nm in diameter. X-ray diffraction, FTIR, mass spectroscopy (MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy assessed the ammonolysis and nitridation reaction of the VCl4-NH3 system. X-ray Rietveld refinement, the BET technique and high-resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) helped assess the crystallographic and microstructural nature of the VN nanocrystals. The surface chemistry and redox reaction leading to the gravimetric pseudo-capacitance value of (≈855 F/g) measured for the VN nanocrystals was determined and validated using FTIR, XPS and cyclic voltammetry analyses.
