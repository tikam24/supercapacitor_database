Single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were dispersed into aqueous solutions without surfactant by functionalizing the SWCNT with carboxyl groups. SWCNT coated electrodes were then prepared from the SWCNT aqueous solutions using drop coating, high voltage electro-spinning (HVES), and electrophoretic deposition (EPD) methods using Ni and SST foils as the current collectors. Optical and scanning electron microscope images were used to evaluate the SWCNT dispersion quality of the various methods. An EPD process was established which reliably produced uniform SWCNT nanoporous networks on Ni and SST foils. The resultant SWCNT coated electrodes were characterized using cyclic voltammetry to evaluate their capacitance. A direct correlation between EPD processing time and capacitance was discovered. The addition of the SWCNT nanoporous network to the SST electrode resulted in an increase in capacitance of 45 times the capacitance of the uncoated SST.
