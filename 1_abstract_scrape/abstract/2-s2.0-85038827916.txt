Free-standing and binder-free flexible electrodes have shown great promise for next-generation energy storage devices. However, improving effective charge collection and transportation of the electrodes is still a great challenge. Here, we design and fabricate a novel hierarchical conductive structure for supercapacitor electrode. The flexible and conductive β-Ni(OH)2/graphene film electrode with alternate layered structure is fabricated by facile filtration, and the novel flexible current collector is applied to these electrodes by screen printing. The integrated electrode exhibits outstanding flexibility and thinness. Based on the hierarchical conductive structure, the graphene as micro current collector in the composite electrode provides conductive pathways for β-Ni(OH)2, and the screen printed current collector enhances the charge collection and transportation for the electrode. As a consequence, the specific capacitance of the all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor employing these electrodes is significantly improved by conductive interconnection. It manifests a high areal capacitance of 61.7 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2, which is 3.7 times higher than that of the device with common assembly. This work provides a simple and effective strategy for developing high-performance supercapacitors.
