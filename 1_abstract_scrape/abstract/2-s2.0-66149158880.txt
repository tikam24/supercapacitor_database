The proceedings contain 9 papers. The topics discussed include: electronic and magnetic properties of carbon-coated lithium iron phosphates; synthesis of Birnessite-type layered manganese oxide and their composites for supercapacitors; the influence of binders on the performances of Ni(OH) 2 positive electrode in supercapacitor; rotating rate dependency of methanol oxidation on a smooth polycrystalline platinum surface; the effect on in-cell measurements from water and methanol transport in direct methanol proton exchange membrane fuel cells; hydrogen production from mill-scale via metal-steam reforming; hybrid supercapacitors with ionic liquid electrolytes; electrochemical properties carbon derived from sol-gel catechol-formaldehyde gels; and ionic liquid based electrolytes for high energy electrochemical storage devices.
