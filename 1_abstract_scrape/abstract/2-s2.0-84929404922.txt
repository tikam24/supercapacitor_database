In this study, irregular cubic phase NiO nanosheets (30.0-100.0 nm in width, 10.0-13.0 nm in thickness) with large specific surface area (120.5 m<sup>2</sup>g<sup>-1</sup>) have been synthesized for both Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors. The superior electrochemical performance including large reversible capacities, high specific capacitance and good cycle stability has been proved: the initial discharge capacity is 1827.7 mAhg<sup>-1</sup> and the reversible capacity is still about 560.0 mAhg<sup>-1</sup> after 50 cycles at 400 mAg<sup>-1</sup>; the specific capacitance is as high as 1092.8 Fg<sup>-1</sup> at 4 Ag<sup>-1</sup> and the specific capacitance retention ratio is about 70.8% after 3000 cycles at 16 Ag<sup>-1</sup>.
