The modern world is highly dependent on portable electronic gadgets, so high-performance energy storage devices are a major demand for human beings. Here, we construct neodymium-doped vanadium pentoxide anchored with reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (rGO/Nd:V2O5) as the electrode material for a high-performance symmetric capacitor device. The prepared electrodes showed pseudocapacitor behaviour and double layer capacitor behaviour, indicating the hybrid nature of the rGO/Nd:V2O5 electrode. Also, the V2O5, Nd:V2O5 and rGO/Nd:V2O5 electrodes show higher capacitance behaviour of 447, 677 and 1122 F/g at 1 A/g and 89 %, 94 % and 98 % cyclic efficiency at the 1000th cycle. However, the rGO/Nd:V2O5 symmetric capacitor device exhibits a higher capacitance value of 218 F/g at 1 A/g and a cyclic efficiency of 82 % at the 10000th cycle. Also, this electrode shows a low charge transfer resistance value of 12.67 Î©. This result shows the prepared rGO/Nd:V2O5 electrode as the high-performance electrode material for the supercapacitor devices.
