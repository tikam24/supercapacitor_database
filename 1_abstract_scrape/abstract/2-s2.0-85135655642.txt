Flexible supercapacitors have several significant advantages that include easy portability, miniatured, robustness besides excellent reliability and wider operating temperature range making them ideally suitable for running numerous automated bio-implantation systems, wearable electronics, cordless sensors, etc. Urge for versatile, independent and self-powered systems have continuously promoted researches for smart materials and designs in the recent past. Besides the electrode materials, the electrolytes have been recognized as a major “performance-determining” component in these EES devices. Among the various electrolytes types, aqueous electrolytes are vastly explored and favor high ionic conductivity, faster ion mobility as well as facile electrochemical activity at the electrode interface. Moreover, they are inexpensive, purely achievable, easily obtainable, and functional with large number of electrode materials and current collectors. However, their usage in current supercapacitors is principally restricted by narrow operating voltage and leakage problems. Nonetheless, low processing and purification costs, eco-friendliness, non-flammability, etc. have highly indulged sincere efforts toward designing novel strategies that may trigger widening of the working voltage window in aqueous electrolytes based supercapacitor devices. The book chapter highlights the fundamental research, as well as provides an insight about the gradual development and latest accomplishments in aqueous electrolyte based flexible supercapacitors.
