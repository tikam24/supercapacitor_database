In energy storage-device it is highly crucial to develop durable electrode materials having high specific capacitance and superior energy density without disturbing its inherent flexibility. Herein, we demonstrate three-dimensional graphene oxide decorated monodispersed hollow urchin γ-MnS (γ-MnS@3DG) via proficient one-step solvothermal method. The designed material delivers a remarkable capacitance of 858 F g-1at 1 A g-1. A flexible solid state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASCs) device assembled using surface activated carbon cloth (CC) decorated with γ-MnS@3DG as positive and three-dimension graphene on carbon cloth (3DG@CC) as negative electrode, (γ-MnS@3DG//3DG). The device delivers 26 Wh kg-1energy density at power density 500 W kg-1@ 1A g-1and retains favorable energy density 17.8 Wh kg-1at an ultrahigh power density of 1500 W kg-1@3 A g-1. This carbon embedded transition-metal sulfide (TMS) based ASC demonstrates eminent mechanical flexibility under rigorous bending states maintaining invariant performance.
