This paper presents the performance investigation of a grid-connected WIND-DFIG system with a static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) by including the supercapacitor energy storage system (SESS) under fault (LLL-G) conditions. During a fault condition, the grid connected WIND-DFIG system requires a quick power exchange between active and reactive powers for stability in the system. A general STATCOM does not have active power exchange between grid-connected WING-DFIG systems; it has only reactive power exchange capability. So, the supercapacitor provides active power exchange capability to STATCOM under any dynamic change in the grid-connected WIND-DFIG system. The entire proposed grid-connected WIND-DFIG system was built and tested for performance under fault conditions with and without STATCOM-SESS in MATLAB/SIMULINK Software.
