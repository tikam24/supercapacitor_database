Rechargeable power management system (RPMS) is significantly necessary to monitor the performance of power storage in biomedical devices. Failure of power storage device due to the battery pack, in a medical device, can entail dire consequences such as respiratory devices defibrillators and severe trembling. During charging and discharging the cell might become overstressed or underutilized, of which former may degrade the cell's lifespan. We applied an active balancing technique to distribute charges uniformly into the cell and thus increasing its efficiency and lifespan. In this technique, cells in the stack are monitored at regular intervals for their state of charge (SOC) and the average charge among them is calculated. The cell having the lowest voltage is charged by the series combination of the rest of the cells, by using switching device through isolation transformer which acts as the charge transferring device. In this research, the amount of charge transferred to the low voltage cell was controlled by controlling the frequency of the switching ranging from 100-500kHz. This RPMS includes modules for data acquisition and data logger by which the history of battery pack can be checked for any possible future breakdown and prediction of available run time for the battery pack. RPMS also features cell temperature monitoring to keep it within its safe limits. In this presentation, we will discuss the circuit simulation results using Multisimâ„¢ and hardware implementation in progress.
