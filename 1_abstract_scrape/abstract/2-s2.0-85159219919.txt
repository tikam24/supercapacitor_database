The influence of deposition current and various electrolytes on the charge storage of Co3O4 electrode material has been studied in the supercapacitor, which opens a new area in green energy storage. The cathodic electrodeposition approach was used to synthesize Co3O4 electrode materials. The XRD, SEM, FTIR, UV–Vis, and contact angle meters were used to study the structural, morphological, optical, and wettability of Co3O4 electrode materials. The influence of the deposition current was observed on crystallite size, morphological structures, and charge storage performance. XRD reveals the cubic polycrystalline structure of Co3O4 materials. SEM elucidates the interconnected porous Co3O4 electrode (PSCE) nanomaterial morphology. The surface area of the PSCE-I3 electrode is 56.224 m2/g with a mesoporous structure. The optical analysis was confirmed by FTIR and UV–Vis spectra. The optimized PSCE-I3 materials show good electrochemical results in 1 M KOH electrolyte, with a maximum specific capacitance efficiency of 833.6 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 2 mVs−1 and a power and energy density of 12.39 kW kg−1 and 158.20 Wh Kg−1, respectively. The PSCE electrode has excellent electrochemical durability, retaining 58% of its capacity after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. Thus, PSCE is a promising candidate material for charge storage hybrid supercapacitor in an aqueous 1 M KOH electrolyte.
