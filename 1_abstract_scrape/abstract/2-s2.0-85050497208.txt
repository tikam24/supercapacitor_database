In this paper, a graphene/nickel-cobalt hydroxide ternary hydrogel (G-Ni-Co) with superior electrochemical performances was prepared by a simple hydrothermal method using Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and graphene oxide as the starting materials. The mass fraction and the pH value of the reaction system were optimized. The prepared G-Ni-Co was assembled into a symmetric supercapacitor and its electrochemical performance was estimated. In a symmetric supercapacitor, the specific capacitance of G-Ni-Co is 551.3 F g−1 at the scan rate of 10 mV s−1 and 646.1 F g−1 at the current density of 0.5 A g−1, respectively. The specific capacitance still retains 70.8% after 5000 cycles at the scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The energy density reaches 108.6 W h kg−1 at a power density of 550.0 W kg−1 and remains 72.4 W h kg−1 at 7600.0 W kg−1, respectively.
