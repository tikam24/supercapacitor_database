We report on the fabrication of a robust hybrid film containing MnO 2 for achieving large areal capacitances. An agarose gel, as an ion-permeable and elastic layer coated on a current collector, plays a key role in stabilizing the deposited pseudocapacitive MnO2. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data indicate that the hybrid electrode is capable of exhibiting a high areal capacitance up to 52.55 mF cm-2, with its superior structural integrity and adhesiveness to the current collector being maintained, even at a high MnO2 loading.
