Because of their low synthesis cost, large specific surface area, and good energy storage performance, microporous metal-based composites have been widely used in supercapacitors and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Flower-like Ni foam@ (@, coating) NCo2O4@Ni(OH)2/NiOOH (NF@NCO@NOH) composites were synthesized through a simple solvent-controlled method and following an electrochemical deposition process. The as-synthesized composites benefit from high specific area, a hierarchical porous structure, and the synergistic effect of Ni and Co, showing a high area-specific capacitance of 23.75 F cm−2 at a continuous current of 5 mA cm−2. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits an energy density of 125 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 6.24 kW kg−1. Furthermore, 84.1% of the capacity was retained after 10,000 cycles, suggesting the sample has excellent electrochemical stability. Moreover, an overpotential of 162 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 95 mV dec−1 were obtained in the HER measurement, indicating that the as-synthesized flower-like electrode material possesses potential applications in the HER.
