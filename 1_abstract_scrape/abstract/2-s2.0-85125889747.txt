Herein, the electrochemical performance of nanocomposite comprised of TiO2 nanoparticles and sodium polyacrylate-derived carbon dots (CDs) was investigated in H2SO4 electrolyte. The specific capacitance of 5% w/w CDs-containing TiO2 electrode in 1 M H2SO4 demonstrated a significant enhancement of 237%, compared to pristine TiO2. Interestingly, when added to the electrolyte, the specific capacitance was further increased by 292% or as high as 643 mF cm−2. As a result, the addition of CDs in both electrode and electrolyte produced overall improvement of 1,261% through favorably synergistic effects of lessening the series resistance, enhancing surface wettability, diffusion-controlled contribution, and pathways for ion diffusion. These findings are confirmed by thorough electrochemical analysis and data fitting. To the best of our knowledge, this supercapacitor gave the highest areal capacitance value among prior reports of TiO2-based supercapacitors containing H2SO4 electrolytes. Furthermore, it also delivered a high areal energy density of 24.3 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 187.5 μW cm−2 and extraordinary cycling stability of 98.4% capacitance retention after 5,000 cycles. Our work proved that the utilization of CDs as pseudocapacitance promoters and ion facilitators can significantly improve the supercapacitor performance. This strategy will be an innovative way to develop energy storage devices with high performance, excellent stability, simple manufacturing process, and low production cost for practical applications.
