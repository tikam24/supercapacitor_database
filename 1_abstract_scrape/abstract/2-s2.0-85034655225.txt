This paper proposes the study of the thermal management system of an energy storage system centered on lithium-ion capacitor (LiC). The investigated system is a LiC module made of 12 cells. A proposed passive thermal strategy has been designed in a 3D model using COMSOL Multiphysics. The strategy consists of integrating different cooling strategies, i.e phase-change materials (PCMs) and liquid-cooling in the LiC module. Initial results showed that with the cooling-plate strategy, the module temperature stays constantly at an optimal temperature of 20Â°C but the solution is found bulky and costly. On the other hand, with the PCM strategy, the temperature is a bit above the optimal operating temperature after a simulation of 3500s but the solution is less complex. Therefore, the idea of this study is to find an optimal thermal solution comprising a liquid cooling method and PCMs that needs to be investigated.
