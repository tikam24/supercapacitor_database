Asymmetric supercapacitors assembled with pseudocapacitive and double-layer capacitive electrodes have a wide potential window, high energy density and long cycle life. Herein, flower-like zinc-nickel sulfide (Zn-Ni-S) nanosheets have been synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal method. Due to the distinctive nanosheet structure with a large number of active sites which enhance the electron transfer and ion diffusion rate, the Zn-Ni-S electrode shows a high specific capacity of 246.7 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and good rate performance. In addition, pitaya mesocarp-based carbon nanosheets (PMCNs) with a large surface area and porous structure have been prepared under a one-step activation and nitrogen doping process, and exhibit a large specific capacitance of 227 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1. Benefitting from the above, the novel asymmetric supercapacitor based on Zn-Ni-S positive and PMCN negative electrodes exhibits a wide operating voltage of 1.65 V, high specific density of 52.4 W h kg-1 at a specific density of 551.7 W kg-1, and excellent cycling stability with 93.5% capacity retention after 6000 cycles. Thus, the Zn-Ni-S//PMCN asymmetric supercapacitor with outstanding electrochemical behavior is thought to be a promising device for energy storage applications. This journal is
