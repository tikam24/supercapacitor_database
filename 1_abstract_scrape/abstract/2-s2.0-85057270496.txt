A fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSC) with a unique roll-type configuration is developed by simply rolling polyaniline-coated carbon fiber bundle electrodes with an H2SO4/polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte. The roll-type polyaniline-coated carbon fibers FSC exhibits four times higher capacitance retention than the twist-type fiber-shaped supercapacitor and shows an energy density of 2.97 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 4 kW kg−1, which is almost three orders of magnitude higher than that of the twist-type FSC (0.004 Wh kg−1). The enhanced performance of the roll-type FSC is attributable to its unique roll-type configuration, which creates a short and consistent distance between the electrodes.
