In this study, we successfully synthesized two types of meso/microporous carbon materials through the carbonization and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation for two different kinds of hyper-crosslinked polymers of TPE-CPOP1 and TPE-CPOP2, which were synthesized by using Friedel–Crafts reaction of tetraphenylethene (TPE) monomer with or without cyanuric chloride in the presence of AlCl3 as a catalyst. The resultant porous carbon materials exhibited the high specific area (up to 1100 m2 g−1 ), total pore volume, good thermal stability, and amorphous character based on thermogravimetric (TGA), N2 adsoprtion/desorption, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses. The as-prepared TPE-CPOP1 after thermal treatment at 800◦C (TPE-CPOP1-800) displayed excellent CO2 uptake performance (1.74 mmol g−1 at 298 K and 3.19 mmol g−1 at 273 K). Furthermore, this material possesses a high specific capacitance of 453 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 comparable to others porous carbon materials with excellent columbic efficiencies for 10,000 cycle at 20 A g−1 .
