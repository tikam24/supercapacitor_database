The rapid development of micro-electronic equipment has put forward new requirements for multifunctional and miniaturized energy storage devices. Among them, micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) have received widespread attention because of the advantages of long cycle life and fast charge and discharge. As excellent electronic conductor, graphene has high specific surface area and good ductility, showing wide application prospects in micro-supercapacitors. Among the various preparation methods of graphene-based micro-supercapacitors, laser direct writing technology with the features of inexpensive, flexible and fast, sacrificing-free templates and complicated follow-up processing is an efficient and quickly integrated processing method. To this end, we review the research progress of laser direct write graphene-based micro supercapacitors, including the advantages of laser construction of miniature energy storage devices, typical laser direct writing graphene supercapacitors and their electrode materials, and micro-device configuration assembly (symmetrical and asymmetrical). Meanwhile, the future development trends and challenges of laser direct writing graphene-based micro-supercapacitors are also presented.
