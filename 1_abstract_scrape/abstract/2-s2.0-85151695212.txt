Herein, an effective method of preparing CNT@NiM-OH nanocomposites by reacting dopamine-modified carbon nanotubes (CNT@PDA) with M(NO3)2 (M = Zn,Co) and 2-methylimidazole is reported. The research results show that CNTs are intertwined to form a network structure surrounded by NiM-OH in CNT@NiM-OH, which provides a more electrolyte contact area and reaction active sites. Electrochemical research indicates that CNT@NiM-OH exhibits excellent electrochemical properties for supercapacitors. The specific capacitances of CNT@NiCoZn-OH, CNT@NiZn-OH and CNT@NiCo-OH were 2039.63, 1930.03 and 1664.73 F/g, respectively, at 1 A/g. In addition, the specific capacitance retention rates of the three electrode materials after 1000 cycles were 97.7%, 99.0% and 85.4%, respectively.
