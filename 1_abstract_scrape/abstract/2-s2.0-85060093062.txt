Petal-like architecture TiO2 mixed oxide (PATMO) nanotubes were readily fabricated by anodization of Ti-4Al-0.005B (TA5) alloy followed by chemical etching in phosphoric acid solution. The formation of PATMO can be attributed to the combined effect of the water-assisted crystallization of TiO2 and the dissolution of alumina component in TiO2 mixed oxides during etching process. The specific capacitance for the PATMO annealed at 450 °C in argon is about 6 times greater than that of the nanotube counterparts. The PATMO show excellent rate capability and cycling stability with a maximum specific capacitance of 110.78 F cm−3 at 0.1 mA cm−2.
