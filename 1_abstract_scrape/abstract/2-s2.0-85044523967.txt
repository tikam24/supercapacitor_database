Hexagonal nanoplates of Ni(OH) 2 with a thickness of ∼11 nm were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method. The formation of Ni(OH) 2 phase was confirmed by XRD technique. TEM images revealed a stack of hexagonal nanosheets with average nanoplates size of ∼62 nm. XPS results confirm the elemental compositions at the surface of Ni(OH) 2 which are in good agreement with XRD results. As we know, the properties of electrolyte affect the performance of supercapacitors. Therefore, the electrochemical performance of Ni(OH) 2 electrodes were investigated in various aqueous electrolyte solutions including 1M NaOH, 2M KOH, and 1M KOH mixed with 0.5M Na 2 SO 4 . The electrochemical results show that the Ni(OH) 2 electrode in 1M NaOH electrolyte reached the highest specific capacitance of 447 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g that was nearly two times higher than that in the 2M KOH electrolyte. This can be attributed to the smaller ionic radius of the Na + ion and a higher intercalation/deintercalation rate of Na + ions into the surface of the Ni(OH) 2 electrode. In addition, a coulombic efficiency of 94% was found in 1M NaOH at a current density of 10 A/g. The capacitance retention of the Ni(OH) 2 electrode in 1M NaOH was maintained at about 100% after 1000 cycles. The present work proves that the best performance of Ni(OH) 2 nanoplates was performed in the 1M NaOH electrolyte.
