In most mass-produced electric vehicles the power source is a lithium-ion battery, thermal mode violation for this type of battery leads to degradation and sometimes even to destruction and explosion. In 2015, at the Department of Electric Drive of Mechatronics and Robotics National Technical University 'Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute', an electric vehicle with a lead-acid battery power source with a parallel-connected supercapacitor battery was created. It based on the Lanos car and designed for educational and scientific purposes. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that battery is discharged in this case from the recovery currents and peak currents in the initial stages of acceleration, while the battery thermal mode is significantly improved. Energy reduction degree assessment by the converted battery for standard mode of ECE-15 is made. Conclusion on the possibility of using supercapacitors in electric vehicles power supplies with lithium-ion batteries and on the feasibility of further comprehensive study of this technical solution is made.
