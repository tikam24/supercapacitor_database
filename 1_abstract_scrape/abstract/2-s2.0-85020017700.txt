Graphene/porous PANI as a supercapacitor electrode materials were prepared by the combination of attapulgite (ATP) hard-template and in situ polymerization method, and then HF acid was used to etch ATP to obtain porous PANI, which was used as a substrate to develop graphene/porous PANI via electrochemical reduction method. The electrochemical performance influenced by different mass ratios of PANI/ATP before and after removing ATP template, etching time of HF acid, and conductivity were investigated in details. The results showed that the optimal graphene/porous PANI nanocomposite exhibited improved electrochemical performance than pure graphene and PANI. The specific capacitance of graphene/porous PANI modified electrode could achieve 654.75 F g−1 at the scan rate of 50 mV s−1 with the current density of 1.0 A g−1, and it is about 74.36% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles of charge-discharge cycle in 1.0 mol L−1 H2SO4 electrolyte even at 8.0 A g−1. The excellent electrochemical properties of the graphene/porous PANI composite were attributed to the porous structure formed by removing ATP, and high specific surface area and extraordinary electrical conductivity provided by both graphene and porous PANI, which indicated that a good application potential of graphene/porous PANI was not only in supercapacitors but also in other kinds of energy storage systems.
