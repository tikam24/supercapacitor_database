The betterment of economic and energy recovery efficiency of an elevator energy storage device is considered a big challenge. To serve this purpose, this paper proposes a capacity allocation method and an energy control strategy of elevator hybrid energy storage device (HESD) based on supercapacitor and battery. By analysing the cost for HESD and calculating battery life with rain flow counting method, a capacity allocation scheme with the minimum daily average cost as the objective function is established. The working area of HESD is partitioned according to the state of charge (SOC) value, and the energy control state machine of HESD. The SOC and the DC bus voltage as the transition boundary is constructed to realize the reasonable energy control. The case analysis and experimental results show that the average daily cost of HESD is 54.65%, which is lower than single energy storage system. The energy saving efficiency of HESD is 15.2%, and this is higher than using only the supercapacitor, which improves the economy and energy saving efficiency of the elevator.
