An ample approach is adopted to fabricate an operative electrode material comprising an immaculate nanocomposite i.e. sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) and functionalized multi walled carbon nanotube (f-MWCNT) as reassuring components for polypyrrole to enhance the overall capacitance of the composited electrode. Due to effective and mutual strengthening of PPy/ SPEEK/f-MWCNT, the electrode appreciably improves its electrical response also, that sustains comfortably even with the enhanced scan rates and cyclic stability with high conductive behavior than that of their individual constituents. This research is also directed towards gaining a safe operation with minimal electrical series resistance and high charge discharge capacity. A layer by layer assembly formation by SPEEK, PPy and f-MWCNT, successfully aids this electrode, prepared for supercapacitor applications. Electrochemical properties are examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV), Nyquist plots and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) curves while the morphological analysis is performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) and Transmission Electron Microcopy (TEM) analyzers. Composite SPM22 prepared by combination of 98 wt% PPy/SPEEK (80:20) with 2 wt% of f-MWCNT is observed as a better electrode material for energy storage devices yielding 593 F/g specific capacitance at scan rate of 2 mV/s. An elegant course of mechanism for redox reactions is also assisting the worth of interweaved electrode material.
