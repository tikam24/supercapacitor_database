A new idea of self-control and rapid-charged circuit used in the cantilever piezoelectric generator has been proposed aiming at resolving the problem that the current power storage circuit is charged slowly. Through analyzing the output characteristics of the cantilever piezoelectric generator using the super-capacitor as the load and by using MATLAB/Simulink simulation tool to obtain the fastest charged time stage of the super-capacitor, a new self-control and rapid-charged circuit with a micro-power control core ATmega168 has been designed. The experimental results show that the circuit is 3 times faster than the circuit which using the traditional charging method. The rapid-charged and self-control functions for the micro-generator can be achieved by using the proposed circuit. It can be used to supply energy to low-power consumption devices, sensors and high instantaneous power consumption circuit in the environment of mechanical vibration.
