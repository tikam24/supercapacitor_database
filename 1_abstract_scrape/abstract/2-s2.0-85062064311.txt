In the research of wearable smart electronics, obtaining particular structure electrodes to provide outstanding mechanical flexible and electrochemical performance remains challenging. In this study, flexible multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) nanocomposite electrodes are fabricated via dip-coating and vapor phase polymerization methods. A poriferous network structure of composite electrode is achieved through incorporation of MWCNTs to the conducting polymer matrix. These interconnected holes on electrodes and the synergetic effects between MWCNTs and PEDOT polymer yield large surface areas and favorable electrochemical performances. A single composite electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 92.55 F/cm 2 , as well as good cycling stability with 94% of its initial charge after 5500 cycles. An all-solid-state micro-supercapacitor based on MWCNTs/PEDOT electrodes is also assembled by sandwiching the polyvinyl alcoholâ€“H 3 PO 4 gel electrolyte, which displays an areal capacitance of 32.06 mF/cm 2 . This belt-shaped flexible micro-supercapacitor served as energy storage device shows significant potentiality in wearable electronics.
