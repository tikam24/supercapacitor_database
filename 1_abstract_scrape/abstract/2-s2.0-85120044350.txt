Supercapacitors have the unique advantages of high power density, fast charge and discharge rates, long cycle life, high safety, and reliability, and are increasingly being used for applications including automobiles, rail transit, communication equipment, digital electronics, and aerospace equipment. The supercapacitor industry is currently in a stage of rapid development; great breakthroughs have also been made in improving the performance of supercapacitors and the expansion of their application. Electrode technology is the core of supercapacitors. Transition-metal compounds have a relatively high theoretical capacity and have received widespread attention as electrode materials for supercapacitors. In addition, there is a synergistic effect between the different components of various electrode composite materials. Due to their superior electrochemical performance, supercapacitors are receiving increasing research attention. Flexible supercapacitors have been hailed for their good plasticity, resulting in a development boom. This review article mainly outlines the development process of various electrode materials, including carbon materials, conductive polymers, metal compounds, and composite materials, as well as flexible electrode materials based on carbon cloth.
