We demonstrate the fabrication of solid-state dielectric energy storage materials from self-assembled, aligned single-walled carbon nanotube arrays (VA-SWNTs). The arrays are transferred as intact structures to a conductive substrate and the nanotubes are conformally coated with a thin metal-oxide dielectric and a conductive counter-electrode layer using atomic layer deposition. Experimental results yield values in agreement with those obtained through capacitive modeling using Al2O3 dielectric coatings (C > 20 mF/cm3), and the solid-state dielectric architecture enables the operation of these devices at substantially higher frequencies than conventional electrolyte-based capacitor designs. Furthermore, modeling of supercapacitor architectures utilizing other dielectric layers suggests the ability to achieve energy densities above 10 W h/kg while still exhibiting power densities comparable to conventional solid-state capacitor devices. This device design efficiently converts the high surface area available in the conductive VA-SWNT electrode to space for energy storage while boasting a robust solid-state material framework that is versatile for use in a range of conditions not practical with current energy storage technology.
