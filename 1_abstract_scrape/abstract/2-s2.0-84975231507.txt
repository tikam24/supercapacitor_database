3D MnO2 nanorod/welded Ag-nanowire-network supercapacitor electrodes were prepared. Welding treatment of the Ag nanowire-network leads to low resistance and long lifetime. Galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD) induces an ever-lasting morphology changing from flower-like to honeycomb-like for MnO2, which manifests as increasing specific capacitance to 663.4 F g-1 after 7000 GCD cycles.
