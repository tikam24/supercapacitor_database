This study provides a methodology to assess the techno-economic performance of photovoltaic household-prosumers that jointly provide self-consumption/sufficiency enhancement (SCSE) and frequency containment reserve (FCR). It thus addresses the following issues: (i) battery aging; (ii) supercapacitors joined to batteries building hybrid storage systems; (iii) management strategies of SCSE and charge level in energy storage systems; (iv) an integrated system with a 1-ms simulation step and high-resolution inputs. The methodology was applied to one Spanish household-prosumer. The study compared three charge-level management strategies by using different technical and economic performance indicators and concluded that the deadband recovery was the best. Moreover, the best techno-economic indicators were achieved by broadening the storage capacity band of unrestricted operation for SCSE (30â€“90%). Regarding the prosumer sizing, the optimal converter-battery configuration was determined so as to minimize the total energy supply cost. Long-term performance confirmed that when FCR provision was added to the SCSE, profitability increased up to 14.01%, with a relatively low impact on battery aging. A sensitivity analysis guaranteed a cost reduction of 3.68% for the prosumer energy and of 16% for the storage system life cycle at the optimal hybrid storage sizing. This sizing involved a 1% supercapacitor hybridization and a time constant of 150 s for power splitting.
