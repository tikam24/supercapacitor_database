Hydrous nano-MnO2 was synthesized by oxidation of aqueous MnSO4 with KMnO4 solution at pH ≈ 10.6. Hydrous nano-MnO2 in Na2SO4 and (NH4)2SO4 aqueous electrolytes proves to be an excellent electrode material for faradic capacitor. Cyclic voltammograms versus SCE give ideal capacitor behavior between 0. 0 and 0. 85V in 0. 5mol · L-1 Na2SO4 and between 0. 15 and 0. 85V in 2. 0mol · L-1 (NH4)2SO4 with a constant specific capacitance over 5000 cycles of about 177. 5 F · g-1 and 159F · g-1, respectively. By 10mA and 50mA constant current charge/discharge in 0. 5mol · L-1 Na2SO4, hydrous nano-MnO2 can provide a specific capacitance of 177. 5F · g-1 and 167. 5F · g-1, respectively. These results demonstrate that in 0. 5 mol · L-1 Na2SO4 solution, hydrous nano-MnO2 can provide ideal capacitance characterization and excellent cyclicabilily.
