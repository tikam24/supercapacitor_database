Active carbon@La2NiO4/NiO hybrid coatings are synthesized using different molar ratios of La/Ni to improve the electrochemical performance of active carbon materials. The morphology and microstructure of the composites are investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge test (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed to characterize electrochemical performance. At a molar ratio of La/Ni 1:2, the electrochemical electrode shows that the resistance of the composite is 2.97 Î©, which is half of that in pure active carbon. The highest energy density of 70.37Wh kg-1 is obtained at a current density of 1 A g-1, whereas the highest power density of 32.4 kW kg-1 is achieved at a current density of 10 A g-1. The CV results present a high specific capacitance of 710.48 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 in 7 M KOH aqueous solution.
