The article presents findings for electrical parameters of supercapacitors, and techniques for experimental definition of capacitance values and internal resistance of supercapacitors. Research on self-discharge and influence of delay within electric field upon self-discharge constant of supercapacitors has been conducted. Monitoring system for supercapacitors and Li-ion battery charge/discharge based on the verifier with pulse-width modulation and voltage balancing system which is employed on a separate battery element has been proposed.
