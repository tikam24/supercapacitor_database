The modelling and control of a DC-coupled hybrid system composed of a micro gas turbine and supercapacitor energy storage bank is presented in this paper. The supercapacitor is used for short power balancing in order to achieve constant power at the system output until the micro gas turbine reacts to the load change. The corresponding control system for power references setting and control of the converters has been developed. The hybrid system is modeled and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results demonstrate proper operation of the proposed hybrid system and its control - at the moment when an electric vehicle is plugged in to the system, the required power for fast charge is provided. In this way fast recharging of electric vehicles can be performed at remote gas stations without further reinforcement of the existing power distribution infrastructure.
