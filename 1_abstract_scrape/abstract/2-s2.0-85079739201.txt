Cell balancing is crucial for charging supercapacitor cells to prevent cells from over-charging. Most existing cell-balancing charging methods typically adopt an output feedback control, i.e., the terminal voltages of cells are directly utilized in the controller design. One limitation of these methods is the voltage drop effect when the charging is terminated, which degrades the system capacity and results in cell imbalance. To address this challenge, in this article, we propose an observer-driven charging method for supercapacitors. The switched resistor circuit is applied and is further modeled using the switched systems theory, where the RC model of cells is considered. The communication interactions among cells is modeled using the graph theory. A switching Luenberger observer is designed to estimate the voltage of the equivalent capacitor of each cell, and a consensus-based switching control law is designed to charge and balance supercapacitors. The closed-loop system model is derived using the block diagram. A laboratory testbed has been built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed charging method. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively alleviate the voltage drop effect when compared with existing charging methods.
