At present, supercapacitors are the most promising form of high capacity, mobile energy storage devices. Among different supercapacitor materials, manganese-based supercapacitors are of great importance because of its cost-efficient simple fabrication and less hazardous environmental impact. MnOx and MnS are the most commonly found forms of manganese-based supercapacitors. The manganese-based supercapacitor electrodes are generally fabricated by hydrothermal, precipitation, CVD, or electrodeposition methods. Different surface modifications, structural changes and doping results in high-performance supercapacitors. While introducing graphene, CNTs and other carbon materials and polymers help increase the faradic reaction of manganese supercapacitors by enhancing active surface area, double metal oxides, and structural modification nanoscale also improves supercapacitor performance. This review article briefly discusses all the recent findings on manganese-based supercapacitors as a promising next-generation high-performance alternative of batteries or capacitors.
