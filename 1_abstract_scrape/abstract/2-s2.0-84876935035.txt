A flexible and solid-state supercapacitor device based on TiO2@C core-shell nanowires has been developed and exhibited excellent flexibility - it can even be folded and twisted without sacrificing electrochemical properties - and good electrochemical performance with a maximum energy density of 0.011 mW h cm-3.
