This work reports on the physical characteristics and electrochemical properties of the carbon derived from treated food-waste as electrode material. The eco-green carbon was produced by means of chemical activation using phosphoric acid as activating agent with varies activation temperature, 500 °C, 600 °C and 700 °C. Highest specific surface area of 535.80 m2g-1 was achieved and consists mainly of mesoporous. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy images illustrated the morphology of the activated carbon was porous and homogenously distributed. The electrochemical properties of activated carbon electrodes were analyzed using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in KOH as electrolyte. The specific capacitance from cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge showed 85 Fg-1 and 106 Fg-1. Results demonstrated that the carbon produced from treated food-waste was a promising electrode material for supercapacitor.
