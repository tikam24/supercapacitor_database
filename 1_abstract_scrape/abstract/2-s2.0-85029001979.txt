In the present investigation, anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanotube arrays (NTAs) have been successfully synthesized by a simple and cost-effective electrochemical anodization of titanium (Ti) foil. To investigate the effect of reaction time on the TiO2 NTAs, the reaction time was varied from 6, 12, 18, and 24 h and studied its morphological changes. Furthermore, the synthesized TiO2 NTAs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTâ€“Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photospectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and the wettability measurement to study detailed investigation of structural, morphological, and wettability characteristics. These results demonstrated that the anodization time is strongly affecting on the morphology and wettability of the TiO2 NTAs. In addition, these results will be useful in dye-sensitized solar cell and supercapacitor applications.
