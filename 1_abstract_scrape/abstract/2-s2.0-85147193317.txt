Owing to high-efficiency energy storage characteristics, lithium-based batteries are expected to solve the energy crisis caused by intermittent anxiety about renewable energy and the rapid popularization of portable electronic products or electric vehicles. However, based on their current development status, a significant gap still exists between their actual performance and theoretical performance in terms of energy/power density, durability, and safety. Expanded graphite has been widely used in lithium-based batteries owing to its distinct chemical/physical characteristics and has gradually narrowed the gap. This article reviews general expanded graphite synthesis methods and composite strategies for high-performance lithium-based batteries. Furthermore, this article will introduce the latest research findings on expanded graphite-based composite materials in lithium-based batteries, emphasizing the important role of expanded graphite-based composite materials in this field. Finally, an outlook is posited for the remaining challenges, which will help accelerate the advancement of expanded graphite-based composite materials and the commercialization of lithium-based battery technology.
