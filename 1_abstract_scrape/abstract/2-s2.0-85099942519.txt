Two-dimensional (2D) MoTe2 nanomaterials have emerged as a promising candidate for constructing excellent supercapacitors due to their high capacitive performance. Recent studies have revealed that MoTe2 has broad prospects as an active material in supercapacitors, although its strict requirements in terms of the external environment and complex preparation process remain serious obstacles to its practical application. Toward this end, MoTe2 nanosheets (NSs) were prepared by a facile and inexpensive liquid-phase exfoliation approach for the fabrication of MoTe2 electrodes. The results show that the MoTe2 NSs exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a specific capacitance (859 F g−1) more than three times that of bulk MoTe2 (271 F g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1. In addition, the MoTe2-based electrode showed excellent cycle stability and maintained excellent specific capacitance (92.7% of the initial value) after 1000 cycles under the working condition of a current density of 10 A g−1. This study describes a fundamental investigation on the energy storage and conversion properties of 2D layered materials.
