Conducting polyaniline (PANI) has been widely considered as a promising energy storage material with excellent electrochemical reversibility and high theoretical specific capacitance. Suffering from poor cyclic stability of PANI, here we demonstrate urchin-like molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with PANI as hybrid electrode materials (MoS2@PANI) via one-pot hydrothermal method. In our case, the electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bond interaction between MoS2 and PANI synergically improve the structural integrity and specific surface area of the binary MoS2@PANI hybrids. Specifically, MoS2@PANI with 25 wt% MoS2 (PM25) delivers a maximum capacitance of 645 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with good cycling stability (89% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1). Compared to pure PANI (335 F g−1), the improvement of capacitive energy storage ability indicates that urchin-like MoS2@PANI hybrids with a stable morphology and unique structure are promising for hybrid supercapacitor materials.
