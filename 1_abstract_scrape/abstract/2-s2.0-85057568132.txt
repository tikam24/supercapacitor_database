A novel ferrocene-functionalized rGO as a electrode material is developed. The rGO was successfully functionalized through [1,2] cycloaddition reaction with 1,1′-bis(4-azidobutyl)ferrocene (bA-Fc). The functionalized ferrocene rGO nanocomposite (bA-Fc/rGO) has been completely characterized using FT-IR, EDX, XRD and SEM. The elimination of the strong azide stretching bond at ∼2100 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of bA-Fc/rGO nanocomposite obviously proved the cycloaddition reaction between bA-Fc and rGO. Its XRD pattern compared to the rGO indicated that the ferrocene moiety successfully functionlized on rGO. The structure of this nanocomposite was balled and wrinkled compared to the starting graphene oxide according to SEM analysis and XRD experiment. The EDX spectrum shows the existence of carbon, nitrogen, iron and oxygen elements in bA-Fc/rGO. The electrochemical properties of bA-Fc/rGO nanocomposite were investigated with CV, GCD and EIS measurements. The bA-Fc/rGO revealed a higher surface, electrochemical performances and electrical conductivity than rGO and bA-Fc. The bA-Fc/rGO nanocomposite showed very good stability in more than 2000 cycles and high rate capability. The results show that bA-Fc/rGO nanocomposite can be considered as a candidate to be used in supercapacitor electrode materials.
