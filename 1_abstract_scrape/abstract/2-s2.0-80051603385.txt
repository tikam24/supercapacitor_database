An ordered mesoporous nanocomoposite of carbon-MoO2 was prepared by incorporation of Mo precursor into mesopores of ordered mesoporous carbon after acid treatment. In spite of crystal growth, inner mesopores of the carbon were covered by MoO2, which was attributed to strong interaction between the Mo precursor and the acidified carbon surface. When applied into supercapacitor electrode, an improved volumetric capacitance (216 F cm -3) and a very high pseudocapacitance by MoO2 itself (622 Fg-1) were obtained, indicative of an efficient capacitive utilization of MoO2 within carbon mesopores. Because of the characteristic nanostructure, furthermore, rate capability and cycle performance were improved. Â© 2011 The Electrochemical Society.
