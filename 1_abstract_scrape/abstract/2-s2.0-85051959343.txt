MnNi2O4-PbS composites have been successfully deposited on a nickel (Ni) foam substrate using a simple and cost-effective two-step hydrothermal route for application as supercapacitor electrode materials in energy storage devices. The morphological, structural and physical behaviors of the as-prepared composite were evaluated, and the results indicate that the PbS nanoparticles were successfully anchored onto the surface of MnNi2O4 nanoflakes. The electrochemical studies reveal that the MnNi2O4-PbS composite exhibits a higher supercapacitor performance with a high specific capacitance of 1176.76 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and improved cycling stability with 98.86% retention after 4000 cycles, which are much higher than that of the MnNi2O4 electrode. The improved electrochemical performance of the composite electrode is mainly due to its unique hierarchical structure, which provides a better contact of the electrolyte and electrode surface, and a large number of active sites. These results suggest that the unique MnNi2O4-PbS electrode would be a promising electrode for high-performance supercapacitor applications.
