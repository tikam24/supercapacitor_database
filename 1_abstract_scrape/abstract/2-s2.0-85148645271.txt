To reduce air pollution and global warming, renewable energy technologies may generate power. Wind, solar PV, and fuel cell energy are the primary sources. Solar PV system-powered brushless direct current motor (BLDC) drives are used in the automobile industry due to their importance. In this study, Sheppard–Taylor (S-T) converter and Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) Inverter-fed BLDC provide steady voltage across the BLDC motor drive independent of solar PV system power output. When renewable energy is scarce, the proposed battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system (BS-HESS) provides electricity. S-T converters may be used for load matching and power processing to create energy-efficient systems and stabilize PV panel output voltage. The variable step size open circuit voltage-Maximum Power Point Tracking (VSSOCV-MPPT) technique in S-T converter switching pulses extracts maximum power from the solar PV system. This study considers the PVSWPS control function as a Port-Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system to continue rural growth and reduce the greatest demand and load. MATLAB/Simulink software simulates the system’s performance, and FPGA controllers validate the controller’s real-time performance.
