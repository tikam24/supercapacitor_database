One important part of the electrical transportation systems is the energy-storage system. This can be based, for example, on supercapacitors. In this paper, we propose to study its behavior under constraints similar to their uses in power and railway-traction systems. We define an adequate measurement protocol for accelerated aging which is applied to supercapacitors according to two accelerated factors: effective current and temperature. We model the supercapacitors for different states of health. The modeling gives a good estimation of the variation of electrical parameters of the supercapacitor at different states. We reveal general indicators of the supercapacitor's aging, and we discuss about its life cycle. Â© 2010 IEEE.
