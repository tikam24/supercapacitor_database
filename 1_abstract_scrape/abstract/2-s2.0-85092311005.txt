The paper reports synthesis of graphene oxide (GO) using modified Hummer's method and its hydrothermal assisted reduction to produce reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for supercapacitor applications. Synthesized GO and rGO were characterized using Raman spectroscopy and their Id/Ig ratio was found to be 0.94 and 0.87, respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was also performed on samples for detailed surface morphology information. UV-Vis spectroscopy was employed to investigate optical properties. FT-IR spectroscopy was utilized to get the information of attached functional groups and electrochemical characterization (cyclic voltammetry) was used to test the charging discharging behavior of the material. The specific capacitance of synthesized rGO was found to be 105F/g.
