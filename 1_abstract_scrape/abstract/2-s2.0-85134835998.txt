The quest for an efficient and inexpensive electrocatalyst via a convenient procedure is pivotal for the development of reliable energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, for the first time, we designed a strategy and tailored a Prussian blue analogue (PBA) derived cobalt telluride (Co0.63Te) electrocatalyst meant for both the oxygen evolution reaction and supercapacitor. The as-synthesized electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and needed only 317 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Similarly, Co0.63Te exhibits a specific capacitance of 680 F g−1 at 5 mV s−1 in 5 M KOH electrolyte with remarkable capacitive retention and a noteworthy 97% coulombic efficiency after 5000 CV cycles. This work provides a distinct route to design an efficient noble-metal-free catalyst through a conventional hydrothermal method for both energy conversion and storage.
