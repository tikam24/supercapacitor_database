By the reactive self-degraded template-directed synthesis and further carbonization, N- and O-doped carbonaceous nanotubes from conducting polymer (polypyrrole) precursor have been prepared. After being chemically activated by KOH, specially, with the weight ratio of KOH to polypyrrole nanotubes of 2 and 4, two samples of activated carbonaceous polypyrrole nanotubes (ACPN-2 and ACPN-4) with an uncapped morphology were obtained. The ACPN-4 possesses high heteroatom content (14.85%) and specific surface area (1226 m2 g -1), and exhibits a reversible capacitance of 470 F g-1 at the current density of 0.2 A g-1, and 280 F g-1 even at a higher current density of 10 A g-1. Moreover, these nanotubular structured materials have also shown excellent cycling performance with no capacitance loss over 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, these carbonaceous nanotubes achieved a high CO2 adsorption uptake of 3.9 mmol g-1 at 273 K and 2.5 mmol g-1 at 298 K. Â© 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
