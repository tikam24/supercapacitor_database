Manganese dioxide has gained wide research attention as a propitious material for supercapacitors attributable to its excellent characteristics like excellent theoretical capacitance, low-price, eco-friendly nature and profound abundance. Here in this paper, we have synthesized MnO2 nanoflowers via a hydrothermal route. The supercapacitive performance of MnO2 was tested. It exhibited a specific capacitance of 73.13 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. To further boost the electrochemical performance of MnO2 nanoflowers, they have been coated with activated carbon via a very straight-forward sol-gel approach at room temperature. The obtained nano-composite (MnO2/AC) exhibited improved capacitance of 170.68 F g−1 at 10 mV s−1. The composite was able to attain an energy density of 20.89 Wh kg−1 (at 350 W kg−1). Thus, the composite material has broad potential applicability as supercapacitor electrode material.
