Porous Co3O4 nanorods were synthesized by the thermolysis of organometallic cobalt oxalate precursor via ultrasonic assisted method. FT-IR, XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and BET were applied to characterize the effect of thermal treatment temperature on the properties of porous Co3O4 nanorods. A three-electrode system was used to perform cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements to study the electrochemical behaviours of Co3O4 nanorods modified nickel foam electrodes. Compared with Co3O4 prepared by pyrolysis at various temperatures, Co3Om nanorods obtained at 300 °C had the highest specific capacitance of 226.80 F·g-1 at a current density of 1 A·g-1 in the potential range of-0.4 to 0.6 V (vs. Hg/HgO). After performing 1000 cycles in 2 M KOH electrolyte, 99.76% of specific capacitance was retained, showing the excellent stability of Co3O4 nanorods modified electrode.
