Nanocomposites of Mn3O4 nanoparticles and graphene (GR) nanosheets - Mn3O4@GR can be made by growing Mn 3O4 nanoparticles directly on the surfaces of GR in solvothermal reactions. The asymmetric supercapacitors constructed with Mn 3O4@GR as positive and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrodes, respectively, show highly enhanced performances in energy storage. It was found that the electrolytes employed in constructing electrodes of the devices can influence the performances of Mn3O4@GR supercapacitors dramatically. Compared to their energy density in KOH electrolyte, the devices exhibit improved charge storage performances in Na 2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the charge storage abilities of the devices are closely related to the amount of Mn 3O4 nanoparticles loaded onto the surface of GR nanosheets. The performances of Mn3O4@GR//AC asymmetric supercapacitors can be optimized by carefully tailoring the composition of electrode materials and adjusting the electrolytes for making the devices.
