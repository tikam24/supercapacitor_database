In this study, CoS/MnCo2O4-MnO2 (CMM) nanocomposites were synthesized by hydrothermal and then electrochemical deposition. Their electrochemical properties were systematically investigated for supercapacitors and energy-saving H2 production. As an electrode material for supercapacitor, CMM demonstrates a specific capacitance of 2320F g−1 at 1 A/g, and maintains a specific capacitance of 1216F g−1 at 10 A/g. It also shows 72.8 % capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor exhibited high energy storage capacity (887.86F g−1 specific capacitance at a current density of 1 A/g), good rate performance and cycling stability. Besides, CMM shows outstanding urea oxidation reaction(UOR) and glycol oxidation reaction (MOR) performances for H2 production. Compared to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (1.635 V) at 20 mA cm−2, the potentials were reduced by 213 mV for UOR and 233 mV for MOR, respectively. Therefore, this study shows the promising practical applications of CMM nanocomposites for energy storage and energy-saving H2 production.
