Development for sustainability and renewable energy storage equipment with energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly characteristics being the overwhelming imperative problem that needs to be addressed. Here, apricot shells were used to prepare apricot shell-derived porous carbons (APCs) with hierarchical structures by employing a mild one-step method, viz. a CaCO3/K2C2O4 salt activator at 700 ℃. Pore structures for APCs can be regulated by the weight ratio of CaCO3 to K2C2O4. Significantly, the mild one-step preparation of APCs bypasses high temperatures (> 700 ℃), strong acids or alkalis, and supercritical drying or freeze-drying. The resultant optimal porous carbon APC-1 had a large specific surface area of 2348.96 m2/g and a low ratio (36.15%) of micropore volume (Vmicro) to total pore volume (Vtotal). Besides, APC-1 achieved a high specific capacitance of 300.41 F/g at 1 A/g in the three-electrode configuration and good capacitance retention of 85.88% at 10 A/g. Particularly, APC-1 displayed a high energy density of 29.54 Wh kg−1 upon 2800.83 W kg−1 in the two-electrode cell and excellent cycling stability of 91.56% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 10 A/g. The present investigation gives a mild one-step approach to obtain biomass-derived porous carbons for high-performance supercapacitors.
