Flexible membrane consisting of ultralong V2O5@conducting polypyrrole (V2O5@PPy) core-shell nanowires is prepared by a facile in situ interfacial synthesis approach. The V2O5 is for the first time demonstrated to show versatile function of reactive template to initiate the uniform and conformal polymerization of PPy nanocoating without the need for extra oxidants. The freestanding PPy-encapsulated V2O5 nanowire membrane is of great benefit in achieving strong electrochemical harvest by increasing electrical conductivity, shortening ion/electron transport distance, and enlarging electrode/electrolyte contact area. When evaluated as binder- and additive-free supercapacitor electrodes, the V2O5@PPy core-shell hybrid delivers a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 334 F g-1 along with superior rate capability and improved cycling stability. The present work would provide a simple yet powerful interfacial strategy for elaborate constructing V2O5/conducting polymers toward various energy-storage technologies.
