In this paper, a double integral sliding mode controller is proposed for a hybrid electric vehicle comprised of the Fuel cell as the main energy source along with supercapacitor and battery as the auxiliary power source. To charge these energy storage units, an LCC-S compensation network-based wireless charging system has been proposed. An energy management system has been presented to efficiently distribute the power during the driving and charging modes. The stability of the proposed control structure has been verified by Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control scheme has been verified by simulating the electric vehicle under the European extra-urban driving cycle in MATLAB/Simulink platform. To check the robustness and effectiveness, the proposed controller has been compared against PID and Lyapunov controllers. The real-time implementation of the proposed controller has been validated by controller hardware-in-loop experiments.
