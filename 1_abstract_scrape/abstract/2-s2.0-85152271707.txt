This paper deals with synthesis of polypyrrole, by the potentiostatic Electrodeposition for supercapacitor application. Polypyrrole (PPY) films were deposited on stainless steel substrates by electro polymerization from pyrrole solutions containing dehydrated 5-sulfosalicylic acid (SSA) as an anionic additive and annealed at 50 °C, 70 °C, 100 °C and 200 °C. Morphology and structure of polypyrrole were studied using SEM,XRD and FTIR technique. Supercapacitive behaviour were studied using Cyclic Voltammetry and Electrochemical impedance technique. Cyclic Voltammetry shows maximum capacitance 62.87F/gm at 2 mV/s for an annealing temperature of 70 °C. In this paper effect of annealing temperature on supercapacitor behaviour of polypyrrole was studied.
