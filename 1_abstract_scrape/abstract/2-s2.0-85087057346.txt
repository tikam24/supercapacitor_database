The novel IrO2-CeO2-G/Ti composite electrodes were prepared by thermal decomposition method. The synthesized electrodes with different IrO2 content were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical performances of the electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 0.5 mol/L H2SO4 solution. The results show that the electrode with 2.5 mg/cm2 IrO2 exhibits an excellent specific capacitance value of 459.5 F/g, and maintains the specific capacitance at about 97.8% after 5000 charge-discharge cycles at 5 mA/cm2 current density. The electrode with 2.5 mg/cm2 IrO2 is an ideal electrode for supercapacitor due to its unique composition proportion and the excellent pseudocapacitance property.
