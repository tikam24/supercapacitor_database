The supercapacitive behavior of the metallic cobalt recycled from Li-ion batteries has been studied in this work. The reversibility of both redox process (Co II/Co III) and (Co III/Co IV) in KOH 6 mol L -1 is very high and promising for capacitive applications in electrochemical devices. The specific capacitances calculated from cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show a good agreement, giving the value of 625 Fg -1. The electrode morphology presents a high porosity, thus an electrical equivalent circuit composed of two parallel resistance and capacitance elements in series was proposed. The specific capacitance values calculated from charge/discharge curves at 0.23 and 2.3 mA/cm 2 are 601 and 384 Fg -1, respectively. Thereby, it was observed that metallic cobalt recycled from ion-Li batteries is compatible with other supercapacitive materials. This shows that cobalt recycling from Li-ion batteries is economically and environmentally viable for application in supercapacitor devices. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.
