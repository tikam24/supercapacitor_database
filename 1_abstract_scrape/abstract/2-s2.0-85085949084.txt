The sponge-like NiMoS4 nanosheets were in-situ induced/grown on self-supported Ni foam, which can be directly applied as supercapacitor electrode without tedious preparation process and charge transfer limited binders. The obtained NiMoS4/Ni foam electrode can exhibit the high specific capacity of 233 mA h/g at 0.75 A/g, owing to the uniform three-dimensional sponge-like network shape with favorable electrons/ions transfer channels. In addition, the assembled NiMoS4/Ni foam//AC asymmetric supercapacitor can possess the energy density of 32 Wh/kg and good stability of 84 % capacity retention after 8000 cycles. This work cannot only provide a new preparation method of NiMoS4 on Ni foam without introducing nickel sulfides, but also exhibits the high-performance NiMoS4/Ni foam supercapacitor electrode.
