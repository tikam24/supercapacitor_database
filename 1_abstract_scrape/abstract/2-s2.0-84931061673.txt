This study reports a paper-like micro-supercapacitor (SC) with in-plane interdigital buckypaper electrodes on a filter membrane substrate. A vacuum filtration method assisted by lithography techniques is proposed for patterning buckypaper. The proposed micro-SC features advantages including a flexible structure, simple fabrication, easy chip integration, and high specific capacitance. Increasing the aspect ratio of the patterned buckypaper electrodes effectively enhances the specific capacitance of the SC. The specific capacitance measured by cyclic voltammetry was 107.27 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 20 mV/sec. The measured charge-discharge behaviors at various discharge rates show the electrochemical stability of the device.
