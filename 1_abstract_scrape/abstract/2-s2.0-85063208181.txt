To further enhance electrochemical performance of WS 2 -based materials in supercapacitors, a 3D architecture with WS 2 nanoflakes interconnected and quantum dots anchored on N and S co-doped reduced graphene oxide (WS 2 /N,S-rGO) crumpled nanosheets is fabricated for the first time via a novel, facile and scalable approach, which is based on rapid solution combustion synthesis of the precursor and subsequent gas-solid phase sulfurization, and needs no such tedious processes as filtration, washing and drying. Significantly, the WS 2 /N,S-rGO hybrid possesses a specific capacitance of 1562.5 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and a rate capability of 780 F g −1 at 40 A g −1 , which are superior to the currently-reported WS 2 -based electrode materials. As to the WS 2 /N,S-rGO hybrid, the 3D hierarchical architecture, synergistic effect between WS 2 and N,S-rGO nanosheets as well as nitrogen and sulfur co-doping on rGO offer a variety of advantages such as larger contact surface area, shorter ion diffusion path, excellent charge transport and especially the enhanced pseudo-capacitance of rGO, and thus result in huge improvement in electrochemical activity, which demonstrate the WS 2 /N,S-rGO hybrid to be a superb anode material in supercapacitors.
