In this study, manganese oxide nanowires wrapped by nitrogen-doped carbon layers (MnO<inf>x</inf>@NCs) were prepared by carbonization of poly(o-phenylenediamine) layer coated onto MnO<inf>2</inf> nanowires for high performance supercapacitors. The component and structure of the MnO<inf>x</inf>@NCs were controlled through carbonization procedure under different temperatures. Results demonstrated that this composite combined the high conductivity and high specific surface area of nitrogen-doped carbon layers with the high pseudo-capacitance of manganese oxide nanowires. The as-prepared MnO<inf>x</inf>@NCs exhibited superior capacitive properties in 1M Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> aqueous solution, such as high conductivity (4.167Ã—10<sup>-3</sup>Scm<sup>-1</sup>), high specific capacitance (269 Fg<sup>-1</sup> at 10 mV s<sup>-1</sup>) and long cycle life (134 Fg<sup>-1</sup> after 1200 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s<sup>-1</sup>). It is reckoned that the present novel hybrid nanowires can serve as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors and other electrochemical devices.
