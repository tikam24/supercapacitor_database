Nickel oxide (NiO) is a promising electrode material in supercapacitor (SC) applications, but the poor electronic conductivity and weak electrochemical stability of NiO limits the fast charge/discharge rate and long-time reuse. Herein we report a core-shell nanostructure formed by NiO nanoparticles decorated on polypyrrole nanotube (PNT) through a chitosan (CS) layer (NiO/CS-PNT), as a supercapacitor electrode material. The PNT is synthesised using a self-degradable soft-template approach. The one dimensional (1D) nanotube structure gives increased surface area to polypyrrole (PPy). The inevitable aggregation of the NiO nanoparticles is reduced by the incorporation of CS, thereby increasing the surface area of the active material and bringing the higher electrochemical performance. NiO/CS-PNT core-shell nanostructure is found to have a large surface area, low charge transfer resistance (Rct) and high specific capacitance (Csp) as compared with that of NiO/PNT and pure PNT. Besides, an all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) was fabricated with NiO/CS-PNT as positive and negative electrode, which shows high power density (PD) of 4045.69 Wkg−1 at an energy density (ED) of 27.80 Wh Kg−1. Also, an outstanding cyclic stability was found with capacitance retention of 84.90% even after 10,000 cycles. The results demonstrate that the NiO/CS-PNT core-shell nanostructure is a favourable electrode material for supercapacitors.
