A CuCo2S4/graphene composite was synthesized using a simple hydrothermal method. The sample was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption and electrochemical tests. The composite had a hierarchical porous structure with micropores of 0.7-1.2 nm, mesopores of 2-10 nm and a total pore volume of 0.1 cm3Â·g-1, and the CuCo2S4 had a nano-belt structure. As the electrode of a supercapacitor the composite showed a high specific capacitance of 665 F/g at 7.5 mV/s, and excellent rate capability and cycling stability.
