In this article, tin sulfide nanoparticles (SnS NPs) are amalgamated by using Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) + Ethanol named as AR1, Ethylene glycol (EG) named as AR2, and Oleylamine (OA) named as AR3 through the solvothermal method. The amalgamated NPs are characterized by using XRD, FT-IR, UV-DRs, SEM, TEM and Electrochemical performance. The orthorhombic phase of the produced SnS nanoparticles is indicated by XRD patterns. The crystalline size calculated by using the Debye Scherrer equation and Williamson Hall (W-H) plot is correlated to each other. The SEM and TEM images manifestly show that the morphological alterations in the SnS nanoparticles. The FT-IR confirmed the characteristics bands pragmatic at 616 cm−1 and 623 cm−1 for SnS stretching vibrations. The (AR1) electrode had a greater Specific capacitance of 419 F/g than that of AR2 and AR3 electrodes, respectively. The higher Specific capacitance of AR1 calculated using CV and GCDs curves could be attained due to well-developed spherical morphology which produces large surface area and better pore size.
