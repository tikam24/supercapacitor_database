A facile hydrothermal method has been used to synthesis of cubic CuCo 2 O 4 nanoparticles by using two types of precipitate agents like oxalic acid and NaOH. XRD and TEM results suggest that spinel cubic structure of CuCo 2 O 4 with space group of Fd 3 m. The N 2 adsorption-desorption results confirms that oxalic acid assisted CuCo 2 O 4 sample shows high surface area (133 m 2 g -1 ) and lower pore size 8–10 nm compared with NaOH assisted CuCo 2 O 4 sample (surface area = 110 m 2 g -1 and pore size = 10–15 nm). The valance state of the sample was analyzed through XPS and the result suggests that the presence of mixed Co 2+ and Co 3+ in the CuCo 2 O 4 spinel cubic system. Impressively, the electrochemical performance of the oxalic acid assisted CuCo 2 O 4 electrode exhibits a maximum capacity of 765 mAhg −1 at a specific current of 2 A/g and results in good long term cyclic stability of 95% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, it delivers a high energy density of 25 W h/kg at a power density of 450 W/kg. This could be due to more electroactive sites for faradic reactions emerging from the two metal ions, higher electronic/ionic conductivity and fast electrolyte transportation kinetics promoted by unique morphology.
