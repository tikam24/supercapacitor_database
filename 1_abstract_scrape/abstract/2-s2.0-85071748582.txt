In the research of flexible microsupercapacitors, particular structure electrodes with favorable electrochemical performances are in high demand. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of nanocomposite by vapor phase polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene with molybdenum disulfide in the presence of an oxidizing agent. The effects of exfoliated molybdenum disulfide in common organic solvents are investigated on the electrochemical properties of molybdenum disulfide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) composites. It is found that molybdenum disulfide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) film prepared by isopropanol solvent assisted exfoliated molybdenum disulfide nanosheets exhibits a typical porous network structure and superior electrochemical performances. On account of synergetic effects between uniformly distributed molybdenum disulfide and PEDOT polymer, the hybrid film shows a high volumetric capacitance of 423.6 F/cm3 and good cycling stability with 92% of its initial charge after 5000 cycles. Moreover, flexible interdigitated micro-supercapacitor assembled by molybdenum disulfide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) electrodes is evaluated, which displays a volumetric capacitance of 15.32 F/cm3. The assembled flexible device shows a huge potential for application in flexible electronic devices.
