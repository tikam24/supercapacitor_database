The rapid development of electrical energy storage (EES) technology is urgent for the exploitation of the supercapacitors with high energy density. The electrode plays a crucial role in the performance of supercapacitor. In this research, a basic magnesium-doped nickel-based (BMDNB) electrode material is successfully synthesized on a foamed nickel substrate by one-step hydrothermal method. After optimizing synthesis condition, the material has a unique card-on-lawn structure, nanocards are grown on a uniform honeycomb lawn array. The unique structure and compositions endow BMDNB prominent morphological features and excellent electrochemical properties. Using the BMDNB and active carbon as electrodes, an asymmetric supercapacitor (BMDNB//AC ASC) is assembled with a voltage window of 1.8 V. The ASC device achieves a maximum energy density of 74.9 Wh∙kg−1 at a power density of 1086.8 W∙kg−1. The energy density is comparable with the state-of-the-art level of the reported Ni(Mg)-based supercapacitors.
