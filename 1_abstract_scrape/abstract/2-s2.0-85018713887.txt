The flexible carbon activated electrode supercapacitor application has successfully prepared from coconut shell based carbon materials that produced by local farmers. The Increasing physical and electrochemical properties of coconut shell carbon has been done by chemical activation using KOH and microwave radiation assisted. A Flexible carbon activated electrodes was produced by by spraying method. Physical and electrochemical properties were tested are the specific surface area and specific capacitance. Extensive surface and optimum capacitance were obtained from a flexible carbon electrodes made from coconut shell based carbon is 194.429 m2/g and 10.55 F/g, respectively.
