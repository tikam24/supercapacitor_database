We demonstrate a supercapacitor made of nanoporous Fe2O3-5 wt%CNT composites that are sintered by scanning-mode nitrogen atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs). The screen-printing technique is first used to print a paste that contains Fe2O3 nanoparticles, CNTs, and carbonaceous binders onto carbon cloth. A nitrogen APPJ is then used to sinter the printed pastes. The addition of 5 wt% CNTs can improve the specific capacitance from 16 to 54 F/g. With an APPJ scanning rate of 5 cm/s, the supercapacitor is found to exhibit a specific capacitance of 54 F/g using cyclic voltammetry measurement with a potential scan rate of 2 mV/s.
