Sucrose derived carbon coated silicon nanowires (SDCC-SiNWs) were prepared by drop casting of sucrose derived carbon (SDC) slurries and used as active electrode material for supercapacitors. It was observed that the SDC particles were coated over SiNWs. The results obtained by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements of SDCC-SiNWs showed superior capacitive performance compared to just SDC based supercapacitors. SDCC-SiNWs has a significantly higher areal capacitance of 3.3 mF/cm2 as compared to that of bare SiNWs (96 µF/cm2) or SDC based electrode (817 µF/cm2).
