The spectral and photochemical properties of graphene oxide films are considered. Photochemical reduction of GO is studied by optical absorption, mass spectroscopy, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Difference between the photoreduction and termoreduction of GO is demonstrated. The molecular model of the photoprocesses is considered and the domain model of photoreduction is proposed. The moisture effect on conductivity of GO films was studied. GO films of 200-500 nm thickness become conductive from 10-6 to 10-2 S/cm upon the moisture increase from 30% to 100%. Waters diffusion changes the films morphology. Proton character conductivity is concluded for GO, the isotopic effect for the conductivity being rH/rD = 1.4 Â± 0.1. A film of deeply oxidized graphene oxide is used as a separator of a supercapacitor for the first time.
