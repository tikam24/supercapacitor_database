Modelling dynamic behaviours of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery and supercapacitor in electric vehicle applications is a key aspect for the emulation of the hybrid power supply. In this study, a dynamical model based on two non-linear equivalent circuits is developed to describe the characteristics of the battery and supercapacitor during both steady-state and transient conditions. The necessary parameters for the proposed model are extracted from measurement data in time and frequency domain using an optimisation algorithm. The developed model is coupled to power electronics devices fed by DC power supply to carry out a laboratory emulator of the hybrid power supply. This tool is mainly used for testing and verification of the electric vehicle performances with convenient and reproducible way. The proposed emulator avoids time-consuming preconditioning and safety problems generally caused by the misuse of electrochemical components such as the Li-ion battery. The modelling and experimental results show a good performance of the hybrid power supply emulator and confirm their feasibility over a wide range of operating points.
