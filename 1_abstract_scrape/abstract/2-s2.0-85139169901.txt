Uncontrolled dendrite growth and worse side reactions shorten the life span of aqueous zinc energy storage devices and limit their practical application. Herein, we report for the first time a high-performance lignocellulosic gel polymer aqueous electrolyte (LC-GPAE) with abundant polar functional groups. The strong interaction between Zn2+and polar functional groups inside LC-GPAE can weaken the solvation of Zn2+with water, thus reducing the desolvation activation energy of [Zn(H2O)6]2+and improving the kinetics of Zn2+in the stripping/plating process. It is mainly reflected in the high ion conductivity (6.3 mS cm-1at 30 Â°C), high Zn2+transference number (tZn2+= 0.44), and lower nucleation overpotential (58 mV). Under the action of LC-GPAE, the growth direction of Zn dendrites tends to be gentle and smooth, avoiding the penetration effect. Impressively, a Zn//Zn symmetric battery with LC-GPAE maintains stable operation over 2000 h at 1 mA cm-2with a capacity of 1 mAh cm-2, and a Zn//AC hybrid supercapacitor with LC-GPAE continuously runs over 12,500 cycles at 1 A g-1(retention rate 84.4%).
