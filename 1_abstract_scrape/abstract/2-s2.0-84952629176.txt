The globally increasing population, technological advancement, and depletion of traditional energy resources all increase the requirements for alternative energy sources. The popularity of electrochemistry for novel energy technologies is increasing. One of the most attractive electrochemical methods related to energy storage and delivery is electrochemical capacitors, or supercapacitors (SCs). Electrochemical, topographical, and morphological properties of thermally-prepared Irx-Ru1-x-oxide coatings of various compositions (0 < x < 1), formed on a Ti metal substrate, were studied for their potential application as SC electrodes. A current state-of-the-art pure RuO2 coating exhibited relatively low performance compared to other bimetallic IrxRu1-x-oxide coatings operated under the same experimental conditions. An electrochemically-activated Ir0.4Ru0.6-oxide coating generated the highest capacitance value (85 mF/sq cm). The addition of IrO2 to RuO2 improved the stability and capacitive performance of the thermally-prepared Ir-Ru-oxide coatings. Ir0.4Ru0.6-oxide coating is a good candidate.
