With the increasing advancement of knowledge and the widespread use of electronics, the demand for more efficient energy storage devices and materials has increased dramatically. Poly ortho-aminophenol and its composites as the energy storage materials are reviewed in this article. The capacitive properties (specific capacitance, specific energy, specific power, number of charging-discharging cycles, and retention capacitance) of all these composites are fully listed as well as compared with other electrode materials. Electrochemical test diagrams (CV, GCD, and EIS) of some of these materials have been carefully studied. The data show that POAP composites have excellent electrochemical performance compared to pure POAP and other composites. These electrodes have also been tested in the actual devices and have shown excellent performance. Also, the morphological properties and structure of composite (SEM, TEM, BET, Fractal dimension, components) of these electrodes have been reviewed. The synergistic effect between the components has been reported. This polymer has a special electrocatalytic effect that can be used to design innovative electrodes with excellent performance and surface modification. Finally, a summary and insight into future plans are provided. In general, these composites showed excellent electrochemical performance and morphological properties, which shows the high potential of these materials in the application of supercapacitor electrodes.
