We report a single-step synthesis of mixed-phase WO3 nanoplates by a rapid and cost-effective wet chemical method. The excellent electrochemical performance of WO3 nanoplate attributed to the proton insertion supported pseudocapacitive charge storage with a superior specific capacitance of 471 Fgâˆ’1 and greater stability. Additionally, the WO3 nanoplate shows better methylene blue (MB) dye degrading performance of 87% in 105 min. Thus the bi-functional activity of the WO3 nanoplates has the potential to employ in the integrated devices for further applications.
