This paper presents a review of the state-of-the-art in aircraft electrical propulsion technology. A comparison is provided of differing propulsion mechanisms such as propellers, open fans, ducted fans, multi-stage rim driven fans and distributed thrust designs and their suitability to particular flight profiles and mission applications. Electrical motor architectures are also reviewed with particular attention being given to synchronous machines, such as Brushless Direct Current (BLDC) and Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) technologies, and the recent advances that have been made in solid-state switching and High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) material applications. Present day electrical power generation, storage and control technologies are also reviewed including hybrid and fuel cell technologies and regeneration techniques. Electrical storage capabilities with regard to specific power and energy characteristics are discussed and the extent to which existing system technology can be integrated onto a Hybrid-electric and an All Electric Aircraft (AEA) is also investigated. Finally, a conclusion is provided highlighting the current technological challenges facing the development of commercial aircraft in terms of performance, airframe configuration and legislative and operational infrastructural requirements.
