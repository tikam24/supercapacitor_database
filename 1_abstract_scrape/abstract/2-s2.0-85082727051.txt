A sodium polyacrylate-mediated strategy was employed to prepare well-defined MoS2 ball-flower-like nanomaterials. It was found that the polyacrylate acted as a morphology-directing agent to promote MoS2 nanosheets to self-assemble into ball-flowers with 3D hierarchical structures. Moreover, as an electrode applied in a supercapacitor, the ball-flower-like MoS2 exhibited a remarkable pseudocapacitive performance such as a high specific capacitance and superior cycling durability.
