We report the preparation of flexible and nano-porous iron oxide-reduced graphitic oxide (Fe2O3â€“rGO) electrodes using a novel photonic processing method. Due to this unique technique, high-temperature thermal processing could be accomplished on inexpensive and low-temperature substrates instantaneously as opposed to longer processing times of conventional thermal processing. The nano-porous morphology of the electrode not only accommodates the volume changes of the electrode but also facilitates the transport of the electrolyte ions into the electrodes. The as-prepared electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with an initial specific capacitance of 179 F/g at 2 A/g. Moreover, it exhibited excellent specific capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (70%), revealing its superior cyclic stability. Along with having specific capacitance comparable to that of rigid electrodes, the as-prepared electrode is bendable and lightweight, signifying its potential application in foldable and wearable consumer electronic devices which require continuous energy supply while going through physical deformation.
