Nickel oxide and cobalt oxide of active material in supercapacitor were prepared using spherical Ni(OH)2 on which 7% Co(OH)2 was encapsulated as raw materials. Physical properties of the mixture were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TG) methods. The electrochemical performance of the (NiO + CoO)/AC (actived carbon) composite electrodes with different contents of (NiO + CoO) was studied in 6 mol/L KOH electrolyte by cyclic voltammograms (CV) and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement. The results indicate that the capacitance of electrodes increases with the mass fraction of (NiO + CoO) mixture. When the mass fraction of (NiO + CoO) is 6%, the specific capacitance of composite electrode is up to 240 F/g which increases by 50%, compared with pure AC electrode. The composite electrode has a good reversibility and electrochemical property.
