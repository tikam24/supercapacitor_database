Three dimensional graphene networks (3DGNs) are promising electrode materials in electrochemical applications because they provide short diffusion pathways for electrolyte ions and fast transport channels for electrons, and act as an ideal scaffold for forming composites with pseudocapacitive materials to obtain a synergistic effect. This review offers an overview of recent advances in the synthesis of 3DGNs and their composites as electrodes in supercapacitors. In particular, methods to enhance the capacitive performance of 3DGN-based supercapacitors are summarized. Prospects for the future development of 3DGNs are presented at the end.
