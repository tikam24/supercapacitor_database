The structural features and its nonlinear mathematicai model of supercapacitor and li-bettery were researched, and then by means of Matlab/Simulink, a nonlinear model of Hybrid energy storage system was established. Through the parallel control strategy, li-bettery chargeing current was adjusted to track maximum charging current, and battery charge and discharge was always in the optimal state. Simulink results verify the correctness of the proposed nonlinear model of Hybrid energy storage system, and the effectiveness of control strategies to achieve intelligent charging lithium batteries.
