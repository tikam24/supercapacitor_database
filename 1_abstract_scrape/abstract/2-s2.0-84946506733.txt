Graphite oxide (GO) is promising precursor for a bulk production of graphene-based materials due to easy preparation. Typically, exfoliation and reduction of GO have depended on either sonication process using chemical agents or heat treatment. In this study, we introduce a preparation of exfoliated and reduced GO powder by using an electrostatic method. GO precursor was changed into black fluffy reduced GO powder by simple electrostatic force. The micro-structural and electrochemical properties are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement, and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The prepared nanocomposites showed the superior capacitive performance with good rate capability, large specific capacitance, and excellentby cyclic performance. As-prepared powder showed specific surface area of 516 m2/g, higher than value (283 m2/g) of microwave assisted reduced GNS powder. Using the exfoliated graphite oxide, we studied electrochemical behaviors for an application of supercapacitor electrode.
