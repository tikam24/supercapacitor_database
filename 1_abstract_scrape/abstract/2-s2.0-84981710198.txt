Supercapacitors composed of MoS2 typically suffer from inferior cycling stability because of aggregation and pulverization of the active particles during cycling. In order to alleviate volume expansion of the active particles and restrain aggregation and pulverization during cycling, hollow MoS2 nanomaterials are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal method and the structure and supercapacitance characteristics are studied. The nanostructured MoS2 particles, which has a hexagonal phase without impurities, has a diameter between 0.5 and 2 Âµm and contains many irregular nanosheets manifesting as a flower-like structure with a thickness of several nanometers. As the electrode in a supercapacitor, the hollow nanostructured MoS2 shows excellent capacitance characteristics including good cycling ability.
