Unevenly distributed polypyrrole (PPy) films/coatings with extensive “dead volumes” via electrodeposition have emerged as a main challenge for high energy density flexible supercapacitor. In this work, we have fabricated a phytic acid-guided graphite carbon felt/polypyrrole (GF@PA@PPy) 3D porous composite with less “dead volumes” via electrodeposition. After the activation of phytic acid (PA), the quantity and content of defects and oxygen-containing groups on the surface of carbon felt (GF) have increased. First, these functional groups improve the hydrophilicity of the surface of GF, resulting in the preferential uniform distribution of pyrrole monomer (Py). While significantly, the synergistic effects between the defects and oxygen-containing groups boost the attraction of pyrrole ring, and thus promotes the formation of perfect PPy films with less “dead volume” on GF. Finally, the supercapacitor assembled from the GF@PA@PPy-40 displays a high areal energy density of 0.0732 mWh cm−2, exceeding the previously reported PPy-based electrodes values. The deeper understanding of the role for the defects and oxygen-containing groups in the synthesis of PPy/carbon materials offers a new strategy to construct advanced PPy-based supercapacitors.
