The present chapter presents our attempts to review highlighted works as well as to provide critical views about the elaboration of electrical conducting polymer - (nano)carbon composites and their use in energy storage application, i.e. supercapacitors. Profiting from the unique properties of (nano)carbon network, e.g. high theoretical surface-active area, high conductivity, etc., ECP@(nano)C composites have additional functionality to be electroactive by introduction of conducting polymer, resulting in the significant increase of pseudocapacitance. Within this context, we are considering that it is indispensable to recapitulate the current state-of-the-art to open a multidisciplinary discussion in this field. Via this chapter, different aspects of ECP - (nano)carbon composites are introduced and recent advancements are summarized. Indeed, several approaches and procedures for integrating ECP into carbonaceous networks are mentioned and reviewed. Later, the electrochemical responses of prepared composites are revealed to get insight the electrochemistry as well as the working mechanism of such materials in the field of supercapacitor. For each approach, an up-to date of highlighted examples of using ECP-nanocarbon composites as active materials in SCs is also described.
