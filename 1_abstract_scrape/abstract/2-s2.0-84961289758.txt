We conceived a material composed of a pseudocapacitive core and an electrostatic double-layer capacitive porous shell for advanced electrochemical energy storage. As a proof-of-concept, the MoS2 nanosheets wrapped with MOF (ZIF-8)-derived microporous carbons (MoS2@MPC) were fabricated via a three-step strategy and applied in supercapacitor research. The structures exhibit a high specific capacitance, rate capability and cycling stability due to the combined involvement of both the structural portions under the electrochemical charge storage and release procedures.
