Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) due to their porosity and well-defined structures are considered to be very promising electrode materials for the construction of high-performance supercapacitor (SC). In this paper, manganese-based metal-organic framework (Mn-MOF) were prepared on the surface of carbon cloth (CC) by a facile hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of the electrode material were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Its electrochemical studies show that the Mn-MOF electrode materials exhibit lower charge transfer resistance, the excellent specific capacitance of 433.5 mF/cm2 in 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution at the current density of 0.8 mA/cm2. It is noteworthy that the flexible electrode have excellent cycle stability and 105% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 5 mA/cm2. The excellent electrochemical performance of Mn-MOF/CC flexible electrode materials can be attributed to its three-dimensional porous structure.
