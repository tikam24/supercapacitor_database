Silver-coated ZrO2 and individual ZrO2 nanoparticles have been synthesized using the simple reduction and co-precipitation methods, respectively. The synthesized products were examined using the X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray and UVâ€“visible spectroscopy, which confirmed the successful synthesis of materials. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed the round-shaped nanoparticles of both materials. The cyclic voltammograms revealed the well-defined redox peaks and recommended the pseudocapacitive nature of the electrodes. The silver-coated zirconia showed higher specific capacitance of 792 F/g at 10 mV/s as compared to individual zirconia (10.22 F/g). Silver-coated ZrO2 also showed good power density of 274.5 W/kg at current density of 5 mA/cm2 through the galvanostatic charge discharge profile. Hence, the results suggest that silver-coated ZrO2 showed improved electrochemical performance as compared individual ZrO2 due to higher electrical conductivity and specific surface area. Hence, silvercoated ZrO2 nanoparticles can be employed as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
