Hierarchical hollow nanostructures with complex shell structures are attractive for efficient storage of electrochemical energy. However, reports on the designed formation of such delicate architectures are rare. Starting from a framework of Co-based zeolitic imidazolate (ZIF-67) nanocubes, we demonstrate a template-engaged formation of double-shelled hollow structures with CoS-nanoparticle-assembled nanoboxes surrounded by outer CoS-nanosheet-constructed shells (denoted as CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs). Delicate manipulation of the template-engaged reaction between ZIF-67 and water leads to the formation of ZIF-67/Co(OH)2-nanosheet yolk-shelled structures, which are then transformed into CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs through the reactions with Na2S. As a result of the unique assembly of subunits with different dimensionalities, the CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs have a high specific surface area, suitable mesopores, and good structural robustness, which contribute to exceptional performance as a battery-type electrode. Moreover, a hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by using CoS-NP/CoS-NS DSNBs as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. Impressively, these optimized devices can be operated stably in a wide potential range of 1.6 V with greatly enhanced energy density and power capability. The device is stable for 10,000 cycles with a capacitance retention of 88%.
