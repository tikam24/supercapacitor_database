Graphene (G) has been attracted great interest for its excellent electrical properties. However, the large-scale production of graphene is presently unfeasible. Graphene oxide (GO) can be (partly) reduced to graphene-like sheets by removing the oxygen-containing groups with the recovery of a conjugated structure. It can be produced using inexpensive graphite as raw material by cost-effective chemical methods. Although hydrogen (mixed with argon) at high temperature (1100°C) has been employed to reduce GO powder, the hydrogenation disproportionation desorption and recombination (HDDR) process in particular was unreported for this purpose. In the present work, attempts of reducing GO powder using the HDDR process have been carried out and investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The experimental results of processing graphene oxide powder using unmixed hydrogen at moderate temperatures (about 850°C) and relatively low pressures (<2 bars) have been reported.
