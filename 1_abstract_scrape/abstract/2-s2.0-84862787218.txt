Composite films consisting of polypyrrole (PPy) and graphene oxide (GO) were electrochemically synthesized by electrooxidation of 0.1 M pyrrole in aqueous solution containing appropriate amounts of GO. Simultaneous chronoamperometric growth profiles and frequency changes on a quartz crystal microbalance showed that the anionic GO was incorporated in the growing GO/PPy composite to maintain its electrical neutrality. Subsequently, the GO was reduced electrochemically to form a reduced GO/PPy (RGO/PPy) composite by cyclic voltammetry. Specific capacitances estimated from galvanostatic discharge curves in 1 M H 2SO 4 at a current density of 1 A g -1 indicated that values for the RGO/PPy composite were larger than those of a pristine PPy film and the GO/PPy composite. In the case of 6 mg mL -1 GO for the preparation of GO/PPy, a high specific capacitance of 424 F g -1 obtained at the electrochemically prepared RGO/PPy composite indicated its potential for use as an electrode material for supercapacitors.
