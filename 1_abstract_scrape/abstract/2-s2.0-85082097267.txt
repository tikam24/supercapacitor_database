Co-Doped MnO2 nanotubes (Co-MnO2-5) were prepared as the positive electrode of supercapacitors via a simple one-step hydrothermal method. Co doping and one-dimensional tunneling of nanotubes result in low internal resistance and good ionic contact, enhancing the conductivity and electrochemical performance of the electrodes.
