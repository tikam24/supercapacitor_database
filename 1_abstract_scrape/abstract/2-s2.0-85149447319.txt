Rational design of electrode meterials with unique core-shell nanostructures is of great significance for improving the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In this work, we prepare several CuCo2O4 @Ni-Co-S composite electrodes by a controllable hydrothermal and electrodeposition route. One-dimensional nanowires can shorten the ions transport path, while two-dimensional nanosheets expose many active sites. This enables three-dimensional structured composite with high electrochemical activity. The as-prepared heterostructured materials show a specific of 1048 C/g at 1 A/g. It still maintains 75.6% of initial capacity after 20000 cycles at 10 A/g. The device delivers an energy density of 79.2 Wh/kg when the power density reaches to 2280 W/kg. Moreover, it possesses an excellent mechanical stability after repeated folding at different angles
