In recent times, many different types of systems have been based on fractional derivatives. Thanks to this type of derivatives, it is possible to model certain phenomena in a more precise and desirable way. This article presents a system consisting of a two-dimensional fractional differential equation with the Riemann–Liouville derivative with a numerical algorithm for its solution. The presented algorithm uses the alternating direction implicit method (ADIM). Further, the algorithm for solving the inverse problem consisting of the determination of unknown parameters of the model is also described. For this purpose, the objective function was minimized using the ant algorithm and the Hooke–Jeeves method. Inverse problems with fractional derivatives are important in many engineering applications, such as modeling the phenomenon of anomalous diffusion, designing electrical circuits with a supercapacitor, and application of fractional-order control theory. This paper presents a numerical example illustrating the effectiveness and accuracy of the described methods. The introduction of the example made possible a comparison of the methods of searching for the minimum of the objective function. The presented algorithms can be used as a tool for parameter training in artificial neural networks.
