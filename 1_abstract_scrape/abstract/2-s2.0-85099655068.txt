Biomass-derived porous carbon has been widely concerned as electrode material for supercapacitors, yet is severely hindered by the complex preparation process and low-efficiency. In this work, a facile solid-phase single-stage activation strategy is developed to fabricate cattail wool-derived porous carbon by using calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and potassium oxalate monohydrate (K2C2O4·H2O). The hard template effect of CaCO3, the activation of K2C2O4, and the interaction between CaCO3 and K2C2O4 endow the resultant carbon an interconnected hierarchically porous structure, enhancing capacitive performance. In particular, CWC-3.5-600, which is prepared with a mass ratio of 3.5 for K2C2O4·H2O to the biomass precursors and calcined at 600 °C, possesses a specific surface area of 1173.2 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.581 cm3 g−1. The optimal carbon exhibits a large specific capacitance (323.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, 268.8 F g−1 at 1.0 A g−1) and superior rate capability in the three-electrode configuration. Also, the CWC-3.5-600-based symmetrical supercapacitor delivers an energy density of 23.93 Wh kg−1 at 240 W kg−1, in addition to good cycling stability. This work proposes a simple, low-cost, and high-efficiency method for large-scale synthesis of biomass-derived porous carbon materials, which are potential in the advanced energy storage and conversion devices.
