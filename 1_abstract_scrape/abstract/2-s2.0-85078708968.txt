Pseudocapacitive materials hold extraordinary promise for improving the energy densities of electrochemical capacitors but are often limited to electrodes with ultralow mass loadings (e.g. <1 mg cm-2) due to the sluggish mass transport kinetics in thicker electrodes. Here a V5O12/VO2 heterojunction nanomaterial with a built-in electric field near the heterointerface is fabricated on a 3D graphite substrate via an in situ electrochemical method for the first time, which can remarkably enhance the capacitive performance by improving the electron/ion delivery kinetics. The V5O12/VO2 electrode (mass loading ∼10.8 mg cm-2) achieves a high areal capacitance of 5.03 F cm-2 (465 F g-1) with a good rate capability and long cycle life, outperforming the V5O12 and VO2 counterparts, as well as the state-of-the-art reported VOX electrodes. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled using V5O12/VO2 as the negative electrode and MnO2 as the positive electrode can deliver high areal/volumetric energy densities of 1.42 mW h cm-2/11.85 mW h cm-3. An extrapolated gravimetric energy density of 18.6 W h kg-1 can also be achieved, based on the entire weight of the device (76.6 mg cm-2, active material ratio ∼30%), representing a critical step of pushing pseudocapacitors toward practical applications.
