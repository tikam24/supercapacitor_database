In recent years, the number of connected embedded systems with sensors is increasing exponentially. Many challenges remain to provide all these devices with energy. A common solution is to use a battery or super capacitor. However, these energy sources get drained over time. Therefore, a human intervention is necessary to recharge or replace the battery. As the number of sensors increases and they may get embedded in difficult to reach places, the human intervention generates a high overhead. To alleviate this problem, an Unmanned Vehicle (UV)-based approach exploiting Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) was conceived. Its main target is to recharge IoT nodes. Thereto energy is transferred from the charge station along the UV to the IoT nodes through two WPT stages. We present an efficient wireless power system developed for charging the batteries inside the UV. Furthermore a WPT system to charge the batteries or super capacitors at the nodes was implemented. Load modulation enables communication to the charge station and results in a reduction of the energy loss.
