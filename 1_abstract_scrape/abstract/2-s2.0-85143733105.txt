The main aim of this project is to develop a hybrid energy storage system employing regenerative braking and vibration-powered energy for a hybrid electric vehicle. A system has been designed involving improved regenerative braking using fuzzy logic controller and vibration powered energy harvester by piezoelectric ceramic plates. The system provides safer braking according to the driver's intent and driving condition. Besides, the system can harvest the mechanical energy from pressing the pedals in a hybrid electric vehicle and convert it into electrical energy. The integration of regenerative braking system and vibration-powered energy system is successful. The main storage supercapacitor was charged by the individual systems at different intervals. The prototype was evaluated by applying a 10N to the vibration-powered energy system harvester at a constant rate for 20 seconds, followed by activation of regenerative braking. The average power of the storage supercapacitor was 0.19W after the charging by both vibration-powered energy system and single braking by the regenerative braking system. It showed an increase of 97.9% compared to solely energy harvesting by the regenerative braking system.
