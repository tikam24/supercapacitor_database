An electrode with high cycling stability is critical to build a high performance electrochemical supercapacitor. However, the fabrication of such electrode materials, particularly in a simple, effective manner, has been generally challenging. Here, inspired by the functions of bryophytes in ecological protection, such as the buffering effect, firm roots and fluffy appearance, we have designed a polymer layer protected electrode, which exhibited greatly improved electrochemical performance with 176% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles.
