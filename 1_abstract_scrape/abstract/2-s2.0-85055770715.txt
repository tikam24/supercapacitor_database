NiTe:Co nanoparticles supported on nickel foam are successfully synthesized using one step hydrothermal method. Electrochemical performances of NiTe:Co in 3 M KOH are investigated. Results show that specific capacitance of the electrode formed by using NiTe:Co is significantly enhanced and the highest specific capacitance is 1645.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, which higher than NiTe electrode (872.7 F g−1). Moreover, the NiTe:Co//AC device also delivers a higher energy density of 36.8 Wh kg−1 than NiTe//AC device (24.4 Wh kg−1) at almost the same power density. The superior electrochemical properties demonstrate that the Co doped NiTe is promising as electrode material for supercapacitors in energy storage.
