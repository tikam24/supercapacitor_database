Since their discovery, carbon nanotubes have been proposed for a number of applications, such as gas storage, reinforcement of composites, electrochemical energy storage, catalyst support, where the nanotexture and surface functionality are of fundamental importance. With regard to surface properties, this new form of carbon is not significantly different from the other classical carbon forms (carbon fibers, pyrolytic carbon, graphite, activated carbons,...) which are also constituted of graphitic carbon layers. Therefore, this chapter aims in its first part at presenting the porous properties and surface functionality of carbon materials and the techniques to control or modify these parameters. However, due to their nanoscale size morphology and inner cavity which can host various species, carbon nanotubes are expected to present specific properties. Mats of highly entangled nanotubes offer an open network of mesopores which favors the access of molecules and ions to the active surface. The second part of this chapter will be focused on the presentation of some specific chemical and electrochemical properties of carbon nanotubes. Filling of nanotubes and in-situ chemistry in the cavity will be documented. Application of carbon nanotubes as lithium battery or supercapacitor electrode materials will be critically discussed by comparison with other kinds of nanostructured carbons.
