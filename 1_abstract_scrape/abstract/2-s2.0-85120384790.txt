There is growing demand for lightweight flexible supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance for wearable and portable electronics. Here, we spun nanoparticles of nickel-manganese oxides along with carbon nanotubes into carbon nanofibers and engineered a 3D networked Ni-Mn oxides/CNT@CNF free-standing membrane for flexible supercapacitor applications. The electrospinning process controlled the nanoparticle aggregation while subsequent heat treatment generates nanochannels in the fibres, resulting in a very porous tubular nanocomposite structure. The preparation process also enabled good interfacial contact between the nanoparticles and the conductive carbon network. The resulting Ni-Mn oxides/CNT@CNF membrane displays high mass loading (Ni-Mn oxides) of 855 mg cm-3 and low CNT incorporation of âˆ¼0.4%. The outstanding porous structure, synergy of the carbon with Ni-Mn oxides, and fast and facile faradaic reactions on the electrode were responsible for the superior volumetric capacitance of 250 F cm-3 at 1 A cm-3, energy density as high as 22 mW h cm-3 and an excellent power density of 12 W cm-3. Despite the low CNT loading, the hybrid electrode exhibits excellent cycling performance with capacitance retention of 96.4% after 10 000 cycles evidencing a well-preserved Ni-manganese oxide nanostructure throughout the cycling. The resulting outstanding electrochemical performances of the Ni-Mn oxides/CNT@CNF synergic system offer new insights into effective utilization of transition metal oxides for establishing high-performance flexible supercapacitors within a confined volume.
