Hierarchical flower-like NiO microsphere was successfully synthesized by a simple one-step template-free hydrothermal process, using l-lysine as precipitator and nickel sulfate as nickel source. The as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscope, high-resolution transmission electron microscope, and the electrochemical workstation. The electrochemical results show that the flower-like NiO microspheres exhibit specific capacitance as large as 324 F g-1 at the current density of 2 A g-1 and the specific capacitance retention can maintain 83 % after 1,000 cycles at the current density of 20 A g-1 in 6 M KOH.
