This paper presents a novel structural supercapacitor based on graphene and hardened cement paste. The maximum specific capacitance is more than 10 F g-1 at the current density of 1A g-1. The almost ideal rectangular cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve of the structural supercapacitors means that there is no pseudocapacitance effect. The triangular charge-discharge plots of the structural supercapacitor indicate an ideal double layer mechanism in the structural supercapacitor. Both the compressive strength and specific capacitance increase as the water-cement ratio decreases. But they don't change consistently with cement hydration time. As the cement hydrates, the strength increases, but the specific capacitance decreases and tends to a constant value.
