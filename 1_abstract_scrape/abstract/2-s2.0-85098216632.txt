Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) consisted of metal ions and organic linker have been successful applied to energy storage device as promising electrode materials candidates for energy storage. However, pristine MOFs have been limited application due to poor electrical conductivity and stability. Here, we design ultra-thin Ni-MOF@NiS2 nanosheet arrays derived from Ni-MOF as self-sacrificed template and precursor. Particularly, this unique heterostructure not only enhances the conductivity but also holds the porous Ni-MOF structure. The as-prepared Ni-MOF@NiS2 electrode delivers a superior specific capacity and rate performance compared with the Ni-MOF electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) consisting of Ni-MOF@NiS2 and active carbon shows good cycling stability and high power density and energy density. This work may provide an innovative strategy for the rational preparation of MOF arrays electrode.
