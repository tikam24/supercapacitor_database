The paper is concerned with the comparison of four basic control strategies of the on-board energy storage system. The energy storage system is able to increase the tram efficiency and decrease operating costs. The comparing criteria are energy savings of strategies. Energy savings are calculated via stochastic model of the real tram line. Return on the investment is also estimated in this paper.
