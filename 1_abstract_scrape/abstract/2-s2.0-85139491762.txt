With the interconnection of all things realizing, the demand amount for green, sustainable and high stability energy storage materials is increasing. Biomass-derived carbon has attracted more attention due to its rich pore structure, large specific surface area, environmental friendliness and considerable economic value. In this paper, the structure and synthesis methods of biomass-derived carbon were introduced, and the research status of biomass-derived carbon electrode materials was summarized. The new development trend and new challenges of biomass-derived carbon electrode materials were put forward, which provided ideas for future rational design of biomass-derived carbon energy storage materials.
