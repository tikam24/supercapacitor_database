Nickel–cobalt hydroxide thin films were synthesized using the chemical bath deposition method, and the effect of thermal annealing (373–673 K) on their physicochemical and electrochemical characteristics was explored. The X-ray diffraction study showed a cubic crystalline structure of NiCo2O4 electrode formed above annealing temperature of 573 K. Field emission scanning electron spectroscopy (FE-SEM) study revealed that after annealing, NiCo2O4 electrode showed urchin-like microspheres morphology with superhydrophilic nature. The electrode annealed at 573 K exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance with a specific capacitance of 470 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1 current density. Over 2000 cycles, electrode demonstrated capacitive retention of 75.55%. Finally, NiCo2O4 and Fe2O3 thin films were used to construct the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device. The ASC device manifested energy density of 40 Wh kg−1 at power density of 1.66 kW kg−1 and 82% retention after 2000 CV cycles. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
