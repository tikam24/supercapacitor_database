In this paper, rGO-TiO2-MoO3, an active electrode material is synthesized by simple hydrothermal method and validated for high performance supercapacitor application. The anatase phase of TiO2 and orthorhombic phase of MoO3are distributed on the surface of the graphene sheet, which is confirmed by few characterization techniques, namely, X-ray diffraction technique (XRD), micro-Raman, Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) and High Resolutionâ€“Transmission Electron Microscope (HR-TEM). Further, the chemical composition of the prepared material is elucidated by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical performance of the active material is estimated by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic Charge-Discharge (GCD) studies. The specific capacitance value of the prepared composite is calculated to be 472 F/gat current density 1 A/g in 2 M Na2SO4 electrolyte solution. The coulomb efficiency and the capacitance retention of the rGO-TiO2-MoO3 composite are estimated to be 98% and 98.6% at current density 7 A/g, respectively.
