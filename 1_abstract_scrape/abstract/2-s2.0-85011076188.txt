N incorporated carbon materials are proven to be efficient EDLCs electrode materials. In this work, aniline modified fungus served as a raw material, and N-doped porous activated carbon is prepared via an efficient KOH activation method. A porous network with a high specific surface area of 2339 m2 g-1 is displayed by the prepared carbon material, resulting in a high accessible surface area and low ion diffusion resistance which is desirable for EDLC electrode materials. In assembled EDLCs, the N-AC based electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 218 F g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Besides, excellent stability is displayed after 5000 continuous cycles at different current densities ranging from 0.1 to 10 A g-1. The present work reveals a promising candidate for electrode materials of EDLCs.
