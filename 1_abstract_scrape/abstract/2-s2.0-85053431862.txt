Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) provides power compensation by configuring energy storage unit to stabilize system frequency and primary frequency regulation, but energy storage alone cannot solve contradiction between power density and energy density. This paper analyzes SG transient response process and decomposes rotor inertia power and regulating valve power by power decoupling. By comparing operating characteristics of different energy storages, feasibility of introducing a mixed form of energy storage is theoretically analyzed. In this paper, lead-acid battery and supercapacitor are integrated into structure of virtual synchronous generator. By introducing different reference quantities, different characteristics of static energy storage can be simulated for rotating rotor and mechanical control valve, so that different power configurations can be realized respectively. Finally, a related simulation model is built in MATLAB/Simulink to verify effectiveness of the proposed idea.
