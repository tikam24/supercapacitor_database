We demonstrate a novel and scalable route for synthesizing NiCo2O4nanorods via solid state reactions at room temperature coupled with a simple post annealing treatment. The as-prepared samples are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments. The electrochemical performances of NiCo2O4are characterized by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. The results reveal that the NiCo2O4nanorods manifest a high specific capacitance of 565 F g-1(1 mg cm-2loading) at a current density of 1 A g-1with superior rate capability and good cycling stability. The good electrochemical properties combined with the facile and cost-effective preparation method will render it attractive for promising application in supercapacitors.
