The development of an economical, eco-friendly, and easy method for the production of carbon nanosheets and heteroatom-doped carbon nanosheets has been a challenge for material scientists. In this study, we developed a method for the synthesis of carbon nanosheets (CNS) and nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (NCNS) of high quality from organic compounds. We exploited the electrostatic interaction among ionic crystals (NaCl in the present case) and polarized aromatic molecules (3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) and 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) in this work) to obtain uniform coverage of the latter over the surface of the ionic crystal. This NaCl-PTCDA/PTCDI assembly, on pyrolysis at 700 °C followed by washing with water, yields high-quality CNS and NCNS depending on the aromatic precursor employed. The sheets obtained consist of minimum 2-3 layers (?2 nm) as observed from atomic force microscopy. The process demonstrated is highly scalable, economical, eco-friendly, nonhazardous, and relatively fast. Moreover, the NCNS derived from PTCDI is applied for energy storage application by fabricating an electrochemical capacitor that exhibits an area normalized capacitance of 23 μF cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is the same as that reported for the single-layer nitrogen-doped graphene. Furthermore, an NCNS-carbon black composite is prepared and applied to a high-performance solid-state supercapacitor that exhibited a capacitance of 300 mF cm-2
