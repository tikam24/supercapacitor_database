Exploring novel porous carbon-based materials with improved electrochemical performance is of great importance for their practical application in energy storage systems. Herein, we report a one-step strategy for the synthesis of porous carbon constructed by highly interconnected micro-/mesoporous thin walls, which exhibits excellent capacitive performance in organic electrolyte. The specific capacitance can reach to 208 F/g at 0.75 A /g and still sustain 188 F/g at 10 A/g while the IR drop only increasing from 0.01 to 0.22 V. All of these results suggesting that the as-synthesized porous carbon material is very attractive as electrode material for high-performance supercapacitor.
