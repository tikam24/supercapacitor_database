Hierarchical porous N-doped carbon submicrospheres (HPNCs) are synthesized at 1000 °C by a facile molten salt method using diaminomaleonitrile as a precursor, iron trichloride as a catalyst, and ZnCl2-KCl to form the molten salt medium. The results indicated that the pore structure of resultant HPNCs could be tuned by changing the amount of iron catalyst, and those prepared with adding 7.1 wt% FeCl3·6H2O showed the highest specific surface area (3155 m2/g) and largest hierarchical pore volume (2.2 cm3/g) with micropore and mesopore surface areas of 808 m2/g and 2347 m2/g, respectively, in addition to their high mesopore ratio up to 84.4%. The resultant HPNCs showed outstanding specific capacitance up to 455 F/g in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution at a current density of 0.5 A/g, a considerably high energy density of 93.6 Wh/kg and high capacitance retention of 95% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, they exhibited high adsorption capacities of 812.2 mg/g and 805.2 mg/g, for methylene blue and methyl orange adsorption, respectively, and high CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.4 mmol/g at 25 °C and at an equilibrium pressure of 1 bar.
