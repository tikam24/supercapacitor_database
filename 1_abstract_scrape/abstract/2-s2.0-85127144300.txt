Transition metal oxides have obtained considerable research attention in energy storage devices. In this study, we demonstrate the preparation of hierarchical CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2 nanowire arrays (CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni) by a combination of hydrothermal reactions and annealing process. This hybrid CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni electrode possesses a significantly enhanced capacity of 8.5 F cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 (3017.9 F g−1 at 0.4 A g−1). Additionally, the assembled all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni//AC ASC) displays a comparable energy density of 76.2 Wh kg−1. Meanwhile, the prepared CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni anode revealed initial discharge capacity (~3548.2 mAh g−1). After 50 cycles, the CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni anode also shows a satisfied cycling stability (1437.4 mAh g−1 of capacity maintained). Further, the LED devices can be lit up for more 230 min by the assembled CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni cell. Therefore, this novel CoMn2O4 @Ni(OH)2/Ni materials with excellent electrochemical property have great potential in the high energy storage applications.
