In this work, graphene nanoparticle (GNP)-embedded polyaniline-polypyrrole (PANI-PPy) hybrid nanocomposite in different ratios were prepared by in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization using ammonium per sulphate (APS) as oxidizing agent and explored as electrode material for supercapacitor application. Various weight percentages of the GNP were added to the (1:1) molar ratio solution of aniline and pyrrole so as to generate the GNP-PANI-PPy nanocomposites. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characterizations conformed the formation of homogeneous composite having GNP-embedded in to the PANI-PPy hybrid polymer matrix. The electrochemical activity of the nanocomposite was examined in three electrodes and two electrode configurations. It was found that the cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge studies revealed the excellent redox characteristics of the generated hybrid nanocomposites with high specific capacitance as high as 195 F g-1. The specific capacitance was found to be strongly influenced by the GNP amount. The symmetric device consisting of (GNP-PANI-PPy|Electrolyte|GNP-PANI-PPy) was constructed and its energy storage performances were evaluated and presented.
