A novel pseudo-solid polymer electrolyte membrane (PSPEM) has been prepared for activated carbon electric double-layer capacitor. The membrane was characterized as a combination of polymer hydrogel and solid polymer electrolyte. The capacitor with pseudo-solid polymer electrolyte exhibited almost the same capacitance and power characteristics as that with KOH aqueous electrolyte. The cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge cycle tests and impedance spectroscopic measurement suggested that the electrolyte membrane is stable under this charge-discharge voltage condition, and the capacitor with the pseudo-solid polymer electrolyte membrane showed a better reversibility and cycle ability.
