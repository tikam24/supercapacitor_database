The carbon nanotube (CNTs) can be considered equivalent to a graphene sheet rolled into a seamless tube capped on both ends. CNTs can be divided into multi-walled carbon canotubes (MWNTs) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) according to the number of graphene layers. CNTs have high modulus and tensile along the axial because the tube wall of CNTs is composed of the sp2 hybridized orbitals hexagonal carbon atoms network, which can be used to reinforce the mechanical properties of the composite material. The cylindrical structure of CNTs will cause the quantum confinement and σ-π rehybridization. This structural feature of the rehybridization and electron confinement can give carbon nanotubes unique optical, electronic, magnetic, thermal, chemical and mechanical properties. CNTs with the hollow tubular structure also can be used as a reactor and storage container. However, problems arise from the small size of the pipe diameter; surface deficiency and serious agglomeration badly restrict the development of CNTs. The appearance of CMTs makes up for the shortages of CNTs. CMTs have the same tubular structure as CNTs. CMTs have a micro-scale pipe diameter and a large outside surface for a tube wall while maintaining a nano-scale tube wall thickness, which is equivalent to a micro-scale graphene membrane. So, CMTs possess the unique physical and chemical properties of both the CNTs and graphene. A comprehensive study of the performance of the CMTs shows that the tube wall of the CMTs has a well-defined structure of graphene, micro-scale hollow structure lumen, large specific surface area and favorable electrical and mechanical properties. With superior electrical properties, CMTs can be applied in quantum wires and transistor array. At the same time, because of their excellent chemical and electrochemical properties, they can also be applied in lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors and hydrogen storage materials, etc.
