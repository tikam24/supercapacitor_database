Manganese oxide/carbon composite electrode was synthesized using liquid-phase plasma method, to be applied to supercapacitor. Spherical manganese oxide nanoparticles smaller than 10 nm were dispersed uniformly on the surface of YP-50F. The increase in the amount of manganese oxide precipitated on YP-50F resulted in improved specific capacitance, charge-discharge rate, and Warburg impedance but specific surface area and total pore volume were decreased.
