Hydrothermally synthesized electrodes of Co3O4@GO, MnO2@GO and Co3O4/MnO2@GO were produced for usages in supercapacitors. Graphene oxide (GO) was incorporated in the nanocomposites used for electrodes synthesis due to its great surface area and electrical conductivity. The synergistic alliance among these composites and GO enhance electrodes performance, life span and stability. The structural properties as obtained from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest that nanocomposites are crystalline in nature. The morphological studies indicated that the nanocomposites have platelet nanoparticles with some agglomerations. The energy bandgaps estimated for the Co3O4@GO, MnO2@GO and Co3O4/MnO2@GO are 2.38 eV, 2.05 eV and 2.33 eV respectively The electrochemical studies provided highest specific capacitance from CV using 10 mV/s scan rates and GCD using 1.0 A/g current density were 765, 1215, 1518 and 975, 1358, 1718 F/g for Co3O4@GO, MnO2@GO and Co3O4/MnO2@GO respectively. These results obviously indicate that composites perform better than single transition metal oxide and the addition of graphene oxide enhanced electrodes performance.
