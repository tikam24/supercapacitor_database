In this paper, we focus on impacts of thermal cycling ageing on supercapacitors performances at a constant voltage. We compare obtained results with those coming from simple calendar ageing at constant temperature and voltage. The comparison is based on physics modeling parameters evolution based on results from experimental measurements during calendar ageing up to 10000 h and 6000 h, 8000 h for thermal cycling tests. Finally, the impacts of thermal cycling interval is highlighted and quantified. Â© 2014 IEEE.
