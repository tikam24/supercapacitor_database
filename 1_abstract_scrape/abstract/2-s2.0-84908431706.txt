A macroporous graphene network was prepared through polyethyleneimine-induced coagulation of graphene-oxide nanosheets from the dispersion. The as-prepared electrode made of graphene assemblies exhibited the high surface areal specific capacitance of 46.3 Î¼F cm-2, excellent rate performance, and long cyclic life, which are attributed to the face-to-edge aggregation of exfoliated single-layer graphene nanosheets.
