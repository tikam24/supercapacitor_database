MoSe 2 nanosheets spheres (MoSe 2 ·NSs) were synthesized directly on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (MoSe 2 –rGO) using a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach, which was used for supercapacitor. The synergistic effect of the MoSe 2 ·NSs and the highly conductive rGO network endows the MoSe 2 –rGO composite excellent electrochemical performance. The effect of the content of graphene in the composite were investigated in details. The optimal electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 814.4 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 in 2 M KOH. Moreover, the assembled supercapacitor delivers a high specific capacitance of 215.7 F g −1 at 1 A g −1 and retains 81.7% of the initial capacitance at 10 A g −1 after 5000 cycles. It suggests that it has potential as an electrode material for high-performance electrochemical supercapacitors.
