The paper presents the results of studies on the formation of planar capacitive systems based on nanoporous anodic oxide films and a conducting polymer. According to voltammetry data, the capacity of the systems under study was determined. The structure of the porous layers was judged by impedance spectroscopy and electron microscopy.
