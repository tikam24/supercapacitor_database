Abstract: Carboxyl functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs-COOH)/cotton flexible supercapacitor electrode is prepared by a simple and efficient method with high conductivity and excellent electrochemical properties. Firstly, MWCNTs-COOH were successfully loaded on the cotton fabric by improved one-time dipping method, while conducted at high temperature and pressure for 2 h can effectively increase their dense on the substrate. Secondly, the as-prepared composite was pre-oxidized and carbonized at high temperature to increase the carbon content of this composite. The resultant composite obtained high conductivity and large specific area. The electrochemical analysis showed that the maximum specific capacitance of the composite reached 94.3 F g−1 at a current rate of 0.81 A g−1. After 3000 cycles and different angles bending, the composite demonstrated good stability and huge potential in the application of flexible supercapacitor electrode.
