A battery is the key component in Battery Electric Vehicles. Main challenge for the Battery Electric Vehicle is low range and need frequent charging. Another issue is the longer charging time required by the batteries. In this review paper different types of batteries and their development is discussed. Lithium Ion, Zebra and Lead acid battery are discussed from Battery Electric Vehicle point of view. Electric motors another key component in electric vehicles is discussed with application of batteries point. The technological development in the batteries to overcome barriers for the electrical vehicle can be a solution, but use of super capacitor or small internal combustion engines as range extender in conjunction with the batteries sounds to be an smart alternative for the market penetration of electric vehicles. This paper will provide current trends in this field.
