Graphite nanosheets have been grown on Ni foam by radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, which are used as substrates for electrodepositon of Ni(OH)2 with a porous and 3D nanostructure. The Ni foam/graphite nanosheets/Ni(OH)2 electrode has a high specific capacitance of 1667 F g-1 and the specific capacitance can maintain 93.3% after 700 cycles at the current density of 60 A g-1 in 1 M KOH.
