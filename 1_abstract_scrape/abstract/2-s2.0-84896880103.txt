This contribution deals with the fabrication of electrode and supercapacitor cell using a new dynamic air-brush deposition technique. This method allows to achieve extremely (ou highly) uniform mats with finely tuned thickness and weight in a completely reproducible way. Using this deposition technique, we have analyzed the effect of mixture of CNTs and graphene/graphite on the electrode and cell properties (energy, power and capacitance). using a mixture of 75% of graphene/graphite and 25% of CNTs we increased the power by a factor 2.5 compared to bare CNTs based electrodes. We also analyzed the effect of the weight firstly on the capacitance and specific energy and then on the specific power. We were able to reach a specific power of 200kW/Kg and a specific energy of 9.1Wh/Kg with an electrode having a surface of 2cm 2 and a weight of 0.25mg composed by 50% of CNTs and graphene/graphite (using a common aqueous electrolyte). using our deposition technique we are able to achieve supercapacitors with ad-hoc characteristics simply modulating the weight and the concentration of the mixture in a completely reproducible way.
