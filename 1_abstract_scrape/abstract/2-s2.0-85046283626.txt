In this work, the MnS/reduced graphite oxide grown on Ni foam (MnS/RGO@Ni foam) is prepared by simultaneously growing MnS and RGO on Ni foam, and activated carbon using biomass walnut shell as carbon source by KOH activation method. The hybrid supercapacitor can be established using battery-type MnS/RGO@Ni foam and capacitor-type activated carbon as positive and negative electrodes respectively. Surprisingly, the hybrid supercapacitor shows good electrochemical performances, such as the energy density of 37.9 Wh/kg at a power density of 1500 W/kg, and even the energy density of 21.3 Wh/kg at a high power density of 3750 W/kg.
