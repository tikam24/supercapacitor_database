A capacitive negative electrode material of Fe3N has been synthesized via a simple precursor ammoniation treatment. Electrochemical measure shows that the electrode exhibits a specific capacitance of 270Ḟg-1 at a current density of 0.5Ȧg-1 in 6M KOH, 66% of the initial value remains at a specific current density of 5Ȧg-1. Capacitance retention after 5000 cycles is about 61.5% of the initial capacitance. The electrochemical performance is relatively great in comparison with the literature reports of some Fe-based compounds. Because of the low cost and simple preparation method of Fe3N, the material is promising in electrochemical capacitive energy storage applications.
