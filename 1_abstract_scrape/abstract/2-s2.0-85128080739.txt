An event-triggered model predictive control (ET-MPC) method for energy management of hybrid power source (HPS) is proposed. In this method, the model predictive control (MPC) part will not be activated and the output of the MPC controller remain the same as the last time instant until the state of the system exceed the preset threshold. Thus, compared to conventional MPC method, the ET-MPC scheme can help ease the computational burden while ensuring similar regulation performance as MPC. Various simulation studies were conducted and comparing to classic MPC controller, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed ET-MPC method is verified in the simulation analysis.
