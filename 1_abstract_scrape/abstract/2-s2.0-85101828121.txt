Nickel sulfide (NiS) nanosheet on carbon fibers (CFs) was prepared by using the hydrothermal method. By varying the concentration ratios, the morphology and size of NiS could be effectively controlled, which was conducive to the improvement of the electrochemical performance. The experimental findings revealed the formation of the uniformly distributed NiS nanosheet on the surface of the pre-treated carbon fibers, and the average NiS size for 2-NiS/CFs was about 200 nm. The specific capacitance of 2-NiS/CFs could reach 534.8 F路g-1 at 1 A路g-1. Further, the composite material could maintain its capacitance retention rate of 86% after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the supercapacitor exhibited a high energy density of 18.7 Wh路kg-1 at a power density of 252 W路kg-1. The unique structure of the NiS nanosheet/CFs electrode materials accelerated the electrochemical reaction between the electrolyte and electrode. The pseudo-capacitance of the composite materials is needed to be improved further.
