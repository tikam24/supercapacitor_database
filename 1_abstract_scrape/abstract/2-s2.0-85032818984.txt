Iron sulfide, commonly known as fool's gold, is rapidly emerging as an attractive material for both energy conversion (in photovoltaics) and energy storage, especially as an electrode in lithium-ion batteries. In this manuscript, we report on a simple one-pot two-step technique for synthesis of carbon nanofiber (CNF) cross-linked FeS2 networks, by microwave pyrolysis of ferrocene to iron decorated CNF and its subsequent sulfidation by a sustainable source, namely, L-cysteine. When used as the negative electrode in lithium-ion batteries, our 3D mesoporous FeS2–CNF hybrids exhibit high capacity of 994 mAhg−1 even after 300 cycles, which exceeds the theoretical capacity of FeS2 (894 mAhg−1). Additionally, when applied as super-capacitor electrodes, our microwave-synthesized FeS2–CNF electrodes exhibit high capacitance of 612 and 342 Fg-1 at 5 and 100 mVs−1, respectively, and long-term cyclability, with 97% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles.
