Vanadium nitride/vanadium sesquioxide/amorphous carbon (denoted as VN/V 2 O 3 /C) composite is successfully synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using ammonium metavanadate and glucose as the starting materials combined with a calcination process. Results show that VN/V 2 O 3 nanoparticles (main VN and minor V 2 O 3 ) are highly scattered on the amorphous carbon which is partly graphitized. VN/V 2 O 3 /C composite possesses the mesoporous structure with BET specific surface area of 134 m 2 ·g −1 , and the pore volume of 0.180 cm 3 ·g −1 . Electrochemical properties of VN/V 2 O 3 /C composite are investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (ESI). VN/V 2 O 3 /C composite electrode exhibits the satisfied electrochemical properties with the specific capacitance of 169 F·g −1 at 5 mV·s −1 (138F·g −1 at 0.5 A·g −1 ) and cycling behavior of 99.4% after 4000 cycles. Furthermore, VN/V 2 O 3 /C symmetric supercapacitor (denoted as VN/V 2 O 3 /C SSC) devices are assembled to assess their practical application. VN/V 2 O 3 /C SSC device exhibits the excellent electrochemical performance with the areal capacitance of 129 mF·cm −2 (16.2 F·g −1 ) at 5 mV·s −1 and 82 mF·cm −2 (10.3 F·g −1 ) at 0.5 mA·cm −2 , cycling stability of 87% after 2000 cycles, and the energy density of 92 mWh·m −2 (1.55 W·h·kg −1 ) at the power density of 2.25 W·m −2 (14 W·kg −1 ). The impressive finding in this work demonstrates that the VN/V 2 O 3 /C composite can be considered as a promising candidate for high-performance energy storage materials.
