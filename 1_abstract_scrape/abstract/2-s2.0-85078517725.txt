Hybrid electric power systems based on fuel cell stack and energy storage sources like batteries and ultracapacitors are a plausible solution to vehicle electrification due to their balance between acceleration performance and range. Having a high degree of hybridization can be advantageous, considering the different characteristics of the power sources. Some parameters to be considered are: specific power and energy, energy and power density, lifetime, cost among others. Ultracapacitors (UC) are of particular interest in electric vehicle applications due to its high-power capability, which is commonly required during acceleration. UCs are commonly used without a power electronics interface due to the high-power processing requirement. Although connecting UCs directly to the DC bus, without using a power converter, presents considerable advantages, the main disadvantage is related to the UC energy-usage capability, which is limited by constant DC bus control. This paper proposes a novel energy-management strategy based on a fuzzy inference system, for fuel-cell/battery/ultracapacitor hybrid electric vehicles. The proposed strategy is able to control the charge and discharge of the UC bank in order to take advantage of its energy storage capability. Experimental results show that the proposed strategy reduces the waste of energy due to dynamic brake in 14%. This represents a reduction in energy consumption from 218 Wh/km to 192 Wh/km for the same driving conditions. By using the proposed energy management strategy, the estimated fuel efficiency in miles per gallon equivalent was also increase from 96 mpge to 109 mpge.
