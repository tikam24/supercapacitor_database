The increasing number of devices needed by wearable systems to bring radical advances in healthcare, robotics, and human-machine interfaces is a threat to their growth if the integration and energy-related challenges are not managed. A natural solution is to reduce the number of devices while retaining the functionality or simply using multifunctional devices, as demonstrated here through a stretchable supercapacitor (SSC) with intrinsic strain sensing. The presented SSC was obtained by electrodeposition of nanoflower MnOx on fabric (as a pseudocapacitive electrode) and three-dimensional conductive wrapping of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to boost the performance. Among fabricated devices, the stretchable PEDOT:PSS/MnOx/PEDOT:PSS supercapacitor (SPMP-SC) showed the best performance (specific capacitance of 580 mF·cm-2 (108.1 F·g-1); energy density of 51.4 μWh·cm-2 at 0.5 mA). The stretchability (0-100%; 1000 cycles) analysis of SPMP-SC with Ecoflex encapsulation showed high capacitance retention (>90% for 40% stretch). The intrinsic strain sensing of the SSC was confirmed by the linear variation of capacitance (sensitivity -0.4%) during stretching. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, the application of SSC with intrinsic sensing was demonstrated for health monitoring through volumetric expansion of a manikin during ventilator operation and in robotics and by measuring the joint angle of a robotic hand.
