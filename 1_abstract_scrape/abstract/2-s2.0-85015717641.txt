In present article, the chemical bath deposition method is used to prepare three dimensional NiCo2O4 thin films and used as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. The effect of reaction time on the supercapacitive performance is studied by varying the reaction time from 2 to 6 h. The 3D NiCo2O4 electrode delivers high specific capacitance of 540 F/g at scan rate of 5 mV/s with better cycling stability by retaining 93.5% initial capacitance after 1000 cycle. Additionally, the 3D NiCo2O4 electrode shows acceptable energy density of 56 Wh/kg at power density of 5.7 kW/kg. These excellent supercapacitive performance indicate the NiCo2O4 nanoflower like structure is a promising electrode material for future energy storage devices.
