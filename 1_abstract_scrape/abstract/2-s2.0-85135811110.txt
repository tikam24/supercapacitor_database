To improve the electrochemical performance of the solid-state supercapacitor, we have developed (PVA)-H2SO4-[Co(en)3]Cl3·3H2O gel polymer electrolyte by blending of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), H2SO4, and [Co(en)3]Cl3·3H2O. The electrochemical performance was analysed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The incorporation of redox mediator [Co(en)3]Cl3 into the gel polymer electrolyte PVA-H2SO4 results in an excellent capacitive property with 96% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. At a current density of 0.1 A g−1, the developed PVA-H2SO4-[Co(en)3]Cl3 electrolyte exhibits high specific capacitance of 522 F g−1, which has a capacity gain of 46% over the PVA-H2SO4-based electrolyte. The energy density and power density are 42.49 Wh kg−1 and 76.5 W kg−1, respectively. Concurrently, PVA-H2SO4-[Co(en)3]Cl3 displays ionic conductivity of 17.52 mS cm−1.
