As a good film electrode material for supercapacitor, carboxyl ruthenium oxide has been prepared using precursor of isopropyl alcohol solution of RuCl3·3H2O by in-situ decomposition. The phase structure, micro-morphology and capacitance of the film have been studied by infrared spectrometer, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and electrochemical method, respectively. The results show that the film is RuOδ (OOCCH3)λ·nH2O after heat treated at 270°C for 2 h. The specific capacitance of the film decreases gradually and the fast charging and discharging performance improves with temperature increasing. Once the film being treated at 270°C for 2 h with specific surface area of 88 m2/g, its specific capacitance reaches 859 F/g, and maintains at 99.7% after 16000 charge-discharge cycles. The adhesive force of the film is measured to be 20.13 MPa.
