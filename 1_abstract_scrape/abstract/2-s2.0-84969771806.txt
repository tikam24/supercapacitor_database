Graphene/MnO2 nano-composite was electrochemically synthesized for application to an electrode material for electrochemical supercapacitors. The nanosized needle-like MnO2 was obtained by use of a graphene substrate. The prepared composite exhibited an ideal supercapacitive behavior. A capacitance retention of 94% was achieved with a 4 h deposition time (an initial capacitance of 574 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 20 mV/s) and the retention declined with further deposition time. The results demonstrate enhanced contact between the electrode and electrolyte and improved power density as an electrochemical capacitor.
