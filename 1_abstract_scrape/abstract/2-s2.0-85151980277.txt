Worldwide, various factors have caused an increase in energy consumption. So, the requirement for renewable and green energy sources becomes a gradually important problem. Nowadays, improvements in energy-related conversion methods such as metal-air batteries, electrochemical water splitting, supercapacitors, etc., are very significant fields of research. Nanostructures of metal phosphate and phosphonate compounds are of tremendous attention in today's technological applications, because of their presence of hollow spaces, high surface area, and straightforward adjusting composition and dimensions. Phosphorus compounds like metal phosphates and metal phosphonates have demonstrated perfect performances and excellent potential in electrochemical applications and devices. This chapter reviews some electrochemical applications such as water splitting and energy storage devices using metal phosphate and phosphonates were examined in the last two decades of improvement.
