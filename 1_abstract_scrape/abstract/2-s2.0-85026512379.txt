The urgent need for sustainable development of human society has forced material scientists to explore novel materials starting from cheap natural precursors for next-generation energy storage devices by using environmentally friendly strategies. In this work, heteroatom-functionalized porous carbonaceous materials with 3D hierarchical and interconnected honeycomb-like structure have been successfully synthesized by using waste biomass pomelo peel as raw material through the combination of hydrothermal carbonization and followed KOH activation procedure. Benefiting from the unique honeycomb-like structure and high specific surface area, the as-obtained carbon material exhibits satisfactory capacitive behavior: 374 F/g at 0.1 A/g; excellent cycling stability of 92.5% capacitance retention over continuous 5000 cycles. More importantly, the as-assembled symmetric supercapacitors based on as-prepared electrode material can deliver high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 20 W h/kg and 18.7 W h/L in 6 M KOH, respectively, as well as outstanding cycling stability. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility for taking full advantage of sustainable and large scale advanced carbon materials by choosing waste biomass, particularly the pomelo peel as a raw material.
