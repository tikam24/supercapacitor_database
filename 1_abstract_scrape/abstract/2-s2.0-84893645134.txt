A model of a supercapacitor with pseudocapacitance focusing on effects along the thickness of the electrode was developed. Fast charging, i.e. high power density operation, was analyzed. The occurrence of moving reaction fronts under these conditions is found and discussed. Indicators of the occurrence of moving reaction fronts were defined by analyzing the reaction front velocity and deriving the reaction penetration depth. Effects of the moving reaction fronts on cyclic voltammograms were simulated and an asymmetric broadening of the oxidation peak was found. The influence of the moving reaction fronts on the performance of the supercapacitor was investigated by means of charging energy analysis. Losses were found mainly at the end of the oxidation phase. Partial charging under fast charging conditions reduces the losses. The scale-up of the electrode mass loading and thus the influence of the thickness was analyzed. Simulation results could be used as an "operation map" to avoid conditions with significant losses. Â© 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.
