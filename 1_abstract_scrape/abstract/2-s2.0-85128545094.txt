A supercapacitor is a major electrochemical energy storage device with significant applications including electronics, automobile, military and space etc. Although these devices have tremendous power density and cyclic life, their practical applications are hindered due to low energy density. In the 21st century, researchers are looking to replace batteries by supercapacitors via improving the energy density without compromising the power and lifetime. It would revolutionize the storage technology in order to realize compact, efficient, lightweight, cost-effective, and safe storage devices. The emerging two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have attracted tremendous attention as supercapacitive electrode materials owing to their fascinating electrochemical and physical properties. Further engineering of 2D materials offers outstanding properties to boost the performance of supercapacitors. This chapter discusses a cutting edge overview of 2D materials, their engineering aspects, propertiesâ€™ correlations, and advantages of supercapacitor devices. The various strategies of engineering 2D materials with suitable examples are mentioned. The physical and electrochemical properties of 2D electrode materials that are systematically regulated via appropriate engineering are described with noteworthy examples. Finally the future prospects of engineering 2D materials are discussed.
