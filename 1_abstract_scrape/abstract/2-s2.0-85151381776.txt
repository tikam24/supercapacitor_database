The surface charge amplification (SCA) phenomenon at the ionic liquid/cavity interface has been investigated as a result of co-ion electrosorption due to increasing the alkyl chain length of imidazolium. Three types of ionic liquids with different imidazolium alkyl chain lengths inside the different-sized spherical cavities of porous electrodes have been studied using the coarse-grained model within the framework of classical density functional theory (CDFT). Our results show that selectivity occurs at lower potentials for ionic liquids with longer cation chain lengths in smaller cavities. The significant point is that at low negative surface potentials for asymmetric ionic liquids, the electrosorption of anions as co-ions occurs in some spatial regions that are made possible by the accidental orientation of cations in the first layer in the vicinity of the cavity surface. This is evidence of the SCA phenomenon for asymmetric ionic liquids at the ionic liquid/cavity interface. Moreover, the comparison of results, especially the normalized screening strength in the first layer indicates that the smaller cavities containing the ionic liquid with cations that have longer alkyl chains amplify the electrode surface charge more.
