A hierarchical porous carbon nanorods (HPCRs) with highly interconnected three-dimensional conductivity networks derived from metal-organic frameworks have been successfully synthesized via a simple carbonization method. The resultant HPCRs shows an stable porous structure with abundant micro/mesopore on two-dimensional squared shape carbon nanosheets and also between the closely cross-linked carbon sheets. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the HPCRs materials as electrodes for supercapacitor deliver a high specific capacitance of 274 F g −1 at 0.5 A g −1 with an enhanced rate capability in basic media. Moreover, a considerable energy density of 6.77 W h kg −1 at power density of 100 W kg −1 are exhibited for solid-state symmetric supercapacitor. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor also works well under 0 and −20 °C with a remarkable temperature endurance. The large-scale production of unique hierarchical porous carbon nanorods with high efficiency, low cost and one-step synthesis method will be effective electrode materials in energy storage applications.
