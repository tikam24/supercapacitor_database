Flexible solid-state supercapacitors (FSSCs) have attracted increasing interest for the development of portable and wearable electronics. However, the widely application of FSSCs has been limited by relatively deficient of the electrode materials, such as low electrical conductivity and modest reaction kinetics, which limit the practical energy output and stability. Herein, we introduce the design and fabrication of a sophisticated FSSCs device which consists of conducting carbon materials modified transition metal oxides/hydroxides nanorod arrays (NRAs). The well-defined carbon conducting layer was rationally introduced on the micro NRAs substrate by using metal-organic framework (MOF) as precursor, which was epitaxial grown on the surface of ZnO NRAs. Subsequently, the as-synthesized ZnO@MOF core-shell NRAs were transformed to the well-uniformed ZnO@C@CoNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) and Fe2O3@C core-shell NRAs through in situ electrodeposition and cation exchange strategy, respectively. Furthermore, an asymmetric ZnO@C@CoNi-LDH//Fe2O3@C FSSC device was constructed with a high energy density (1.078 mW h cm–3), power density (0.4 W cm–3) as well as outstanding cycling lifespans (retention 95.01% after 10,000 charge/discharge cycles), which is superior to majority asymmetric FSSCs.
