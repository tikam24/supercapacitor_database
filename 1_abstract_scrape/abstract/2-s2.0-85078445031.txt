With the increasing demand for green energy, the cheap tea waste is recycled to produce three-dimensional framework of porous carbon nanosheets materials with commercial value and excellent electrochemical properties. The TPCN-6 materials were prepared by simultaneous pyrolysis/activation. The density and pore structure of the material depend on the activation concentration. Due to the microporous structure and reasonable pore size distribution of the porous carbon, the TPCN material shows a high specific capacitance of 482.1 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and perfect cycling stability (retaining 87.6% after 6000 cycles at 10 A g-1) in 6 M KOH aqueous electrolyte. The optimum symmetric supercapacitor device base on TPCN-6//TPCN-6 diaplayed a supreme energy density of 19.1 Wh kg-1 and power density of 325 W kg-1. What's more, it offers a potential way to recycle tea waste into high-valued product in large-scale with disposing of biological waste to relieve environmental concerns.
