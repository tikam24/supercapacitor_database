We report the fabrication of binder-free, low-cost and efficient hybrid supercapacitive electrode based on the hexagonal phase of two-dimensional MoS2 nanoworms reinforced with molybdenum nitride nanoflakes deposited on stainless steel (SS) substrate using reactive magnetron sputtering technique. The hybrid nanostructured MoS2-Mo2N/SS thin film working electrode delivers a high gravimetric capacitance (351.62 F g-1 at 0.25 mA cm-2) investigated in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The physisorption/intercalation of sodium (Na+) ions in electroactive sites of MoS2-Mo2N composite ensures remarkable electrochemical performance. The deposited porous nanostructure with good electrical conductivity and better adhesion with the current collector demonstrates a high-energy density of 82.53 Wh kg-1 in addition to a high-power density of 24.98 kW kg-1. Further, excellent capacitance retention of 93.62% after 4000 galvanostatic charge-discharge cycles elucidated it as a promising candidate for realizing high-performance supercapacitor applications.
