The use of nonhalogenated electrolytes for electrochemical devices is very important from the point of view of safety and cost. We have developed a series of quaternary ammonium salts based on halogen-free chelatoborate anions for electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs): four quaternary ammonium bis(oxalato)borates (QABOBs) and tetraethylammonium bis[salicylato(2-)]borate (TEABSB). We investigated the physical and electrochemical properties of the quaternary ammonium chelatoborates and evaluated the performance of EDLCs using them as single electrolyte salts. These properties were compared with those obtained for tetraethylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) as standard substance. Mass and van der Waals volume of chelatoborate ions are higher and larger than those of tetrafluoroborate ion (BF4 â€“). Mass densities, viscosities, and surface tensions of propylene carbonate (PC) solutions containing the quaternary ammonium chelatoborate were higher than those obtained for TEABF4. As a result, conductivities of the PC solutions were lower. However, in the cases of QABOBs, electrochemical stability on an activated carbon electrode and gravimetric capacitances of three-electrode measurement and 2025-type coin cells were comparable to those obtained for TEABF4. The gravimetric capacitance of a negative electrode, at which the surface excess concentration of cations increases, dominated the magnitude of the gravimetric capacitance of a full cell.
