Abstract: Activated carbon Norit Supra DLS 30 and carbon fabrics L-03 and T-040 were studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors with aqueous sodium sulfate. The use of the T-040 fabric led to higher specific capacity than in the case of carbon tape L-03. The decrease in the capacity when cycling the capacitors with electrode materials of both fabrics was almost the same. The introduction of benzotriazole in the electrolyte or electrode material increased the operating voltage and specific characteristics of the supercapacitor.
