The electrical energy required by the remote communities can be supplied efficiently and effectively using a decentralised renewable energy source (RES). However, the stochastic variations in power output of RESs, i.e. solar photovoltaic and wind turbine, and deviations in demand make it difficult to preserve the balance between generation and demand which may jeopardise the stable operation of the system. Moreover, in the islanded systems the lack of inertia due to the replacement of conventional power plants with inverter-based sources cause undesirable influence on the frequency of the supply. Generally, various energy storage systems (ESSs) are proposed in such a grid to overcome this problem. This study investigates the implications of the hybrid ESS (HESS) on the frequency regulation (FR) of an islanded system. Battery ESS and a supercapacitor has been used to form a HESS for the islanded power system. Analysis has been conducted in MATLAB/ Simulink simulation platform. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed HESS in FR of the islanded system.
