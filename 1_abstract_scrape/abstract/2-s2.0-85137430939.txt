Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), which are generally considered to be crystalline materials comprising metal centers and organic ligands, have attracted growing attention because of their controllable structures and high porosity. MOFs based on transition metals (Fe, Co, Ni) are highly efficient electrode materials for electrochemical energy storage. In this review, the characteristics of Fe-MOFs, Co-MOFs, Ni-MOFs, and their derivatives are summarized, and the relationships between the structures and performance are unveiled in depth. Additionally, their applications in lithium–ion batteries, lithium–sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors are discussed. This review sheds light on the development of MOFs and their derivatives to realize excellent electrochemical performance.
