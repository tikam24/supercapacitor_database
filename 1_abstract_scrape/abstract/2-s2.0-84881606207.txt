Supercapacitors hold a promising future in large-scale energy storage field. Due to the low terminal voltage, supercapacitors are compulsory attached in serial in large amount to meet the overall voltage requirement of an energy storage system, whose collapse would probably results from failure of one single cell. Therefore, it is essential to research on ageing and lifetime of supercapacitors. The paper first reviews the ageing characteristic of supercapacitors, and then illustrates the factors which may influence supercapacitor's life span. Additionally, the paper demonstrates the temperature factor, one of the most influencing ageing factors, to verify its effect on supercapacitor's feature parameters. After that, the paper compares the traits as well as the scope of applications between the calendar life test and the cycle life test; both tests' demerits are also evaluated. By analyzing the state-of-the-art, the paper finally predicts the research tendency. Â© 2013 Chinese Society for Electrical Engineering.
