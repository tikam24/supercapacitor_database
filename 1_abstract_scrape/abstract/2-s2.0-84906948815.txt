Electrically conducting wires play a critical role in the advancement of modern electronics and in particular are an important key to the development of next-generation wearable microelectronics. However, the thin conducting wires can easily break during use, and the whole device fails to function as a result. Herein, a new family of high-performance conducting wires that can self-heal after breaking has been developed by wrapping sheets of aligned carbon nanotubes around polymer fibers. The aligned carbon nanotubes offer an effective strategy for the self-healing of the electric conductivity, whereas the polymer fiber recovers its mechanical strength. A self-healable wire-shaped supercapacitor fabricated from a wire electrode of this type maintained a high capacitance after breaking and self-healing. Wires with a will to survive: Self-healable conducting wires were developed by coating electrically conducting carbon nanotubes on the surface of polymer fibers. The wires were used to fabricate wire-shaped supercapacitors, whose high specific capacitance of 140.0 F-g -1 or 1.34 mF-cm-1 was restored after breakage to 92-% by self-healing.
