Forthcoming wearable/flexible electronics with compelling shape diversity and mobile usability have garnered significant attention as a kind of disruptive technology to drastically change our daily lives. From a power source point of view, conventional rechargeable batteries (represented by lithium-ion batteries) with fixed shapes and dimensions are generally fabricated by winding (or stacking) cell components (such as anodes, cathodes and separator membranes) and then packaging them with (cylindrical-/rectangular-shaped) metallic canisters or pouch films, finally followed by injection of liquid electrolytes. In particular, the use of liquid electrolytes gives rise to serious concerns in cell assembly, because they require strict packaging materials to avoid leakage problems and also separator membranes to prevent electrical contact between electrodes. For these reasons, the conventional cell assembly and materials have pushed the batteries to lack of variety in form factors, thus imposing formidable challenges on their integration into versatile-shaped electronic devices. Here, as a facile and efficient strategy to address the aforementioned longstanding challenge, we demonstrate a new class of printed solid-state Li-ion batteries and also all-inkjet-printed solid-state supercapacitors with exceptional shape conformability and aesthetic versatility which lie far beyond those achievable with conventional battery technologies.
