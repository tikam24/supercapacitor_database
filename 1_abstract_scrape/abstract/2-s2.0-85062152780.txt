Herein, in this work we have developed macroporous nanocomposite of polyaniline (Pani) with nanodiamond (ND) and graphene (GN) by the combination of oxidative aniline polymerization and hydrothermal methodology to prepare the overall composite. Morphological features showed that the ND particles and Pani tubes have been well dispersed inside the GN, thereby forming structures with high porosity. The high conductivity of GN in addition to the high thermal stability of ND is expected to give highly stable conductive Pani-ND@GN composite. The electrical transport studies was done by DC electrical conductivity retention under aging experiments and the Pani-ND@GN nanocomposites showed high stability under ambient conditions. Three electrode assembly was used for the electrochemical supercapacitive characteristics i.e. the cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves and galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD) of Pani-ND@GN. The obtained nanocomposite delivered a high capacitance of 150.20 F/g at 2 A/g and high cyclic stability of 84% after continuous 1000 charge-discharge cycles.
