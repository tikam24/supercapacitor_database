Free standing electrodes have grabbed attention among the researchers around the globe due to its ease of fabrication, scale-up and flexibility for stack development. In the present communication, we have described a novel approach to improve the areal capacitance of graphite fiber paper (GP) from 4.5 ×10−3 F cm−2 to 0.677 F cm−2 by surface modification. Surface functionalised graphite paper (Oxd-GP) and its chemically reduced counterpart (Red-GP) are explored as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The materials synthesized are structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The electrochemical performance of the electrodes is assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GC) analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) where both Oxd-GP and Red-GP exhibit appreciable areal capacitance while Red-GP shows excellent cycle life over 2600 cycles. Red-GP showed an increment in capacitance over 1000 cycles while attaining stability. This work suggests that modified graphite paper can be a low-cost and free-standing electrode for high performance energy storage devices.
