In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate the design and fabrication of a novel flexible nanoarchitecture by facile coating ultrathin Ni2SnS4 nanoparticles grown radially on nickel foam substrate to investigate its electrochemical behavior in supercapacitors. The samples were characterized with XRD, FTIR, FESEM, and TEM. The several electrochemical tests, i.e., cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed to probe the applicability of materials as the supercapacitor electrode. The GCD analysis exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 2121.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with elevating cycling stability of 93.5% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in three-electrode system. Interestingly, the asymmetric supercapacitors assembled with the Ni2SnS4 nanoparticles arrays and activated carbon electrodes displayed an excellent electrochemical behavior with a high energy density of 87.8 Wh kg−1 at 4.8 kW kg−1 and superior cyclic stability.
