Growth of nanostructured materials has flourished in the field of energy materials research in recent times. In particular, nanostructured electrode materials are chosen for supercapacitors due to their superior electrochemical features and improved charge storage capacities. Herein, we report the preparation of ZnWO4nanoarchitectures by CTAB-template assisted sonochemical method with subsequent calcination. The morphologies and structures were altered by varying the CTAB concentration. CTAB has a strong influence on the morphological features of ZnWO4 materials, leading to chain-like nanoarchitectures. The supercapacitive features of the chain-like ZnWO4nanoarchitecture materials were studied using cyclicvoltammetric and chronopotentiometric techniques. At a scan rate of 5 mVs−1, the ZnWO4 nanoarchitecture exhibits a specific capacitance of 602 Fg−1 with good rate capability. Moreover, it retained 93% of the initial capacitance up to 3000 continuous cycles at a scan rate of 100 mVs−1.
