Flexible threadlike supercapacitors have attracted extensive attention owing to recent breakthroughs in modern wearable electronics, taking advantage of their high flexibility, tiny volume, and good specific performance. Because CNTs possess very large specific surface area, low mass density, outstanding chemical stability and excellent electrical conductivity, they have been widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitors. This chapter discusses recent progress in charge storage mechanisms, active materials, electrolytes, designs of threadlike supercapacitors, CNT-based supercapacitor architecture (symmetric and asymmetric supercapacitors), and self-charging supercapacitors. The final section highlights future perspectives on research in this field.
