Today, with increasing concern about fossil fuel-based energy and its environmental issues, the design of electrical systems has focused on the use of renewable energy sources. One of the most interesting sources of renewable energy is solar energy, but its production and sustainability are simply affected by intermittent working conditions such as changes in radiation, temperature, humidity and minor shadow effects. In this paper, a hybrid energy storage system is used to solve this problem. The main advantage of a hybrid storage system over a battery storage system is the effective use of the characteristics of each element of the storage system. Most of the proposed control strategies for a hybrid energy storage system have high computational burden and difficult implementation. This paper proposes a simple and low cost control strategy using PI controllers and fuzzy logic algorithm, which have a high speed in DC link voltage recovery and higher efficiency for using high charge/discharge cycles of supercapacitors (SCs) and therefore reduces stress on the battery and thus extend its useful life. Finally, the proposed strategy is simulated in MATLAB/simulink and its performance is evaluated.
