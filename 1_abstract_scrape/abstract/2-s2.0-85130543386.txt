Micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), a clean and Sustainable energy storage device possess remarkable characteristics such as high energy/power autonomy, high charge-discharge cycles, and fast charge-discharge rates, making them a promising candidate for miniaturized energy storage components. However, the major constraint of MSCs is their low energy density. As a result, researchers have been working extensively to enhance the energy density of MSCs. This work presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) porous interdigitated MSC electrodes with parallel cylindrical holes. The proposed and popular octet structures were designed and compared using finite element analysis under uniaxial tensile loading. The proposed structure demonstrated more than 70% higher surface area, and since these holes are continuous along the electrode length, there will be no resistance to the ion movements. Because of the design's simplicity, it will be possible to produce 3D MSC electrodes with a larger surface area using unconventional manufacturing methods. The proposed structure will significantly improve the energy and power density of 3D MSCs.
