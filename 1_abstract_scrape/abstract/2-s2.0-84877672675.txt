A graphitic ordered mesoporous carbon (G-OMC) has been synthesized for the first time using mesoporous nickel oxide as a template and catalyst and dopamine as a carbon source. The probable formation mechanism for the preparation of G-OMC is also proposed. Characterization by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and high resolution transmission electron microscopy indicate that the as-prepared mesoporous carbon has a high degree of graphitization. The electrochemical performance of G-OMC is visibly superior to typical CMK-3D in alkalic media, involving fast kinetic transfer, anti-corrosion, a capacitance of 68 μF cm-2 at 0.1 A g-1 and a light increase of the 6000th-cycle capacitance compared to the initial capacitance. In organic electrolyte, a wider potential window of 2.5 V is presented. The fast charge transfer, quick response and anti-corrosion properties promise that G-OMC will have a great prospect as a supercapacitor for energy storage applications. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
