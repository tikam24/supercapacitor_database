N-doped multi-channel carbon derived from fiber-reinforced polyimide (PI) composites (NCPCs) with multi-scale porous structure has been prepared by pyrolysis process. The obtained N-doped derived carbon series materials with a three-dimensional conducting meshwork structure possess a high content of nitrogen, improved specific surface area, and great open multi-level pores that provide interconnected ducts for fast ion-diffusion and electrons to pass through polyimide-derived nitrogen layers, which is beneficial to rapid Faradaic redox reactions. The supercapacitor based on the electrode of NCPCs displays a high energy and power density of 24.50 Wh/kg and 209.8 W/kg, respectively. The full results suggest the NCPCs with hierarchical multi-channel structure is a promoting electrode material used in the advanced field of energy storing equipment.
