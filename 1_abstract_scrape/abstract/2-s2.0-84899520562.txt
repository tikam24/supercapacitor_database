A flexible, porous TiOxNy sheet consisting of numerous conductive fibers was synthesized by nitridation of titanate and further used as an electrochemical electrode. The high surface area and mixed-oxidation state of titanium make TiOxNy sheets to be promising candidates for a good supercapacitor. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
