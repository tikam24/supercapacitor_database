Ferric oxide (Fe2O3) has gained immense attention as a favorable negatrode (negative electrode) material for high-performance supercapacitors for its low cost, high theoretical specific capacity, and abundance in nature. However, owing to its relatively large volume change during the long charge-discharge cycle and comparatively, low conductivity utterly hinders its electrochemical performance. Herein, a composite negative electrode consisting of Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on CNT-graphene conductive networks (Fe2O3@GR-CNTs/NF) fabricated using a two-step approach is reported. The fabricated composite electrode exhibited a superior specific capacitance (114.2F/g) and good stability (64.2% after 2000 cycles) because of the unique structure of the composite material.
