Porous TiO2@C nanotube bundles (NTBs) are synthesized by a simple hydrothermal treatment with subsequent carbonization, which exhibited an enhanced specific capacitance of 274.2 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with high rate capability (81% retention of its initial capacitance when current density increased 10 times) and excellent long-term cycling stability (102% of its original capacitance after 5000 cycles) compared with bare TiO2 electrode. Thus it can be considered as a perspective material for high-performance supercapacitors.
