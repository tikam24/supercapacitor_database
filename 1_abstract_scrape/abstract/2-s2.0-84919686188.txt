By their nature, microgrids are dependent on the continuity of power supply and require backup sources with the highest degree of efficiency and availability. In addition, most users connected to a low voltage network have individual loads or groups of receivers that need quality energy supply (higher than those offered by the public grid) and they also require backup power source. The availability, redundancy, resiliency and effectiveness of a hybrid backup source (with batteries and supercapacitors) were analyzed in this paper by physical modeling a critical consumer. Experimental stand, scaled 1at9.5, is centered on supercapacitors' storage system, which supplies critical consumer in parallel with two batteries. Load profile obtained both with supplying through the converter and without control discharge, reflecting a very good coverage of energy demand.
