Asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) are regarded as promising energy storage devices due to their excellent electrochemical properties, especially favorable power density. In this work, both the high-performance positive electrode and negative electrode materials are designed and prepared using the electrospinning technique and a metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived strategy. The obtained Bi-MOF-derived Bi2O3/C hollow nanofibers have an outstanding specific capacity (1420 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) and show an excellent cycling performance (92.21% retention after 4000 cycles) as negative electrodes, while the NiCo-MOF-derived NiCo2S4 hollow nanofibers as positive electrodes also have an excellent specific capacity (2656 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), and their capacity retention is 92.11% after 4000 charge-discharge cycles. The assembled ASC device with these two electrodes displays a high energy density of 85.38 W h kg-1 and excellent cycling performance with 80% retention after 10,000 cycles. Therefore, this work not only experimentally demonstrates MOF-derived Bi2O3/C and NiCo2S4 as fascinating candidate electrode materials for ASCs but also affords a method to rationally design and fabricate other electrode materials with unique hollow nanofiber structures for energy storage.
