Here, a well crystalline 3D flower-like structured MoS2 (âˆ¼420 nm) has been successfully synthesized on a large scale by a simple hydrothermal technique. The evolution of morphology in the formation process has also been investigated. The crystallinity, purity, and morphology of the sample are characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, fieldemission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The FESEM and TEM images reveal that the sample exhibits a uniform 3D flower-like microsphere shape with folded nanosheets, which are stretched out along the edge of the microsphere. The electrochemical performance of the sample has been investigated by cyclic voltammogram, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. The results of the electrochemical analysis suggest that the material delivers a maximum specific capacitance (Csp) of 350 F/g at a discharge current density of 0.25 A/g with energy density 17.5 Wh/kg. It also exhibits good capability and excellent cyclic stability (94% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles in 1 A/g) owing to the coupling effect of electrical conductivity with the interesting morphology and larger active surface area. Hence, the sample may be used as a promising electrode material for high-performance energy storage devices.
