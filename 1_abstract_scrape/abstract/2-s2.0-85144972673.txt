The global energy crisis is the most significant concern of the twenty-first century due to excessive consumption of non-renewable sources such as coal, natural gas, crude oil, etc. Renewable energy sources come out to be the most effective tool to solve these global issues. In this context, there is a need for the advancement of efficient energy storage systems for the complete utilization of renewable energy sources. To fulfill the requirement of continuous energy supply, advanced energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors need to be developed. Various novel materials including metal nitrides, polyoxometalates (POMs) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been used for the supercapacitor application. TMDs and their nanocomposites play a prominent role as active electrode materials in supercapacitors owing to their large surface area and variable oxidation states. TMDs serve as promising materials to achieve significantly high energy densities. Nowadays, supercapacitors are primarily used as a complementary aid to batteries due to their weakness in terms of low energy density. This chapter introduces the need for renewable energy and the importance of supercapacitors as an energy storage device in comparison to batteries. This also describes the supercapacitors and types of supercapacitors. Furthermore, the chapter presents the highlight and reviews the various synthesis methods of TMDs and their nanocomposites with their applications in supercapacitors for use in various fields including hybrid electric vehicles and wearable electronics. Recent advancements along with future challenges and prospects in the field of TMDs-based supercapacitors are also discussed.
