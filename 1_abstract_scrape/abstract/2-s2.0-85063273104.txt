Ag@Ag2O/RGO nanocomposites with different loads of Ag (0.4%–8.5%) were synthesized using a simple deposition method in the presence of a triblock copolymer template at different annealing temperatures (250 °C and 400 °C). All samples were characterized with various techniques such as XRD, FTIR, Raman, TEM-SAED, N2 sorptiometry and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance. The supercapacitor performance of the samples was measured. Besides, the catalytic performances of the samples towards 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) reduction were tested under dark conditions. The results revealed the well dispersion of Ag and Ag2O moieties on RGO with crystallite size in the range of 17–34 nm. The nanocomposite Ag@Ag2O/RGO annealed at 400 °C exhibited the highest reduction rate constant for 4-NP reduction (0.01 s−1). In addition, this composite has shown the highest specific capacitance of 312 F g−1 at scan rate of 20 mV s−1 and 119 F g−1 at a current density of 11 mA g−1.
