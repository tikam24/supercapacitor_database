Detailed in this paper is a multi-frequency wireless power charging platform which serves as energy source for hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). A composite power source composed of sinusoidal components with different frequencies is used to power the battery/ultra-capacitor HESS systems. Based on the frequency selective characteristic of wireless power transfer, unified control can be realized by adjusting the amplitude of current at each frequency. Analysis is mainly carried out using equivalent circuit model based on equivalent resistance of HESS. Simulation and experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed techniques.
