Molybdenum oxide/carbon nanotube (MoOx/CNT) composite fibers were fabricated via the electrochemical deposition of MoOx on macroscopic carbon nanotube fibers spun from a chemical vapor deposition process. The observation by scanning electron microscopy shows that the composite fiber consists of unique core-shell axial nanofibers. The thickness of MoOx layer is 100-175 nm and the CNT core is 20-60 nm. The electrochemical properties of the composite fibers were examined in the aqueous electrolyte, showing a distinct electrochemical response with a capacitance of 19 F/g. This functional oxide and CNT composite fiber have some potential applications as a multifunctional electric supercapacitor for the development of weaving fabrics.
