The binary as well as ternary nanocomposites of the square-facet nanobar Co-MOF-derived Co3O4@Co/N-CNTs (N-CNTs: nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes) with Ag NPs and rGO have been synthesized via an easy wet chemical route, and their supercapacitor behavior was then studied. At a controlled pH of the precursor solution, square-facet nanobars of Co-MOF were first synthesized by the solvothermal method and then pyrolyzed under a controlled nitrogen atmosphere to get a core-shell system of Co3O4@Co/N-CNTs. In the second step, different compositions of Co3O4@Co/N-CNT core-shell structures were formed by an ex-situ method with Ag NPs and rGO moieties. Among several bare, binary, and ternary compositions tested in 6 M aqueous KOH electrolyte, a ternary nanocomposite having a 7.0:1.5:1.5 stoichiometric ratio of Co3O4@Co/N-CNT, Ag NPs, and rGO, respectively, reported the highest specific capacitance (3393.8 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1). The optimized nanocomposite showed the energy density, power density, and Coulombic efficiency of 74.1 W h.kg-1, 443.7 W.kg-1, and 101.3%, respectively, with excellent electrochemical stability. After testing an asymmetrical supercapacitor with a Co3O4@Co/N-CNT/Ag NPs/rGO/nickel foam cathode and an activated carbon/nickel foam anode, it showed 4.9 W h.kg-1 of energy density and 5000.0 W.kg-1 of power density.
