Supercapacitors are attractive alternative energy storage sources. They offer high energy/power density with other characteristics like fast discharge/charge time, long operation stability, safety etc. In a supercapacitor, working electrode material is the principal constituent. At present there are numerous electrode materials (with properties) suitable for their use in hybrid type supercapacitors. Carbon/polyaniline (PANi) composites are one class of such electrode materials. Here, perspectives on state-of-the-art carbon/PANi composites namely carbon nanotube/polyaniline and graphene/polyaniline composites expedient as hybrid type supercapacitor electrode materials will be presented.
