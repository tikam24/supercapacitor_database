All-solid-state planar on-chip micro-supercapacitors (MSCs), as a new type of energy storage device, can be well integrated with micro-nano devices and exhibit good practical performance. Nitrogen and oxygen co-doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs), as one of the electrode materials for fabricating supercapacitors, exhibiting novel chemical/physical properties including nanometer-size, abundant edge defects, good conductivity and better surface grafting. In this article, the GQDs film was prepared by modified liquid–air interface self-assembly method and fabricated interdigital electrodes with electrode width and interdigital gap of 6 μm by simple photolithography technology. Electrochemical measurements revealed that the obtained GQDs electrodes for all-solid-state MSCs exhibited the areal power density of up to 0.107 mW cm−2 at the scan rate of 10,000 V s−1 and 95.6% capacitance after charging and discharging for 10,000 cycles. Specially, there was still the ultra-fast charging-discharging time (4.17 μs). The favorable performances make the GQDs film interdigital electrodes prepared by photolithography have good application prospects.
