Higher performance portable energy storage devices are required for the increased use of portable mobile electronics such as smart phones, tablets, and wearable devices. Recent portable energy storage should have not only a large charging capacity but also a fast charging-discharging cycle. There are two key factors, which represent the performance of energy storage devices. One is energy density, which means how much energy can be stored. The other is power density, which is related to charging-discharging time. Recently, a lithium ion battery has been the most widely used energy storage device because it has a large energy density. Lithium ion battery, however, has a small power density. This defect causes many inconveniences for customers such as long battery charging time. Supercapacitors are one of the best candidates for replacing current lithium ion battery technology. A supercapacitor has a very large power density and this is the most important advantage of the supercapacitor. Supercapacitors also have a long life and less risk of exploding. Until now, the supercapacitor has less energy density than a lithium ion battery, so many researchers have studied new methods for installing a high energy density into supercapacitors. In this study, we suggest a new simple method for constructing a metal based supercapacitor electrode coated with a metal hydroxide. The performance of our device was tested with various techniques.
