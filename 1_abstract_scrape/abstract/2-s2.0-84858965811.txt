This paper compares the experimental and simulation results to improve the voltage sag ride through capability of an adjustable speed drive using a supercapacitor as an energy storage device. The supercapacitor maintains the ASD dc bus voltage under voltage sag condition. Experimental results are presented, which show the effectiveness of the mitigation approach to voltage sags. The performance of ASD under healty and abnormal condition is first simulated in MATLab simulink and then the same are verified using designed hardware setup. The LABView (8.5) software and DAQ board has been used to record the generated waveforms during normal and abnormal conditions.
