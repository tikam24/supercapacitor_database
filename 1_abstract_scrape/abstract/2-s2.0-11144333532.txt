The Swiss research center of Michelin and the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) unveiled a prototype lightweight fuel cell/supercapacitor hybrid car at the Challenge Bibendum in Shanghai, the world's largest competition for futuristic drive concepts, recently held for the first time in China. The Hy-Light vehicle uses a 30 kwe PEM fuel cell system developed by PSI engineers. Michelin researchers created the powertrain, electric motors, and chassis management system, based on an active electric suspension. This gives the vehicle stability on bends and under braking. Hydrogen and oxygen are stored at 350 bar in tanks fitted into the vehicle structure, protecting against shocks. Both gases can be produced centrally by electrolysis; a prototype installation was studied and realized with the support of the Electrical Power Co of Fribourg.
