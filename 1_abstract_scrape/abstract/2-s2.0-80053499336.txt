The energy accumulator in electric vehicles must be laid out for many different areas of application. On the one hand, the battery must provide enough energy to overcome longer distances with high velocity. On the other hand the battery must be laid out to temporarily supply high peak current for a short time, e.g., during the acceleration. Or the battery has to store much energy in a short-time e.g. during regenerative braking. This paper describes how a combination of double layer capacitors (DLCs) with modern batteries can lead to stress reduction as well as a range enlargement in electric vehicles. The advantages of the supercaps with their high power density and of the batteries with their high energy densitiy can be ideally combined. We will show that based on an intelligent energy management also in electric vehicles supercaps are a good supplement to the batteries. Â© 2011 EPE Association - European Power Electr.
