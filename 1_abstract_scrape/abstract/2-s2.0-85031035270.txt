With the rapid development of energy storage technologies, especially for practical application, it is of paramount importance to consider the cost, environmental friendliness, and sustainability of the devices. Recently, biomass-derived carbon materials (BDCMs) have been widely researched for energy storage due to their superior properties such as renewability, earth-abundancy, low-cost, good electrical conductivity, and stability. In this study, we have mainly reviewed recent research on the potential applications of BDCMs, especially in batteries and supercapacitors. Furthermore, the fundamentals and advantages/disadvantages of typical BDCMs for energy storage have been discussed. Finally, some possible future research directions have been provided.
