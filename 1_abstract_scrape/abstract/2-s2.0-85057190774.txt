Co-Ni-S nanoarchitectures with considerable conductivity and superior electrochemical performance have been successfully designed and grown on Ni foam substrates. The collective effects of structure and composition endow Co-Ni-S electrodes better electrochemical performance with ultra-high areal capacitances of 6.3 F cm −2 at 1 mA cm −2 (4.2 F cm −2 retained at 8 mA cm −2 ) and remarkable rate capability of 65% at 10 mA cm −2 . Correspondingly, asymmetric supercapacitors are assembled with Co-Ni-S sample and active carbon as the positive and negative electrodes, which display an excellent energy density of ∼50 Wh kg −1 at a power density of ∼0.783 kW kg −1 . Furthermore, the capacitance maintains 71% of the initial value after cycling 6000 times at 1 A g −1 . These results have great significance for the optimization of asymmetric supercapacitors as the energy-storage devices for the next generation.
