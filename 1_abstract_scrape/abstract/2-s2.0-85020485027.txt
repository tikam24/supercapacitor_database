In this work, a fast and mild in-situ oxidization hydrothermal method was developed to fabricate the nickel-cobalt layered double hydroxides (Ni-Co LDHs) on Ni foam. The Ni-Co LDHs with the nanoarrays and nanopetals structures were synthesized by in situ oxidizing Ni foam in a mixed solvent of cobalt chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2.6H2O) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at 90Â°C for 3h. The electrochemical performance tests indicate the Ni-Co LDHs electrodes have a high areal capacitance value about 17.3F/cm2 at 5.0mA/cm2. After 1000 cycles at 50mA/cm2, the as-prepared electrodes have the high capacitance retention of 83%. Thus, the binder-free Ni-Co LDHs with high electrochemical performance are the promising electrode materials for advanced electrochemical storage energy devices including flexible power sources and supercapacitors in modern electronic systems.
