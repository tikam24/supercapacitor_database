Herein, a hierarchical MoS2@3D-Ni-foam was successfully evolved using in situ solvothermal method as electrode materials for energy harvesting applications. The assembled symmetric supercapacitor device illustrates high specific capacitance (38.9 F g−1) in a wide potential region of 1.0 V. Furthermore, outstanding stability was demonstrated to have ∼81.5% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles and ∼70.3% capacitance retention after smashing accelerated aging test for 150 h, respectively. Simultaneously, a successful blue LED demonstration for SSC device supports practical operation and its impact with low leakage current and nailing self-discharge characteristics.
