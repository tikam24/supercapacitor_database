Graphene has been much anticipated as an ideal active material of electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). However, the overall capacitance of monolayer graphene is affected by its own low quantum capacitance (Cq). This characteristics lowers most of the capacitor properties, therefore, we should concentrate on finding a solution to increase Cq value. By using density-functional theory on graphene with different functional groups, we compared the effects of functional groups on Cq and band structure. Then we found that some functional groups could change the local electric structure of graphene, and improve the Cq value of graphene at low voltage range. This should be due to the effects of electronegative atom in functional groups. As a result, functionalized monolayer graphene could have better capacitor performance in aqueous electrolytes.
