Nanocarbon material prepared via dehydrohalogenation of PVC-PVDC copolymer was studied in this work. The results of structural characterization of this material reveal the growth in the chain component fraction with increasing temperature of annealing that increases the specific capacity from 5 to 25 F/g. Chemical activation results in a noticeable growth of the specific capacity to 100 F/g.
