Titanium disulfide, being one of the popular transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, shows great properties. TiS2 nanodiscs have been synthesized by solid state reaction (SSR) method. FESEM images confirm the synthesis of TiS2 nanodiscs. XRD spectra suggest the crystalline structure of as-prepared TiS2 nanodiscs. Electrochemical properties of the synthesized nanodiscs were studied in 6 M KOH aqueous solution. The observed results indicates the promisibilty of TiS2 as electrode material in energy storage devices.
