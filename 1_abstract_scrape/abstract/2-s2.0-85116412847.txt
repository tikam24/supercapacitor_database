Sheet-like morphology of copper cobaltite/N-doped graphene oxide materials composite was synthesized by a thermal reduction process improved by sonication. These composite nanostructured materials were confirmed by analytical methods. The composite materials were fabricated as electrode for supercapacitor applications via CV, GCD, and EIS analysis in the presence of 5 M KOH solution. The CuO@NGO and CuCo2O4@NGO composite electrodes employing excellent morphology showed improved capacitance of (196 and 475) F.g−1, respectively, at 0.5 A.g−1, and excellent cyclic stability and retention (96.5%) in the continuous 10,000 charge–discharge cycles. The electrochemical description of the synthesized CuO@NGO and CuCo2O4@NGO materials composite showed excellent electrochemical properties and cyclic stability in the presence of 5 M KOH electrolyte. The composite design of CuO@NGO and CuCo2O4@NGO materials was developed for the symmetric electrochemical supercapacitor in the presence of 5 M KOH electrolyte.
