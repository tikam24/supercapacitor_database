Aqueous zinc-ion hybrid capacitors (ZIHCs) are promising energy storage devices for grid-scale energy storage due to the low cost, intrinsic non-flammability, environmental friendliness, and high power densities. Currently, most reported ZIHCs employed zinc metals as anodes. However, uncontrollable Zn dendrite growth and the huge volume change of Zn metal anode during the stripping/plating process greatly hinder the practical application of ZIHCs. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop alternative anode materials with favorable electrochemical performances. Herein, we demonstrate a polymer from polyarylimide and porphyrin as a new anode material for ZIHCs. The Zn ion storage electrochemistry in this porous organic polymer-tetra(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin-1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (POP-TAPP-NTCA) is investigated by cyclic voltammetry analysis, galvanostatic charge/discharge measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, kinetic analysis, and density functional theory calculation. The fabricated ZIHC based on POP-TAPP-NTCA anode exhibits an energy density of 48 Wh kgâˆ’1 and capacitance retention of 90% after 1100 cycles. This work will inspire the exploration of new anode materials for Zn ion storage and facilitate the development of safe electrochemical energy storage.
