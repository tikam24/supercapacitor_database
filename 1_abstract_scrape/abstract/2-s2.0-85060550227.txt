Electrochemical-deposition method was engaged to prepare Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO) modified Polydiphenylamine (PDPA)/Phosphotungstic acid (PTA)/Manganese dioxide (MnO 2 ) nanohybrid (FTO/PDPA/PTA/MnO 2 -ME) Electrode. Nanocomposites structural analysis, morphology, and molecular vibrational studies were characterized through X-ray diffractometer (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infra read Spectroscopy (FTIR). Recorded XRD and FTIR pattern authenticates the existence of PDPA, PTA, and MnO 2 structures. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies performed using electrochemical workstation shows very high specific capacitance value of 514.77 Fg −1 at 5 mVs −1 for the modified hybrid electrode system. The superior capacitive performance, cyclic stability of FTO/PDPA/PTA/MnO 2 electrode was attributed due to the existence and fast reversible multi‐electron redox response of tungsten atoms in PTA along with PDPA-MnO 2 synergistic interaction that augments the electron transfer processes.
