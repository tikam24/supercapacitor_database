Prussian blue analogues have been widely investigated in the field of materials chemistry because of its low cost, high porosity, and excellent redox reversibility. Herein, a series of MnHCF/GO nanocomposites (MHG) with diverse GO contents have been successfully prepared at room temperature through a facile and cost-effective chemical precipitation method. It is indicated that MnHCF nanoparticles anchor on the surface of GO nanosheets, forming a well-coupled hybrid nanostructure. GO nanosheets can not only ameliorate the agglomeration of MnHCF nanoparticles, but also boost the electron/ion transport in the electrolyte. In addition, the synergistic effect between MnHCF nanoparticles and GO nanosheets can improve the electrochemical properties of MHG nanocomposites. MHG-3-based electrode with 20 wt% GO nanosheets exhibits a specific capacitance of 279.3 F g−1, which is approximately three times higher than that of pristine MnHCF electrode at 0.3 A g−1. Moreover, MHG-3-based electrode exhibits favorable cyclic stability (65.3% after 2000 continuous charge/discharge cycles at 0.8 A g−1).
