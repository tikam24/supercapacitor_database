The supercapacitor with intrinsic self-healability, stretchability after self-healing, and biodegradability after full usage, is very significant for modern flexible and implantable electronics. However, the few healing times and/or the low healing efficiency of state-of-the-art self-healable supercapacitor cannot satisfy current needs. More importantly, all stretchable supercapacitors cannot be stretched anymore after healing, which greatly limits the use of these devices. In addition, once the supercapacitor fails ultimately, it can only be discarded. Herein, we innovatively modify the self-healable flour as the main material of both electrolyte and electrodes to fabricate the one-stop supercapacitor for the first time, which displays intrinsic self-healability and stretchability after healing as well as biodegradability after full utilization. This supercapacitor from the nature, beyond the nature and to the nature, opens many new opportunities for various next-generation flexible and implantable electronics.
