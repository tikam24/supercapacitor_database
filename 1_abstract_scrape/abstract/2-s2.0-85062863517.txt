An effective method has been explored to improve the capacitive property of carbon-based materials by carbonizing the polypyrrole electrodeposited on the porous carbon cloth (PCC). The porous carbon cloth coated with N-doped mesoporous carbon (PCC@NMC) demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 33.45 F cm −3 at 4 mA cm −2 in 1 M Na 2 SO 4 solution and showed excellent cycling stability by running 40,000 charge/discharge cycles without degradation at 16 mA cm −2 . We also assemble PCC@NMC//MnO 2 /N-doped mesoporous carbon on porous carbon cloth (PCC@MNMC) as a flexible asymmetrical supercapacitor (ASC), which exhibits a high energy density of 4.51 mWh cm −3 at 333.3 mW cm −3 in a voltage range of 0–2 V and can power 32 light-emitting diodes for 10 min. This type of supercapacitors based on commercial carbon cloth may open the way for applications in wearable electronic storage.
