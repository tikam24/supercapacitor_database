We report on the gas storage behaviour and electrochemical charge storage properties of high surface area activated nanoporous carbon obtained from rice husk through low temperature chemical activation approach. Rice husk derived porous carbon (RHDPC) exhibits varying porous characteristics upon activation at different temperatures and we observed high gas uptake and efficient energy storage properties for nanoporous carbon materials activated even at a moderate activation temperature of 500 °C. Various experimental techniques including Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and pore size analyser are employed to characterise the samples. Detailed studies on gas adsorption behaviour of CO2, H2 and CH4 on RHDPCs have been performed at different temperatures using a volumetric gas analyser. High adsorption capacities of ~9.4 mmol g−1 (298 K, 20 bar), 1.8 wt% (77 K, 10 bar) and ~5 mmol g−1 (298 K, 40 bar) were obtained respectively for CO2, H2 and CH4, superior to many other carbon based physical adsorbents reported so far. In addition, these nanoporous carbon materials exhibit good electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes and a maximum specific capacitance of 112 F g−1 has been obtained using aqueous 1 M Na2SO4 as electrolyte. Our studies thus demonstrate that nanoporous carbon with high porosity and surface area, obtained through an efficient approach, can act as effective materials for gas storage and electrochemical energy storage applications.
