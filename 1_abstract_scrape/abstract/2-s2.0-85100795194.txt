Synthesis strategy plays a vital role in the physical and chemical properties of materials. In this study, a quick and simple microwave-assisted rheological phase reaction route is designed to prepare Cu3Mo2O9. The phase, composite and morphology of the as-prepared sample are characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The formation time of the precursor is reduced to only 10 min and a pure phase Cu3Mo2O9 can be obtained at a relatively low heated temperature (500 Â°C). Crystallite size is estimated from X-ray line profile fitting to be 53.5 nm. As anode of lithium half-cell, the as-prepared Cu3Mo2O9 achieves a higher discharge capacity with stable cycling performance (554.6 mAh g-1 after 350 cycles), excellent rate capability and diffusion kinetics. The capacity contribution is analyzed by cyclic voltammetry at various scan rates in detail. For supercapacitor application, the electrode also shows a high specific capacitance with good cyclability (136.3 F g-1 after 1000 cycles). This work not only opens up an efficient avenue to prepare efficient inorganic materials, but also suggests a prospective material for energy storage devices.
