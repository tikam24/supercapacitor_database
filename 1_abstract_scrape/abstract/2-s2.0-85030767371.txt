Application of energy storage technology helps to inhibit wind power fluctuations. However, negative impact of hysteresis characteristics of phase-change energy storage on power regulation performance stands out when it comes to large-scale wind farm with higher requirements of power regulation. This paper puts forward a scheme aiming at improving dynamic property of phase-change energy storage and generating system (PESGS) using super capacitors with high power density and rapid charge/discharge ability. Steam washing double-screw expansion generator is chosen as PESGS model. Control strategies of super capacitors is formulated, taking state of charge and blunt tip power constraint into consideration in typical working conditions. A new computing method of rated power and capacity of super capacitors is proposed based on installed capacity and response speed of PESGS. Simulation results show that the super capacitors help to shorten transient time of PESGS and improve system performance.
