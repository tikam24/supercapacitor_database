Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanoscrolls are synthesized in the presence of pyrrole (Py) by using oxidative polymerization method in the presence of sulphuric acid and ammonium persulfate. We report a simple method for the synthesis of rGO nanoscrolls in the presence of pyrrole, and this composite material is used for the supercapacitor applications. Supercapacitor electrodes show good cyclic stability by retaining 88% of the specific capacitance even after 200 cycles. Polypyrrole – reduced graphene oxide (PPy-rGO nanoscrolls) is characterized by Raman, TEM, FESEM, EDX, FTIR, TGA and UV–vis spectroscopy techniques.
