Herein we demonstrate the rational design and fabricate of the Co3O4 nanowire@Fe2O3 nanorod core-shell nanowire arrays on carbon cloth for supercapacitor electrodes. When measured as electrode material for supercapacitors, the Co3O4@Fe2O3 electrode delivers high areal capacitance of 245 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2. The excellent electrochemical performances of the Co3O4@Fe2O3 electrode can be attributed to the unique core-shell nanoarchitecture and synergistic effect. The hydrothermally synthesized Co3O4 nanowire arrays serve as the conductive scaffold for the growth of mesoporous Fe2O3 nanorods, which facilitate fast charge transport throughout the whole electrode. These results indicate that the Co3O4@Fe2O3 core-shell nanowire arrays are a promising electrode material for next-generation high-performance supercapacitors.
