g-C 3 N 4 with plenty of lone pair electrons on the two dimensional (2D) lamellar structures have attracted remarkable attention as an electrical double layer (EDLC) supercapacitor electrodes due to their surface polarity and wettability with electrolyte molecule. However, the agglomeration of the exfoliated g-C 3 N 4 sheets during the electrochemical process curtails their accessible electroactive surface area so that specific capacitance get reduces considerably. Here in for the first time in the literature, we report a 2D nanohybrid structure of g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 having attractive electrochemical properties than bare g-C 3 N 4 and MoS 2 , owing to the wonderful flower shaped morphology of the synthesized pseudocapacitive semiconducting MoS 2 phase which acts as spacers in between the layers of g-C 3 N 4 . The specific capacitance of bare g-C 3 N 4 and MoS 2 is 10 Fg −1 and 14 Fg −1 respectively however hybrid material g-C 3 N 4 /MoS 2 exhibits a specific capacitance value of 45.5 Fg −1 . This remarkable hike in specific capacitance can be attributed to the synergistic effect of both faradaic and non-faradaic process of energy storage.
