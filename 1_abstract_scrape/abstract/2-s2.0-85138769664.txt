Supercapacitors have rapidly revolutionized energy storage technology since its discovery. The miniaturized, self-sustained, reliable, precise, highly flexible and portable power supply is the urge of futuristic electronics devices which necessitates the development of supercapacitors. The present invincible position of the supercapacitor is the result of a series of evolutions. Nevertheless, there are some hurdles that need to be addressed for making supercapacitors a flawless preference for electrochemical energy storage devices. Herein, a rudimentary analysis of supercapacitors that largely impact the overall performance is discussed. Foremost, investigating the crucial role played by the basic elements of the supercapacitors are demonstrated. Each element of a supercapacitor is given the utmost importance so as not to leave any stone unturned in understanding the primary structure of the device. Subsequently, the principal mechanism of the supercapacitor is largely discussed along with the working procedure of the two different categories of the device. Ultimately, the significance of the key performance factors is scrutinized.
