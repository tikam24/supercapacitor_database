Supercapacitors with high power density, ultralong lifespan and wide range operating temperature have drawn significant attention in recent years. However, monitoring the state of charge in supercapacitors in a cost-effective and flexible way is still challenging. Techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction can analyze the characteristics of supercapacitor well. But with large size and high price, they are not suitable for daily monitoring of the supercapacitors' operation. In this paper, a low cost and easily fabricated fiber-optic localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) probe is proposed to monitor the state of charge of the electrode in a supercapacitor. The Au nanoparticles were loading on the fiber core as LSPR sensing region. In order to implant the fiber in the supercapacitor, a reflective type of fiber sensor was used. The results show that this tiny fiber-optic LSPR sensor can provide online monitoring of the state of charge during the charging and discharging process in situ. The intensity shift in LSPR sensor has a good linear relationship with the state of charge calculated by standard galvanostatic charging and discharging test. In addition, this LSPR sensor is insensitive to the temperature change, presenting a great potential in practical applications.
