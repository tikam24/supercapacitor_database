Calcium nitrate Ca(NO3)2 aqueous solution was found to be an effective aqueous electrolyte for a supercapacitor using ordered mesoporous carbon as the electrode materials. The supercapacitive behavior of ordered mesoporous carbon CMK-3 electrode in Ca(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte was investigated utilizing cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements. CMK-3 electrode shows excellent supercapacitive behavior with wide voltage window, high specific gravimetric capacitance and satisfactory electrochemical stability in Ca(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte. The specific gravimetric capacitance of CMK-3 electrode in Ca(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte reaches 210 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, which is higher than that in conventional aqueous electrolytes NaNO3 and KOH solution about 40% and 54%, respectively. The high charge density of the electric double layer formed at the interface of the CMK-3 electrode and Ca(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte and the pseudo-capacitive effect originating from the oxygen groups on the surface of CMK-3 were believed to respond for the excellent supercapacitive behavior of CMK-3 electrode in Ca(NO3)2 aqueous electrolyte.
