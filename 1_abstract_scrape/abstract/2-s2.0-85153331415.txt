In the present study, copper vanadate (CuV2O6) was prepared via a simple precipitation route, followed by calcination. The as-prepared electrode material, CuV2O6, was observed to have a surface area of 62 m2 g−1 by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis. Further, its capacitance behaviour was assessed using cyclic voltammetry, Galvanostatic charge–discharge studies (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The electroactive CuV2O6 showed a high specific capacitance of 497 F g−1 at 1 Ag−1. Furthermore, long-term cyclic stability of 3000 GCD cycles at 2 Ag−1 with 92.2% of capacitance retention was attained. Hence, CuV2O6 is one of the potential electrode materials for energy storage systems due to its significant properties, such as porous nanostructure and good surface area.
