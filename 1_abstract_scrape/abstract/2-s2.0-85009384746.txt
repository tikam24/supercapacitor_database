We report the fabrication of high energy Li-ion capacitor (LIC) using teak wood sawdust derived mesoporous activated carbon (AC-HBP) with electrochemically pre-lithiated graphite (LiC6). Three interesting supercapacitor assemblies are constructed using AC-HBP to realize the high energy density. Amongst, AC-HBP paired with LiC6 delivered a maximum energy density of ∼111 Wh kg−1 compared to Li4Ti5O12 in LIC (∼53 Wh kg−1) and AC-HBP (∼37 Wh kg−1) in symmetric configurations. This excellent energy density is mainly ascribed to the tailored mesoporous nature (∼67%) of the high surface area activated carbon (2108 m2 g−1) obtained via hydrothermal carbonization process in the presence of processing agent, benzene tetracarboxylic acid followed by physico-chemical activation.
