Supercapacitors have received a great attention owing to their exceptional characteristics like outstanding cycle life, high power and eco-friendly nature. In recent years, chitin/chitosan derived porous carbon electrode materials for energy storage applications have gained a substantial consideration due to their broad accessibility, high porosity, less weight, natural biodegradability, renewability, and eco-friendly. More importantly, chitin/chitosan biopolymers have a linear long chain-like moiety attached to functionalize the surface groups with -Î²-D glucosidic linkage which can be exploited as templates for constructing electrode materials with tunable and well-definite geometrics. The main focus was on porous carbon derived from heteroatoms doped chitin/chitosan biopolymers along with their composites in supercapacitor applications. In addition, the overall behaviors in supercapacitor application have been discussed in terms of specific capacitance, specific surface area, voltage window, energy density, and power density. Furthermore, the present review addresses the up-to-date development accomplished in chitin/chitosan materials for supercapacitor electrodes. Eventually, the recent challenges and forthcoming perspectives of the chitin/chitosan biopolymer derived porous carbon electrode materials with respect to the supercapacitor's performance were thoroughly tinted along with future energy storage devices, such as fuel cell, solar cells and lithium ion battery.
