In this work, the effects of different Co3O4:KOH mass ratios on the microstructure, chemical state, and surface properties of Co3O4 nanoparticles were investigated and discussed. The different KOH contents in the activation process affecting the electrochemical properties of the samples were determined in a three-electrode configuration. The results showed that the sample with a Co3O4:KOH mass ratio of 1:0.5 (Co@0.5KOH) exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 204.0 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g. The excellent capacitance retention of 97.7% was observed after a 5000 cycle galvanostatic charge/discharge test. A symmetrical two-electrode system was set up, and the results showed that the Co@0.5KOH sample had a superior energy density of 3.5 Wh/kg and a power density of 276.0 W/kg at a current density of 1 A/g. The KOH activation method was effective and could be extended to other metal oxides to obtain better electrode materials for supercapacitors.
