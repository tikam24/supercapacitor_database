In this article, a contribution to the fault diagnosis of a doubly fed induction generator for a closed-loop controlled wind turbine system associated with a two-level energy storage system using an on-line fault diagnostic technique is proposed. This technique is proposed to detect the rotor fault in the doubly fed induction generator under non-stationary conditions based on the spectral analysis of stator currents of the doubly fed induction generator by an adaptive fast Fourier transform algorithm. Furthermore, to prevent system deterioration, a fractional-order controller with a simple design method is used for the control of the whole wind turbine system. The fractional-order controller ensures that the system is stable in both healthy and faulty conditions. Additionally, to improve the production capacity under wind speed fluctuations and grid demand changes, a two-level energy storage system consisting of a supercapacitor bank and lead-acid batteries is proposed. The obtained simulation results show that the objectives of the fault diagnosis procedure and control strategy are reached. Â© 2014
