This paper examines several existing voltage equalizers techniques for energy storage system, with a focusing on batteries and supercapacitors. Due satisfy the demands, energy storage cells are often coupled in series/parallel. However, divergence of voltage distributed among cells produces the problems of voltage imbalance that affecting the ageing of energy storage system and solved through equalizers. Several assessments from features of topologies in voltage balancing circuit supplied primarily based total on a few attentionsâ€™ just like the effectiveness in balance and components. Voltage balancing is essentially separated into two categories: passive and active equalizers. Therefore, this paper studied and reviewed several topologies from both equalizer types with the sample result to verify the topology performance.
