Biomass-derived carbon by activation with nitrogen and cobalt (denoted as NPAC Co ) was prepared by one-pot pyrolysis of pomelo peel with melamine, cobalt nitrate and potassium hydroxide, followed by acid leaching. NPAC Co possesses high content of quaternary-N (2.5%) and pyridinic-N (1.7%), co-existences of amorphous and short-range ordered carbon, high specific surface area and pore structure with majority of micropores and small mesopores. As electrode material of supercapacitors, NPAC Co exhibits high specific capacitance and good rate capability. At ultrahigh rate of 50 A g −1 (135 mA cm −2 ), the capacitance of NPAC Co remains 246 F g −1 , which is 6.3, 1.9 and 3.2 times as high as that of other three materials (PC, PAC and NPAC). The as-assembled symmetric supercapacitor of NPAC Co delivers high energy density, high power density and excellent cycling stability. With respect to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), NPAC Co exhibits high onset potential (0.87 V), high half-wave potential (0.78 V), excellent methanol tolerance and low yield of H 2 O 2 . The ORR properties of NPAC Co are comparable or superior to those of commercial Pt/C. This investigation of pomelo peel-based NPAC Co would be valuable for development of both supercapacitor and ORR.
