The Supercapacitor Assisted Low Dropout Regulator (SCALDO) is a novel approach to achieving high end-to-end efficiency (ETEE) in linear, step-down, DC-DC converters. This is a patented technique and it has been well established with various proof-of-concept prototypes showing its efficiency advantage in the range of a factor of 1.33 to 3 along with the other excellent linear characteristics such as low noise and high slew rate. As a better way of utilizing this approach to match multiple voltage rail applications such as mobile battery operated products, processor-based systems, automotive systems, and data centers, a further extension to the technique called Dual-Output Supercapacitor Assisted Low Dropout Regulator (DO-SCALDO) has been suggested. In this paper, the design approach and the practical implementation details of a prototype version of 5V-to-dual 1.8 V DO-SCALDO are discussed.
