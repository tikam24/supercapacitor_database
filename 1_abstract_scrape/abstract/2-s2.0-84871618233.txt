Poly-2,5-dimethoxyaniline coating has been fabricated on active carbon (AC) substrates by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in organic system. The resulted coating is hydrolyzed to produce poly-2,5-dihydroxyaniline (PDHA) to enhance the capacitance of the composite electrode. Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra, CV, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and galvanostatic charge/discharge test are used to investigate the properties of these electrodes. In organic electrolyte, due to the introduced hydroquinone units, high value of capacitance up to 975 F g-1 of the PDHA/AC has been obtained at a current density of 0.37 A g-1 at a potential window of 0-1.5 V. An asymmetric capacitor has been assembled with the PDHA/AC positive and pure AC negative electrodes, which is able to obtain a specific energy as high as 178 Whkg -1 in the potential range of 0-2.0 V at a current density of 0.93 A g-1. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
