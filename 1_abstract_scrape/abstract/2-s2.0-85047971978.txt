This article presents the means for reducing the capacity of batteries in DC auxiliary power systems of substations with electromagnetic drives of high-voltage switches. The evaluation of the reducing effect of supercapacitors on the capacity of the battery and the economic effect is given. The estimation of the fulfillment of requirements of voltage dips in DC network of substations during the electromagnetic drive starting was made. The recommendations of the supercapacitors application for using of batteries in DC auxiliary power systems of substations with lower capacity were proposed.
