Manufacturing electrode films at an industrial-level submillimeter thickness (≈100 µm) with superior volumetric performance is of practical significance for the commercialization of miniaturized supercapacitor systems. This work proposes a commercially scalable solvated-ion-intercalated hydrothermal strategy to demonstrate a record-high volumetric capacitance (511.29 F cm−3) for supercapacitors based on an industrial-level submillimeter MoS2 film electrode (94.2 µm). The intercalated solvated Li+ ions increase the amount of negative surface charge and reduce the formation energy of 1T MoS2, leading to a high metallic phase content of 82.7% with enhanced electrical conductivity. Together with the expanded interlayer distance (≈1.23 nm), this allows rapid electron transfer and ion transport in the excessively stacked ultrathick MoS2 film to be simultaneously realized. Thus, the as-fabricated MoS2||graphene/carbon nanotube asymmetric supercapacitor presents both high energy and power densities, outperforms those of commercial devices, including supercapacitors with submillimeter-thick electrodes and even micrometer-thick electrodes.
