Bacteria-loaded polyaniline@multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) composite materials were prepared, and their electrochemical properties were investigated for application in supercapacitor electrodes. The polyaniline@MWNTs composite were synthesized through in situ polymerization of polyaniline in MWNTs dispersion. Then, two types of bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria) were loaded on the polyaniline@MWNTs composite and carbonized to produce bacteria-loaded composite electrodes. Bacteria were first attached to the composites through electrostatic interaction and porous morphology, then doped after the carbonization process. The composites showed different electrochemical properties depending on the type of bacteria applied, and exhibited increased specific capacitance regardless of bacteria type. Bacteria-loaded materials, which exhibited a maximum specific capacitance value of 57.7 F g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 within a potential window of -1 – 0 V, achieved an increment of 60%, and this was maintained up to 70% after 1000 charging/discharging cycles.
