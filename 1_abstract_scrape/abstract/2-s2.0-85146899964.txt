High power laser weapon has important strategic significance in military. As a pulsed load, it requires large energy and high peak power. When using the mobile platform, it is necessary to match the energy storage system with high output performance to provide electric energy. The battery has high energy density and strong energy storage capacity; Supercapacitor has high power density and fast dynamic response. The composite energy storage system based on battery and supercapacitor can meet the energy storage requirements of high-power pulse load. Firstly, this paper determines the topology of the composite power supply and models the composite energy storage system accordingly. Then the energy management strategy based on fuzzy control is proposed. Finally, the simulation analysis of sudden loading and unloading of load is carried out in the AMESim-Matlab joint simulation platform.Meanwhile, the correctness of the control strategy is verified. The research results have important academic and engineering significance for the performance improvement of airborne energy storage system in the future.
