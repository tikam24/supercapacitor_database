Cobalt Oxide (Co3O4) nanoparticles were synthesized with an aid of urea by sol–gel method. The results of X-ray diffraction revealed that the formation of face-centered cubic (Fd3m) structure and the average crystallite size of the product were found to be 13.76 nm. The formation of cobalt oxide is confirmed by FT-IR analysis. The results of HR-TEM images reveal that Co3O4 nanoparticles were found to have within the range of 13–15 nm. At 3 M KOH, electrochemical analyses were investigated with impedance spectroscopy and an intrinsic pseudo capacitance and the results were reported. The results of Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests revealed the capacitive properties of Co3O4 with the highest specific capacitance of 761.25 F g−1. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]
