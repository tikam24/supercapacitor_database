Supercapacitors, which are also known as ultracapacitors, have been intensively explored as energy storage devices because of their pulse power supply, ultralong cyclability, ease in operation, and high dynamics of charge propagation. Supercapacitors have the potential for use in various energy storage systems. Carbonous materials like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been extensively considered as high-performance electrodes in supercapacitors with both a high power density and high energy density owing to their excellent physicochemical properties. The physical properties like high surface area and remarkable electrical conductivity of both CNT and graphene made them the potential candidate for supercapacitor electrode material. In this chapter, we summarize the progress of recent research on the development of carbon nanotubes and graphene using various processes.
