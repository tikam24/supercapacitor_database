With the increase of photovoltaic penetration rate, the fluctuation of photovoltaic power generation affects the reliability of ship power grids. Marine PV grid-connected systems with high penetration rates should generally have a low voltage ride-through capability. In the present paper, a strategy in which super capacitors are applied for energy storage in a marine photovoltaic grid-connected system is proposed, and an inverter adopts independent decoupling control of active and reactive currents to improve the LVRT capability of photovoltaic grid-connected systems. In addition, a comprehensive control strategy is also designed to control the supercapacitor, to regulate the active power through the control method of the voltage outer loop and the current inner loop, in order to maintain the DC bus voltage stability. At the same time, the inverter can increase the reactive power output to support the grid voltage. The advantage of this system is in smoothing the power imbalance in a short time, enhancing the low voltage ride-through capability of the photovoltaic grid-connected system, improving the power quality, and ensuring the safety and stability of the ship’s power grid. MATLAB/Simulink were employed to establish a ro-ro ship super capacitor–marine photovoltaic grid-connected power system model and to carry out simulation experiments by setting the grid voltage drop. The results show that when the grid voltage drops, the inverter adjusts the distribution of active and reactive power. The power factor drops from 1 to 0.77, and the effective value of the voltage drop increases from 150 V to 156 V, which proves that this strategy effectively reduces the depth of the grid voltage drop and improves the low voltage ride-through capability of the photovoltaic grid-connected system.
