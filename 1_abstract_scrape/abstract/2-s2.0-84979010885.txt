The polyaniline (PANI)/activated carbon (AC) nanocomposite was prepared by Ex-Situ chemical synthesis method. In this method, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied as a binder and finally, prepared electrodes were used for supercapacitor applications. Their structures and morphologies were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The electrochemical properties and supercapacitive behaviors of the PANI, AC, and AC/PANI/PVA electrodes were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), charge/discharge, and cycle life measurements. As demonstrated in SEM images, uniformly distribution of PANI nanofibers onto porous surface of AC particles results in the formation of interlinked porous networks. Charge/discharge measurements showed that specific capacitance of AC/PANI/PVA nanocomposite electrode (66.6 F.g−1) is greater than that of pure AC electrode (25 F.g−1) which is due to the pseudocapacitance (redox reaction) contribution of PANI chains. In addition, the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of PANI electrode were lower than that of AC/PANI/PVA nanocomposite electrode. Good charge/discharge cycling stability of AC/PANI/PVA nanocomposite electrode versus the PANI electrode is assigned to the presence of AC particles in its composition.
