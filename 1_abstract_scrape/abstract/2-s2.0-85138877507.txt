Current faster economic development and an increasing population need clean and renewable energy sources and advanced technologies to store such energy, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Recent electric vehicle (EV) development needs energy storage devices having high energy density and power density along with superior cycle life. Even though the battery has high energy density, due to low power density and lower cycle life, it leads to work on other technologies, such as supercapacitor. The Supercapacitor attracted major attention from the research world due to its excellent characteristics, such as high-power density, fast charge-discharge, higher operating temperature range, and superior cycle life. This review covers the development of supercapacitor technology in the automotive sector, as well as the various materials used for supercapacitor technology. Finally, a review complete with future challenges in supercapacitor technology from an automotive point of view.
