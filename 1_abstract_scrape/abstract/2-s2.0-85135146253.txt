The proceedings contain 42 papers. The topics discussed include: effect of synthesis route on the structural and electrical properties of sodium bismuth titanate: a comparative study of solid-state and polyol mediated synthesis; electrochemical study of copper oxide and activated charcoal based nanocomposite electrode for supercapacitor; deposition and optimization of piezoelectric zinc oxide-layer using sol-gel technique for MEMS acoustic sensor; bridged circular microstrip patch antenna for wireless applications; effect of annealing temperature on the electrical and photoluminascence properties of tin oxide thin films prepared by sol-gel spin coating technique; characterization of chemically deposited nanocrystalline CdSe thin films from transmittance spectra; and comparative analysis of various code domain NOMA schemes for future communication networks.
