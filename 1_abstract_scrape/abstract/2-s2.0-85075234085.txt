Rational design and simple synthesis of carbon-based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are essential for their practical applications in electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, we report the synthesis of nitrogen, sulfur co-doped three-dimensional interconnected hierarchically porous carbon (NSHPC) by zinc acetate assisted pyrolysis of polymer networks. The thus-synthesized NSHPC has a specific surface area of 1057 cm2 g-1 with the coexistence of micro-and meso-pores. As metal-free electrocatalyst, the NSHPC exhibits a promising activity towards oxygen reduction reactions as evidenced by the slightly negative shift of half-wave potential compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. The assembled lithium ion battery using NSHPC as anode delivers the reversible capacity of 740 and 470 mA h g-1 at current densities of 2 and 5 A g-1 without performance decay after 1000 charge-discharge cycles. Moreover, the assembled supercapacitor using NSHPC as electrode has the capacitance of 203 F g-1 at 1 A g-1.
