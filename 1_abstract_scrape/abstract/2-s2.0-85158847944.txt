The current work involves employing hydrothermally generated nanostructured MnO2 to produce MnO2/ZnO-based nanocomposite with weight percentages of 3:7, 5:5, and 7:3 and demonstrating their electrochemical performance. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) were used to analyze the produced MnO2 and MnO2/ZnO nanocomposite. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are used to evaluate electrochemical performance. MnO2/ZnO (5:5) has the greatest specific capacitance of 277.5 F/g at a current density of 0.3A/g, and more significantly, an energy density of 24.66 Wh/kg at a power density of 49.06 KW/kg was observed, demonstrating that MnO2/ZnO is a promising material for supercapacitors devices.
