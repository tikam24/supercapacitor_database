Transition Metal Vanadates proved to have diversified applications in photochemical, electrochemical, energy generation and storage, and fluorescence materials. Bandgap fabrication and modifying structure morphology to suit the need have been challenging. Nanocrystalline Zinc vanadate (Zn2V2O7) crystals on Graphene Oxide scaffolds were synthesized by hydrothermal method. The structure and functional bonding properties of the prepared nanomaterial was analyzed by powder X-Ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The bandgap is determined by UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), and the surface charge and particle size are analyzed by dynamic light scattering analysis. Scanning Electron Microscopy equipped with a Field Emission gun is employed to check the material's morphology. The nanoparticles obtained were of size 37.1 nm, and the zeta potential of nanoparticles was found to be − 29.6 mV, which indicates the dispersion and stability of the material prepared. The specific capacitance value of the synthesized nanoparticles was 148.1 Fg−1. The active composite material was exploited as an electrode for the supercapacitor application, and it revealed that synthesized Zn2V2O7 nanoparticles lead to a possible application for future energy storage technologies.
