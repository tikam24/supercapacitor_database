In this study, the concept of selecting the propulsion system parameters of an extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) powered from a supercapacitor (SC) pack and a range extender (REX) consisting of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Electric Generator (G) was presented. The methodology of parameter selection was verified by computer simulation as well as by laboratory tests. On the basis of initial laboratory tests, parameters (capacitance as a function of the terminal voltage) of the supercapacitors pack were determined and subsequently used in the EREV simulation model. The tests were carried out for the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), and the vehicle parameters were scaled to the capabilities of the laboratory stand. Research on EREV powered from supercapacitor pack allowed to conclude that it is possible to properly select the capacitance of SC pack and the power of the REX, so that the WLTC cycle can be realized. Thanks to EREV powered from SC it is possible to work at the point of the highest efficiency of ICE, which is associated with the least fuel consumption.
