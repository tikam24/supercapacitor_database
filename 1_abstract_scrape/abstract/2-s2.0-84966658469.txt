Sulphonated polysulphone (SPS) has been synthesized and subsequently applied as binder for graphene oxide (GO)-based electrodes for development of electrochemical supercapacitors. Electrochemical performance of the electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry in 1M Na2SO4 and 1M KOH solution. The fabricated supercapacitors gave a specific capacitance of 161.6 and 216.8 F/g with 215.4 W/kg and 450 W/kg of power density, in 1M Na2SO4 and 1M KOH solutions, respectively. This suggests that KOH is a better electrolyte than Na2SO4 for studying the electrochemical behavior of electroactive material, and also suggests SPS is a good binder for fabrication of a GO based electrode.
