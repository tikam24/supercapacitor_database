High-power density supercapacitors and high-energy–density batteries have gotten a lot of interest since they are critical for the power supply of future electric cars, portable electronic gadgets, unmanned aircraft, and so on. The electrode materials used in supercapacitors and batteries have a significant impact on the practical energy and power density. Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have the outstanding electrochemical ability because of their ultrahigh porous structure, ease of functionalization, and great specific surface area. These features make it an intriguing electrode material with good electrochemical efficiency for high-storage batteries. Thus, this review summarizes current developments in MOFs-based materials as an electrode for electric vehicle battery applications. We introduce several kinds of batteries and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Also, current developments in MOFs composite, the use of MOF-derived materials as electrode materials in electric car batteries, and MOFs architectures and their features were highlighted. Lastly, the future of MOF-related materials for electric vehicle batteries was discussed and provide some guidance on where this field is headed.
