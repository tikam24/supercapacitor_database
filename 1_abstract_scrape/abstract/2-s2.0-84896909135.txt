In this work, we developed a one-pot approach to fabricate CoFe 2O4/FeOOH nanocomposites without any surfactant. By tailoring the urea concentration, flower-like nanostructures of CoFe 2O4/FeOOH nanocomposites can be obtained. The electrochemical properties of the CoFe2O4/FeOOH electrodes were elucidated by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge/discharge tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Flower-like CoFe2O4/FeOOH exhibited a specific capacitance of 332.4 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A g-1, and excellent cycling stability (91.3% retention after 1000 cycles, 5 A g-1). These findings suggested that this facile synthetic strategy could be useful to design and synthesize hierarchical electrode nanocomposites with enhanced supercapacitive performance.
