Herein, we demonstrate a flexible, structural robust and highly electrochemical active film electrode based on evenly distributed carboxymethylcellulose-polyaniline/carbon nanotube (CMC-PANI/CNT) for supercapacitors. In this process, vertically aligned PANI nanoparticles grow in an orderly manner on CMC fibers. The highly dispersed CNT nanomaterials are then introduced by simple layer-by-layer assembly, eventually forming an interwoven network structure. Mechanical tests have shown that the obtained CMC-PANI/CNT film exhibit excellent robustness and flexibility, and can be used directly as electrodes without any conductive additives and binders. The CMC-PANI/CNT electrode with optimal CMC, PANI and CNT contents demonstrates an excellent area specific capacitance of 3106.3 mF cm−2 at 5 mA cm−2 and a gravimetric specific capacitance of 348.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1. Furthermore, the symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) assembled with CMC-PANI/CNT exhibits a high energy density of 99.89 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 400.02 μW cm−2, and a good cycling stability (with capacitance retention of 89.2 % after 5000 cycles). The cost-effective and eco-friendly preparation method of free-standing CMC-PANI/CNT film electrodes provide a novel insight for developing flexible energy storage devices.
