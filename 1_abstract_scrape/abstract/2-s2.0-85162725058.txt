The present work proposes a coordinated power management scheme (CPMS) of wind energy-fed self-excited induction generator (SEIG) based low-voltage direct current (LVDC) autonomous microgrid. The battery and supercapacitor (SC) based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is interfaced with the common 48 V LVDC bus using a parallel-active configuration through two bidirectional converters. The central idea of hybridization is to mitigate the instantaneous surge current demand and alleviate the charge/discharge stress during transients, thus ultimately enhancing the cycle life of the battery. The experimental validation of the autonomous LVDC microgrid equipped with the CPMS is conducted for various operating modes. The dSPACE DS1103 digital controller is used for the real-time implementation of the complete system. The effectiveness of the proposed CPMS is supported by the analysis of comparative experimental results demonstrates its ability to incorporate seamless mode transition. The developed 48 V LVDC microgrid can be a promising solution for powering consumer electronics in homes/office spaces or other small-scale applications.
