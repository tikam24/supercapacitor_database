Three-dimensional porous nickel foam was used as a current collector to prepare a Co-Ni oxide/Ni foam electrode for a supercapacitor. The synthesized Co-Ni oxide was proven to consist of mixed oxide phases of Co3O 4 and NiO. The Co-Ni oxide/Ni foam electrode prepared was characterized by morphological observation, crystalline property analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry for the electrode showed high specific capacitances, such as 936 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and 566 F g-1 at 200 mV s-1, and a comparatively good cycle performance. These improved results were mainly due to the dimensional stability of the nickel foam and its high electrical contact between the electrode material and the current collector substrate.
