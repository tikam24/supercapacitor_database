Electrochemical Double Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) play great roles in research and development field of power engineering as a new energy store device. The porous carbon material developed in our Lab exhibits perfect physical structure and properties. Its good electrochemical performances are confirmed by the experiment of CV and AC impedance analysis etc. The specific capacitance of active carbon is 173.2 F/g at the 16 mA/cm2 current density discharge. And under large discharge current condition, the specific capacitance of EDLC decayed little with a thrilling life over 105 times at the same time. A hybrid power source consisting of Nickel-hydrogen and double layer capacitor is demonstrated to power successfully a simulated load encountered in communication equipment.
