SnO2 nanoparticles were synthesized by coprecipitation method and were characterized by XRD (Rutile tetragonal), FESEM (spherical), EDS (Sn and O) and FTIR (O-Sn-O stretching). The electrochemical performance of the supercapacitor was analyzed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. The maximum specific capacitance of 122 F g-1 was obtained at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1.
