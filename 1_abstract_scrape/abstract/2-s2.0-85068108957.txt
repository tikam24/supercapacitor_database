Understanding the effect of heteroatoms on the capacitance of doped carbon provides an effective strategy to boost its electrochemical performance. Here we show that the pseudocapacitive behavior is closely related to the chemical sites of bonded oxygen, which can be enhanced by immobilizing oxygen functional groups on micropores. Additionally, the doping styles have a significant influence on the capacitance retention ability. High capacitance of 3457 mF cm-2 achieved for the as-prepared oxygen-doped carbon cloth also promises its application to flexible solid-state supercapacitors (SSCs). These findings can open up new opportunities for future design and application of advanced heteroatom-doped materials for high-performance flexible energy storage devices.
