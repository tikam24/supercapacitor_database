The synthesis of materials on magnetic activated carbon is of concern, with a simple and environmentally friendly. The research used pecan shell (Aleurites moluccana) as a carbon source. The breakthrough made in this research is to make magnetic activated carbon electrodes in supercapacitors. Obtained on the XRD diffractograms show the graphite lattice, respectively. Also, a sharp, narrow peak is seen at 2θ = 26° in the carbon samples spectrum, showing a highly graphitized fraction. FESEM-EDX showed AC20/80 that the shape of the particles was like plates indicating that the particles had been formed. AC80/20 is the surface morphology in which particles with irregular shapes indicate that particles have been formed, where the shape of the particles is irregular. The composition between C and O is also balanced. AC80/20 has lower Co content than AC20/80, AC40/60, AC60/40, and AC50/50 and it appears that AC80/20 is better than the others. The magnitude of the coercivity states that AC20/80, AC80/20, AC40/60, AC60/40, and AC50/50 are strong magnets. The lower the value of the open circuit potential, it will show electrochemical stability. The Nyquist plots of magnetic activated carbon show a straight vertical indicating the process of charge transfer resistance at the low electrode. Obtained specific capacitance AC80/20 at 150F/g.
