Nickel oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple aqueous solution method with carbon black powder. X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the mean size of the synthesized nickel oxide is 8.3 nm, which is much smaller than that obtained from other two methods without carbon black powder annealed at 350C (21.1 nm) and with carbon black powder annealed at 600C (15.6 nm). Accordingly, the specific capacitance in the first case is 161.4 Fg1, which is much larger than that of 139.1 and 11.5 Fg1 synthesized by the other two methods. Consequently, the method supplies a simple way to obtain super-fine electrode material for supercapacitor. Â© 2011 IEEE.
