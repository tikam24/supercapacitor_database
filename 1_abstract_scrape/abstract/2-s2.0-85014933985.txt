This paper considers the synthesis of RC electrical circuits from physics-based supercapacitor models that describe conservation and diffusion relationships. The proposed synthesis procedure uses model discretisation, linearisation, balanced model order reduction and passive network synthesis to form the circuits. Circuits with different topologies are synthesized from physical models. Because the synthesized impedance functions are generated by considering the physics, rather than from experimental fitting which may ignore dynamics, this work provides greater understanding of the physical interpretation of electrical circuits and will enable the development of more generalised circuits.
