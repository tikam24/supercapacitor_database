Nowadays the distributed generation is being vastly implemented due to its various advantages. Generally a non renewable source is connected in parallel to a renewable source. Normally Photo Voltaic (PV) generation gives the power necessary by the load. The output of the PV is varying due to various reasons like temperature, irradiation, etc. Distributed generation using micro turbine is a realistic solution because of its friendliness with environment, small in size and high efficiency of energy. If the load is more than PV power capability, micro turbine supplies the remaining power. Due to the varying load conditions, the micro turbine practically compensates all the PV fluctuations of power. Even so, to reduce the fast fluctuations of power, one need to use an energy storage system like battery, ultra capacitor and flywheel etc. Ultra capacitor has been chosen, because of the its high power density and very fast energy storing capability. This paper documents the simulation and analysis of a standalone Photovoltaic / Micro turbine hybrid system and Photovoltaic / Micro turbine / Ultra capacitor hybrid system using MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation software. The system is implemented based on the concept of a parallel hybrid configuration. The simulation results validate the proposal.
