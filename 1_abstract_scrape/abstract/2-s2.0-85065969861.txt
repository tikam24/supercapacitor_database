Wind and solar are the most emerging renewable energy sources to meet residential load demands and to make the environment healthy, cleaner and greener. When these sources are combined to have a DC microgrid, problem of power fluctuation among the sources and loads occurs. Also the problem of grid voltage stability is faced. Although battery energy storage system solves these problems but due to demerits and limitations of batteries and due to superseding characteristics of supercapacitors, combination of battery and supercapacitor is used to solve the above mentioned problems. Battery has low power density but high energy density whereas supercapacitor has high power density but lower energy density. So, battery provides lower power for longer duration and supercapacitor provides high power for shorter duration. This paper presents a control strategy to solve power fluctuation problem using combination of battery and supercapacitor for Wind Turbine Generator (WTG) and Solar PV fed DC microgrid in islanded mode of operation.
