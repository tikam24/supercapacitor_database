Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have recently emerged as promising hierarchical structured porous materials for high-performance energy storage and conversion devices due to their unique tunable structure and excellent porosity. Herein, we reported a “one for two” strategy to prepare NiCo2S4 nanorods directly grown on carbon cloth (NiCo2S4@CC) via a simply modified MOFs-derived approach for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors and efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As an electrode for asymmetric supercapacitors, the NiCo2S4@CC electrode showed excellent electrochemical performance with high specific capacitance and good rate capability. The asymmetric supercapacitor using NiCo2S4@CC as a cathode electrode and N-doped porous carbon nanosheets grown on the CC (NC@CC) as an anode electrode achieved a superior energy density and power density and a long cycle life. Furthermore, the NiCo2S4@CC exhibited a notable electrocatalytic activity as an electrocatalyst for OER. The remarkable electrochemical performance of as-prepared NiCo2S4@CC could be mainly attributed to its hierarchical structure, sufficient active sites and low metal-anion bond energy after sulfuration reaction. This work could provide an unprecedented opportunity to fabricate functional materials under rational design for various applications.
