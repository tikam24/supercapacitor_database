This paper focuses on the simulation of a Dual Active Bridge converter (DAB) by applying an open-loop and closed-loop Proportional, Integral and Derivative (PID) control strategy during the charging and discharging process of the supercapacitor-based power system, controlling the voltage output when the converter works in steady state to maintain a constant power transfer over a time span.
