In order to meet the characteristics of the fiber required for the separator preparation, fibers fibrillation could be prepared by low-consistency light beating or high-consistency refining, and the physical properties of the separator prepared were tested. The supercapacitors prepared using the separators with different porosities were subjected to electrochemical performance analysis. The results showed that compared with the low-consistency light beating method, the high-consistency refining could effectively retain the fiber length and increase the fiber aspect ratio. When the beating degree was 85°SR, the tensile strength of the separator reached 0.55 kN/m, the porosity was 67%, and the Gurley permeability value was 41.7 μm/(Pa•s). As the porosity of the separator increased, the supercapacitor had a higher specific capacitance retention at different current densities, and the cyclic volt-ampere characteristic curve also exhibited good capacitance performance.
