Composite electrodes were fabricated for supercapacitor applications by depositing vanadium oxide onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) buckypaper using supercritical fluid deposition (SFD). The deposited thin vanadium oxide layer showed amorphous structure with excellent uniformity. In aqueous KCl electrolyte, the vanadium oxide exhibited a constant pseudo-capacitance of ∼ 1024Fg- 1, which was independent of the oxide material loading (up to 6.92wt%) and voltage scan rate (up to 100mVs- 1). The highest specific electrode capacitance achieved was ∼ 85Fg- 1, which was almost four times that of the pristine buckypaper electrode. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.
