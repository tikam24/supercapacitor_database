N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon/graphene composites with supercapacitor performance are successful synthesized by evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA). In this procedure, using phenolic resin as carbon source, triblock copolymer (F127) as template, hydrochloric acid as catalyst, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as structure enhancer agent and urea as additive for improving graphitization and surface wettability, ordered mesoporous carbon is formed by EISA and low temperature carbonization. At the same time, graphene is added into the mixed solution with the carbon source. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N2 sorption analysis results illustrate that the samples display two-dimensional ordered mesoporous structure with uniform pore diameter (âˆ¼4 nm). The highest surface area could reach to 1801 m2/g and the biggest pore volume can be up to 1.55 cm3/g. The reinforcement of graphitization is implied by the Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle XRD results. The capacitor performance test shows a capacitance of 246 F/g at 1 A/g with excellent stability.
