Manganese phosphate (Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O) nanosheets are successfully fabricated via a facile chemical precipitation method. The Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O nanosheets synthesized at 70 °C show excellent supercapacitive performance in 2 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. Typical pseudocapacitance feature of Mn3(PO4)2·3H2O nanosheets treated at various annealing temperatures is then evaluated in 2 M KOH alkaline electrolyte. M3 annealed at 750 °C exhibits the optimal integrated electrochemical properties. Furthermore, an asymmetric supercapacitor composed of M3 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode can reach the high-voltage region of 0–1.7 V. The asymmetric supercapacitor displays high energy density of 32.32 Wh kg−1 and power density of 4250 W kg−1. The impressive results presented here may pave the way for promising applications in high energy density storage systems.
