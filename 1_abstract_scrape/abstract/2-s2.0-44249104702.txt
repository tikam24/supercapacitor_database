The electrochemical behaviour of a chemically activated carbon with oxygen-containing surface groups was studied using a conventional macroelectrode configuration with disc electrodes and the single particle microelectrode technique. The results of both experimental set-ups were compare taking into account the visible peaks of the surface groups, capacitance and Faradaic currents. Galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry performed at different potential windows clearly indicated that the microelectrode configuration was more sensitive to Faradic phenomena (i.e. oxygenated functional groups). The incorporation of mainly CO2-evolving groups after positive polarization may cause the degradation of the carbon material, leading to a distortion in its capacitive behaviour as a result of a restriction of the available surface area.
