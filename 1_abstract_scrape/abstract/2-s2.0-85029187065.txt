Increasing the energy-storage density for supercapacitors is critical for their applications. Many researchers have attempted to identify optimal candidate component materials to achieve this goal, but investigations into systematically optimizing their mixing rate for maximizing the performance of each candidate material have been insufficient, which hinders the progress in their technology. In this study, we employ a statistically systematic method to determine the optimum mixing ratio of three components that constitute graphene-based supercapacitor electrodes: reduced graphene oxide (rGO), acetylene black (AB), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). By using the extremevertices design, the optimized proportion is determined to be (rGO: AB: PVDF = 0.95: 0.00: 0.05). The corresponding energy-storage density increases by a factor of 2 compared with that of nonoptimized electrodes. Electrochemical and microscopic analyses are performed to determine the reason for the performance improvements.
