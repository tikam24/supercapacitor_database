This paper deals with the model-based analysis of a Supercapacitor for diagnostic purposes. A two legs nonlinear physical model is assumed for the Supercapacitor and the corresponding second-order nonlinear state-space mathematical model is obtained. Then, an Extended Kalman Filter is tuned so that the estimated outputs reproduce the voltages at the equivalent capacitance terminals; they give information on the state of health of the supercapacitor but are not directly measurable. In particular, an optimization problem is firstly formulated, involving the experimental input-output data and those given by the Extended Kalman Filter.
