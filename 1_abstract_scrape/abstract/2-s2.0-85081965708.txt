Hierarchical agglomerated cauliflower-like ZnWO4@NiO nanoparticles were successfully prepared using the facile chemical bath deposition method for supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical studies revealed a higher value of specific capacity as 225.131 mA h gâˆ’1. Further, the ZnWO4@NiO electrode possesses a higher rate capability of 83.78% and good cycling stability of 94.27% after 4000 cycles, respectively. The impressive electrochemical studies and their morphology reveal that the as-prepared ZnWO4@NiO composite electrode possess high energy storage performance.
