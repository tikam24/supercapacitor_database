Supercapacitors which have been widely used in portable electronics and hybrid electric vehicles are considered to be fascinating energy storage devices owing to their higher energy density than traditional capacitors and higher power density than batteries. The performance of supercapacitors is much dependent on the properties of the used electrode materials, and much effort has been devoted to exploring high-performance electrodes. During the past decade, cobalt-based materials, especially Co3O4 and its composites, have been regarded as prominent electrode materials for supercapacitors in view of their relatively low cost, high theoretical specific capacitance, non-toxicity, and excellent electrochemical activity. In this review, we attempt to provide some basic insights into the rational design of Co3O4 based materials/composites and their capacitive properties for supercapacitors. The electrochemical advantages of Co3O4 as a supercapacitor material are summarized, and many examples are illustrated. The remaining challenges in exploration of Co3O4-based materials as efficient electrodes for supercapacitors are also discussed and the future research directions are offered.
