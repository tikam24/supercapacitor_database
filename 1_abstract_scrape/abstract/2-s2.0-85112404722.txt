Conversion-type NiCoMn triple perovskite fluorides (KNCMF-622) have been explored for advanced aqueous supercapacitors (ASCs), batteries (ABs) and supercapatteries (i.e., ASC/Bs). The ASC/Bs outperform the ASCs and ABs, owing to the synergistic effect of capacitive, pseudocapacitive and faradaic characteristics, showing great significance in developing energy storage devices.
