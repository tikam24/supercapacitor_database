In this paper a measurement system for determination of supercapacitor equivalent parameters is proposed. Specific properties of materials used for supercapacitor construction require some advanced tools and measurement procedures to be applied during tests. The measurement system allows to measure values of equivalent parameters by both the DC and AC method whilst keeping appropriate time criteria required by this type of devices. Furthermore, in this paper the most relevant properties and measurement capabilities of the proposed system are described as well as some exemplary values of the supercapacitor equivalent parameters measured experimentally are presented.
