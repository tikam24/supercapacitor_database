High surface area, porous nanostructures have attracted research interest for supercapacitors due to their high power density and long cycle life. Herein, porous hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanostructures have been synthesized via ferrous oxyhydroxide (α-FeOOH) as a precursor material. The hematite (α-Fe2O3) nanorods have been prepared by heating α-FeOOH at 300 °C for 3 h under an air atmosphere. The prepared porous α-Fe2O3 nanorods are polycrystalline with a high surface area of 197 m2 g−1 with a pore diameter of 8.9 nm. The electrochemical capacitance performance of α-Fe2O3 nanostructures has been evaluated. The high discharge capacitance is 372 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 with high capacitance retention of about 83% observed upon charge–discharge cycling after 3000 cycles. The high discharge rate and cyclic stability are attributed to the porous nature and high surface area of α-Fe2O3 nanorods. As α-Fe2O3 is economic and environmentally friendly nature, it has potential application for supercapacitors.
