In this work, one-step electrodeposition of multiwalled carbon nanotube/NiCo dihydroxide nanocomposite (MWCNT/NiCo-DH) was developed to fabricate supercapacitor positive electrode. However, the poor adhesion of the composite to the Ni foam (NiF) seriously hampered its practical applications. We discovered that by modifying the Ni foam with Ni3Se2, the adhesion of the MWCNT/NiCo-DH to the Ni foam was dramatically improved. By investigating the obtained MWCNT/NiCo-DH/Ni3Se2/NiF, it was found out that the introduction of Ni3Se2 not only makes the electrode materials firmly attach to the surface of the Ni foam but also significantly enhances its electrochemical behaviors. MWCNT/NiCo-DH/Ni3Se2/NiF presents a high areal capacity of 3.55 C cm−2 at a very high current density of 60 mA cm−2. It is especially worth noting that MWCNT/NiCo-DH/Ni3Se2/NiF retains almost 100% of its initial capacity even after 2000 consecutive galvanostatic charge–discharge cycles, suggesting excellent cycling stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is also assembled with MWCNT/NiCo-DH/Ni3Se2/NiF as the positive electrode and active carbon as the negative electrode. The ASC displays a prominent energy density of 35.52 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 485.12 W kg−1. The excellent capacitive performance of MWCNT/NiCo-DH/Ni3Se2/NiF is partly because of the modification of NiF with Ni3Se2 and partly due to the incorporation of MWCNT, which improves the electric conductivity of the electrode material.
