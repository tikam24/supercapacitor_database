High-power pulsed load (HPPL) such as airborne laser weapon and radar poses a severe challenge to aircraft electrical power system. Since peak power cannot be satisfied only by generator, hybrid energy storage system (HESS) should be well sized to match their energetic performances versus instantaneous power requirement and improve reliability of electrical power system. To deal with these challenges, a sizing optimization for HESS with considering energy management strategy (EMS) based on virtual-droop control in aircraft is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the spectrum characteristics of HPPL profile, splitting frequency between different types of energy storage devices is specially analyzed and designed to give full play to HESS. HESS weight, loss and parameters in EMS are taken into account in this multi-objective optimization based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithms II (NSGA-II). Series of Pareto fronts can be obtained through the optimization process, and the most suitable solutions of different HESS combinations are selected by a decision-making means which combines subjective and objective weighting methods. Finally, optimization results of four different combinations are compared. Simulation results are obtained in MATLAB/Simulink environment to prove the rationality and applicability of the optimal sizing tool. The research has resulted in a solution of HESS and EMS optimization for HPPL used in aircraft.
