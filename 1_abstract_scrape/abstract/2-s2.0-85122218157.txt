Tin oxide quantum dots/graphene oxide/polypyrrole (SGP) ternary composites are unique materials with novel properties like large specific surface area and cyclic stability that are needed to develop the supercapacitor electrodes for high energy storage applications. The optical, structural, electrochemical properties of SGP1 and SGP3 composites (The different masses of graphene oxide (GO) accordingly 0.05 g, 0.15 g produced the SGP ternary composites) were characterized by using UV-Visible spectra (UV–Vis.), Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Impedance Spectroscopy techniques. Fabrication of supercapacitor device using SGP composite electrode with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte as separator and examined the supercapacitor performance. As an outcome, the maximum specific capacitance achieved by the SGP ternary composite is 928.56 F g−1 at 40 mV s−1. The assembled SGP3 supercapacitor device is retained the energy density of 25.6 Wh kg−1 with a high-power density of 4098 W kg−1 even after 11,000 successive galvanostatic charging-discharging (GCD) cycles at current density of 1 A g−1. These results demonstrate that ternary composite material is highly promising for portable electronic storage device applications.
