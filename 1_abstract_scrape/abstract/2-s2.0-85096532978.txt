Supercapacitor electrode materials built from transition metal oxides have been explored for energy storage applications. Herein, the strips of CoMoO4 in the form of flowers like structure are self-assembled on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets by two steps hydrothermal method. The synthesized materials revealed monoclinic phase. The synthesized electrode materials show significant electrochemical performance with specific capacitance 1120 F/g at 10 mA/g. It retains 92 % of its performance after 2000 cycles.
