The influence of variant graphenes on electrochemical performance for supercapacitors was studied comparatively and systematically by using SEM, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results revealed that: 1) the nitrogen-doped graphene (N-G) electrode exhibited the highest specific capacitance at the same voltage scan rate; 2) the specific capacitance of the N-G reached up to 243.5. F/g at 1. A/g, while regular graphite oxide (GO) was 43.5. F/g and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was 67.9. F/g; 3) N-G exhibited the best supercapacitance performance and the superior electrochemical properties, which made it an ideal electrode material for supercapacitors.
