In this study activated carbons were produced from the biorefinery waste lignin (Asian lignin (AL) USA & Inbicon lignin (IL) Denmark) to evaluate their potential in waste water treatment and as energy storage devices. These products were studied for their surface characteristics as a function of reaction temperature, time, and catalyst loading accordingly. Under the conditions with a temperature lower than 750 °C and within a reaction time of 1 h, the catalytic reaction of alkali-carbon bonding occurred from the external surface, and a turbostratic disorder structure with a large aromatic ring system was formed. More severe reaction conditions accelerated the volatile release of de-alkylated aromatics such as benzene and naphthalene, along with structure and surface collapse. The maximum BET surface area of 2782 m2/g was obtained at 750 °C, 2 h and catalyst ratio of 4. Lignin-derived activated carbon was more efficient for the removal of organic pollutants (<50% adsorption capacity) rather than heavy metals (adsorption capacity >90%) due to interaction of π-π bonding. Furthermore, the activated carbon has a potential to be used as a supercapacitor electrode with high specific capacitance (214.0 F/g AL lignin) and an excellent cyclic stability (95% of their initial capacity). The results of this study demonstrate that lignin is an attractive precursor to produce activated carbons with diverse applications both as biosorbent and as a carbon electrode material even so with acceptable performance.
