High electrochemical performance of supercapacitor electrodes largely rely on the heterostructure of different active component materials. Furthermore, the integration of Co3O4 nanowire (internal conductive highway) to bridge the Ni-Co layered double hydroxides nanosheets (provided high specific capacity), which is favorable for fast charge transfer, as well as improved conductivity. Thus, the Co3O4@Ni-Co LDH core-shell nanowire arrays electrodes exhibit a remarkable specific capacitance (1318 F·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1) and also a relatively low resistance. Due to synergistic interaction of porous NiCo-LDH nanosheets and inner Co3O4 nanowire, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled with Co3O4@Ni-Co LDH as the anode and active carbon as cathode. The as-fabricated ASC shows high energy density of 46.3 Wh·kg−1 and exhibit superior cyclic stability of 92% retention after 5000 cycles, suggesting this electrode is promising for efficient electrochemical capacitors.
