Construction of core-shell heterostructures with multifunctionalities has been regarded as promising materials to improve the supercapacitor performances for single metal oxide. In our work, hierarchical Co3O4@NiCo2O4core-shell nanosheets are successfully fabricated on Ni foam for supercapacitors. The Co3O4@NiCo2O4electrode demonstrates excellent supercapacitor performances with the areal capacitance of 1.33 F/cm2at 3 mA/cm2, the specific capacitance of 1330 F/g at 3 mA/cm2and superior cycling stability of âˆ¼100.7% after 5000 cycles. The excellent electrochemical properties for the Co3O4@NiCo2O4hybrid composites can be ascribed to the unique core-shell nanostructures as well as the synergistic effect of Co3O4and NiCo2O4. The as-prepared Co3O4@NiCo2O4hybrid composites with enhanced performances could be considered as a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
