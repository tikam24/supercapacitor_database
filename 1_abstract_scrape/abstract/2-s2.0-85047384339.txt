The analytical and simulation based experiment in this presented paper shows a comparative study between the two-level inverter and five-level inverter to convert supercapacitive energy for PMSM Load. Sometimes dependent numerical models are used to measure the voltage and current response for those inverters in MATLAB Simulink based environment. In this study, Supercapacitive sources are used as input sources to analyze the response of multilevel inverters to integrate with the supercapacitive energy storage devices in any system. The PMSM loads are used to compute the time response in the simulation environment. A comparative study has been made of two different level types of inverters with the simulation results. Two basic types of the inverter are discussed in the study with reference to their electrical behavior. It is also simulated that multilevel inverter can convert stored energy within supercapacitor, which can be integrated to store energy in the renewable energy system.
