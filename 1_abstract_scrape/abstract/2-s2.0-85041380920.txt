Porous silicon carbide derived carbon (SiC-CDC) nanospheres have been successfully synthesized by electrochemical extraction of Si atoms from SiC nanospheres precursor in molten CaCl2. The electrochemical etching process was conducted at 900 Â°C and 3.2 V. The results show that the obtained product is porous SiC-CDC nanospheres, which contain amorphous carbon and a small amount of ordered graphite phase. The specific surface area of the produced SiC-CDC was determined to be 881 m2/g. The specific capacitance of the SiC-CDC is 176 F/g and possesses excellent cycling stability (97.8% retention of the initial capacitance after 1000 cycles) at a current density of 1000 mA/g.
