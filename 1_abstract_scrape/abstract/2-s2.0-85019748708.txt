Developing flexible energy storage materials with high volumetric performances for portable electronic applications is arousing increasing interest in recent years. Herein, we presented a simple in-situ wet chemistry synthetic method to prepare flexible and free-standing MnOx-Ti3C2 hybrid films, consisting of few-layered titanium carbide nanosheets and manganese oxide nanoparticles, which exhibited promising electrochemical performances as electrodes of supercapacitors. Hybridized nanoparticles of Mn2O3 and MnO are anchored on the surface of delaminated Ti3C2 nanolayers through electrostatic interactions. Such unique film based electrodes have a volumetric capacitance of 602.0 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1. Also, symmetric supercapacitors based on the MnOx-Ti3C2 electrodes show an excellent energy stored capacity (13.64 mWh cm−3) and a very high long-term cycle stability with 89.8% capacitance retention after 10000 circles. Hence, these highly flexible and free-standing MnOx-Ti3C2 films could be potential candidates as electrodes for flexible supercapacitors.
