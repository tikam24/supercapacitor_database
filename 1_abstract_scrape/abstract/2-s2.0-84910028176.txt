The output power of the photovoltaic island microgrid is intermittent and random. To ensure the reliability and stability of power supply, the idea that combines the high energy density battery with supercapacitor which has high power density to form hybrid energy storage system applied to photovoltaic (PV) microgrid becomes a research hotspot.On the basis of existing research, this paper proposes a multi-hysteresis control strategy based on energy management.The energy storage system working state can be optimized and the working life of the battery can be greatly improved by this control strategy. Using MATLAB/Simulink software, a simulation module for PV Island microgrid based on hybrid energy storage is constructed, and the control strategy of PV microgrid is verified and analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed hybrid energy storage system can balance the instantaneous power rapidly, optimize the microgrid operation, and ensure the reliability of power supply.
