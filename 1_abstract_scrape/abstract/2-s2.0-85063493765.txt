One of the most toxic materials used in the manufacture of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors is the N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent for the PVDF polymer. This work shows that the NMP solvent can be replaced by a safer solvent (DMSO), which considerably simplifies and improves battery technology. This provides opportunities to decrease the costs of the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.
