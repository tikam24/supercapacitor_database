Binderless composite electrodes in the monolithic form prepared from carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and self-adhesive carbon grains (SACG) from fibers of oil palm empty fruit bunch were studied as an electrode in a supercapacitor. The green monoliths (GMs) were prepared from three different types of precursors, SACG, SACG treated with 0.4 Molar H2SO4 and mixture of SACG and 5% CNTs (by weight) treated with 0.4 Molar H2SO4, respectively. These GMs were carbonized at 600°C in N2 gas environment and activated by CO2 gas at 800°C for 1 hour to produce activated carbon monoliths (ACMs). The properties of the ACMs (density, porosity, microstructure, structure and electrical conductivity) were found affected by CNTs addition and acid treatment. The acid treatment did not improve the electrochemical behavior of the ACMs used as electrodes (specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power of the supercapacitor) in the supercapacitor cells but CNTs addition improves the equivalent series resistance of the cell. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.
