Polypyrrole (PPy) and copper sulfide (CuS) have been successfully deposited on bacterial cellulose (BC) membranes to prepare nanofibrous composite electrodes of PPy/CuS/BC for flexible supercapacitor applications. The introduction of CuS remarkably improves the specific capacitance and cycling stability of BC-based electrodes. The specific capacitance of the supercapacitors based on the PPy/CuS/BC electrodes can reach to about 580 F g−1 at a current density of 0.8 mA cm−2 and can retain about 73% of their initial value after 300 cycles, while the PPy/BC-based device could retain only 21.7% after 300 cycles. This work provides a promising approach to fabricate cost-effective and flexible nanofibrous composite membranes for high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.
