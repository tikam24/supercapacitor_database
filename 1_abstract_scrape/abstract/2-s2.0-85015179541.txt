Many challenges must be overcome in order to create reliable electrochemical energy storage devices with not only high energy but also high power densities. Gaps exist in both battery and supercapacitor technologies, with neither one satisfying the need for both large power and energy densities in a single device. To begin addressing these challenges (and others), we report a process to create a self-assembled array of electrochemically active nanoparticles bound directly to a current collector using extremely short (2 nm or less) conductive tethers. The tethered array of nanoparticles, MnO in this case, bound directly to a gold current collector via short conducting linkages eliminates the need for fillers, resulting in a material which achieves 99.9% active material by mass (excluding the current collector). This strategy is expected to be both scalable as well as effective for alternative tethers and metal oxide nanoparticles.
