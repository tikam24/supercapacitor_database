Recently, hydroxyl-carbonates have drawn increasing interest in energy storage because of their special layered structure and pseudocapacitive character. In this work, a novel open architecture based on reduced graphene oxide and ultra-fine single-crystal Co2(CO3)(OH)2 nanowires (designed as rGO/Co2(CO3)(OH)2) is synthesized via mutual electrostatic interactions benefiting from their intrinsic opposite charges. Taking advantage of the high conductivity of rGO, the ultra-fine diameter of the nanowires, and the open network of the architecture, the rGO/Co2(CO3)(OH)2 electrode exhibits high specific capacitance (998 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and 727 F g-1 at 20 A g-1) with excellent rate capability and stability (98.3% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles). An asymmetric supercapacitor fabricated by using it as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode has demonstrated high energy/power density (26.7 W h kg-1 at 751 W kg-1 and 13.1 W h kg-1 at 15362 W kg-1) and outstanding cycle stability (10000 times with only 5.4% loss).
