The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficiency of a BLDC motor in regenerative braking mode. The mode of operation of the BLDC motor using its torque-slip characteristics is taken into consideration to evaluate its performance. The simulation, characteristics and the tabular column are all got from the MATLAB simulation. The paper ends with a suggestion of using supercapacitors to compensate for the energy lost while the motor is in regenerative mode. The purpose of the supercapacitor has also been discussed to show the usefulness on the inclusion of the component. The motor and the supercapacitor compliment each other to increase the efficiency of the electrical vehicle.
