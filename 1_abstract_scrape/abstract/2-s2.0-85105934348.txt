We synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber for supercapacitor applications. Melamine is used as nitrogen source. 4 wt% of nitrogen is doped, and it consists of pyridinium, pyrrole, and quaternary nitrogen The electrochemical surface area increased from 0.28 μcm2 to 0.40 μcm2 due to the nitrogen doping, and the electrochemical impedance decreased from 249 to 63 Ω at 100 Hz. Finally, the specific capacitance was enhanced from 71 F/g to 192 F/g (at 0.5 A/g), which is almost three times higher, compared to the precursor carbon nanofiber. A high specific energy of 17 Wh/kg with a specific power of 200 W/kg was obtained from a symmetric supercapacitor device. Capacitance retention of 87 % and coulombic efficiency of 81 % after 3,000 cycles prove relatively good rate capability and cyclic stability.
