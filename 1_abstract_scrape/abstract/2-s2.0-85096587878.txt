In this work, CeNiO3 has been prepared via co-precipitation method, has not been previously reported to my best of knowledge as an electrode material for supercapacitor applications. The structural confirmation is done by XRD analysis, comparing it with JCPDS data of SmNiO3. The electrochemical measurements such as Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic Charge Discharge (GCD) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) were executed in 3 M KOH aqueous solution to analyze the performance of CeNiO3 as an active material for supercapacitor electrode. The electrode displays maximum specific capacitance of 510 Fg-1 at a current density of 1 Ag-1. The electrode maintains 79% rate capability even at current density of 25 Fg-1 and also has a cyclic stability of 97% retention after 5000 cycles at current density of 15 Ag-1, indicating long cycle stability. The excellent electrochemical performance showed up a novel material CeNiO3 as pseudocapacitance electrode material for energy storage applications.
