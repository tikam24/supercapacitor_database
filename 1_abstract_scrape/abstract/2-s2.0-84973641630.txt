A new composite electrode design was successfully fabricated based on 3D flexible graphene foams (GF) with interconnected macropores as the freestanding substrate and a composite of MnO2 nanoparticles and polypyrrole (PPy) as an integrated electrode. Under assistance of PPy, the microscopic morphology of MnO2 changed from flower-like to nanoparticles, and correspondingly, a high specific capacity of 600 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1 was obtained from the GF@PPy@MnO2 nanoparticles composite electrode. Moreover, over 92% of the initial capacity was retained after 5000 cycles at 30 A g-1. Also, the role of PPy in improving the electrochemical performance of the composite electrode was investigated. We also tested a full symmetric supercapacitor of GF@PPy@MnO2//GF@PPy@MnO2 obtaining the maximum energy density of 28 W h kg-1 at 508 W kg-1 and the maximum power density of 13 kW kg-1 at 14 W h kg-1. This well-designed nanostructured composite electrode could be a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
