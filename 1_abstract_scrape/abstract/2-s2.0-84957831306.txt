Miniaturized energy storage devices with high energy density have been drawing extensive attentions owing to their promising applications in consumer electronics, such as smart phones, roll-up electronics, electronic paper, and wearable electronics etc. We have developed a three-dimension fibrous nanostructure for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes, which contains electrodeposited nickel nanowires covered by a thin layer of MnO2 as the active material. The nanoporous electrode with excellent ohmic conductive structure ensures the supercapacitor devices exhibit excellent flexibility, high rate performance and high areal capacitance (up to 1.8 F/cm2) with excellent cyclability up to 20,000 times. Due to the superior electrochemical and mechanical properties, we envisage that the new technology may find vast applications in the future wearable and miniaturized electronic devices.
