As a new class of two-dimensional transition metal carbon/nitride, MXenes have been proven to be a kind of pseudocapacitive supercapacitor electrode materials with excellent electrochemical property, and hold promise in practical use in the near future. In practical applications, it is required to make the electrode materials into planar porous electrodes for capacitor assembly. Herein, a simultaneous ammonization/carbonization method is proposed for the preparation of MXene planar porous electrode. Filter paper was used as a planar porous template, and MXene was coated on the fibers of the filter paper by means of dipping-drying, and then heat-treated in an ammonia atmosphere to obtain MXene/carbon planar porous composite electrodes. Analysis results show that the MXene nanosheets are uniformly coated on the carbonization-derived carbon fibers of the filter paper. When immersed 5 times, the areal capacitance reaches 403 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. After the composite electrode was tested for 2500 times in a galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, the capacitance was almost the same as the initial capacitance, showing good rate performance and cycle stability. The MXene/carbon planar porous composite electrodes prepared by simultaneous ammonia/carbonization exhibit excellent electrochemical performance without using either polymer binder or metal current collector.
