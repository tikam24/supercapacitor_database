Flexible strip supercapacitors were developed and their electrochemical properties were characterised. Activated carbon was used as the electrode material and it showed a good porous structure which provided a large surface area for energy storage. Furthermore, this activated carbon showed a good rate performance. The manufacturing processes for the supercapacitors have been described in detail and the preparation process has a good reproducibility.
