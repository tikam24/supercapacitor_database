To solve the problems of resource waste and environmental pollution from coal gasification fine ash (CGFA), it is necessary to develop a high-value and sustainable utilization technology. In this study, a sustainable utilization method for CGFA to prepare activated carbon supercapacitor (AC-SC) was proposed for the first time. AC-SC with a high specific surface area was successfully fabricated via a facile deashing pretreatment and subsequent KOH activation. Results showed that with increasing KOH dosage, the specific surface area of AC-SC samples, “C–O or O[dbnd]C–O” functional groups content, and disorder in carbon skeleton increased. Among them, the AC-SC sample (D-800-1-5) with a carbon source to KOH mass ratio of 1:5, activation temperature of 800 °C, and activation time of 1 h showed an ideal micropore-mesoporous composite type pore structure. Moreover, the BET surface area of the sample was 2224.62 m2 g−1. The specific capacitance of the D-800-1-5 sample was 124.06 F g−1 @ 0.5 A g−1, and the capacitance retention rate was as high as 128.7% after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles. These results revealed that D-800-1-5 exhibited excellent capacitance characteristics and rate performance, and proved the feasibility of CGFA as a carbon source for the preparation of AC-SC. The proposed method provided a new technical route for the high value and sustainable utilization of CGFA.
