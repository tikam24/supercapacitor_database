The current worldwide situation demands the efficient supply of sustainable energy, storing renewable energy, and converting it to other forms of energy for various applications. Since the first isolation of graphene in 2004, graphene-based composites have been highlighted in the minds of researchers ascribable to their enthralling properties. The unique structural and functional aspects of graphene, such as sterling electrical conductivity, good thermal conductivity, splendid mechanical strength, etc., idealize it to be applied in energy materials. The ease of synthesis, lightweight, and cost-effectiveness of graphene, drive researchers to incorporate graphene-based nanocomposites into electrochemical energy storage (EES) applications. Incorporating electrochemical components, nanoparticles, nanorods, polymers into graphene can remarkably upgrade its physicochemical aspects, making it befitting for EES. This review epitomizes the synthesis routes of graphene nanocomposites, the structural designs, and the mechanistic facets of the graphene nanocomposite-based electrochemical energy storing devices pertaining to the lithium-ion battery, supercapacitor, and hybrid supercapacitor and provides an outlook into the betterment of the properties for upcoming applications.
