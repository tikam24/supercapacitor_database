A main issue in the production of robust supercapacitors is the creation of efficient and cost-effective electrodes. We present here the realization of a kind of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing activated carbon microspheres made from divinylbenzene, diallyl phthalate, and acrylonitrile monomers, which can be produced on a large scale for use in supercapacitors. The supercapacitor's performance is optimized by adjusting the carbonization temperature of the microspheres. Our preliminary result shows that the supercapacitor displays a maximum capacitance of 300 F/g at the current density of 1.0 A/g and retains ~82% of the capacitance after 10,000 chargeâ€“discharge cycles.
