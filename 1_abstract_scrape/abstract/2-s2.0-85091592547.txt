The effort of exploring a new stable oxide electrode for a supercapacitor has been extensively performed. For the conventional capacitor, the capacitive storage could strongly depend on high dielectric materials. Besides the high capacity, the release rate is one of the crucial issues for supercapacitors. For the latest case, we should control the optimum electrical conductivity of electrode materials, because it has an important factor to influence the high-performance supercapacitor. For those purposes, a composite combination of high ferroelectric materials of ATiO3 perovskite by introducing FC (Functionalized Carbon) with FC stands for enhancing the conductivity. The new supercapacitor materials made of FC (graphene, graphite, acetylene carbon black) and ATiO3 (A = Ba, Ca, Sr) could be a good candidate for high energy density supercapacitor. A series of ATiO3 has been synthesized using conventional solid-state reaction with intermediate calcination. The composite of FC-ATiO3 (A = Ba, Ca, Sr) with ethanol adhesive has been fabricated using conventional die pressed. The capacitance under the influence of the magnetic field was characterized using DC capacitance meter with various magnetic fields generated by a double coil magnetic generator.
