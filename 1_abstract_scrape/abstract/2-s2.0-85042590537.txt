Renewable energy is derived from natural and sustainable processes. For example, solar energy, wind energy, and geothermal energy are types of renewable energy. The challenges to using renewable energy include energy harvesting, energy storage, and energy delivery. In this chapter, electrochemical energy storage and delivery methods will be introduced. To be specific, batteries and fuel cells with various chemistries will be covered. The difference between heat engines and chemical energy storage devices are discussed in the scope of the second law of thermodynamics.
