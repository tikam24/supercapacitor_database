The polyimide-based carbon nanofiber non-woven fabrics were activated at 750Â°C with H 2O 2 in nitrogen atmosphere to increase their specific surface areas and their capacitances. Transmission electron microscope was used to observe the size, morphology, and structure of the activated polyimide-based carbon nanofibers. Methylene blue solution adsorption method was used to measure the specific surface area of the carbon nanofibers. CHI660B electrochemical workstation was used to characterize the charge-storing capacity of the polyimide-based carbon nanofiber electrodes in supercapacitor. Experimental results show that higher activating degree of the nanofibers results in higher specific surface area and a better capacitance performance of carbon nanofiber electrodes. The capacitance of 174.2 F/g was obtained after activation for 6 h when 1 mol/L H 2SO 4 was used as the electrolyte.
