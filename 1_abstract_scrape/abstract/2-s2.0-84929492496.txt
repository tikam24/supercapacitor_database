This study investigates the use of graphene oxides (GOs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in polyacrylonitrile-based carbon nanofibers (GO-CNT/CNF) as electrodes for the supercapacitor. GO-CNT/CNF was prepared by electrospinning, and was subsequently stabilized and activated. The specific capacitance of GO-CNT/CNF is 120.5 F g<sup>-1</sup> in 0.5 M Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte, which is higher than or comparable to the specific capacitances of carbon-based materials in neutral aqueous electrolyte, as prepared in this study. GO-CNT/CNF also exhibits a superior cycling stability, and 109% of the initial specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. The high capacitance of GO-CNT/CNF could be attributed to the edge planes and the functional groups of GO, the highly electrical conductivity of CNT, and the network structure of the electrode.
