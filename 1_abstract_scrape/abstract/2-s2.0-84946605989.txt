Well crystallized Fe2O3 with the particle size mainly concentrated around 35-40 nm combined with graphene is fabricated under solvothermal conditions. The optimized Fe2O3/GH-2 composite sample possessing 49.7 wt% Fe2O3 has a high specific BET surface area of 215.3 m2 g-1. When used as a supercapacitor electrode, the capacitances are admirable 2310 F g-1 at 5 mV s-1 and 615 F g-1 at an amazingly high current density of 100 A g-1. When used as an anode material for asymmetric hybrid capacitors, the composite shows a promising future for energy storage with high energy density, high power density and excellent cycle life.
