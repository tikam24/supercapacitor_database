One-dimensional/three-dimensional (1D/3D) hierarchical porous network configurations are composed of NiCo2S4 nanowires in-situ grown on biomass carbon (NiCo2S4/3DHC). The 3D biomass carbon (3DHC) with hierarchical micron- to nano-porous structure which is suitable for as a basal growth has been obtained from a pyrolysis active process of wood (Metasequoia). NiCo2S4 nanowires were produced on 3D biomass carbon via a facile hydrothermal method. The characterization and comparison of various properties of NiCo2S4/3DHC have been investigated systematically. A maximum specific capacitance of 765.8 F/g was observed for the NiCo2S4/3DHC electrode at 1 A/g in a 6 M KOH electrolyte solution, while 32.3 F/g for 3DHC at the same condition. The method reported here can be potentially applied to feasible construct 3D electrode configuration for energy storage devices using biomass as main raw materials.
