Polyaniline (PAni) widely studied conductive polymer due to its incredible versatility, electrical properties, and low cost. PAni usually is produced by chemical or electrochemical synthesis. However, these processes either generate a large amount of waste or are expensive and produce a small amount. The catalytic system incorporated into the PAni synthesis can be a strategic way to develop clean and low-cost processes. Therefore, we propose a synthesis of PAni catalyzed by carbon fiber (CF) reported for the first time. The procedure is to immerse the CF in an aqueous solution of aniline and H2SO4, at room temperature, in an open flask. Tests were carried out to investigate the CF as a catalyst and the molecular oxygen as an oxidant in the polymerization reaction. The samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. According to the analyses, the reaction catalysts are heteroatoms on the fiber surface. Molecular oxygen present in atmospheric air is the oxidant of the reaction. The method is environmentally friendly, simple, and economical route to produce a conductive form of PAni on carbon fiber. The composite produced was evaluated as a possible electrode for a supercapacitor, and presented interesting results for application in energy storage devices.
