In this paper we focus on the supervisory control problem of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle (HEV): minimize fuel consumption while ensuring self-sustaining State-of-Charge (SoC). We reapply the state of the art methodology by comparing optimal results of Dynamic Programming (DP) against a real-time control candidate. After careful selection, we opted for an Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) based approach for the following reasons: (i) results are quite remarkable with less than 5% fuel usage increase when compared to DP; (ii) simple and intuitive tuning of control parameters; (iii) readily usable for code generation (prototyping). Topics that distinguish this article from others in the literature include: (i) the usage of trapezoidal rule of integration implementing DP and ECMS; consequently, the offline simulation results are intended to be more precise and representative when compared against the more common, often used rectangular rule; (ii) a particular post-processing procedure of the recorded driving cycle data based on physical interpretation; it allows consistent offline simulations with quite high sampling period (in the order of seconds); (iii) tuning of control parameters in such a way that control system is robust towards new, unknown, unpredictable but closely resembling driving cycles. In particular, we focus on the supervisory control of a forklift truck. The real-time control is able to compute: (i) the power split (i.e. a balanced usage between an internal combustion engine and a supercapacitor); (ii) the drivetrain control (i.e. automatic gear shifting and clutching). Numerous numerical implementation issues are discussed along our presentation.
