The SO42-/SnO2 system has been investigated as a potential electrode material for supercapacitors. It is precipitated as a tin oxide gel by an alkaline hydrolysis of SnCl4, and subsequently impregnated with sulfuric acid and calcined. The SO 42-/SnO2 is characterized by XRD, FT-IR and an electrochemical analyzer system. The specific capacitance of SO4 2-/SnO2 is 51.95 F g-1 at 5 mV/s scan rate compared to the SnO2 value of only 15.61 F g-1. SO 42-/SnO2 maintains 92.15% of its maximum capacitance after 2000 cycles.
