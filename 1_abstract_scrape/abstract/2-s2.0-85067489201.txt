The aim of the present work is to develop a novel electrode material for micro-supercapacitor (μ-SC) application, which must be compatible with the fabrication of Si microelectronic. A simple, cost-effective and scalable approach has been proposed to enhance the electrochemical capacitance of silicon nanowires (SiNWs). SiNWs grown using hot wire chemical vapor process (HWCVP) at low temperature were encapsulated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles film. The prepared hybrid nanostructure of SiNW@MnO2 core-shell showed stable electrochemical performance in an aqueous electrolyte of 1 M Na2SO4. The MnO2 shell was deposited on SiNWs by electrophoretic process (EPD) at room temperature. The synthesized SiNW@MnO2 core-shell structure exhibited a specific capacitance of 2.1 mF/cm2, which is larger than to other Si-based materials reported in literature. The scalability and simplicity of the process make it useful to fabricate SiNW@MnO2 electrodes based on-chip μ-SC with enhanced electrochemical performance.
