Polyaniline(PANI) nanofiber was synthesized by interfacial polymerization utilizing the interface between HCl and CCl4. The hybrid type supercapacitors (PLi/C) based on Li-doping polyaniline and activated carbon electrode were fabricated and compared with the redox type capacitors (PLi/PLi) based on two uniformly Li-doping polyaniline electrodes. The electrochemical performances of the two types of supercapacitors were characterized in non-aqueous electrolyte. PLi/C supercapacitors have a wider effective energy storage potential range and a higher upper potential. At the same time, the PLi/C supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacity of 120.93 F/g at initial discharge and retains 80% after 500 cycles. The ohmic internal resistance (R ES) of PLi/C supercapacitor is 5.0 Ω, which is smaller than that of PLi/PLi capacitor (5.5 Ω). Moreover, it can be seen that Et 4NBF4 organic solution is more suitable for using as organic electrolyte of PLi/C capacitor compared with organic solution containing LiPF6. © 2009 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.
