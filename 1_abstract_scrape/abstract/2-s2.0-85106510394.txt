The increasing demand for the development of high-performance supercapacitors led researchers to synthesize and develop new electrode materials by optimizing various parameters. In this respect, we have developed ternary nanocomposites using graphene, CuCr2O4 and polyaniline as potent electrode material. We have used simple sonication-assisted mechanical mixing of pre-synthesized N-doped graphene, CuCr2O4 and polyaniline at varied proportions. The prepared composites have been analyzed by different characterization techniques to comprehend the successful formation of the composite. The electrochemical characterizations revealed that the nanocomposite shows the specific capacitance of 443.4 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with excellent capacity retention of 92% even after 10,000 GCD cycles, thereby validating the fact that N-doped graphene and CuCr2O4 have enhanced the stability of pristine PANI.
