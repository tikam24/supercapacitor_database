Adsorption and subsequent polymerization of nickel(II) complexes with Schiff bases were studied in a porous carbon material used to manufacture electric double-layer capacitors (supercapacitors). The optimal modifi cation conditions of the carbon material with polymeric complexes to obtain the maximum effect as regards the accumulation of electric energy in the supercapacitor were determined and substantiated. An effective and costeffi cient technique for modifi cation of supercapacitor electrodes with electrically active polymers was suggested. Â© 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
