One dimensional hierarchical CuCo2O4 nanobelt like architecture was synthesized via hydrothermal method. The synthesized nanomaterial was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM image clearly shows the nanobelt like architecture of CuCo2O4. The supercapacitor properties of CuCo2O4 nanobelts electrode were tested using cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The spinel CuCo2O4 nanobelts exhibit maximum areal and specific capacitance of 2.42 F cm-2 (809 F g-1). After 1800 continuous charge-discharge cycles, 127% of the initial capacitance was retained. This superior electrochemical supercapacitor property is mainly due to increased surface area and ion transport of nanobelt like architecture. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) value of CuCo2O4 nanobelt electrode is 3.85 Î©. This high capacitance and cyclic stability demonstrate that the prepared CuCo2O4 nanobelts are a promising candidate for supercapacitors.
