Metal sulfides (MSs) with porous structures are highly desirable materials for supercapacitor (SC) applications, due to their good electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity. Herein, a facile hydrothermal strategy is introduced to fabricate spinel FeCo2S4 nanosheet (FCSNS) arrays as a promising binder-free electrode for SC applications. The FCSNS electrode indicated significant properties with a good capacity of 260.5 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, excellent rate performance of 71.2%, and exceptional durableness of 95.4%. Most importantly, an asymmetric device (FCSNS//AC (active carbon)) was then established, indicating a good capacitance of 143.6 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and a satisfactory energy density (EnDe) of 44.87 Wh kg−1.
