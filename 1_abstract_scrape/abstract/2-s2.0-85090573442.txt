Nickel/cobalt co-doped porous manganese oxide(MnOx) is fabricated by feasible nonionic surfactant route followed by precipitation heat treatment method. The as prepared metal ion modified manganese oxide further impregnated via reducing graphene oxide and MoS2 nanoparticles by ultra-sonication assisted deposition method. The as prepared binary nanocomposite is characterized by XRD and HR-TEM for crystalline phase formation analysis and structure morphology determination. Binder free flexible electrode fabrication on nickel foam using MoS2/graphene modified Ni-Co-MnO2 have also been studied and it shows higher super capacitor performance like 1190 F/g in aqueous acidic conditions.
