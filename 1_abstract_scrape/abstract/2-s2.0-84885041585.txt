Onion-like carbon (OLC) based micro-supercapacitor electrodes prepared by electrophoretic deposition (EPD) were combined with a eutectic mixture of ionic liquids (IL), producing a micro-supercapacitor which is able to function from 50°C to 80°C. This device was electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at different scan rates and different temperatures. At 20°C, a capacitance of 1.1 mF.cm - 2 per footprint area of device at 200 mV.s- 1 within 3.7 V was measured, hence a specific energy of 15 mJ.cm- 2 and a specific power of 240 mW.cm- 2. At - 50°C, 76% of the capacitance was maintained at 10 mV.s- 1 within 3.7 V. By integrating with IL, this micro-supercapacitor can be potentially used in portable electronic devices that are required to work under temperature extremes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
