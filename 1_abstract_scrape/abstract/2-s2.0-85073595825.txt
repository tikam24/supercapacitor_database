Developing high conductive porous electrode materials is a critical challenge to increase the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. In this work carbon-based graphene oxide was functionalized by 2,4-diaminopyrimidine ligand (rGO-2,6-DP) and then in the presence of triethyl amine, CoI2 was linked to the functionalized graphene oxide structure (Co-rGO) and characterized by XPS, XRD, TEM, SEM, FT-IR, and EDX techniques. To improve the electrochemical efficiency in terms of specific capacity and energy density, porous Co-rGO was electro-synthetically blended with conducting polymer of POAP (Co-rGO-POAP) as high conductive electrode material. Cyclic voltammetry tests were carried out in three-electrode system and showed high electrochemical potential with long cycle life and specific capacitance of 944 at 1 A g−1 in aqueous environment. The charge–discharge results represented superior efficiency of synthesized Co-rGO-POAP nanocomposite as an outstanding electrode in supercapacitor. Also, Ragone plot described improved energy densities at power densities while energy density obtained as 131.2 Wh kg−1 at power density of 500 W kg−1. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the synergistic effect of Co-rGO and conducting polymer enhanced electrochemical features through the facilitating electron delivery and reducing electron resistance. This investigation open a new strategy to use beneficial of both metal and carbon-based materials to use in energy storage devices.
