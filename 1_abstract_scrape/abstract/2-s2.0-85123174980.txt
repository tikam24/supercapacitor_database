We synthesized a heterojunction combination of cobalt titanate (CoTiO3)@Co3O4/N–CNO as an electrode material for supercapacitors. The binary nanocomposite of CoTiO3@Co3O4 was accumulated in the rhombohedral@cubic structure of the R-3@F-d3m space-group. Further, the Rietveld refinement and Raman analysis were performed on the ternary CoTiO3@Co3O4/N–CNO nanocomposite. The morphology of the ternary nanocomposite appeared as coral-like structures, where CoTiO3@Co3O4 binary nanoparticles of diameters from 50 to 100 nm are dispersed within the N–CNO matrix. The current CoTiO3@Co3O4/N–CNO composite electrode possessed a specific capacitance value of 873 F g−1, which is higher than that of a binary CoTiO3@Co3O4 electrode (775 F g−1) at 1 A g–1 current density. This increase is due to the presence of the N–CNO matrix, which provides better charge transport properties and adds additional double-layer electrochemical characteristics that come from carbon nano-onions and the pyridinic redox reactions from the doped nitrogen. An asymmetric supercapacitor device made of the CoTiO3@Co3O4/N–CNO nanocomposite and activated carbon (AC) showed excellent energy/power densities of 34.7 Wh kg−1/2.19 kW kg−1, at 4 A g−1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 10 A g−1, a high-power density of 5.48 kW kg−1, an energy density of 13.7 W h kg−1, and capacitance retention of 90% is achieved. The present results indicate that the CoTiO3@Co3O4/N–CNO nanocomposites can be used in high-performance supercapacitors.
