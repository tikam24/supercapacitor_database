Magnetic thin films with perpendicular anisotropy have important application value in magnetic random access memory (MRAM), track storage, spin logic and other devices, which have attracted widespread attention. Among the current common spintronic devices, CoFeB thin films and Co/Ni multilayer films have become ideal magnetic thin film materials for spintronic devices due to their large vertical anisotropy (PMA) and low damping constant. At present, the latest technology requires the thickness of the film in spintronic devices to be on the order of nanometers, which puts forward higher requirements for the preparation of magnetic films. This involves some basic issues in materials science, so the research from the perspective of materials science in the preparation process of magnetic ultra-thin films, it is particularly important to discuss the influence of preparation conditions on its microstructure and magnetic properties. This article focuses on how to obtain CoFeB films and Co/Ni multilayer films with good vertical anisotropy, and investigates the effect of the thickness of the magnetic layer in the CoFeB film, the type of substrate layer, the growth mode and the film deposition sequence on the vertical anisotropy of the CoFeB film. Influence: The influence of the substrate layer on the vertical anisotropy of the multilayer film, and the influence of the thickness and period of the magnetic layer of the multilayer film on the magnetic properties and magnetic domain structure of the Co/Ni multilayer film are studied. The physical mechanism of the change of the thickness and the number of cycles of the magnetic layer affecting the magnetic domain structure of the multilayer film is discussed. The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor has a high energy density of 36.9 Wh kg-1 (power density of 400 W kg-1) and good cycle performance (83.9% is still retained after 5000 cycles).
