Nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanospheres (NHPCNs) with mesoscale and microscale pores are reported herein for their application in high-performance supercapacitor electrode materials (SCMs). The NHPCNs were facilely prepared via the carbonization of mesoporous polydopamine nanospheres (MPNSs) fabricated by one-step self-polymerization of dopamine using Pluronic F127 as a soft template. The influence of polymerization and carbonation temperatures on the morphologies, structures, and capacitor performances of the as-prepared NHPCNs was investigated systematically. The specific surface area of the NHPCNs can be achieved as high as 1725 m2 g-1, together with a pore volume of 1.85 cm3 g-1. Due to their unique structure, the NHPCNs can act as high-performance SCMs and exhibit high charge storage capacity with a high specific capacitance of 433 F g-1 in 6 M KOH at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 and excellent stability with 95.7% of the initial capacitance after 10000 cycles.
