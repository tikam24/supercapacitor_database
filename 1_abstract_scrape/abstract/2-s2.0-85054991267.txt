The exploration of multifunctional electrode materials has been a hotspot for the development of high-performance supercapacitors. We have used carbon fiber plates recovered from construction waste to prepare high-quality flexible carbon fiber materials by pyrolysis of epoxy resin. The as-prepared recycled carbon fiber has a diameter of 8 μm and is the perfect substrate material for flexible electrode materials. Furthermore, polyaniline and manganese dioxide are uniformly deposited on the recycled carbon fiber by one-step electrodeposition to form an active film. The recycled carbon fiber/polyaniline/MnO2 composite shows an excellent specific capacitance of 475.1 F·g-1 and capacitance retention of 86.1% after 5000 GCD cycles at 1 A·g-1 in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The composites optimized for electrodeposition time have more electroactive sites, faster ions and electron transfer, structural stability and higher conductivity, endowing the composites promising application prospect.
