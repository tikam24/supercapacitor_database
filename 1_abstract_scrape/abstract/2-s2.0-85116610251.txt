DC and battery-powered motor applications are shifting from conventional silicon MOSFET-based, low PWM frequency inverters to GaN-based, high-frequency PWM inverters. The advantages lie in the higher system efficiency and in the elimination of the electrolytic capacitors, and the DC input filter. In this paper, gallium nitride-based devices are shown to increase power density to a new level and move to high-frequency PWM inverters with negligible dead time for electric motors used in many different applications including, but not limited to: servo drives, e-bikes, e-scooters, collaborative and low-voltage robot, medical robots, industrial drones, and service-motors used in automobiles.
