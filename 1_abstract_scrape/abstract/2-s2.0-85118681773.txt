Vehicle tyres lead us to move miles and miles, which faces a lots of heat and stresses all that energy should not go in vain, Peizoelectric materials are materials which have the ability to convert the applied mechanical stress into electrical charge. Our experimental work deals with the conversion of heat and stress of the tyre into an electrical energy by using piezoelectric transducer followed by rapid collection and storage of electric energy using super-capacitor. For this experimental study, electric bike was taken and conventional tyres was replaced by regenerative tyre. PZT (lead zirconate titanate) type PET is chosen for greater stability and higher operating temperature. PET is placed in the order of 8 columns in which 4 columns is placed over another 4 columns and 40 rows in the circumference of the inner tyre at about 320 PET in each tyre. The experiment was performed through long drive on the high way at average speed of 35 km/hr by adopting super-capacitor with regenerative tyre. The vehicle fitted with super capacitor charges eight times faster than the vehicle with fast charger (15A charger). Our fabricated electric vehicle with normal tyre went upto 51.6km (average for three trials) by replacing it with regenerative tyre went upto 83.2km (average for three trials) which increased efficiency about 61.2%. Electric vehicles fitted with regenerative tyre and super capacitor will create a new revolution in electric vehicles. Peizoelectric materials are pollution less regenerator, hence helping to build a green world. Our project is recommended for light and heavy vehicle transportation.
