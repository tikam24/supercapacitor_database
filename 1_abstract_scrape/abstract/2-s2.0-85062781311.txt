In this paper, an energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid batteries and supercapacitor (SCs) electric vehicles (HBSEV) is considered for extending the batteries lifespan and lifting the power performance of HBSEV. In detail, firstly, vehicle dynamics model and hybrid energy storage source (HESS) models including batteries and SCs are adapted and simplified as fundamental of model prediction control (MPC) approach. Secondly, the EMS of HBSEV is designed for reducing batteries power variation and maintaining SCs SOC in a proper value based on MPC method combining adaptive method. That can enhance batteries lifespan and power performance. Finally, simulation results based on the proposed EMS are given, which show batteries lifespan and power performance for HBSEV are improved obviously compared with a real time average (RTA) strategy. Meanwhile, the SOC of batteries and SCs are maintained in a proper range.
