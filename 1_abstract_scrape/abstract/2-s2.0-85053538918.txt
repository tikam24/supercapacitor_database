This work contains maximum power point tracking fed Photovoltaic (PV) source, in combination with an energy storage device which is supercapacitor. The DC power obtained from PV source is then fed to an inverter controlled by Sliding Mode Controller connected to variable loads. MPPT-controlled boost converter effectively manages the effect of changing solar irradiation. A supercapacitor as a storage device is also deployed to handle intermittent power obtained from the PV source and to meet the stochastic load demands. The implementation of the supercapacitor is facilitated by a bidirectional dcâ€“dc converter with the befitting conversion ratio for interfacing it to the DC link. It bucks and boosts the voltage of supercapacitor and the flow of power is in bidirectional manner for needed charging and discharging of the supercapacitor. The model developed in this paper highlights a seamless action by the storage device for maintaining constant supply under varying irradiation and for varying load conditions. In terms of power quality, the performance of voltage source inverter controlled by sliding mode controller has been found to be superior to PSO-based PI-controlled Voltage Source Inverter. The SMC regulated VSI is found to be robust for any kind of variations at the supply as well as the load ends.
