MnO2 powder with urchin sphere and nanowire were prepared by chemical coprecipitation method and hydrothermal method. The structure and morphology of the products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their electrochemical performance as a supercapacitor electrode material was investigated comparatively by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge (CP). The results indicate that MnO2 powder prepared by different preparation methods with the same material displayed different morphologies. Urchin type MnO2 prepared by chemical coprecipitation has a diameter about 300-500 nm. The diameter of nanowire MnO2 prepared by hydrothermal method is about 10-30 nm, with a length of about 100-500 nm. Both of the MnO2 powders have excellent capacitance behaviors in 6 mol路L-1 KOH solution. The specific capacitance of urchin sphere-structured MnO2 and nanowire-structured MnO2 at the current density of 1 A路g-1 were 539 F路g-1 and 375 F路g-1, respectively. When the urchin sphere-structured MnO2 was recycled for 1000 times, only 15% of its specific capacity was lost.
