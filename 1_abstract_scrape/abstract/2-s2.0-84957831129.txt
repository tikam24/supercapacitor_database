The actual trend in automotive is to reduce as much as possible pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions. This could be achieved by using electrical propulsion systems which usually contains: electrical machine, three phase voltage source inverter (VSI), voltage supply system. The main problem of the full electric vehicles represents the autonomy due to low energy capacity of batteries. This issue could be solved by using a hydrogen fuel cell in parallel with a battery pack to extend the range of the electrical vehicles. This paper presents a voltage supply system which connects to a DC bus a battery, a fuel cell, and a supercapacitor using DCDC converters. The focus of this work is on keeping controlling the voltage level of DC bus and on energy distribution between elements of voltage supply system. The proposed algorithm is validated using a close loop model which contains simulation of: fuel cell, battery pack, supercapacitor, DCDC converter, distributed control strategy of voltage supply system, DC Link capacitor, VSI, electrical machine, vehicle dynamics, and driver. The model is developed in Matlab/Simulink.
