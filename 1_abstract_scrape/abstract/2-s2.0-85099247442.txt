A hybrid structure of zinc oxide (ZnO) on reduced graphene oxide (GO) has been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions by simultaneous in situ formation of flower-like ZnO and chemical reduction of graphene oxide. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Raman spectroscopy were used to characterize the obtained hybrid. The ZnO nanorods exhibit high crystallinity and cluster on GO layers to form flower-like nanostructures. The electrochemical behavior of the ZnO/GO hybrid was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and capacity vs potential measurements. The composite showed improved capacitive performance compared to the bare ZnO synthesized using similar hydrothermal conditions.
