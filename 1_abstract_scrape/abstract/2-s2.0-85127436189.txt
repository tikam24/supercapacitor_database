In this paper, research activities from my groups in the field of electrochemical energy storage are reviewed for the past 22 years, which is divided into three sections. The first section describes the researches related to high specific energy and high specific power energy storage devices, including lithium sulfur batteriies (sulfur composite cathode material, lithium sulfur battery fabrication, lithium boron alloy as lithium sulfur battery anodes, and sulfur lithium-ion battery new system), supercapacitors (super activated carbon, capacitive carbon prepared from phenolic resin, carbon nanotube array parasitic pseudo-capacitive energy storage materials, necessary properties of capacitive carbons, nickel hydroxide xerogels pseudo-capacitive energy storage materials,the development of capacitors, and the determination of “the fourth type” supercapacitors), and lithium-ion batteries (the confrontation between lithium-ion batteries and renewable fuel cells, the cathode material of dual variable-valency elements, lithium cobalt phosphate cathode materials, and high-power lithium-ion batteries). The second section describes the researches linked to a large-scale energy storage battery, including new systems of flow battery (dual function flow battery of energy storage and electrochemical synthesis, all metal compounds single flow battery, and organic compound positive electrode single flow battery), revitalizing lead-acid batteries (promoting new technology of lead-acid batteries, lead-carbon battery and new grid of lead-acid battery), and economic benefit calculation method of energy storage battery (station). The third section describes the research roadmaps in the development of electric vehicles including hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles, the suggestions in the development of electric vehicles in China, striving for the rationalization of subsidies for electric vehicles, adhering to the purpose of “energy saving and emission reduction” of electric vehicles, and putting forward “direct drive electric vehicles for power generation”. Three opinions based on my experiences are provided at the end of this paper.
