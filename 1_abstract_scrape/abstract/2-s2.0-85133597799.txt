Transition metal hybrid nanomaterials have attracted wide attention in the field of energy storage due to their rich redox activity and good conductivity and structural stability. In this work, low-crystalline Ni(OH)2·0.75H2O nanosheets embedded with NiMoO4 nanoparticles (NiMo-LDH) on nickel foam (NF) were synthesized by a simple urea-assisted hydrothermal method. By optimizing the Ni/Mo molar ratio and urea concentration in the initial reaction solution, the composition of NiMo-LDH was effectively controlled, which was found to have a crucial impact on the electrochemical performance of the NiMo-LDH electrode. The NiMo-LDH (Ni2Mo1-urea0.2 M) electrode shows porous ultra-thin two-dimensional characteristics and NiMoO4 nanoparticles (3-5 nm) embedded in nickel hydroxide nanosheets can provide more exposed active sites, accelerate electron transport and enhance the faradaic reaction. The Ni2Mo1-urea0.2 M electrode exhibits an extremely high capacitance of 4.4 F cm−2 (2001 F g−1) at 4 mA cm−2 (1.8 A g−1), with 63% capacitance retention observed at 48 mA cm−2 (21.8 A g−1). More importantly, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) assembled using Ni2Mo1-urea0.2 M as the positive electrode presents an energy density value of 70.76 W h kg−1 at 318.84 W kg−1 and 26.24 W h kg−1 even at 7680 W kg−1 along with good stability of 82% over 5000 cycles at 100 mV s−1
