Herein, CoMoO4 nanoneedles were first directly grown on carbon cloth through a facile one-pot water bath method. Interestingly, with the extension of reaction time, the mass loading of CoMoO4 on carbon cloth (CoMoO4/CC) increases gradually. As a pseudocapacitors material, the CoMoO4/CC electrode obtained at 10 hour (CoMoO4/CC-10) displays a higher specific capacitance (2100 F/g at a current density of 1 A/g) than those of the other CoMoO4/CC electrodes. Furthermore, the CoMoO4/CC-10 electrode also shows a good rate performance 64.29 % and excellent cycle property 94.53 % after 10000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor device using the CoMoO4/CC-10 as a positive and active carbon (AC)/CC as a negative electrode achieves high specific capacitance 184 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g, specific energy 65.42 Wh/kg (with the specific power 2880 W/kg), specific power 12000 W/kg (with the specific energy 40.18 Wh/kg) and cycle performance 94.29 % after 10000 times. These electrochemical performances demonstrate the as-prepared CoMoO4 nanoneedles will be a promising pseudocapacitor material for application in energy storage.
