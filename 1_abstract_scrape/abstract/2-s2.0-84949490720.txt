A polypyrrole/molybdenum trioxide/graphene nanoribbon (PPy/MoO3/GNR) ternary nanocomposite was successfully synthesized via an in situ method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses show that MoO3 was successfully combined with the GNRs. The one-dimensional morphology was observed using field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The electrochemical tests show that the PPy/MoO3/GNR ternary nanocomposite exhibits the highest specific capacitance (844 F gâˆ’1) among the investigated materials and exhibits good cycling stability for 1000 cycles. These results collectively demonstrate that the combination of each component can efficiently increase the specific capacitance and cycling stability. As such, the method reported herein represents a promising approach for fabricating supercapacitor electrode materials.
