Recent advances in supercapacitor technology reveals new opportunities for energy storage devices for application in electro-transportation and renewable energy sectors. In this paper results on device fabrication are reported. A low-cost screen-printing technology to obtain electrodes of supercapacitor has been applied. The device structure is based on Cu plate/hydrocarbon ink electrodes and gel electrolyte. Carbon ink is prepared from naturally occurring not full carbonized particles in the chimney's soot. The cyclic charge/discharge measurements confirm supercap behaviour and specific capacitance around 5 F/g at discharge current of 0.62 A/g. The flat configuration of the supercaps allows easy connection in series and adjustment to DC loads. A pack of four supercaps driving conventional LED has been thoroughly tested for more than 100 cycles.
