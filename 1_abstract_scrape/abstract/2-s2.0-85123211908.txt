One-dimensional Cu(OH)2 nanorods and two-dimensional 1T-MoS2 nanosheets have attracted attention due to their attractive electrochemical properties. However, 1T-MoS2 nanosheets tend to agglomerate and transform to 2H-MoS2, resulting in a decrease in electrochemical performance. In this study, flexible electrodes with 3D hetero-nanostructures are constructed by growing Cu(OH)2 nanorod arrays and loading 1T-MoS2 nanosheets on carbon fiber paper made of chopped carbon fibers as a conductive flexible substrate. The flower-shaped 1T-MoS2 nanosheets with increased interlayer spacing are conducive to the rapid diffusion and insertion of electrolyte, while the conductive copper hydroxide nanorod array and carbon fiber paper can facilitate electron transport. The 1T-MoS2/Cu(OH)2@CFP based electrode has a high areal capacitance of 1124.0 mF cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and excellent cycle stability (with 98.3% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles). Furthermore, a flexible asymmetric solid-state supercapacitor (FASSC) device based on the as-prepared 1T-MoS2/Cu(OH)2@CFP electrode exhibits an energy density of 0.130 mWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.375 mW cm−2. The capacitance of FASSC device remains 90.8% of the initial value after 20000 cycles. In addition, the CFP substrate can be bent at a large angle and folded into different shapes, which makes 1T-MoS2/Cu(OH)2@CFP based electrodes suitable for flexible and portable electronics.
