Pyridinium triflates are highly dissociated protic ionic liquids, and nonstoichiometric compositions have been used in protic energy devices such as the all-organic proton battery. Herein, we use a combination of pulsed field gradient NMR spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to investigate the charge transport properties of the nonstoichiometric protic ionic liquid 2-fluoropyridinium triflate and the variation with the acid-doping level. While all diffusion coefficients decreased with the level of acid doping, the room-temperature conductivity increased because of the concurrent increase in charge carrier concentration. The maximum room-temperature conductivity was 7.33 mS/cm, obtained when 14% of the pyridine was protonated with triflic acid, while higher acid-doping levels lead to liquid/solid mixtures with low conductivity. PEDOT supercapacitor cells with this electrolyte demonstrated very high capacitance (83.9 F/g) and charge storage capacity (23.3 mA h/g). In addition, we predict that using an acid-doping level lower than before will result in superior electrolyte performance in proton batteries because of improvements in conductivity, processability, and electrochemical stability.
