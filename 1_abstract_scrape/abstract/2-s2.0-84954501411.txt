The utility of carbon materials for electrochemical energy storage devices has been rapidly increasing in the recent years. In this study, graphdiyne nanostructures have been prepared via a cross-coupling reaction and their electrochemical properties were investigated for supercapacitor applications. Spectroscopic studies such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman analysis confirmed the formation of graphdiyne with high order and low defects. Cyclic voltammetric studies revealed the quasi-rectangular profiles suggesting the presence of electrochemical double layer and Faradaic capacitance in graphdiyne. The graphdiyne electrode delivered a specific capacitance of about 71.4 F/g from the galvanostatic charge-discharge analysis measured at a constant discharge current density of 3.5 A/g. Moreover, the cyclic stability tests demonstrated excellent capacitance retention of about 97% for the graphdiyne electrode. These studies suggested the potential applications of graphdiyne as an electrode material for supercapacitor devices.
