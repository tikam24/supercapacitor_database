Owing to their porosity and large surface area, coordination polymers (CPs) have received widespread attention in the potential application of electrode materials. Herein, a new Ni (II) CP, namely, {[Ni(TPTA)0.5(1,4-bib)0.5(H2O)2]·CH3OH}n (1), has been synthesized with the help of Ni(NO3)2, 2′-amino-[1,1′:4′,1″-terphenyl]-3,3″,5,5″-tetracarboxylic acid (H4TPTA) and 1,4-bis(1-imidazoly)benzene (1,4-bib) under solvothermal methods. The electrochemical performances of CP 1 modified foam nickel (NF) electrodes were measured. When the current density (J) was 0.5 ​A ​g−1, the specific capacitance (C) of CP 1@NF electrode was 227.1 ​F ​g−1, whose capacitance retention rate was 90.8% of the original one after 2000 cycles. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was assembled in 1 ​M KOH electrolyte, in which CP 1@NF and AC were used as the anode and cathode, respectively. The capacitance of ASC still retained 90% of the original one after 2000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 ​A ​g−1. And it exhibited the energy density (E) of 8.36 ​Wh kg−1 when the power density (P) was 501.3 ​W ​kg−1.
