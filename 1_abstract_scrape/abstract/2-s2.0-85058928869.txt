Control of bus voltage stability in DC microgrid is a key issue, which is particularly important when the DC bus is disturbed at different time scales. In order to solve the problem of instantaneous power imbalance of the DC bus, the idea of capacitor charge balance control (CBC) was introduced to supercapacitor interfacing bidirectional DC-DC converter to realize fast recovery of bus voltage with high power density of the supercapacitor. Based on existing CBC for unidirectional current DC-DCconverter, the idea of indirectly predicting the change of capacitor current was extended and optimized. Moreover, the general substitution method of node current was obtained and the corresponding control law was also derived to achieve the objective of fast control of bidirectional current. The detailed implementation of the hybrid control strategy based on CBC was given, and the average current mode control combined with hysteresis current limiter were used to realize stable control of the interfacing converter at both sides. Finally, simulation and prototype experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control strategy.
