Devices that convert ambient energy into electricity and simultaneously store it for future usage are highly desirable. Herein, we have designed a hygroelectric power generator with energy self-storage ability (HPGES) by hybridizing a moist-electric energy harvester with a supercapacitor, thus achieving the conversion of chemical energy into electricity and the storage of electric energy at the same time. An array of ten HPGES devices are able to deliver a voltage output of 2 V and adequately drive a commercial calculator.
