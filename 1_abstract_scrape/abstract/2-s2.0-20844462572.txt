The fabrication of carbon nanotube containing fibers was presented. Surfactant (LDS)-assisted aqueous HiPco SWNT (Carbon Nanotechnologies, Inc.) dispersions were employed. The energy storage measurements on a fiber supercapacitor device were performed by coating two separate fibers with a gel electrolyte, leaving the ends of the fibers uncoated. It was observed that the area under the discharge curve was proportional to the energy density of the device.
