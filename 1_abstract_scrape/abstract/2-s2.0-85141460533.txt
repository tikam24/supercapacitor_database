The hybrid energy storage system(HESS) composed of lithium-ion battery and super capacitor supplements the output peak power through super capacitor, which effectively solves the problem of irreversible capacity attenuation of lithium-ion battery caused by the high power demand of frequent start and braking of lithium-ion battery electric vehicle under urban driving conditions. However, compared with the power battery alone, the addition of super capacitor increases the cost and weight and reduces the output efficiency of the whole energy storage system. The research progress of HESS is discussed from two aspects: energy allocation strategy and parameter matching. At present, the researches of energy allocation strategy mostly use the cycle test conditions of fuel-engined vehicles as the research data, and according to the online computing ability and application scenarios, the energy allocation strategies are divided into offline control and online control, the former relies on the known energy consumption data, but can achieve the optimal allocation effect, while the latter can achieve real-time energy allocation, but the optimization effect is limited. The researches of parameter matching have developed from efficiency analysis and strategy matching to global optimization based on energy allocation strategy to solve the optimization problem that the first two methods do not consider cost and weight of HESS. Finally, it is pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to establish a personalized parameter matching global optimization model based on the natural driving data of electric vehicles on urban roads, aiming at optimizing the service life of the whole power battery pack and considering the driver's style, so as to reduce its manufacturing cost; and combined with road traffic information, more accurate energy consumption prediction would be carried out, and the intelligent energy distribution strategy combining off-line and on-line control is adopted to further improve the effect of energy allocation.
