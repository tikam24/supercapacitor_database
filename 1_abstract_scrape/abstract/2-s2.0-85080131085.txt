In this present study, we report multi-functional application of as synthesized carbon nanotubes as both electrolyte and electrode material for supercapacitor due to its porous nature and wide-ranging electronic properties. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption studies revealed the surface area of 476.9 m2 g−1. The average pore size of the so-formed carbon nanotubes was found to be 3.11 nm and volume of 0.427 cc g−1 by BJH method. These porous structures of carbon material were utilized as a filler in PVDF-HFP:NH4I polymer electrolyte and additionally optimized to get higher conductivity of 2.09E−4 S cm−1 at room temperature which is well suitable for supercapacitor fabrication. Supercapacitor fabricated consisted of graphite sheet was used as the current collector, carbon nanotubes as the electrode and optimized polymer electrolyte as the dielectric, showed capacitance of 35 F g−1 which is in accordance with the value obtained by low-frequency impedance studies.
