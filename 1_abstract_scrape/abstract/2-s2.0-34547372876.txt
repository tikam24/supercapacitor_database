New energy storage technologies based on flywheels, supercapacitors and superconducting coils could reduce the demand for energy by ensuring that it is used only when needed. Energy storage could extend the capability of intermittent energy sources such as solar cells, wind turbines and other renewables by allowing the electricity they generate to be stored and then fed into the electrical grid at periods of high demand. NASA's carbon-composite flywheels, which are an order of magnitude higher those made out of steel, can store 10 times as much energy per unit mass as a conventional chemical battery. Similarly, supercapacitors have proved useful in storing energy whenever a variable amount of power is required because they can rapidly discharge to make up any power shortfalls and recharge when there is excess power. Another technology named superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) can store energy in the magnetic field created by an electric current flowing in a superconducting coil cooled to near absolute zero.
