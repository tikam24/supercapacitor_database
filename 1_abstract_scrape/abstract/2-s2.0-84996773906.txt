Graphene incorporated, N doped activated carbons (GNACs) are synthesized by alkali activation of graphene-polypyrrole composite (G-PPy) at different temperatures for application as electrode materials of supercapacitors. Under optimal activation temperature of 700 °C, the resultant samples, labeled as GNAC700, owns hierarchically porous texture with high specific surface area and efficient ions diffusion channels, N, O functionalized surface with apparent pseudocapacitance contribution and high wettability, thus can deliver a moderate capacitance, a high rate capability and a good cycleability when used as supercapacitor electrode. Additionally, the GNAC700 electrode demonstrates high catalytic activity for the redox reaction of pyrocatechol/o-quinone pair in H2SO4 electrolyte, thus enables a high pseudocapacitance from electrolyte. Under optimal pyrocatechol concentration in H2SO4 electrolyte, the electrode capacitance of GNAC700 increases by over 4 folds to 512 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, an excellent cycleability is also achieved simultaneously. Pyridinic- N is deemed to be responsible for the high catalytic activity. This work provides a promising strategy to ameliorate the capacitive performances of supercapacitors via the synergistic interaction between redox-active electrolyte and catalytic electrodes.
