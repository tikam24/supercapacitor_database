A simple hydrothermal process has been used to prepare a carbon nanofiber/copper chromium dioxide (CNF/CuCrO2) composite for the selective detection of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and supercapacitor applications. The electrochemical sensor was developed with a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with the CNF/CuCrO2 composite by the drop-casting method. The structural formation of the prepared materials was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. To investigate the electrochemical efficiency of the electrode, various electroanalytical techniques, namely, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge tests, were employed. The GCE/CNF/CuCrO2 modified electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic behavior for the detection of 4-NP under optimized conditions with a low detection limit (0.022 μM), long linear response range of 0.1-150 μM, and high sensitivity (20.02 μA μM-1 cm-2). The modified electrode was used for the detection of 4-NP in real samples with satisfactory results. In addition, the GCE/CNF/CuCrO2 electrode has advantages such as stability, reproducibility, repeatability, reliability, low cost, and practical application. The CNF/CuCrO2 composite coated Ni-foam electrodes also exhibited excellent supercapacitor efficiency, with a high specific capacitance of up to 159 F g-1 at a current density of 5 A g-1 and outstanding cycling stability. Hence, the CNF/CuCrO2 composite is a suitable material for 4-NP sensors and energy storage applications.
