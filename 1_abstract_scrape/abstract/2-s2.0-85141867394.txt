Two dimensional material based heterostructures have been widely investigated for high performance energy storage applications due to their distinctive advantages. These heterostructures remove most of the congenital shortcomings belonging to each individual structure. In this study, electrochemical energy storage performance of the chromium diselenide (CrSe2)/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure is examined. CrSe2 is a lesser explored layered TMD and is a promising candidate for energy storage applications. MXene on the other hand is an emerging material and is being extensively studied for its unique intrinsic energy storage abilities. The CrSe2/Ti3C2 MXene heterostructure electrode displays an enhanced energy storage performance in a basic electrolyte medium. The multi-dimensional hierarchical architecture of CrSe2/Ti3C2 MXene results in an increased number of active sites for electrochemical activities and improves the electrochemical stability. The synergistic interplayed effect triggered by fast ionic/electronic transportation, reduced agglomeration and volume expansion, etc. can be accounted for the enhanced electrochemical performance of the heterostructure. An all-solid-state supercapacitor is fabricated to utilize and demonstrate the energy storage capability of CrSe2/Ti3C2 MXene in real time applications. The fabricated device showed a compelling performance during the electrochemical assessment.
