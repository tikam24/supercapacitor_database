Abstract An amorphous aluminum oxide supercapacitor can store a large amount of electric storge on the uneven surfaces with AlO6 clusters. The amount of stored electricity increases with decreasing convex diameter d and depth of valley h. The nondestructive detection of AlO6 clusters on a surface with (Al0.91Y0.09)O1.66 oxide layer at a depth of 0.5 μm was determined based on a 3505 cm-1 peak band in the Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) spectrum and one 1047 cm-1 peak in the microRaman spectrum. The discharging time (T) could be expressed as T = 1.388 × 100.019 I. Thus, we can evaluate the amount of electricity by the nondestructive detection methods such as FT-IR and the microRaman spectra.
