A well dispersed stable film is synthesized via potentiodynamic deposition technique under ambient conditions and neutral pH. p-type copper oxide is prepared potentiodynamically under a scan rate of 20 mV/s in a potential sphere, which is reaffirmed by virtue of hall measurements. The characterization tools like Gracing Incidence X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Visble spectroscopy, photoluminescenece spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope and Hall measurement are used to study the structural, optical, morphological and electrical traits of the thin films. Film thickness plays a pivotal role in supercapacitor application. The amelioration of film thickness for supercapacitor application is attuned by repeating the number of cycles such as 15, 30 and 45. The film formed under 30 number of cycles displays better specific capcitance value with an excellent cyclic stability of 1000 number of cycles and having good charge retention efficiency.
