The conductivity capacity of ion and electrons for pseudocapacitance materials are the foremost essential that restricts the further development of supercapacitor. In this study, a new type of nanoflower-like NiAl-LDHs-S electrode material was successfully synthesized by presynthetic solvothermal reaction and pursuant vulcanization modified program. Due to the generation of sulfides on surface of the nanoflower-like NiAl-LDHs, the resulting NiAl-LDHs-S electrode material presents a impressive specific capacitance of 1680 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. Besides, this new-found NiAl-LDHs-S electrode has a relatively superior capacity retention rate of 60 % at 20 A g−1, which is better than the antiquated NiAl-LDHs electrode. Additionally, the as-prepared soft package NiAl-LDHs-S//AC asymmetric supercapacitor presents a acceptable energy density of 35.78 Wh kg−1 when the power density reaches to 1127.03 W kg−1. This study shows that our novel nanoflower-like NiAl-LDHs-S sample is a bright electrode material with properties of pseudocapacitance to aggregate the asymmetric supercapacitors and the vulcanization treatment is an toilless and efficient strategy to accelerate the electron conduction in electrochemical energy storage performance of LDH-based supercapacitor materials.
