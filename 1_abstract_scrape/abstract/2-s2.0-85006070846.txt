3D network-like porous MnCo2O4 nanostructures have been successfully fabricated through a facile and scalable sucrose-assisted combustion route followed by calcination treatment. Benefiting from its advantages of the unique 3D network-like architectures with large specific surface area (216.15 m2 g−1), abundant mesoporosity (2–50 nm) and high electronic conductivity, the as-prepared MnCo2O4 electrode displays a high specific capacitance of 647.42 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, remarkable capacitance retention rate of 70.67% at current density of 10 A g−1 compared with 1 A g−1, and excellent cycle stability (only 6.32% loss after 3000 cycles). The excellent electrochemical performances coupled with facile and cost effective method will render the as-fabricated 3D network-like porous MnCo2O4 as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
