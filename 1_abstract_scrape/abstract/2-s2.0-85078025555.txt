One-step hydrothermal reaction has successfully been used to prepared three-dimensional hierarchitecture Co2(OH)3Cl@FeCo2O4 composite without any annealing treatment. The samples are investigated to confirm the crystal structure, elemental composition, morphology structure and electrochemical performance. The results show the sample has a three-dimensional hierarchitecture that nanoblocks are assembled with nanoparticles. And the specific surface area is 87.5 m2 g−1 and the total pore volume is 0.17 cm3 g−1. Meanwhile, the composite shows a high specific capacitance of 1110.0 F·g−1 at 1 A·g−1 and great cycling stability with 98.8% capacitance retention after 3000 cycles. To evaluate the electrochemical performances, the results are used to compare with the Co2(OH)3Cl and FeCo2O4 nanomaterials, indicating a higher capacitance and longer cycle stability shown by the as-synthesized sample. The as-synthesized Co2(OH)3Cl@FeCo2O4 composite has an outstanding electrochemical performance, predicting an enormous potential and promising future as a novel electrode material applied in supercapacitor.
