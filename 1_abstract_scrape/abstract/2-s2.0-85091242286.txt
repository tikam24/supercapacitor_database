Recently, use of supercapacitors as energy storage systems has attracted considerable attention. However, the literature is scarce of information about the optimization of hybrid systems, using supercapacitors as the main energy storage system. In our study, we focused step-by-step on the engineering concept of a photo-rechargeable energy storage system based on silicon solar cells and supercapacitors. In the first step, based on commercially available elements, we designed a solar charger and simulated its work in idealized conditions. Secondly, we designed appropriate electronic connections and control systems, allowing for the charging-discharging process of the energy storage system. After constructing three type of demonstrators of solar energy charger, we tested it. The novel design allowed us to achieve total available energy from solar panel energy conversion up to 93%.
