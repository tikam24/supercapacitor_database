The flake-like NiTe materials were successfully synthesized by one-step hydrothermal method using TeO2 as tellurium source, nickel foam as the nickel source and substrate and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4•H2O) as the reducing agent. The effects of hydrothermal temperature on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of the product were studied by using NiTe as the electrode material of Supercapacitor. Results shown that when the reaction temperature was 180 ℃, the prepared NiTe had a homogeneous flake-like structure. The maximum specific capacitance of NiTe electrode obtained under the three-electrode system was 603.6 F•g-1. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was prepared using NiTe and AC as positive and negative electrode, respectively. The NiTe//AC ASC could extend the potential window to 1.6 V and had the maximum energy density and power density of 25.8 Wh•kg-1 and 3994 W•kg-1, respectively. In addition, ASC exhibited good circulatory stability, 83.3% of initial specific capacitance was maintained after 5000 cycles.
