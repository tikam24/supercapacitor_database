Due to their high-power density, manganese-based electrodes have been studied for energy storage systems. However, they are not stable over high potential windows limiting their use as supercapacitor electrode materials. Manganese was electrodeposited with iron to increase the potential window because manganese-based electrodes are electroactive in the positive region (in Na2SO4 electrolyte) whereas iron-based electrodes are electroactive in the negative region. Graphite was coated potentiostatically with Mn-Fe alloys in a deep eutectic solvent (DES) ionic liquid, Ethaline. The effect of deposition potential on surface morphology, chemical structure, and electrochemical behavior was investigated. XRD, Raman, FTIR, CV and SEM were utilized to characterize bare graphite and alloy deposited graphite. The areal capacitance of the alloy-coated graphite electrode was determined to be 1.66 F cm−2 at 5 mV s−1. The potential window of the alloy-based coating electrodeposited from Ethaline DES was 2.0 V (from −1.0 to +1.0 V). The Mn-Fe-coated graphite electrode material reacts with the neutral electrolyte via a combination of surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled mechanisms. The production of Mn-Fe-coated graphite electrodes from ionic liquid (Ethaline) media allowed for flexible, easy-to-prepare, and cheap electrodes with wide potential windows for supercapacitor applications.
