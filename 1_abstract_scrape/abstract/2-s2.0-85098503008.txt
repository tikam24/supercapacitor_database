As a new type of energy storage device, supercapacitor has attracted wide attentions due to its advantages such as short charging and discharging time, good cycle stability and higher power density. The main factor that affects the performance of supercapacitors is the electrode material, so electrode material with high specific capacitance has become one of the most focuses of current researches on supercapacitor. In this paper, biomass-based porous carbon material with high specific surface area was synthesized from ginger slices of food residue by activation and carbonization method. The prepared porous carbon was used as the electrode for supercapacitor, and the electrochemical performance was investigated. Its specific capacitance was as high as 227 F g-1 at the current density of 0.5 A g-1, and it was assembled into an asymmetric supercapacitor with the voltage up to 1.6 V, and the maximum energy density was up to 13.65 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 399.5 W kg-1, and the maximum power density was up to 7.99 kW kg-1 at the energy density of 9.1 Wh kg-1. After 5,000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1, the specific capacitance retention is 98.95 %.
