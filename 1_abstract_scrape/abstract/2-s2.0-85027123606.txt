A simple preparation of nanoplatelet like Ca2V2O7/PANI composite via co-precipitation technique has been reported and it is used as an electrode material for supercapacitor application. The structure and morphology of the as-prepared pure Ca2V2O7 and Ca2V2O7/PANI composite are characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The electrochemical performance of Ca2V2O7 and Ca2V2O7/PANI composite based electrodes is investigated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance analysis in 6 M KOH as supporting electrolyte. It is found that the specific capacitance of Ca2V2O7/PANI composite was 542 F g−1 at current density 1 A g−1 which is much higher than that of pure Ca2V2O7 (202 F g−1). Meanwhile, the composite electrode also showed an excellent cyclic stability and retained 84.2% efficiency of its initial discharge capacitance after 1000 cycles (at current density of 5 A g−1). Therefore, the described Ca2V2O7/PANI nanoplatelets are found to be a highly suitable electrode material for supercapacitor applications.
