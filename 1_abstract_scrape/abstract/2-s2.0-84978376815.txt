Demand for high-performance energy storage materials has motivated research activities to develop nano-engineered composites that benefit from both high-rate and high-capacitance materials. Herein, NiMnO3 (NMO) nanoparticles have been synthesized through a facile co-precipitation method. As-prepared NMO samples are then employed for the synthesis of nano-composites with graphite (Gr) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Various samples, including pure NMO, NMO-graphite blend, as well as NMO/Gr and NMO/RGO nano-composites have been electrochemically investigated as active materials in supercapacitors. The NMO/RGO sample exhibited a high specific capacitance of 285 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, much higher than the other samples (237 F g-1 for NMO/Gr, 170 F g-1 for NMO-Gr and 70 F g-1 for NMO). Moreover, the NMO/RGO nano-composite has shown excellent cycle stability with a 93.5% capacitance retention over 1000 cycles at 2 A g-1 and still delivered around 87% of its initial capacitance after cycling for 4000 cycles. An NMO/RGO composite was assessed in practical applications by assembling NMO/RGO//NMO/RGO symmetric devices, exhibiting high specific energy (27.3 Wh kg-1), high specific power (7.5 kW kg-1), and good cycle stability over a broad working voltage of 1.5 V. All the obtained results demonstrate the promise of NMO/RGO nano-composite as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.
