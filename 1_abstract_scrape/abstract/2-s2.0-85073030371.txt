CNT-reinforced foams comprised of three-dimensional (3D) interconnected macropores with uniform mesoporous walls were developed as multifunctional nanocomposites and tested for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Multi-walled CNTs grown on the wall surface of the interconnected scaffold structure of carbon foams were found to improve the surface area and electrochemical properties of the nanocomposites. The lightweight CNT-reinforced nanocomposites not only exhibit high structural flexibility, but also possess enhanced electrocatalytic performance for HER at current density of 10 mA cm−2 with overpotentials of 240 mV. In addition, these nanocomposites can be used as flexible, electric double layer capacitor electrodes, and have achieved a specific capacitance of 776 F g−1, with excellent durability and stability after 1000 cycles.
