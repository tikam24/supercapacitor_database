The integration of flexible supercapacitors (FSC) into electronic textiles (e-textiles) offers a promising power source, capable of fast charge-discharge rates, high-power density and long lifetimes. The design parameters for such a device are varied and complicated, with the need for low weight, cheap production, breathability and low toxicity. This work presents the optimization of the carbon electrodes within a solid-state, single-layer textile supercapacitor that meets these device requirements. Three commercial activated carbons are investigated with different ratios of activated carbon to Carbon Black, at differing loading levels. The maximum areal capacitance observed was 23.6 mF.cm-2
