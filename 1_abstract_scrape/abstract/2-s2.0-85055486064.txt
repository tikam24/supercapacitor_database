A simple method has been developed to prepare carbon nanotube/graphite/zinc oxide (CNT/GT/ZnO) composite on SS foil substrate which was employed for supercapacitor electrode materials. The XRD study reveals the formation of CNT/GT/ZnO structure. Scanning electron microscopy characterizations reveal that the combination of CNT/GT and ZnO can increase the conductive property of material. The electrochemical performance of composite electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry measurements in 1 M KCl aqueous electrolyte. The CNT/GT/ZnO composite electrode shows the specific capacitance up to 6.99 Fg−1 in scan rate of 25 mVs-1 with an energy density of 152.9 Wh kg−1 in the potential range −0.5 V to 0.5 V.
