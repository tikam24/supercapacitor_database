This paper considers Peukert's law for supercapacitor parallel and series modules composed of supercapacitor cells during constant power discharge processes. Originally developed for lead-acid batteries, Peukert's law states that the delivered charge of a battery depends on the discharge current: the higher the discharge current, the less the delivered charge. Recent studies show that Peukert's law applies to supercapacitor cells during constant power discharge processes. This paper first verifies that Peukert's law is also applicable to supercapacitor parallel and series modules with constant power loads. Furthermore, this paper studies the dependence of the supercapacitor module Peukert constant on the terminal voltage.
