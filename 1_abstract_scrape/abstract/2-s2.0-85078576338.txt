This work provides the dynamic operation and supervisory control of a hybrid renewable energy system which supplies power in stand-alone as well as in grid-connected mode. It contains a photovoltaic as a primary source controlled via fuzzy and a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) as a secondary source controlled via Proportional Integral Differential (PID) controller. The high intermittency nature of photovoltaic is addressed through the integration of super-capacitor and battery bank in the proposed architecture. The overall strategy of the proposed system is achieved using dynamic power switches of the power converters. The strategy maximizes the use of available photovoltaic /fuel cell/ super-capacitor/battery power and reduces stress on the public grid under all conditions for 24 hours. The proposed test-bed is simulated under real weather pattern and load variations. Simulations conclude the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.
