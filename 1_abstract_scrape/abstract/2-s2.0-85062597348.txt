Supercapacitors have rapidly evolved into one of the important components in energy storage technology with the capability of storing and discharging energy very quickly and effectively. The fabrication of a high-performance supercapacitor carbon electrode via a large-scale printing process can accelerate its commercialization. Herein, a high-performance supercapacitor carbon electrode is processed via a micro-gravure roll-to-roll (R2R) printing technique, and the properties are optimized through web tension, printing speed and morphology control. The supercapacitor with carbon electrodes fabricated by R2R micro-gravure printing shows a capacitance of 151.15 F g-1 and equivalent series resistance (ESR) of 0.37 Î©, which are comparable to the carbon electrodes fabricated via conventional coating. Furthermore, the electrodes show highly promising performance in the application of solid-state supercapacitors, and the light-emitting diode working for nearly 30 s. The research demonstrates that the low-cost, large-scale R2R micro-gravure printing process can be used to produce high-quality electrodes for the supercapacitor, which will accelerate the development of a fully R2R micro-gravure printed supercapacitor and its commercialization.
