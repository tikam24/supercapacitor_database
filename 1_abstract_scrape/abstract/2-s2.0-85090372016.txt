Carbon nanofibers are important one-dimensional carbon-based nanostructured materials. They are generally prepared by electrospinning of polymer precursors and followed by thermal treatment, or by chemical vapor deposition growth through the decomposition of hydrocarbons in the presence of a metal catalyst. They are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors due to their high electrical conductivity, specific surface area, and porosity. They store energy through the electrical double layer capacitor mechanism. Nitrogen doping, activation process, etc., can further improve the specific capacitance values of them. Therefore, this chapter provides decent and updated coverage on the basic structure, properties, and supercapacitor performance of carbon nanofibers at different synthetic approaches. The chapter also describes the supercapacitive performance of carbon nanofibers through different surface and structural modifications.
