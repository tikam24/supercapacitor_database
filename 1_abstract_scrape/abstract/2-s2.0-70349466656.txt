Electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors were fabricated by cathodic electrodeposition of MnO2 on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which were grown by chemical vapour deposition on stainless steel meshes. The MnO2-CNT nanocomposites were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The electrodes showed excellent capacitive behaviour in the 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, with specific capacitance of 356 F g-1 at a scan rate of 2 mV s-1. Â© 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.
