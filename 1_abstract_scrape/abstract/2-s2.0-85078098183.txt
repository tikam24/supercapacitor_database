Herein we prepared a type of MoS2/corncob-derived activated carbon (CB–C) hybrid materials for the application in supercapacitor by simple one-step hydrothermal method. The microstructures, morphology and electrochemical performance of the obtained MoS2/CB-C hybrid materials were studied by XRD, Raman, FE-SEM, TEM, Cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance and constant current charge and discharge. The nanoflower-like MoS2 is directly grown on the nanoflaky biocarbon to increase the specific surface area of the composite material, thereby increasing its electrochemical performance and making its specific capacitance reaches 333.5 F g−1 under the current density of 1 A g−1 with the capacitance retention of 81.8% over 7000 cycles, which is 160 and 4 times that of CB-C and MoS2, respectively. The symmetric supercapacitor made of MoS2/CB-C possesses a high specific capacitance of 38.3 F g−1 and energy density of 7.6 W h kg−1.
