Current paper comprises the electrodeposition of nanostructured porous Co1-xNix layered double hydroxide (Co1-xNi x LDHs) thin films on to stainless steel substrate by a potentiodynamic mode. The compositional impacts on the various properties of Co1-xNix LDHs are examined via structural, morphological, surface wettability and electrochemical studies. The nanocrystalline Co 1-xNix LDHs thin films possess varying porous, nanoflake like morphology and superhydrophilic behavior by the composition influence. Electrochemical studies demonstrate the supercapacitive performance of Co 1-xNix LDHs thin film electrodes. The maximal specific capacitance for Co1-xNix LDHs electrode is found to be ∼1213 F g-1 for composition Co0.66Ni0.34 LDH in 2 M KOH electrolyte at 5 mV s-1 scan rate owing specific energy of 104 Whkg-1, specific power of 1.44 kW kg-1 with ∼94% of coulomb efficiency and stability of electrode retained to 77% after 10,000th cycle. The high capacitance retention proposes the deposited Co 1-xNix LDHs thin film as promising contender for supercapacitor applications. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
