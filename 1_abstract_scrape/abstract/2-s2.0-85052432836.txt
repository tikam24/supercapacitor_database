The micro-supercapacitors are of great value for portable, flexible, and integrated electronic equipments. Here, the large-scale and integrated asymmetrical micro-supercapacitor (AMSC) array is fabricated in virtue of the laser direct writing and electrodeposition technology. The AMSC shows the ideal flexibility, high areal specific capacitance (21.8 mF cm−2), and good rate capability. Moreover, its energy density reaches 12.16 µW h cm−2, outperforming most micro-supercapacitors reported previously. Meanwhile, large-scale series-connected AMSCs are integrated on the flexible substrates (e.g., indium tin oxide-polyethylene terephthalate film), which can power a veriety of the commercial electronics. The combination of AMSCs array, solar cell, and electronic device proves the feasibility for practical application in the portable, flexible, and integrated electronic equipments.
