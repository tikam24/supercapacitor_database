Graphene oxide(GO) was prepared by improved Hummers method. Hydrothermal reduction was performed at 180â„ƒ under acidic conditions (pH=5). Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) with different reduction degrees was prepared by adjusting hydrothermal reduction time. The effects of different hydrothermal reduction time on RGO structure and supercapacitive performance were studied. The results showed that RGO with different degree of reduction could be prepared by controlling the time of hydrothermal reduction. With the increase of hydrothermal reduction time, the specific capacitance of the RGO electrode increases at the beginning and then decreases through electrochemical testing. When the hydrothermal reduction time was 6 h, the RGO electrode showed the best supercapacitive performance, and its specific capacitance reached 251 F/g at 1 A/g current density, which was 225% higher than the GO electrode. After 500 charge and discharge cycles, the RGO-6 electrode has a specific capacitance retention rate of 92%, which has excellent cycle stability.
