This paper presents the development of a thermal management system for an energy storage system based on lithium-ion capacitors. In the proposed study, a liquid cooling method for a LiC module that comprises 12 cells has been investigated. In this sense, a 3D thermal model coupled with liquid cooling plates has been developed in order to test its effectiveness and the potential it could represent in comparison with other cooling strategies. The developed model has clearly shown an optimal performance of the module could not be reached without controlling the temperature distribution, using liquid-cooling medium, it is possible to solve this issue.
