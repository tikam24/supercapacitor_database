Four POM-based complexes were synthesized under hydrothermal conditions by using two kinds of triazole derivatives, namely [Cu2(Cmt)2(OH)Cl(β-Mo8O26)0.5] (1), [Cu(H2O)3(H3/2Tpm)2](HTpm)(PMo12O40)2·4H2O (2), [Cu3Cl2(H2Tpm)2(HTpm)4(PMo12O40)4]·26H2O (3), and [Co3(HTpm)6(H2O)2(Mo13O42)2]·21H2O (4) (Cmt = 1-cyclopropylmethyl-1-H-[1,2,4]triazole, Tpm = 4-(3-[1,2,4]triazole-4-propyl)morpholine). Complex 1 contains tetra-nuclear Cu clusters, which are linked by Mo8 anions to form a 1D chain. Both complexes 2 and 3 are 0D structures, and complex 3 includes tri-nuclear Cu clusters. Rarely observed [Mo12O38]4− subunits are present in complex 4, which are further linked by {MoO4} to construct a new infinite Mo-O chain. These Mo-O chains are connected by tri-nuclear [Co3(HTpm)6(H2O)2]12+ clusters to build the 3D framework of 4. Complexes 1-4 exhibit good electrochemical properties and can be used as amperometric sensors for detection of Cr(vi), NO2−, H2O2 and Fe(iii). Complexes 1 and 2 have good capacitance performance. In particular, at a current density of 1 A g−1, the specific capacitance of complex 2 is as high as 1618 F g−1. Complexes 1-4 have photocatalytic activity, and can not only photocatalyze the degradation of organic dyes, but also photocatalyze the reduction of Cr(vi). In addition, complexes 2 and 4 exhibit photochromic and thermochromic properties.
