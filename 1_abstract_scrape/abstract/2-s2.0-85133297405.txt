We report the electrochemical performance of divalent (Mn, Fe, Zn) substituted NiCo2O4 nanorods, developed using facile hydrothermal route. The physico-chemical properties of the electrode materials were analysed using XRD, FESEM, TEM, HRTEM, FFT, EDAX and XPS. The performance of Mn substituted NiCo2O4 was found to be the best divalent replacement, with a specific capacitance of 1272 F/g at 1 A/g current density, an energy density of 35.77 Wh/kg, and a power density of 660.39 W/kg. The capacitance of Fe and Zn substituted NiCo2O4 was found to be lower than that of the pure NiCo2O4 electrode material, which may be owing to the lower catalytic activity of Fe and Zn. The Mn substituted NiCo2O4 demonstrates that it has the potential to be used as a high performance supercapacitor in practical applications.
