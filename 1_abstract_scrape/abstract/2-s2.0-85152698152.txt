Long cycle life and high energy/power density are imperative to energy storage systems. Polyaniline (PANI) has shown great potential as an electrode material but is limited by poor cycling and rate performance. We present a molecular design approach of binding short-chain aniline trimers (ATs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the formation of amide covalent linkages enabled by a simple laser scribing technique. The covalently coupled AT/CNT (cc-AT/CNT) composite retains 80% of its original capacitance after 20 000 charge/discharge cycles, which readily outperforms long-chain PANI/CNT composites without covalent connections. The compact AT/CNT heterointerfaces produce fast charge/discharge kinetics and excellent rate capability. The flexible symmetric quasi-solid-state devices can be stably cycled beyond 50 000 cycles, at least 5 times longer than most PANI/CNT-based symmetric supercapacitors reported to date. This molecular design of durable conducting polymer-based electrode materials enabled by laser irradiation presents a feasible approach toward robust advanced energy storage devices.
