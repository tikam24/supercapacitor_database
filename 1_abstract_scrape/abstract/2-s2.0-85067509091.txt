The technological requirements for burst power, high-energy-density memory backup, and a revitalized domestic electric vehicle program have suggested the use of thin-film, high-voltage transition metal oxide cathodes coupled with a Li foil anode in a bipolar configuration. Consequently, the authors investigated the electrochemical behavior of LiMn2O4, LiNiO2, and LiCoO2 prepared by chemical vapor deposition and sol-gel techniques. They consider the synthesis, characterization, and costs associated with the preparation of thin-film cathode materials. Particular attention has been focused on morphology, double-layer capacitors, and solid-state Li+ ion diffusivity as these materials are pulse discharged.
