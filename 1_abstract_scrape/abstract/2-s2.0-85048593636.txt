Present study investigated decoration of Cu(OH)2 with different morphologies by copper precursors, on 3D nickel foam. The Cu(OH)2-A (nano flower)electrode showed an excellent capacitance of 1332 F g−1 at current density of 2 A g−1 compared to the Cu(OH)2-C (nano ribbon, 1100 F g−1) and Cu(OH)2-S (nano long leaf, 1013 F g−1) electrodes. Asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) was fabricated, and showed maximum capacitance of 165 F g−1 at current density of 2 A g−1with high energy density of 66.7 Wh kg−1 and power density of 5698 W kg−1 with excellent stability of 80% after 10,000 cycles.
