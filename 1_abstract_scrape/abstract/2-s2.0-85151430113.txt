Electrolytes are the key to supercapacitor devices having high specific capacitance, high energy density, good rate performance, high power density, safety and long cycling life. Electrolyte performance can be evaluated from ionic mobility and conductivity. This research focuses on the electrochemical properties of biomass-based activated carbon by optimizing the electrolyte solution used. Biomass-based activated carbon electrodes (AC) were synthesized through a pre-carbonization process, then chemically activated with 0.5 M KOH. Samples that have been chemically activated are dried and printed, then the carbonization process is carried out at 600 ℃ and physical activation at 800 ℃ using a furnace. AC that has been neutralized is immersed in an electrolyte of 1 M H2SO4 (AC-01), 1 M KOH (AC-02), and 1 M NH3 (AC-03). The physical properties of AC electrodes were characterized using XRD to determine crystallinity and FTIR to determine functional groups. The specific capacitance value of the supercapacitor cells was tested using CV and GCD. The results showed that AC has an amorphous nature and had O–H and C[dbnd]O functional groups. The specific capacitance values obtained from AC-01, AC-02 and AC-03 are 192, 154, and 112F/g respectively. The highest capacitance value is obtained when the AC is immersed in H2SO4 electrolyte, because H2SO4 has smaller ion sizes than other electrolyte solutions so that many of these ions enter the pores of the carbon electrode.
