With the rapid development of wearable electronic devices, there is an increasing demand for lightweight, flexible, and flame-retardant electronic materials. Herein, flexible and porous aerogel films composed of poly(p-phenylenebenzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PBO-NFs) and carboxylated carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) were prepared using a sol-hydrogel-aerogel conversion method. By changing the ratio between the two components, we obtained aerogel films that met our different requirements. The prepared PBO-NF/CCNT(10%), with conductivity, conductive stability, superhydrophilicity, breathability, and flame retardancy, could be used as a pressure sensor. The sensor exhibited high sensitivity, wide detection range, and short response time and could monitor various physiological activities. After the in situ growth of Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) onto PBO-NF/CCNT(20%) for 2 h, the specific capacitance of the resulting PBO-NF/CCNT(20%)@Ni3(HITP)2(2h) was 78.9% higher than that of PBO-NF/CCNT(20%). The capacitance retention rate was as high as 94.4% after 10,000 cycles. This multifunctional aerogel film holds great promise for wearable electronic devices.
