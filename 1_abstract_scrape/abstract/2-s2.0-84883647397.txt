Urchin-like NiO nanospheres were synthesised by a microwave hydrothermal method. The as-synthesised NiO nanospheres were characterised by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that NiO nanosphere consists of a nanoporous structure and nanosize crystals. When applied as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries, NiO nanospheres exhibited a high reversible specific capacity of 1027 mA h g-1, an excellent cycling performance and a good high rate capability. NiO nanospheres also showed a high specific capacitance as electrode materials for supercapacitors. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
