Biopolymers are excellent precursors to prepare porous carbon owing to their abundant resources, low cost, and unique properties. In this study, a La2O3 doped graphitic porous carbon (La2O3/Chit-C) was prepared using La(III) ions chelated chitosan as starting materials. The prepared nanocomposite exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, which is suitable for the design of supercapacitor. It demonstrated a capacitance of 464.8 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, which is higher than most of chitosan derived carbon materials. Furthermore, the nanocomposite showed good high-rate discharge capability and stability, demonstrating a potential application for electrochemical energy storage.
