The bidirectional regulation functions of hydrogen storage system and supercapacitor can used to effectively suppress wind power fluctuation and improve wind power consumption ability. In this paper, the structure of wind power / hydrogen integrated system coupled to the DC bus is firstly constructed, and the mathematical model of each unit is established. To improve the wind power consumption ability using hydrogen storage system, the coordinated control strategy for the integrated system is proposed. Based on the actual operation state of the system and the load demand of the power grid, the integrated system is divided into 10 operation modes. Under the condition of ensuring the safe operation of the system, the reasonable energy distribution for system energy balance is realized and the utilization rate of wind energy is therefore improved. Finally, PSCAD / EMTDC software is used to build the simulation model of wind power / hydrogen integrated system. The simulation results show that the coordinated control strategy proposed in this paper can effective smooth the wind power fluctuation and improve the wind power consumption ability.
