Recently, two-dimensional layered structures, especially MoS2 has come out as the most investigated electrode material for batteries and supercapacitors, possessing well preserved in-plane covalent bonding, leading to extraordinary mechanical elasticity within the layers as well as outstanding firmness along the c-axis. The present work is aimed to fabricate vertically aligned edge exposed molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes on the surface of the self-standing hydrophilic carbon nanotubes, using a two-step process involving a chemical route and magnetron sputtering techniques for flexible supercapacitor application. These hybrid heterostructures have been characterized using XRD, FESEM, and cyclic voltammetry. In the aqueous electrolyte of 1M Li2SO4, the symmetric device revealed very high areal capacitance of 182.5 mF/cm2 and 155 mF/cm2, at scan rates of 2 and 5 mV/s, respectively. The device shows high energy density of 365 mWh/cm2.
