The carbon spheres aggregations (Csa) were synthesized by carbonation of polystyrene spheres aggregations which were prepared by suspension polymerization of styrene. And polyaniline (PANI) was grown on surface of Csa successfully by chemical oxidative polymerization aniline (ANI). Their structures and morphologies were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Capacitive behaviors were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The PANI/m-Csa showed hierarchical structure containing carbon spheres aggregations and PANI nanoparticles. Relationship between the specific capacitance and the composition of m-Csa/PANI composite was also investigated. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
