Power management in a standalone microgrid having large scale renewable generation is generally based upon droop control strategies. However, the renewable sources such as photovoltaics (PV), which are interfaced with microgrid through power electronic converters have low inertia. Because of low inertia, the transient power variation during switching events like change in load may be very large and may result into variation in voltage and frequency beyond permissible limits. In this paper an adaptive scheme for power management of a standalone microgrid is proposed, which is based on available state of charge (SoC) of the batteries to mitigate these issues. The proposed battery SoC based adaptive droop control for power management allows smooth transition of distributed energy resources (DERs) from maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode to adaptive droop mode and vice versa. The transient behaviour is handled with the help of batteries and supercapacitor (SC), which is further improved with the help of fuzzy logic based proportional integral controller (FLC-PI). A significant drop in SC power during switching events is obtained with FLC-PI. The test microgrid is composed of multiple PV generation at different locations as primary source of generation, multiple batteries energy storage system (ESS) at different locations, fuel cell (FC), supercapacitor (SC) and a dynamic load.
