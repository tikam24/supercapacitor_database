In recent years, the development of MoS2 as supercapacitor electrode material has been widely reported, and most of them adopt a single method to improve the electrochemical performance of MoS2. Pure MoS2 has poor intrinsic conductivity and easy aggregation, which impedes its electrochemical performance and greatly limits its practical application. In this paper, Co-doped MoS2 was used as the substrate to compound with g-C3N4 to improve the electrochemical performance of MoS2. Mo0.7Co0.3S2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with different mass ratio were successfully synthesized via solvothermal method. The effects of different ratios on the microstructure and electrochemical properties of samples were studied by a series of tests. The experimental results indicate that Mo0.7Co0.3S2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites are hexagonal structure with good crystallization, the morphologies are mainly nanosheet structure, and Mo0.7Co0.3S2 nanoparticles are uniformly embedded on the surface of g-C3N4 nanosheets. Mo0.7Co0.3S2/g-C3N4 nanocomposites show pseudocapacitance behavior and excellent electrochemical performance, in particular, MCS/CN-2 electrodes (mass ratio of Mo0.7Co0.3S2:g-C3N4 is 9:1) exhibit the best electrochemical performance. This work improves the performance of MoS2 as electrode material of supercapacitor material through doping modification and composite of carbon material and provides reference value for subsequent research.
