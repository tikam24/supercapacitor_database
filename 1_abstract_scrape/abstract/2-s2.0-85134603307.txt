The organic fractions in coal liquefaction residue, such as asphaltene (CLRA) and preasphaltene (CLRPA), are the preferred precursors for preparing carbon materials as electrodes in supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The molecular structure, size and the corresponding carbonized products of CLRA and CLRPA are characterized by Fourier-transform infrared, Nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman spectroscopies, in addition to X-ray diffractometry. The effects of CLRA and CLRPA on the properties and electrochemical performance of polyacrylonitrile based carbon nanofiber nonwovens (PANCF) are investigated. For SCs, the CLRA based carbon nanofiber nonwoven shows a satisfactory specific capacitance of 221 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 and an outstanding rate capability of 79 % from 1 to 100 A g-1. For LIBs, this material also has an excellent reversible specific capacity of 251 mAh g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 after 600 cycles. Moreover, the free-standing electrodes for SCs and LIBs not only essentially reduce the complexity of the electrodes preparation process and enhance the utilization of the active materials.
