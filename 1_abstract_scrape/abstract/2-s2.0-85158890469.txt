Graphene is an important type of nanocarbon having two-dimensional sp2 hybridized nanostructure. Nitrogen doping has been applied as an effective method to modify the properties and potential applications of graphene. In N-doped graphene, nitrogen doping results in insertion of pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N in graphene nanostructure. Similar to graphene, N-doped graphene has been reinforced in polymeric matrices to form the nanocomposite. In this regard, polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivative, poly(vinyl fluoride), and other polymers have been used. Notable applications of high performance polymer/N-doped graphene nanocomposites have been observed in sensors, light emitting diodes, supercapacitors, and fuel cells.
