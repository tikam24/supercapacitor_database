Fe(OH)x (x = 2, 3) colloidal aggregations were synthesized at room temperature via a reduction and hydrolysis of FeCl3a6H2O on microscale Cu2O octahedron, which functions as a self-sacrifice template. We herein proposed the growth of Fe(OH)x colloidal aggregation by redox etching Cu2O octahedron while two critical reactions of both redox and precipitation were well employed in this work. As-synthesized Fe(OH)x samples exhibited high specific capacitance of 242.7 F/g, which was higher than those available data of iron oxides and hydroxides.
