In this paper, the development of an all-solid-state photo-supercapacitor (PSC) by micromachining techniques is discussed. The device consists of two ZnO-nanorod solar cells, a buckypaper-based supercapacitor (SC), and an indium tin oxide-coated polyethylene terephthalate substrate. The two solar cells were connected in series by sputtered Au films for scaling up the output voltage. The proposed device is highly flexible, lightweight, and durable. The total photocharge voltage of the PSC exceeded 1.0 V. The energy conversion efficiency of the PSC was 0.26%, and the maximum specific capacitance of the SC was 95.25 F/g. The photocharging- discharging process was measured. Cycle stability measurements showed that 95.89% of the initial specific capacitance was retained after 1000 cycles.
