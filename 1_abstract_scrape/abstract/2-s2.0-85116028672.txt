Ti3C2Tx, as novel members of the two-dimensional material family, hold great promise for electrochemical energy storage and catalysis, however, the electrochemical performance of Ti3C2Tx is largely limited by the self-restacking of their layers due to van der Waals forces. In this study, we report a high-performance electrode material, Ti3C2Tx supported Fe3O4 nanoplates (denoted as MXene-Fe), synthesized by a simple in situ wet chemistry method in a solvothermal system. The mesoporous MXene-Fe material as a supercapacitor electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 368.0 F g-1 at 1.0 A g-1 and long cycling stability with about 81% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 10.0 A g-1. Moreover, the optimized MXene-Fe also displays high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution (1.0 M KOH) with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec-1. This work provides an effective strategy for developing novel Ti3C2Tx-based functional materials with outstanding electrochemical performance for supercapacitors and electrocatalysis.
