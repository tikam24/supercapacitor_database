Electrophorus Electricus (EE) is known to discharge electric voltage through multiple organs based on Reversible Membrane Potential (RMP). We report a new type of supercapacitor for mimicking the EE's RMP based on an Electron-Relay Nano-Biomimetic Membrane Electrode Assembling (ERNBMEA) and an asymmetric membrane design with features free from ion channeling effect and a negligible double layer potential effect. The results obtained by a double step chronopotentiometry (DSCPO) method shown the Biomimetic EE devices has the reversible membrane potential in both 0.2 and 0.4 cm 3 supercapacitors. It can fire high electric spikes at both ends of the anode and cathode with a firing rate of 2-fold higher compared with the EE's 3.75V/s. The power and energy density for a single 0.2 cm 3 cell are several magnitudes higher than the EE's single electrolyte of 0.03 W/kg and 0.03Whr/kg. The capacitance of the 0.2 cm 3 biomimetic EE increased linearly from 0.25 to 13,240 μF/cm 2 over 0.015 to 1000 Hz range. At 120 Hz, the high storage capacitance is 5,140 μF/cm 2 that is an order of magnitude higher over the reported double-layer capacitor.
