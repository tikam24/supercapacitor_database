We have synthesized new electrode material for the supercapacitor application. Polyoxovanadates (POVs) have been used for energy storage electrode materials due to their fast multi-electron redox properties. The formation of SDV/GO composites was confirmed using various analytical methods, e.g., Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The composite electrode’s electrochemical behavior was studied using a neutral 1 M sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) solution in three-electrode cyclic voltammetry (CV) system. The SDV/GO composite electrode showed a specific capacitance of 306 F/g for a scan rate of 5 mV/s and a corresponding energy density of 42.4 Wh/Kg. Galvanostatic charge/discharge exhibits a specific capacitance of 310 F/g with energy densities of 43.08 Wh/kg. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which was used to investigate interface property, yielded a considerably higher power density of 172.41 KW/kg with an equivalent series resistance of 5 Ω.
