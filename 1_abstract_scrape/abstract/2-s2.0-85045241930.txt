High volumetric capacitance of supercapacitor is important and challenging for practical application in the energy storage devices. Herein, we develop a simple and effective approach to fabricate functionalized and pore structure controllable graphene via low temperature (∼170 °C) thermal treatment of graphite oxide with designed particle size. The as-obtained graphene with oxygen contents of 14.19 at.%, porous structure and a relative low pore volume (0.38 g cm−3), exhibits a promising material for the application in high volumetric performance supercapacitors. The prepared supercapacitor delivers a high volumetric capacitance of 226.9 F cm-3 at 0.5 A g−1 and achieves high rate capability (79% capacitance retention at 20 A g−1) in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the assembled supercapacitor in neutral electrolyte also exhibits a high volumetric energy density of 15.1 Wh L−1 as well as a high cycling stability with 94.2% retention after 9000 cycles. Therefore, this work will provide a new strategy for designing high volumetric capacitive performance of graphene for energy storage devices.
