Nanostructured carbon materials for supercapacitor electrodes, produced by short-pulse laser treatment of a polyimide film in argon with a fiber-optic ytterbium laser, were studied. Owing to the high power density, there occurred an optical breakdown of the polyimide film and its material was destructed to give nanocrystalline graphite. The thus synthesized nanostructured carbon was used as an active electrode material for supercapacitors. The results obtained in measurements of their functional characteristics demonstrated that the materials being synthesized are highly promising.
