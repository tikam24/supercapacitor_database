At present, the designs of carbon nanomaterials are indispensable to fulfill the growing demand for high energy and power density of energy storage devices. Heteroatom-doped (such as B, N, O, P, S, etc) porous carbon has great potential in the application of supercapacitor (SC) electrode materials. Nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) has displayed superior properties in SC applications, which has attracted the attention of researchers. Due to the synergistic effect between N and S atoms, the nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon (N/S-C) shows superior electrochemical properties compared to the nitrogen single-doped porous carbon. Therefore, the development of N/S-C as SC electrode is of great importance. In recent years, the literature on the study of N-C for SC applications has been very extensive, however, there are a limited number of review articles on N/S-C. This manuscript represents future research directions, recent developments in the preparation of N/S-C and its application in SC. Herein, the preparation and dimension structure of N/S-C were summarized. Finally, the electrochemical properties including specific capacitance (CF), energy density (ED) and power density (PD) are critically reviewed when these N/S-C are used as SC electrodes.
