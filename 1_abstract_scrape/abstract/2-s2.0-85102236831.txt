A synthesis of electrode material with higher-energy density and more extended stability is very significant for replacing the present-day supercapacitor demand. Toward this objective, in this work, a composite containing three primary materials meant for supercapacitor application is synthesized. They are conducting polymer, metal oxide, and carbon materials. A unique quaternary composite is prepared via the chemical method using mesoporous carbon (MC), polyaniline (PANI), molybdenum oxide (MoO3), and silicon dioxide (SiO2) materials. This composite is used as an electroactive material in symmetric electrode configuration in aqueous electrolyte supercapacitor. As synthesized MoO3-MC-SiO2-PANI sample is subjected to 250,000 CD cycles at a higher discharge current density of 16.6 A/g with 57% retention of the initial capacitance of 45 F/g with low and constant equivalent series resistance (ESR) value (3–3.8 Ω). This composite showed an energy density (ED) as 31 Wh/Kg at a power density of 155 W/Kg. The excellent stability of the electrode material was established by evaluating the electrode material after the subjection of 250,000 CD cycles by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements.
