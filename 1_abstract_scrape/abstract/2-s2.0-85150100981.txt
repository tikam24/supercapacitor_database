Ionic liquids (ILs) offer a wide range of uses in the chemical industry for eco-friendly energy source products. Generally, ILs have been employed as electrolytes, which serve as catalysts and catalytic supports in electrochemistry. It has also been extensively used as electrolytes in batteries, plasticizers, lubricants, extraction, solvents and catalysis in synthesis, solvents for manufacturing nano-materials, matrices for mass spectroscopy, gas absorption agents, and so on. The ability to adjust properties by altering design in ILs structure gives an opportunity according to our needs. Overall, the topic of ILs in electrocatalysis has potential for future industrial applications. Therefore it needs to be investigated extensively.
