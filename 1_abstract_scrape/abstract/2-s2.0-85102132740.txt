In this work, MgCo2O4@NiMn layered double hydroxide (LDH) core-shell structured nanocomposites on Ni foam (NF) are synthesized by facile hydrothermal and calcination methods. MgCo2O4/NF is synthesized first via a hydrothermal reaction and annealing treatment, and then utilized to prepare MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH/NF core-shell structured nanocomposites via the second hydrothermal process. It is found that the MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH/NF nanocomposite prepared from 6 h hydrothermal reaction (MC@NM-LDH-2) exhibits an excellent specific capacitance of 3757.2 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1). Moreover, a high capacitance retention (86.9% after 6000 cycles) and a low internal resistance (Rs) (0.565 Ω) can be achieved. Furthermore, an all-solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) is assembled using MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH/NF-2 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode. The as-fabricated MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH/NF-2//AC ASC shows a high energy density of 62.33 Wh kg−1 at 750 W kg−1. Meanwhile, the MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH/NF-2//AC ASC device possesses an outstanding cycling stability of 93.7% retention of the initial capacitance after 6000 cycles and three ASC devices connected in series can light up a LED bulb for 15 min. Our results manifest that these core-shell structure MgCo2O4@NiMn-LDH nanocomposites could envision huge potential application in energy storage devices.
