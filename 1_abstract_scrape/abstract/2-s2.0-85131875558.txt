As a naturally ordered porous material, wood has many unique advantages in the field of energy storage. After carbonization, it can be directly loaded with active materials to form a self-supporting electrode material without a conductive agent and binder. Here, carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays are grown in wood tracheids by chemical vapor deposition, and nickel-cobalt sulfide (NCS) nanosheets are deposited on CNTs by electrochemical deposition to build self-supporting electrodes. CNTs are similar to the inflorescence axis to distribute nutrients, which is an excellent passage for electron transportation; NCS nanosheets, similar to Sophora flowers, exhibit better electrochemical properties after compounding with CNTs. The composite electrode based on NCS and CNTs in a carbonized wood slice (CWS) achieves an excellent specific capacity of 8.62 F cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2. The all-solid-state hybrid supercapacitor assembled with NCS/CNT@CWS as the cathode and CNT@CWS as the anode expresses a high specific capacitance of 0.85 F cm-2 at 5 mA cm-2, and the capacitance is retained at 92.86% even after 10,000 cycles.
