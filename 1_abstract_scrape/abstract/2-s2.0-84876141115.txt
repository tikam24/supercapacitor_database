This paper presents the integration of the Fuel Cell (FC) and the SuperCapacitors (SC) in the distributed energy generation system such as the transport applications. This proposal is due to the present trend in the transport applications, knowing that the major drawback for these applications is the energetic autonomy problem. In this context, using the Fuel Cell and the SuperCapacitors with a performing energy management method is a promising solution to improve the energetic performances of the system. This paper presents the load's demand sharing between the SC and the FC in the traction situations. The proposed control method is implemented in the PIC18F4431 microcontroller for the reduced scale experimental test bench management. Through some experimental results, the authors present an improved energy management method for the transport applications during the tractions situations. Â© 2012 IEEE.
