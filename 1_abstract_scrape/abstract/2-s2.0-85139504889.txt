Constructing self-supporting porous electrode material with abundant electrochemical active sites can effectively improve the energy storage capacity of supercapacitors. Herein, a novel electrode material (NCS@Co-ZIF/NF) is developed by depositing zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (Co-ZIF) on nickel foams (NF), which is adopted as a precursor (Co-ZIF/NF) to electrodeposit nickel-cobalt sulfides (NCS). The nanosheet arrays with cross-porous structures provide NCS@Co-ZIF/NF with excellent electrochemical characteristics, including a high specific capacity of 144.4 mAh g−1 at the current density of 1 mA cm−2, 60.5% capacity retention at 50 mA cm−2, and superb long-term cycle stability. Furthermore, NCS@Co-ZIF/NF//AC hybrid supercapacitor is fabricated by using NCS@Co-ZIF/NF as positive electrodes and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrodes, which exhibits a high energy density of 33.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 145 W kg−1.
