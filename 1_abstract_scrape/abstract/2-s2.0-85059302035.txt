In this study, cathodic electrodeposition of manganese oxide onto reduced graphene oxide paper is carried out to prepare flexible and binder-free electrodes for electrochemical capacitors. Effects of electrodeposition potential and the amount of deposited mass on the electrochemical performance are examined. Hausmannite phase manganese oxide coated electrodes exhibit promising performance in charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry measurements with specific capacitance of 546 F g−1 at current density of 0.5 A g−1 and 308 F g−1 at scan rate of 1 mV s−1, respectively. During potential cycling, phase transformation of Mn3O4 to mixed-valent MnOx is observed. Consequently, MnOx nanostructures on self-standing reduced graphene oxide electrodes have 154% capacitance retention at 10000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry.
