The rod shape WO3–V2O5 hybrid nanocomposites were prepared by microwave assisted wet chemical route. The electrochemical investigations of as-prepared composites were carried in two electrolytes such as KOH and H2SO4 for comparison. Their maximum capacitance was calculated as 44 F/g for WO3 and 173 F/g for WO3–V2O5 composites in KOH electrolyte and its efficiency is 100% up to 5000 cycles and its capacitance retention is ∼126% in KOH electrolyte. In H2SO4 electrolyte, the specific capacitance of WO3 was recorded as 246 F/g and WO3–V2O5 showed poor performance such as less than 12 F/g.
