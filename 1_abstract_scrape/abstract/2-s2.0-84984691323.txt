We have developed an in situ facile surface oxidation method to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical ball of yarn-like CuO microstructures on copper foam, which can be directly used as a long-life binder-free electrode for supercapacitors. The electrochemical results demonstrated that this CuO microstructures exhibited a specific capacitance of 762.55 mF cmâˆ’2, excellent cycling stability (98.11% retention after 20000 cycles) and good rate capability (81.5% retention upon increasing the current density by 10 times). These features will make ball of yarn-like CuO microstructures attractive for high-performance supercapacitors.
