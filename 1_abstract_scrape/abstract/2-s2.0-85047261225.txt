For potential applications in supercapacitors, Graphene oxide - Vanadium oxide structures exhibit high capacitance performance. In this study, GO was synthesized by Hummers Method and coated on substrate materials. Then, thin film supercapacitors glass/GO/VO, PMMA/GO/VO, FTO/ GO/VO and ITO/ GO/VO were fabricated successfully by chemical bath deposition method (CBD). Structural characterizations were investigated by SEM, XRD, FTIR, UV-VIS and AFM. I-V and CS-V characteristics were investigated and energy densities were calculated at voltage range (from -0.2 to 1.2 V) at scanning potential 25, 50, 75 and 100 mV/s. At the scanning rate of 25 mV/s, the maximum capacitance values ​​for glass/GO/VO, PMMA/GO/VO, FTO/GO/VO and ITO/GO/VO thin film supercapacitors structures were 880 F/g, 806.6 F/g, 949.6 F/g and 563.2 F/g; and the energy intensities were calculated as 85.4 W h/kg, 44.8 W h/kg, 15.78 W h/kg, 23.4 W h/kg, respectively.
