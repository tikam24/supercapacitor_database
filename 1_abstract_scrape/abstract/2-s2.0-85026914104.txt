Honeycomb-like MnO2 nanospheres were synthesized using stainless steel substrates by a facile chemical bath deposition method. The obtained nanospheres were about 200–400 nm in diameter and consisted of porous ultrathin nanosheets. Honeycomb-like MnO2 nanospheres exhibited a high specific capacitance of 240 F g−1 and 87.1% capacitance retention after 1000 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. These remarkable electrochemical results imply great potential for applications of the honeycomb-like MnO2 nanospheres in supercapacitors.
