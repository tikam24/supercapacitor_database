All High-performance flexible electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are highly desirable as a result of the ever-increasing demands for stretchable electronics. In this work, an effective two-step strategy contain surface and structural modulation and hydrothermal method is developed to grow cooper sulfides onto a highly active surface with pores and numerous functional oxygenic groups. Arising from rough surface and increased active sites, the as-prepared activated loosen cooper sulfides coated electrochemical modified carbon cloths (CuS@ECC) electrode not only achieves a large capacitance (410 F cm-2 at 1 mA cm-2) and fast kinetics but also shows excellent cycling durability (maintain 95% initial capacitance after 3000 cycles). This dual modification strategy may throw light on the rational design of new generation advanced composited electrodes for high-performance flexible supercapacitors.
