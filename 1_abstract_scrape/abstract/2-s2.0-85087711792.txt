The paper presents the study and analysis of rural microgrid in Hariharpurgadhi, Nepal and the proposed laboratory-based model on a 'Hybrid Energy storage for a Microgrid. A hybrid energy system comprises more than one type of energy storage system. The paper presents the model of a hybrid energy storage system using a lead-acid battery and supercapacitors for a rural microgrid that can resolve the issues of energy as well as the instantaneous power of the microgrid. Supercapacitors have a significantly lower energy density and a higher power density compared to batteries which are sufficient to provide high current for a short duration of time-solving the issues to run water pumping motors and agricultural mills in microgrid areas.
