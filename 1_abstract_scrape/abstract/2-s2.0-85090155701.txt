In this work, an electrospray deposition (ESD) technique is applied to fabricate binder-free porous 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tx) electrodes for supercapacitor applications. As a result of the crumpling of MXene flakes induced by the capillary force during drying, a porous structure is formed between MXene flakes within the electrode which leads to the formation of channels for rapid ion-diffusion. Together with binder-free networks of highly electrical conductive MXene sheets, these ion diffusion channels greatly improve the rate capability of the electrospray MXene electrode. Cyclic voltammetry measurements show that micron-thickness electrodes retain their capacitive rectangular-shaped curves even at a very high scan rate of 10 000 mV s−1 in KOH electrolyte. A specific capacitance as high as 400 F g−1 is also recorded in H2SO4 electrolyte and this high specific capacitance maintains 85% of its value when the scan rate is increased to 1000 mV s−1. Furthermore, the electrospray MXene electrode shows good cycle stability in H2SO4 without a binder. About 90% of the capacitance is maintained after 10 000 charge–discharge cycles at a current density of 15 A g−1. All of these results show that the ESD MXene electrodes are a promising candidate for supercapacitor applications that require both high capacitance and enhanced rate capability.
