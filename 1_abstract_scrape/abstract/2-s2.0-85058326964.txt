Two-dimensional (2D) NiSe 2 nanosheets with porous ultrathin structure and selenium vacancies (NiSe 2 PNS vac ) are synthesized via plasma-assisted dry exfoliation for supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the NiSe 2 PNS vac is 466 F g -1 in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is much higher than those of NiSe 2 ultrathin nanosheeets (328 F g -1 ) and NiSe 2 particles (251 F g -1 ). After 1000 cycles, the specific capacitance of the NiSe 2 PNS vac can be well-maintained, indicating its high cycling stability. The superior performance arose from its high conductivity, short electrolyte diffusion distance, and large specific surface area.
