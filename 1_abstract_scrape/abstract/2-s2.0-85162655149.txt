In order to achieve high energy density and power density requirements of the on-board energy storage system, batteries and supercapacitors are combined into a hybrid energy storage system. This combination can allow the on-board hybrid energy storage system to inherit the advantages of battery and supercapacitor to improve the overall performance. A distributed energy storage topology is used to improve the reliability of the energy storage system. Based on the above objectives, this paper proposes a hybrid energy system design method, and verifies the effectiveness of the control in the simulation.
