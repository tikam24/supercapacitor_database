Recently, the extraction of energy from the incoming waves has taken more importance in the energy generation based on renewable resources. However, most of the attention has been directed towards the Power-Take-Off systems more than in the interaction between several generating units. Consequently, in this work, there are presented and carefully analysed a novel topology of Interconnected Wave-Energy Converters (IWECs) and its associated control system. A representative set of data of a real wave frequency and height variation from the South Uist island, in Scotland, and a proof-of-concept simulation show that the energy requirements of the proposed IWEC are lower than those required for individual WECs.
