In this work, solid-state supercapacitors with ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte and MnO2 electrodes were fabricated and characterized. The MnO2 electrode was prepared by ultra-short pulsed electrochemical deposition over flexible graphite substrates. The ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte was prepared by immobilizing ionic liquid BMIBF4 with PVdFHFP. The electrochemical performance of the solid-state supercapacitor was evaluated by three electrochemical characterization techniques including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CV measurements were conducted at two different voltage ranges showing typical capacitive character evidenced from the nearly rectangular shape. Charge-discharge analysis showed specific energy and specific power values of 1.27 Wh kg-1 and 0.292 kW kg-1, respectively. EIS analysis confirmed the capacitive character of the device and produced an areal capacitance density of 39.68 mF cm-2 (equivalent to a specific capacitance of 36.68 F g-1). The presence of MnO2 in the electrodes was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy with two major peaks observed at 550 cm-1 and 630 cm-1.
