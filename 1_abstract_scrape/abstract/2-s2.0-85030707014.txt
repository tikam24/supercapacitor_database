A ternary Ni1+xFe2-xS4-graphene-2D-MoSe2 (Ni1+xFe2-xS4-g-MoSe2) nanocomposite was designed and fabricated through a facile two-step method. Well-dispersed Ni1+xFe2-xS4 nanoparticles on graphene sheets were achieved using a hydrothermal method followed by coating with MoSe2 nanosheets using in situ adsorption. The synergistic effect of the three components present in Ni1+xFe2-xS4-g-MoSe2 yielded enhanced electrochemical properties in terms of high specific capacitance reaching up to 2108 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1, with capacity retention of 93.3% after 4000 cycles at the high charge-discharge current density of 5 A g-1. These outstanding capacitance features were mainly attributed to the unique Ni1+xFe2-xS4-g-MoSe2 nanostructure, allowing easy access to the pseudocapacitive species and fast ion/electron transfer. Overall, the prepared 3D nanocomposite is promising as an electrode material for advanced supercapacitors.
