Due to the unique characteristics, tremendous research attention has been attracted by semiconductor nanoparticles in the recent decades. Wide studies are undertaken for studying the particle size efficiently. The biological, chemical and physical properties of semiconductor nanoparticles are enhanced significantly by decreasing the particle size from micrometer to nanometer scale. Among them, zinc oxide is a versatile semiconductor material with superior electronic transport capabilities, robust optical transparency, relatively huge surface area to volume ratio, bulky exciton binding energy (60 meV) at room temperature and wide band gap (3.37 eV). Graphene is considered to be the parent of all carbon materials. It is denoted as a two-dimensional layered hexagonal lattice of sp2 bonded carbon atoms that are crowded in a honeycomb crystal lattice. This work has been carried out to explore the electrochemistry of few layered graphene/zinc oxide nanocomposites. The morphology and size of the composites were characterized by using Transmission Electron Microscopy and Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy. The electrochemical behavior of the prepared nanocomposites was studied by using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry. The obtained materials were tested as electrodes in supercapacitors. The graphene based ZnO nanocomposites exhibit enhanced specific capacitance when compared with pure ZnO samples.
