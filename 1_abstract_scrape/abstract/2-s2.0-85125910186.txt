Aqueous supercapacitors show advantages of high safely, prolonged lifespan, and low cost, etc. but there have never been commercial market products, nor quantitative investigation of practical pouch devices of aqueous supercapacitors. Herein, to achieve their lab-scale to real-life manufacture, a unique MoOx for supercapacitor use is constructed by a hydrothermal and annealing strategy suitable for industrialization, which plays three key functions, including precisely adjusted interlayer spacing, conductive flexible graphite carbon and abundant oxygen vacancies. As a result, the as-synthesized electrode yields an ultra-high specific capacitance of 717 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and ultra-long cycling durability with no obvious capacitive loss even after 100 000 cycles. Realistically, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (MoOx-HDA-3//MnO2) exhibits extraordinary energy density of 78.2 Wh kg−1, superior to many advanced supercapacitors reported to date. We have fabricated pouch devices, which can successfully run 3C products such as tablets and smartphones, and maintain stable electrochemical performance even after heavy strikes, fires, and pressures. Quantitative investigation results confirm that the pouch device delivers an excellent specific capacitance of 74.7 F g−1 and a high energy density of 41.5 Wh kg−1. This work enhances the confidence of pushing aqueous supercapacitors to realistic energy storage market.
