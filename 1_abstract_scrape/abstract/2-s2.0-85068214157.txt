Transition metal sulfides such as Ni–Co sulfides are promising electrode materials for supercapacitors owing to their advantageous electrical conductivity. Current approaches for the synthesis of Ni–Co sulfides normally involve wet chemical sulfurization. In this work, we demonstrate a facile method for synthesizing CoxNi1-xS2 (0 < x < 1) by solid-state sulfurization of Ni–Co layered double hydroxides (Ni–Co LDHs) at a lower temperature (300 °C). The CoxNi1-xS2 is found to retain the original porous morphological structure of Ni–Co LDHs which consists of hierarchical flower-like nanosheets. This material demonstrates much enhanced electrochemical properties. The specific capacitance of the as-prepared CoxNi1-xS2 nanosheets is 1622.4 F g−1 (811.2 C g−1) at a current density of 1 A g−1, which is 50% higher than the capacitance of the pristine Ni–Co LDHs (specific capacitance: 1040.4 F g−1) at the same discharge current density. Even at a large discharge current density of 20 A g−1, the CoxNi1-xS2 still shows specific capacitance of 1220 F g−1, which is nearly 3 times higher compared to the Ni–Co LDHs. Electrochemical stability test shows that the CoxNi1-xS2 maintains 69% capacitance retention after 2000 charge/discharge cycles. This work demonstrates that Ni–Co sulfides possess superior intrinsic electrochemical properties to Ni–Co LDHs. Importantly, the in-situ solid-state sulfurization annealing process is a facile and viable approach for large-scale synthesis of high-performance Ni–Co–S materials.
