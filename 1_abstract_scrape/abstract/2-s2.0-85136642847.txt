This investigation is motivated by increasing interest in the development of magnetically ordered pseudocapacitors (MOPC), which exhibit interesting magnetocapacitive effects. Here, advanced pseudocapacitive properties of magnetic CuFe2O4 nanoparticles in negative potential range are reported, suggesting that CuFe2O4 is a promising MOPC and advanced negative electrode material for supercapacitors. A high capacitance of 2.76 F cm−2 is achieved at a low electrode resistance in a relatively large potential window of 0.8 V. The cyclic voltammograms and galvanostatic charge–discharge data show nearly ideal pseudocapacitive behavior. Good electrochemical performance is achieved at a high active mass loading due to the use of chelating molecules of ammonium salt of purpuric acid (ASPA) as a co-dispersant for CuFe2O4 nanoparticles and conductive multiwalled carbon nanotube (MCNT) additives. The adsorption of ASPA on different materials is linked to structural features of ASPA, which allows for different interaction and adsorption mechanisms. The combination of advanced magnetic and pseudocapacitive properties in a negative potential range in a single MOPC material provides a platform for various effects related to the influence of pseudocapacitive/magnetic properties on magnetic/pseudocapacitive behavior.
