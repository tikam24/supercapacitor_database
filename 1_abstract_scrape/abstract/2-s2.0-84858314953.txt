Polyaniline/Graphene composite (PANIGNS) was synthesized via in situ polymerization method. XRD and SEM results indicated that the polyaniline could uniformly adsorb on the graphene surface and prevent the agglomeration of the graphene sheets. The composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. A specific capacitance of 688F/g at current density of 1A/g was achieved in 1M KOH solution. The capacitance retention of 77.3% was acquired after 1000cycles at current density of 10A/g. Â© (2012) Trans Tech Publications.
