Co(OH)2 hollow nanostructures including cube, octahedron and flower are delicately tailored via a simple and fast one-step Cu2O template etching method. The as-prepared materials were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), N2 adsorption-desorption and electrochemical methods and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In particular, the supercapacitive behaviors of the as-prepared materials were investigated to explore relation of capacitance versus nanostructure. Results indicate that the as-prepared Co(OH)2 samples inherit the size and shape of the Cu2O templates but with an inside hollow, and the differently nanostructured Co(OH)2 exhibits different capacitive behaviors. Among various morphologies, the flower Co(OH)2 has the largest specific capacitance of 1350 F/g, while octahedron Co(OH)2 has the smallest one of 986.4 F/g. This is mainly because the flower Co(OH)2 not only has the largest available surface area, but also offers the fast interfacial electron transfer for higher pseudocapacitance and enhanced electrolyte ion diffusion rate for high power density, which is supported by both theoretical calculation, measured BET data and ac impedance measurements. This work may provide a vivid example to rationally design a nanostructure and further explore its fundamental insights for high performance supercapacitors.
