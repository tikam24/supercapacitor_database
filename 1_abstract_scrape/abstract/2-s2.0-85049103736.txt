Exploring electrode materials with high energy density is crucial for the application of electrochemical energy storage. Herein, we innovatively synthesized frisbee-shaped architecture of h-WO3·nH2O by a simple hydrothermal method, which is assembled by nanorods of ∼80 nm in diameter, with structural water storing in the open hexagonal tunnels via a template-free strategy for supercapacitor application. This electrode material possesses high specific capacitance of 391 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, superior rate capacity of 298 F g−1 at 10 A g−1, and almost 100% capacitance retention after 2000 cycles at 10 A g−1, which can be ascribed to its unique hierarchical micro/nanostructure and water chains within the channels of crystalline h-WO3. The unique self-assembled frisbee-shaped micro/nanostructure can avoid further aggregation of nanosized building blocks and allow sufficient ions accessible surface, beneficial to increasing deliverable capacity. Notably, the presence of structural water also offers fast hydrated protons transport pathway, resulting in high capacity and good stability at high rate.
