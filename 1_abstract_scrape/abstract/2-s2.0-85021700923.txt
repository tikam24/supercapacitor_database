A novel three-dimensional (3D) porous flower-like NiCo2O4 electrode is reported. The electrode is constructed by homogeneous chemical co-precipitation involving the in situ growth of ternary nickel cobaltite nanosheets on a Ni foam, and a high temperature heat treatment. Field emission electron microscopy (FESEM) demonstrate that the porous flower-like structure is made up of uniform thin nanosheets with thickness of about 10 nm. Electrochemical studies reveal that the porous flower-like electrode exhibits excellent supercapacitor behavior with a high initial specific capacitance of 1046 F g−1 (at 1 A g−1) and stable cycling performance.
