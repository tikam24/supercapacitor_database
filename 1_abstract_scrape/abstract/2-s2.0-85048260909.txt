Herein a porous carbon with a high content of nitrogen, high surface area and high degree of graphitization was prepared by pyrolysing a cheap and abundant biopolymer chitin in the presence of both FeCl3 and ZnCl2. It was found the electrochemical performance is significantly dependent on the carbonization temperature. The 1000 Â°C-treated carbon exhibited high electrocatalytic activity as catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), showing a four-electron oxygen reduction pathway with an onset potential of 0.978 V (against reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). The porous carbon also exhibited a capacitance of 130 F/g at 0.5A/g and excellent rate performance as electrode for supercapacitors. These results are attributed to the high surface area, as well as the high degree of graphitization which endows the as-prepared carbon with a high electrical conductivity.
