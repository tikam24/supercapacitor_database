Porous electrodes of an activated carbon material have been modified by bivariant mechanical tuning (optimization of electrode density and thickness). Features of this method have been described in detail; the electrochemical behavior of porous carbon electrodes of varying density (0.35, 0.55, and 0.75 g/cm3) in a wide thickness range (60–1400 μm) has been studied. In addition, the possibility of using the modified electrodes in high-power symmetric and high-energy asymmetric supercapacitors has been analyzed; an additional criterion for the selection of the electrodes for the supercapacitors has been proposed.
