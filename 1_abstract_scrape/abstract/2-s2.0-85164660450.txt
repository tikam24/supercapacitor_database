Supercapacitors (SC) are among the most promising energy storage technologies due to their great properties including strong conductivity and excellent surface area with porosity. An interesting aspect of SC is high energy capacity, shorter storage period and has longer lifetime. The development of sulfide-based electrode materials is an advanced research field in energy storage applications. However, due only few studies were reported due to its poor electrical conductivity, low stability and limited storage performances. Here, we report a one step hydrothermal technique to synthesis pristine and heterostructure metal sulfide with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based nanocomposite for supercapacitor application. The synthesised samples of NiS2, MoS2, Ni-Mo-S, and Ni-Mo-S/rGO were characterized using advanced characterization techniques. The ternary metal sulfides was influenced the high crystalline structure and obtained high aspect ratio of nanorod in Ni-Mo-S/rGO. The resulting electrochemical behavior of rGO anchored Ni-Mo-S nanorods showed excellent capacitance retention and cycling stability. According to the electrochemical tests, the Ni-Mo-S/rGO nanocomposite electrode exhibited exceptional performance, with a specific capacitance (Cs) of 1480 F/g at a current density of 3 mA gâˆ’1, and a capacitance retention rate of 92% after 3000 cycles. This research work is step towards developing of Ni-Mo-S and rGO based nanocomposite electrodes to improve the supercapacitor device performance.
