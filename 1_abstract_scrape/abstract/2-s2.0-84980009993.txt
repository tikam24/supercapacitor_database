A computerized simple chemical spray pyrolysis technique was used to prepare nanostructured α-Fe2O3 thin films from nonaqueous medium. These nanostructures were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and optical measurements. From the XRD study formation of hematite phase of α-Fe2O3 is confirmed. The particle sizes of α-Fe2O3 ranged from 43 to 47 nm. The optical energy bandgap of the film decreases with increase in molarity of FeCl3 solution. The obtained energy bandgap values are in the range of 1.86–2.14 eV. The electrochemical properties of the Fe2O3 were studied using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement by a three-electrode system. The α-Fe2O3 electrodes exhibited a specific capacitance as high as 539 Fg−1 in 2 M aqueous KOH electrolyte at 5 mV s−1 sweep rate within the operated potential window (−1.1 to 0.2 V).
