In this study, we demonstrated a supercapacitor-integrated strain sensor system using three types of iron(III)-alkylbenzenesulfonate-based oxidizing agents, so as to induce surface-treated SEBS-rGO-PPy composite films. PPy has incorporated into the SEBS-rGO film under oxidizing agent treatment by VPP. The electromechanical properties, chemical compositions, supercapacitor, and strain sensor durability performances of the composite films were examined. The composite A2 iron(III)-(4-ethylbenzenesulfonic acid surface-treated SEBS-rGO-PPy films exhibited better performance than the other two A0 (benzene sulfonic acid)-and A1 (p-toluene sulfonic acid)-based oxidants, in terms of strain sensor integrate energy storage concerts. These types of systems have good capacity retention ~95% over 5000 charge-discharge cycles. The biocompatibility studies exhibited good results for the three composites. The high-flexibility supercapacitor combined with the sensor system has the potential to be used as an energy storage system for smart electronic wearable skin-based devices.
