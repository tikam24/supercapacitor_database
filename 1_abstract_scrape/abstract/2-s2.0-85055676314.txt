Compared to electrochemical supercapacitors, electrostatic supercapacitors have higher power density and reliability but energy density is too low. In the present study, the preparation and electrical properties of high dielectric-constant CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) films were investigated for the high energy-density MEMS electrostatic supercapacitor. Firstly, CCTO films were synthesized at different sintering temperatures (700, 800, 900℃) by a sol-gel method on silicon substrate. The morphology, phase identification and crystallization of CCTO films were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). Results show that the crystallinity of the CCTO films is the best at the sintering temperature of 800℃. Then, the current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements of the CCTO films were performed on a metal-insulator-semiconductor capacitor structure. The maximum threshold voltage and energy density of the films are 47 V and 3.2 J/cm3, respectively. Meanwhile, the phenomenon of dielectric charging with high dielectric-constant in CCTO films was studied for the first time and the influence of dielectric charging on the performance of electrostatic supercapacitors was analyzed.
