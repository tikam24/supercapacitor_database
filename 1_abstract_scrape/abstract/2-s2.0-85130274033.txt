Layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials are promising candidates to achieve high specific capacities of supercapacitors (SCs). However, their electrical conductivities are low, restricting their SC performance. Herein, a one-step solvothermal technique is employed to synthesize a hybrid material of nickel‑manganese LDH/holey reduced graphene oxide (NiMn-LDH/hrGO). The addition of hrGO improves the conductivity and surface area of the NiMn-LDH/hrGO electrode. It thus exhibits a specific capacity of as high as 302.0 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and excellent capacity retention even after 2000 cycles. In an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC), the NiMn-LDH/hrGO electrode is assembled with a Bi(OH)3/hrGO electrode. This ASC exhibits a specific capacity of 237.6 C g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, cycling stability of 80.5% after 2000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g−1, and an energy density of as high as 59.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 901.5 W kg−1. The proposed method handles the challenges posed by electrochemical capacitors and paves a way to ensemble high performance SCs.
