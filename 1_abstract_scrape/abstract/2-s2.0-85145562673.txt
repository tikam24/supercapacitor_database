As the demand for supercapacitors in various flexible and wearable energy sectors grows, reliability becomes a key aspect to consider. We report the fabrication and reliability study of printed, flexible organic electrolyte-based supercapacitors. The supercapacitor can be operated over a wide temperature range from −40 ◦C to 100 ◦C with excellent repeatability and stability. Thermal shock tests led to a defect in the electrode layer’s microstructure, which reduces the supercapacitor performance. Cyclic bending experiments show that the device has excellent robustness, mechanical flexibility, long-term electrical stability, and 100% capacitance retention up to 10 000 bending cycles with a bending radius of 0.41 cm. Thus, the device is suitable for wearable and flexible energy storage applications over a wide temperature range.
