A series of Sr2+-doped Li3×La2/3-x□1/3–2×TiO3 (LLT), i.e., Li0.33SrxLa0.56–2/3×□0.11–1/3×TiO3 (LSLT, □ represents vacancy), materials were synthesized and investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurement methods. Sr2+-doped LLT materials exhibited an increase in electrical conductivity when the doping content was ca. 0.25 mol% in our investigation. It was found that the doped elements were uniformly distributed, and no impurity phase was detected in the bulk materials. In addition, the improved electrical conductivity was probably caused by the proper enlargement of the Li+ migration path when Sr2+ ions, with a larger ionic radius, replaced La3+ ions and changed the Li+-La3+ bond after doping. The solid-state ionic supercapacitor, using-doped LSLT as an electrolyte, showed a capacitance of 0.48 mF g−1 for a 0.25 mol% Sr2+-doped sample.
