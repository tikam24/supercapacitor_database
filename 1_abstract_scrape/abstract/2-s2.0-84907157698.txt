Uniform 3D flower-like MoS2nanostructures were successfully synthesized through a facile two-step hydrothermal method and were applied as electrode materials for high-performance electrochemical capacitors. Galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements showed that the MoS2electrode had a specific capacitance of 168 F g-1at a current density of 1 A g-1and it retained 92.6% of capacitance even after 3000 cycles. Furthermore, the as-prepared MoS2nanostructures were used as an adsorbent in Rhodamine B aqueous solution, and the maximum adsorption capacity toward Rhodamine B was about 49.2 mg g-1. This journal is
