Electrochemical studies, including sensors, biosensors, fuel cells, supercapacitors, batteries, corrosion require very much catalytic modifications upon the high costs of the noble metals or nanomaterials. Besides, because the worlds energy source crisis reached very high levels, people tend to find new routes for green synthesis and application of biosourced materials. Chitosan, cellulose, wool, silk, pectin, and many of the biocomposite and bioplastic produced by nature are less hazardous, renewable, sustainable, innovative, low cost, and carbon-neutral, preferred as immobilization matrix and/or as a source as biomass for nanomaterial productions or used as the main component of an electrochemical system, such as a membrane in a fuel cell. It is known that materials originating from biological materials are less harmful to nature in different ways compared to fossil fuels. In addition, it has been reported in many studies that biomass-based biocomposites can be replaced by many materials produced with petroleum-based resources. In this sense, the chapter includes electrode modifications or the electrochemical applications of biocomposites and bioplastics.
