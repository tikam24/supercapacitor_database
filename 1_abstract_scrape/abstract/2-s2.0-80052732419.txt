ZnO nanopowders have been synthesised using the spray pyrolysis method. XRD analysis reveals the powder samples to be of crystallite size 19nm. SEM images indicate petal-like formation for the zinc oxide powder. The electrochemical properties have been studied using cyclic-voltammetric and chrono-potentiometric techniques. The specific capacitance of the ZnO electrode in the presence of 2M KOH electrolyte was 365F/g at a scan rate of 5mV/s. The decrease in the specific capacitance of 22 has been observed after 1200 cycles. Â© 2011 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.
