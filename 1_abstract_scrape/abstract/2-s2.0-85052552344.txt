Hybrid supercapacitors (HSCs) are novel, promising devices having features of both batteries and supercapacitors. Herein, we report HSCs (Li-HSC and Na-HSC in a uniform system) based on an interlayer-expanded MoS2/rGO composite that show ultrahigh energy density and power density as well as superior cycle stability. The 3D network-structured interlayer-expanded MoS2/rGO nanocomposite (3D-IEMoS2@G) was synthesized and employed as the anode. Because the 3D architecture of the graphene skeleton frame delivered sufficient charges and the highly interlayer-expanded MoS2 achieved fast ion diffusion, the as-prepared composite exhibited excellent performance as the anode material for both LIBs and SIBs (1600 mAh g− 1 at 100 mA g−1 for the LIB; 580 mAh g−1 at 100 mAh g−1 and 320 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1). When paired with nitrogen-doped hierarchically porous 3D graphene (N-3DG), the obtained Na-HSC surpassed Li-HSC in a uniform system, showing an excellent performance of 140 Wh kg− 1 at 630 W kg− 1, 43 Wh kg− 1 at an ultrahigh power density of 103 kW kg− 1 (charge finished within 1.5 s) and no distinct capacity attenuation after over 10000 cycles. Thus, a quantitative kinetic analysis was performed to understand the synergistic effect of the two electrodes and the resulting effect of ions in the hybrid supercapacitors and to further pave a general path for fabricating high-performance HSCs.
