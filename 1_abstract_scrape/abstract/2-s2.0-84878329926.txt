Vanadium pentoxide thin films of various thicknesses have been prepared by sol-gel spin coating method on glass and conducting substrates. X-ray diffraction analysis reveals crystalline nature for the 6-12 layered films (170-310 nm). The crystalline films indicate a preferential orientation of the crystallites along the (200) plane. FTIR studies of the V2O 5 xerogel show the presence of V-O-V and V= O bond confirming the formation of V2O5. The scanning electron microscope images reveal formation of nanostructures in the 6-12 layered films. Optical absorption studies indicate a band gap of 2.2-2.5 eV. Pseudocapacitance behaviour of the V2O5 films was studied using cyclic voltammetric technique and impedance analysis. V2O5 films of thickness 202 nm (8 layers) exhibit a specific capacitance of 346 F/g at a scan rate of 5 mV/s. Â© 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.
