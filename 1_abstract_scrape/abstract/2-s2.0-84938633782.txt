Metal nitride nanoarrays are attractive to electrochemical energy storage and in this work, hierarchical mesoporous manganese oxide (MnOx) nanoflakes and nitrided TiO2 nanorod arrays (NTNA) are prepared on carbon fiber paper (CFP) by hydrothermal synthesis and electrodeposition. The MnOx/NTNA/CFP electrode delivers outstanding electrochemical performance such as high areal capacitance of 327 mF cm-2 at a current density of 0.25 mA cm-2 and good cycling stability with 96% retention after 5000 cycles. Compared to the MnOx/TiO2/CFP and MnOx/CFP electrodes, the MnOx/NTNA/CFP electrode possesses better electrochemical properties such as higher areal capacitance, better electrochemical activity, and cycling life. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the nitrided TiO2 nanorod arrays with higher conductivity offering low electrochemical impedance and fast ion/electron transfer. The MnOx/NTNA/CFP electrode is a promising candidate in high-performance supercapacitor applications.
