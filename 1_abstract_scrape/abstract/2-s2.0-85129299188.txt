Conventionally, an energy storage system and two Voltage Source Converters (VSCs) are required to combine the operation of Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS). The DSTATCOM's VSC can compensate for the source voltage sag and swell. However, it cannot compensate for the voltage interruption. On the other hand, the VSC of the UPS can compensate for the source voltage interruption, but it cannot compensate for the voltage sag and swell. This paper proposes a control algorithm that uses a single VSC and a battery–supercapacitor energy storage system to function as DSTATCOM and UPS. The VSC and the battery–supercapacitor energy storage system mitigates the sag, swell, and interruption of the source voltages. Under the normal source voltages, this system mitigates the load current harmonics, unbalance, and reactive power. The proposed control algorithm uses a State of Charge (SoC) based scheme to control the battery–supercapacitor energy storage system. This control scheme protects the battery and supercapacitors from overcharging. Also, it eliminates the ripples in the load angle and increases the battery cycle life. The efficacy of the proposed control scheme has been verified through the experimental setup of the VSC with the battery–supercapacitor energy storage system in the laboratory.
