Sandwich-like, hetero-structured Co 3 O 4 /CNTs were prepared by a simple hydrothermal and self-assembly process. The CNTs insert into layered Co 3 O 4 sheets and ensure fast electron transfer between the Co 3 O 4 sheets for a faradaic reaction close to the electroactive sites and effectively inhibit the deformation and collapse of the pseudocapacitance material in the cyclic process. The well-ordered complex delivers a specific capacitance of 562.22 F⋅g −1 at a current density of 1 A⋅g −1 ; and in a three-electrode system with regard to hold 96% of the primitive specific capacitance after 5000 cycles. An asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with Co 3 O 4 /CNTs as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode, the device shows a high energy density of 157.5 W⋅h⋅kg −1 at a power density of 2520 W⋅kg −1 .
