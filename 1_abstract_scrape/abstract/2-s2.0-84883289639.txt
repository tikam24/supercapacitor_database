A three-dimensional finite element thermal model for the stackable supercapacitor is built and tested at 3A constant current in charge-discharge process, and then we analyze the inner temperature distribution field. It can be concluded that the maximum temperature appears in core. The maximum temperature will rise to 34.5°C after 30 cycles and 37.6°C in steady state. Cooling measurements should be taken when the current is 5A and the maximum temperature exceeds 53.2°C. This paper aims at investigating the relationship between the maximum temperature and charge-discharge current, and provides thoughts for the study on the inner temperature distribution field and structure design in working process of stackable supercapacitors. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
