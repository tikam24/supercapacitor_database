Honeycomb graphene-polyaniline (HG-PANI) nanocomposites are synthesized through a facile electrostatic self-assembly approach, and the obtained material is characterized as the electrode for supercapacitor applications. HG-PANI comprises of fibrous polyaniline embedded within honeycomb graphene nanosheets, preventing the stacking of nanosheets and suppressing the volume expansion of polyaniline. In the nanocomposite, nitrogen (≈8 at%) exists in the form of quinonimine ( = N-), amine (-NH-) and positively charged nitrogen cation radical (N+), and the latter effectively enhances both the electronic conductivity of graphene and the surface activity of the electrode improving the capacitive performance of the nanocomposite. HG-PANI exhibits a mesoporous structure with an average pore size of 3.78 nm and a specific surface area of 40 m2 g−1 providing sufficient channels for the ion transport. The electrical conductivity of HG-PANI (80%) was measured to be 6289.31 S m−1, a 10-fold increase in electrical conductivity over the unmodified material HG. The specific capacitance of the material is measured to be 736.2 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1, 81.6% higher than that of HG without the involvement of PANI. This article reports on the simple, scalable and low-cost preparation of a honeycomb graphene-polyaniline nanocomposite, and its supercapacitor application.
