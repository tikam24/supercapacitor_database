In order to optimize the performance of supercapacitors, the capacitance of the carbon materials used as electrodes was strictly related to their pores size and also to their redox properties. Well-sized carbons have been elaborated through a template technique using mesoporous silica. For a series of template carbons, a perfect linear dependence has been found for the capacitance values versus the micropore volume determined by CO2 adsorption. The redox properties of carbons were enhanced by substituting nitrogen for carbon up to ca. 7 wt.%. For carbons with similar nanotextural characteristics, the electrochemical measurements showed a proportional increase of the specific capacitance with the nitrogen content in acidic electrolyte. For an activated carbon from polyacrylonitrile with a specific surface area of only 800 m 2 g-1, but with a nitrogen content of 7 wt.%, the capacitance reaches 160 F g-1, with very little fading during cycling.
