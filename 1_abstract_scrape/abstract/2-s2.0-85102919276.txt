Sodium manganese oxide (Na x MnO2) is supported on nickel foam (NF) substrate to prepare electroactive Na x MnO2/NF electrode material. Na x MnO2 as sodium ion pre-intercalation compound is formed through solid phase reaction of MnO2 and NaOH with optimal mole ratio of 1:2 and calcination treatment at 700 °C for 5 h. Na x MnO2 shows lower Warburg diffusion impedance and charge transfer resistance than MnO2. Na x MnO2/NF shows much higher current response than MnO2/NF due to predominant reversible redox reaction of Na x MnO2. The reversible intercalation/deintercalation of sodium ion at the deep interlayer of Na x MnO2 contributes to Faradaic capacitance. MnO2/NF and Na x MnO2/NF reveal capacitance decay from 18.5 to 4.2 F g−1 and from 133.2 to 65.7 F g−1 in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte when current density increases from 0.2 to 2.0 A g−1, indicating respective capacity retention of 22.7% and 49.3%. Na x MnO2/NF exhibits higher capacitance and better rate capacitance retention than MnO2/NF, presenting the promising supercapacitor energy storage.
