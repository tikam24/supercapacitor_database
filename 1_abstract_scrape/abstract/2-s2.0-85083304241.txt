Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have attracted great attention because of its unique properties which originate from its small dimensions. This work is the first report of ferrocenyl modified Graphene Quantum Dot (GQD-Fc) which performed as supercapacitor. In order to improve the electrode conductivity, the GQD-Fc physically mixed with Polypyrrole and obtained nanocomposite was used as electrode material. Benefiting from the high specific surface area of GQD as well as the presence of nitrogen and iron-rich contents in the synthesized nanocomposite, prepared electrodes reveal the good capacity behaviors include high mass specific capacitance of 284.01 F g−1 (2.5 A g−1), the 86% retention of initial capacitance after 5000 cycles in a three-electrode system along with the remarkable energy density (81.79 Wh kg−1) and power density (18.17 kW kg−1). Based on the obtained results, ferrocenyl modified GQD expected to be a competitive candidate for new kind of capacitive material as high-performance supercapacitor electrode.
