Carbon nanofiber (CNF) composites could be promising materials for flexible supercapacitors. However, it is still a challenge to grow uniformly active materials on the surface of fibers and maintain flexibility. Herein, Co3O4 nanoparticle-decorated CNFs have been produced through the combination of electrospinning technology and a polydopamine-assisted self-assembly strategy. The free-standing hybrid electrode exhibited a high capacitance of 418 F g−1 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH solution. In addition, the as-fabricated symmetric supercapacitors (SCs) presented excellent electrochemical performance with a capacitance of 55 F g−1, an energy density of 14.97 W h kg−1, and a power density of 5660 W kg−1. Notably, the symmetric SC device exhibited remarkable electrochemical stability and flexibility (93 % capacitance retention after 2000 cycles and 97 % after bending 100 times to 60°).
