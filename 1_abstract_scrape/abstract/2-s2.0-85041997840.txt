Conjugated donor-acceptor copolymers based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) as acceptor and thiophene-terminated oligophenylenevinylene as donor moieties (P1 and P2, respectively) were synthesized using the direct (hetero) arylation (DHAP) polymerization route. Nitrile groups were introduced at the vinylene linkage in one copolymer (P2) to fine-tune its electrochemical properties. Both polymers show π-π∗ transition in the 300-480 nm region and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from thiophene to NDI in the 500-800 nm region in the absorption spectra. P2 exhibits a blue-shifted intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band in the absorption spectrum as well as a lower reduction potential in the cyclic voltammogram compared to the analogous polymer without the nitrile substitution (P1). The two polymers were evaluated as type III supercapacitor materials by preparing composite electrodes with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and employing 0.5 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte. Their performance was compared with that of P(NDI2OD-T2) as a reference polymer. The polymer P2 based supercapacitor exhibits a specific capacitance of 124 F/g with excellent stability up to 5000 cycles with almost 100% retention of the initial capacitance in the potential window of 0.7 to 0.5 V. Compared to P2, P1 exhibits a specific capacitance of 84 F/g, while the corresponding value for the reference polymer P(NDI2OD-T2) is 61 F/g under identical conditions.
