In the present research work, layered nanocomposite of polyaniline–manganese oxide (PANI/MnO2) electrodes is synthesized using the potentiostatic electrodeposition method. The structural and morphological properties of the nanocomposite electrode materials are tested using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) techniques. The XRD analysis shows the amorphous nature of the electrode material. The FE-SEM micrographs show porous morphology. The supercapacitive properties are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, cyclic stability, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques in 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The layered nanocomposites show maximum values of specific capacitance which is 582 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1. The synergistic effect of layered nanocomposite leads to enhancement in the supercapacitive performance than the pristine electrode.
