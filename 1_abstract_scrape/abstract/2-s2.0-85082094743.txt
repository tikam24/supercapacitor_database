A supercapacitor electrode with high capacitance is mainly based on the careful design of nanostructures and the intelligent hybridization of custom active materials. Herein, we designed 3D core-shell nanoforest arrays with hierarchical structure which are directly grown on carbon cloth using a two-step bracket-hydrothermal method and electrodeposition process. Due to the advantages of large specific surface area, abundant pores and active sites, the structure of Mo-Co-Ni(nanotube)@Ni-Co(nanosheet) arrays can promote electrolyte penetration and ions diffusion, further improving the electrochemical performance. The 3D core-shell nanoforest arrays electrode shows outstanding electrochemical performance: A superb areal capacitance of 9.81 F cm-2 (1998.0 F g-1) at the current densities of 1 mA cm-2, as well as long cycle stability (after 3000 cycles maintains 85.4% of the highest capacitance value). This work may provide a promising method for design of flexible supercapacitor electrode materials.
