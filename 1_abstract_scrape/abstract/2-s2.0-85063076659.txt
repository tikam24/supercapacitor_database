Graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite has been synthesized and applied as supercapacitor electrodes. Graphene was synthesized by oxidation of graphite followed by reduction of graphite oxide to form reduced graphene oxide then transformed into graphene by reduction with NaBH4. The graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite was prepared by in situ polymerization of aniline in graphene suspension with a variation of the composition. Characterization of samples was conducted using FTIR spectrometer, XRD, and SEM. Specific capacitance was obtained from the cyclic voltammogram (CV) curve taken using the potentiostat/galvanostat. FTIR spectra shows the presence of functional groups indicating the formation of a graphene/polyaniline composite. Results of XRD analysis indicated the presence of crystal phases of graphene and polyaniline. Morphology of graphene is looked like a rather thick sheet while graphene/polyaniline nanocomposites are looked like clumps which are an incorporation of graphene and polyaniline nanoparticles. The highest specific capacitance of the supercapacitor fabricated with graphene/polyaniline electrode was 128 F/g.
