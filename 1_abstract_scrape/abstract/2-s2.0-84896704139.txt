With NaOH as precipitation agent and NiSO4 · 6H 2O as raw material, Ni(OH)2 particles were synthesized by infinite dilute method and sintered at 300 C for NiO. The synthesized NiO particles with a structure of cubic crystalline phase are well dispersed and ball-flower like with a diameter of 500 nm. The electrochemical tests show that the NiO particles have relatively high capacitance and excellent capacitive retention. The good structure and excellent performance suggest its promising application in supercapacitors. © 2014 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.
