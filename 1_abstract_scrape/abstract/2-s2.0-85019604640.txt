The present work deals with the application of two stage rate limit control for battery energy storage system under different operating modes. Energy storage systems are playing very important role in renewable power systems and microgrids. Depending on the nature of power requirement, utilization of multiple energy storage units with distinguised characteristics in terms of power and energy density is quite common in microgrids. Batteries are one of the most commonly used energy storage systems in microgrids, to support slow transients or steady state load demands. The power charge/discharge rates affects the stress levels in the battery, which in turn affects the battery life span; and its power pattern affects stored/discharge energy from the battery, which in turn affects the state of charge (SOC) of the battery. Therefore, to optimize the charge/discharge rates a two stage rate limit control scheme is proposed, and its application for different operating modes is discussed in this paper. This control scheme is verified in OPAL-RT by creating real-time control hardware in loop (CHIL) with dSPACE.
