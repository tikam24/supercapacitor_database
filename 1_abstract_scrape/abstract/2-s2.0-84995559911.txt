In order to fully utilize advantage of the complementary characteristics of hybrid energy storage system (HESS), improve the responsiveness of HESS and avoid over charging and discharging, it is necessary to study optimal coordination control of power distribution of HESS. The low-pass first order filter is adopted as the wind power smoothing method and two-level optimal coordination control method of HESS is proposed according to the different time scale. In long time scale, the filter time constant is adjusted based on fuzzy algorithm, and then the state of charge(SOC)of battery is taken as the optimization goal to complete the first level control of HESS. The second level control is aimed at keeping the SOC of supercapacitor in the active state and realizing power distribution based on power transfer control in short time scale. The effectiveness of the method is verified through the system simulation of the example.
