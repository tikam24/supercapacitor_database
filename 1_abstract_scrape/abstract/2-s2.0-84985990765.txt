In present work, we report the electrochemical supercapacitor performance Hematite α-Fe2O3 thin films prepared by spray pyrolysis from non-aqueous medium. The structural, morphological optical and electrochemical properties of the α-Fe2O3 thin films are studied. The α-Fe2O3 has shown Rhombohedral (Hematite) crystal structure. Scanning electron microscopy results reveal that the α-Fe2O3 thin films have well covered nanoporous surface. The as prepared films exhibited a direct band gap energy varying from 2.36 to 2.14 eV. The α-Fe2O3 thin films showed a maximum specific capacitance 451 F g− 1 within potential window − 1.1 to 0.2 V in aqueous 2 M KOH electrolyte. Further, α-Fe2O3 electrode based supercapacitor showed 1.3 V wide voltage window with specific energy and specific power of 45 W h kg− 1and 1.25 kW kg− 1 at 4 A g− 1 respectively. Such nanoporous α-Fe2O3 thin film with high performance may be used as a promising material for electrochemical supercapacitors.
