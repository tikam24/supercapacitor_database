Mesoporous manganese dioxide supercapcitor electrode materials were electrochemically deposited onto silicon substrates coated with Pt using triblock copolymer species (Pluronic P123 and F127) as the structure-directing agents. Deposited electrodes of manganese dioxide film were physically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and were electrochemically characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. Maximum specific capacitance (SC) values of 449 F g-1 was obtained at a scan rate of 10 mV s-1 from F127 templated mesoporous MnO2. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
