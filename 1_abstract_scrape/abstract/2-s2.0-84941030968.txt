Electrical energy storage is a persistent issue in today's era. Recent developments in this field have led to the emergence of supercapacitors which boasts higher energy and power density as compared to conventional capacitors. Since supercapacitor is mainly a pulse current device, it is therefore used wherever high current delivery for a short duration is required for electrical storage devices. It is also seen as an alternative to batteries in low end applications. Supercapacitor finds other applications in automotive subsystems and industrial automation. Various parameters related to supercapacitor such as energy density, power density and specific capacitance can be controlled by electrode and electrolyte. Supercapacitor can be fabricated into flexible forms which are essential for the development of flexible and wearable electronics. One of the methods to increase the flexibility of supercapacitor is to change the shape of electrode as per the needs of the application. It was found that the parameters of supercapacitor are affected when the shape of electrode is changed. Such changes have been studied in detail through repeated experimentation and new empirical formulae have been introduced to accommodate them.
