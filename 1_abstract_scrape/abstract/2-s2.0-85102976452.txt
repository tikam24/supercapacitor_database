Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (also known as lithium triflate) (LiTf) polymer electrolytes incorporated with different weight ratios of ionic liquid, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BmImBr), were prepared by solution casting method. Upon the addition of 50 wt% BmImBr, the ionic conductivity increases from (9.73 ± 0.04) × 10−6 S cm−1 to (1.96 ± 0.01) × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature. Besides, the ionic liquid free-polymer electrolyte obeys the Arrhenius theory which is related to thermally-activated principle. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymer electrolytes also demonstrate a decreasing trend in Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) thermogram. This decrease in Tg is mainly due to the plasticising effect of BmImBr. The Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) studies indicate complexation between the PVA, LiTf and BmImBr. The fabricated EDLC demonstrate its specific capacitance of 19.5 Fg−1, energy density of 1.4 W h kg−1 and power density of 15 kW kg−1.
