In this work, a three dimensional (3D) conductive material of activated carbon coating Copper-Cobalt Prussian Blue (PB) is synthesized and applied on sodium ion supercapacitors. The activated carbon is proved able to enhance the conductivity, prevent structural collapse during sodium ion deintercalation, reduce interstitial water in PB crystals as well as special hindrance, and improve electrochemical performance of super capacitors dramatically. It is demonstrated that a specific capacity of 90.4 F g-1 and and power density of 4.3 kW kg-1 as well as energy density of 65.1 Wh kg-1 are achieved for CuCoHCF@AC//AC device. In addition, 90% % starting value are retained for the specific capacity after 2000 cycles operation.
