In the present investigation, Ni (OH)2 microflowers were successfully deposited on a cost-effective stainless steel electrode by a simple chemical bath deposition method (CBD). The optimized deposition time and heating temperature. Potassium persulphate shows an important role as an oxidizing agent and controlled the growth of nanostructure. Deposited Ni(OH)2 shows α phase but due to persulphate ion one hydrogen removes and it converted into γ phase. The Ni(OH)2 deposited using CBD method at 2 h then heated at 100 °C temperature give better specific capacitance. For a current density of 3.0 mA cm−2, the computed highest specific capacitance becomes 669 F g−1. After 1000 cycles, electrode material shows good capacitive retention of about 78% and high coulombic efficiency of 99.3%. The impressive results proffered above indicate that Ni(OH)2 is a promising electrode material with excellent supercapacitor performance.
