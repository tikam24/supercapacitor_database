In this paper, a top-down method is used to partially hydrolyze leather to achieve a leather-based gel electrolyte, and successfully develop a leather-based all-in-one configured flexible supercapacitor. The hierarchical structure of collagen fibers effectively solves the interface problem of flexible supercapacitors, and at the same time endows the gel electrolyte with degradability and reproducibility.
