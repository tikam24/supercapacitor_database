A novel three-dimensional (3D) graphene/polyaniline nanocomposite material which is synthesized using in situ polymerization of aniline monomer on the graphene surface is reported as an electrode for supercapacitors. The morphology and structure of the material are characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical properties of the resulting materials are systematically studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current charge-discharge tests. A high gravimetric capacitance of 463 F g-1 at a scan rate of 1 mV s-1 is obtained by means of CVs with 3 mol L-1 KOH as the electrolyte. In addition, the composite material shows only 9.4% capacity loss after 500 cycles, indicating better cyclic stability for supercapacitor applications. The high specific surface area, large mesopore volume and three-dimensional nanoporous structure of 3D graphene could contribute to the high specific capacitance and good cyclic life.
