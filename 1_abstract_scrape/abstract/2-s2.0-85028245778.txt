Vertically assembled two-dimentional materials have great scientific and technological promise. In this work, altrathin atom doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was synthesised via thermal treatment of thiourea and KBr/NaBr. Free-standing manganese dioxide nanoflakes were uniformly grown on K/Na doped g-C3N4 through hydrothermal reaction. The K doped g-C3N4@ MnO2 has a specific capacitance twice higher than that of pure g-C3N4@ MnO2. This unique design brought excellent specific capacitance (375 F gâˆ’1) and cycle stability, which showed that atom doping is an effective approach to enhance electrochemical performance. In addition, the low cost, facial synthesis and small amount of addings make this strategy an optimized approach to construct g-C3N4 based electrode materials.
