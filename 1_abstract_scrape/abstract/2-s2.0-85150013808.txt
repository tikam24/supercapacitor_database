Designing new electrode structures with excellent electrochemical properties and finding facile synthesis methods are challenges for energy storage devices. Herein, we constructed a heterogeneous N-doped 2D structure of Ti3C2TX with tubular NiCo2S4 and formed a 3D hydrogel structure using graphene oxide as a binder, which could prevent the natural packing of Ti3C2TX and increase the specific surface area. This electrode combines the metallic conductivity of Ti3C2TX with the pseudocapacitance property of NiCo2S4 to achieve exceptional electrochemical performance. As a result, the electrode achieves an ultra-high specific capacitance of 517.11 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and 92.6 % capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. Moreover, a high energy density of 27.78 Wh kg−1 is obtained at a power density of 596 W kg−1. This new N-Ti3C2TX@NiCo2S4/RGO electrode sheet provides more active sites with higher charge transfer rates and improved charge transfer kinetics, boosting the level of material processing of supercapacitors.
