Double-layered carbon/NiO 2 electrodes have been fabricated by atmospheric plasma jet and the reactive magnetron sputter techniques. Thick activated carbon coatings were deposited on stainless steel substrates using atmospheric plasma torch and argon-acetylene working gas. Thin NiO 2 films were deposited on the top of the as-grown carbon layers by magnetron sputter deposition of Ni in the oxygen atmosphere. The studies of surface morphology of fabricated electrodes was done using scanning electronic microscope (SEM) in dependence on the coating/film deposition parameters and plasma treatment conditions.
