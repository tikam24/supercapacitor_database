A Power Conditioning System (PCS) which uses a supercapacitor bank as energy storage device is proposed as a viable solution for improving the quality and the reliability of the electric energy suppl!. Several tasks can be performed at the same timc, such as reactive power compensation, current harmonic reduction, and smoothing of pulsating ioads. Moreover, the PCS can operate as Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) during short time interruptions of the grid supply. Â© 2002 IEEE.
