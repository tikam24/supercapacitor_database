Renewable energy is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and this is only going to grow in the future. Considering renewable energy even the automotive industry has started moving towards electric vehicles not only because they run on electricity which saves the environment from harmful gases but also have a very minimal carbon foot print unlike the traditional ICE car whose carbon footprint almost quadruples by the end of their life span when compared to EV's. The problem with today's EV's is they have less range as compared to an ICE vehicle, which impacts negatively on the sales of those vehicles. A possible solution to this would be building a hybrid generator integrated using IoT technology inside the vehicle which could charge the vehicle as it moves. Instead of regular regenerative braking which only generates electricity when we are decelerating or breaking the proposed system generates electricity whenever the vehicle is moving. In this work, the generator motor is connected with the axle of the rear wheel with the ratio of 1:4 which will help the motor spin at a faster rate. Then the generator motor is connected to a step-up transformer which always stabilizes the current. Then the current from step-up transformer transfers to the super capacitor which charges a lot faster than (lithium ion/ lead acid) regular batteries. Storing the current in the super capacitors helps stabilize the current furthermore and creates a steady linear current. Then the current is passed on to the battery after going through a battery management circuit. The continuous monitoring and integration from power generation, storage and actuation of super capacitor using IoT technology extends the range of the vehicle
