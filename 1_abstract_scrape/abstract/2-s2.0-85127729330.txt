Transition metal oxides are considered to be one of the most potential electrode materials. However, poor conductivity and insufficient active sites limit their actual applications. Rationally designed electrode materials with unique structural features can be ascribed to the efficient route for enhancing electrochemical performance. Here, we report hybrid Co3O4@Ni3S2 nanostructures obtained via a hydrothermal strategy and subsequent electrodeposition process. The obtained products can be used as electrodes for a hybrid supercapacitor with a specific capacity of 1071 C g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent rate capability. The as-assembled device delivers an energy density of 77.92 W h kg−1 at 2880 W kg−1. As an electrocatalyst, the above electrode possesses an overpotential of 237.6 mV at 50 mA cm−2 for oxygen evolution reaction.
