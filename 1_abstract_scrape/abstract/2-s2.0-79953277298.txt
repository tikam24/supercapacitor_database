Graphene-ZnO nanocomposite was successfully synthesized via microwave-assisted reduction of zinc ions in aqueous solution with graphite oxide dispersion using a microwave synthesis system. The electrochemical performance of the nanocomposite was analyzed through cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry tests. The results showed that as compared with pure graphene, graphene-ZnO composite exhibited an improved electrochemical capacitance of 146 F/g with good reversible charge/discharge behavior.
