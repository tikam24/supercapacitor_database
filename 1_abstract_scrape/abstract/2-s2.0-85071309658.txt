Great efforts have been devoted to designing porous carbons to improve energy density of supercapacitor, yet still impeded by high-cost and time-consuming procedures. The low capacitance and poor rate capability of various biomass-derived carbons in organic electrolyte remain a challenge for their practical application. Herein, to address these issues, biomass (leek) is used to produce three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon, which possesses big cavities, high specific surface area and well-defined hierarchical pores. In three-electrode system, it exhibits a high capacitance of 349 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte and a superior cycling stability of no capacitance decay at 20 A g−1 over 10,000 cycles. Notably, the assembled symmetric cell reveals a high capacitance of 191 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 with a good rate capability (77% capacitance retention at 10 A g−1) in organic electrolyte. In addition, a high energy density of 86 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 450 W kg−1 is demonstrated, while it remains 55 Wh kg−1 at a high power density of 18 kW kg−1, superior to that of many biomass-derived carbon materials. The excellent electrochemical performance offers great potential as next-generation electrode material for supercapacitor.
