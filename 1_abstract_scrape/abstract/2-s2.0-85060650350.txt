Microbial power generation is the use of microbial energy to generate electricity. This paper is mainly designed to study the microbial power generation system in the energy storage system. Microbial power generation voltage is only 0.6v and this voltage is very small, The electricity from the microbes is first charged by a group of parallel super capacitors. Then the super capacitor is transformed into a series state, and then through the DC-DC boost circuit to store electricity. This can store electricity exponentially and Long time power supply for load. This process, the switching of the series and parallel state of the super capacitor is controlled by a single cylinder which is connected with the circuit. The whole system can raise the voltage of microbes from 0.6V to 15V.In addition, the energy storage scheme discussed in this paper has practical guiding significance, and can guide the production of the corresponding objects.
