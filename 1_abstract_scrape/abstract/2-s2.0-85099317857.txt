Reduced graphene oxide aerogels (RGOAs) were obtained through steam reduction of freeze-dried graphene oxide hydrogels with different suspension pH. X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscope were used to characterize the structures of graphene oxide aerogels (GOAs), and electrochemical measurements were used to study the electrochemical performance of RGOAs. The results show that the structure of GOA is greatly affected by the suspension pH, and the GOA prepared at pH 3 has low restacking degree. The RGOAs obtained by steam reduction can retain the 3D structure well. The RGOAs reduced at 180 ℃ exhibits a high specific capacitance of 265 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1, and excellent rate capability. This work suggests that steam reduction of freeze-dried GO hydrogels with a low degree of stacking is a feasible approach to prepare RGOAs as electrode material for supercapacitor application.
