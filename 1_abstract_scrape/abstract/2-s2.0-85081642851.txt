In this paper, the battery-supercapacitor management system is developed to monitor the operation of the battery-supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system. The proposed battery and super-capacitor management system consists of two subsystems. One is the battery management subsystem and the other is the supercapacitor management subsystem. The battery-supercapacitor management system includes the master control unit, the monitor, the battery monitoring units (BMUs), the battery bus monitoring unit (BBMU), the super-capacitor monitoring units (SMUs) and the super-capacitor bus monitoring unit (SBMU). The CAN 2.0B communication is used to implement the data exchange between various units. The experimental set-up is built to examine the developed battery-supercapacitor management system. The designed layouts and the displayed cell voltages are verified by the experiment. The developed battery-supercapacitor management system is applied to the hybrid battery-supercapacitor in an EV prototype.
