NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> and carbon-NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> hetero-structured nanosheet arrays have been firstly synthesized on nickel foams in a facile hydrothermal and CVD method. The products NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> and carbon-NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> are obtained in Na<inf>2</inf>S aqueous solution in a hydrothermal reaction from precursor of NiCo<inf>x</inf>(OH)<inf>y</inf> and carbon-NiCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf> through anion exchange respectively, which are characterized by XRD, TEM, Raman analysis. The obtained binary metal sulphide NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> nanosheet delivers better electrochemical activity and higher mass loading compared with NiCo<inf>2</inf>O<inf>4</inf>. In addition, carbon introduced enhances the capacitive behaviours and cycle performance for enhanced electric conductivity and stable architecture. The integrated carbon-NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> electrode exhibits high areal capacitance of 8.33 F cm<sup>-2</sup> and ultrahigh specific capacitance of 1893.2 F g<sup>-1</sup> with a potential window of 0.8 V and high mass loading of 4.4 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> and good cycle performance in a three-electrode system. The asymmetric supercapacitor is further assembled using carbon-NiCo<inf>2</inf>S<inf>4</inf> as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode. The integrated asymmetric supercapacitor demonstrates a high energy density of 68.82 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 47.83 W kg<sup>-1</sup>, which confirms its practical applicability.
