In the present work, we report the exploration of rationally designed electrodes based on quasi-aligned nanoarrays composited by the cores of SiC nanowires and shells of sulfur-doped porous carbons (SiC@PC-S), which are directly employed as the free-standing electrodes for Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors. They behave an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 38.24 mF/cm2 at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, with an exceptional rate capability (~20.67 mF/cm2 even at 1000 mV/s). The as-constructed hybrid supercapacitors deliver a remarkable energy of 10.6 Î¼Wh/cm2, which is the highest one among SiC-based supercapacitors ever reported. Moreover, such hybrid devices exhibit a high power density of 7.2 mW/cm2 and a robust cycle stability with ~97 % capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 2 mA/cm2, representing their promising practical applications.
