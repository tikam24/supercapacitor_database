In this paper an interleaved converter has been studied. The control system structure and the modeling of step-up/step-down DC/DC converters working in discontinuous mode have been developed and presented. In order to validate the theoretical model the whole system has been simulated with the PLECS/Simulink simulation software. A proof-of-concept prototype has been designed, built and tested.
