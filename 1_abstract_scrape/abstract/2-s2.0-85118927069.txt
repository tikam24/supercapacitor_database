This paper proposes an integration of renewable energy sources based on a modular multi-input bidirectional DC/DC buck-boost converter. The proposed four-port converter is realized with a reduced component count and simplified control strategy, which makes the converter more reliable and cost-effective. Also, this converter exhibits bidirectional power flow functionality, making it suitable for charging the battery during regenerative braking of an electric vehicle or hybrid electric vehicle. Photovoltaic (PV) panel, battery, and ultra-capacitor are the three different energy sources for the suggested topology. Dynamic modeling is derived, and the steady-state performance of the converter is well analyzed in MATLAB/Simulink platform. Experimental results obtained from a 100Wprototype model validate the performance of the proposed four-port bidirectional buck/boost (FPB3C) DC/DC converter.
