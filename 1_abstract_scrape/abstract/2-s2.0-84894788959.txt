Nanocrystalline NiO-CeO2 binary oxide as a novel electrode material for ultracapacitor was synthesized via glycol assisted citrate sol-gel method. Unique cubic phases with aggregated crystalline microstructure of NiO-CeO2 mixed oxides were examined by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope. The observed electrochemical measurements further reveal the strong pseudocapacitance features of the mixed oxides at different current density. Binary oxide annealed at 500 °C shows an optimum specific capacitance (C s) of 305 Fg-1 at the constant current density of 1 Ag-1. The achieved C s value undoubtedly certifies that in combination with NiO the structural stability and redox property of CeO2 have been enhanced. Especially, increasing the calcination temperature binary oxide has shown well reversible redox features which confirm the high chemical and thermal stability of CeO2 and it could be involve in the charge storage process effectively by their strong Ce3+/Ce4+ redox couples. Capacity retention and cyclic stability of the electrode was quite good, only ~5 % capacity fading was observed after 1,000 cycles. Moreover, binary oxide calcined at 700 °C exhibits a specific capacitance of 167 Fg-1 at the constant current density of 1 Ag-1 which states that presence of CeO2 with NiO have controlled the grain growth and maintains their porous microstructure even at 700 °C. This facilitates to the redox process at both NiO and CeO2 active surfaces at elevated temperature significantly. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
