In this study, the easy-to-operate silver mirror reaction (SMR) was used for metallizing chromatography paper. The SMR-metallized paper was characterized by water contact angle measurements, a surface profiler, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and electrical resistance measurement. The characterization results show that Ag was successfully synthesized on cellulose fibers and was electrically conductive after cyclic bending. Moreover, this SMR-metallized paper was used as electrodes for fabricating a supercapacitor. This SMR-metallized paper could be used for realizing cost-effective flexible electronics applied in on-site biochemical sensing in resource-limited settings.
