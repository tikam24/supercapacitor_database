Supercapacitor: A highly aligned nanochannel Nb oxide structure can be formed by self-organizing anodization of Nb in a K 2HPO 4-containing glycerol electrolyte at elevated temperatures (180 °C). Under optimized electrochemical conditions, a high degree of ordering can be achieved. These layers can be used as supercapacitors (see figure). Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
