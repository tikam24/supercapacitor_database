This work demonstrates a facile and effective strategy for the preparation of a reduced graphene oxide/carboxymethylcellulose-polyaniline (RGO/CMC-PANI) hybrid film electrode. Specifically, through the hydrogen bonding interaction between -OH of CMC molecules and -NH2 of aniline monomer, PANI grows in an ordered manner on the surface of CMC, which effectively alleviates the structural collapse of PANI during the continuous charge/discharge process. After compounding with RGO, CMC-PANI bridges adjacent RGO sheets to form a complete conductive path, and opens the gap between RGO sheet layers to obtain fast ion channels. As a result, the RGO/CMC-PANI electrode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance. Moreover, an asymmetric supercapacitor was fabricated using RGO/CMC-PANI as the anode and Ti3C2Tx as the cathode. The results show that the device has a large specific capacitance of 450 mF cm−2 (81.8 F g−1) at 1 mA cm−2 and a high energy density of 140.6 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 749.9 μW cm−2. Besides, 87.3 % initial capacitance and 100 % good coulombic efficiency can be maintained even after 20,000 GCD cycles. Therefore, the device has a broad application prospect in the field of new-generation microelectronic energy storage.
