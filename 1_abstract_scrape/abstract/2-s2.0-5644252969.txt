In this communication, electrochemical double layer capacitance of SnS nanorods synthesized via hydrothermal method was studied in aqueous 0.1 M KOH and NaCl solutions. The nanomaterial was immobilized on paraffin impregnated graphite electrode by abrasive transfer technique and the electrochemical behaviour was studied by employing cyclic voltammetry, double step chronocoulometry and charge-discharge techniques. The chemical and electrochemical stability of SnS nanorods on progressive cycling was robust over 1000 cycles. In neutral solutions, the voltage was 1.65 V which is an excellent value for aqueous medium. As against blank PIGE electrodes, the capacitance was impressively higher for nano SnS in both alkali and neutral solutions. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
