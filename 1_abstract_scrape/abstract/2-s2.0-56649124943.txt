Due to the increasing number and complexity of the available functions, modern handheld devices require higher and higher current slew rates. Customers' requirements lead to a growing interest in longer-lasting power, fast transient response power supply systems and minimization of system weight, volume and cost. Fuel cell based hybrid systems are designed to meet all requirements. In this paper, a fuel cell-supercapacitor hybrid power supply for portable applications is proposed. The power management subsystem is designed and simulation results are shown to test the efficiency of the control algorithm. Â©2008 IEEE.
