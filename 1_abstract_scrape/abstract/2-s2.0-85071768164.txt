Abstract—: Tin oxide (SnO2) nanoparticles were prepared by a low cost precipitation method. As prepared, SnO2 nanoparticles were incorporated into polyaniline (PANI) matrix to form PANI/SnO2 nanocomposites via liquid-liquid interfacial polymerization. The composite formation and structural changes in PANI/SnO2 nanocomposites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Electrochemical behavior of nanocomposite was evaluated in a three electrode system (in 1 M H2SO4) using such electrochemical techniques as cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. The calculated, via cyclic voltammetry, specific capacitance of the nanocomposite was found to be 636 Fg–1 at a scan rate of 2 m Vs–1. The nanocomposite exhibited a specific capacitance of 337 Fg–1 at a current density of 0.2 Ag–1. Further, it exhibited 73% of capacitance retention and 100% of columbic efficiency in a life cycle test conducted at 7.5 Ag–1 for 2000 cycles.
