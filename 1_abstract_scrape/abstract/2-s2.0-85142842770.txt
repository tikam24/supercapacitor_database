The expeditiously growing wearable, thin, and flexible electronics have created a great demand for futuristic miniaturized charge storage devices. As power sources, flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) have received huge attraction because of their reliability, compatibility, and safety within the integrated lightweight consumer device applications. Along with high specific power and durability, the FSC provides a novel platform that inspires creative applications. Thereupon, the FSCs have become one of the most favorable candidates for energy storage in various forms such as skin patches or printed/wearable fabrics that can be used in medical examination. In this review, we focus on the current progress in the development of flexible electrode materials and scalable fabrication processes for FSC devices. Prospects in developing new approaches toward improved energy and power densities are highlighted.
