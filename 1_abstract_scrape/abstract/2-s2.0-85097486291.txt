Stationary energy storage technology has become an effective measure to improve energy saving and power supply quality of urban rail transit. Technical and economic evaluation is an important issue to be solved in the engineering application of energy storage technology. Based on the review of the power-capacity constrained configuration method (P&C-Method) and capacity constrained configuration method (C-Method) of supercapacitor array for urban rail transit braking energy recovery, the comprehensive technical and economic evaluation criteria and a net income mathematical model of the stationary supercapacitor energy storage system was established. The technical economy of the above two typical configuration methods is compared and analyzed. The case study shows that: Although the investment cost of P&C-Method is higher than that of C-Method, the cost recovery period of two configuration methods is similar, the energy-saving performance of the power-capacity constraint configuration method is better than that of the capacity constraint configuration method, within the whole life cycle. The power-capacity constraint configuration method has better comprehensive technical and economic performance and can obtain greater economic benefits. It is worthy of priority in practical engineering.
