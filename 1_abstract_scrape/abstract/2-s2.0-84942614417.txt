Although exfoliated MoS<inf>2</inf> sheets have recently demonstrated their great potential for use as electrodes for supercapacitors, they suffer from poor intrinsic electrical conductivity and strong tendency for intersheet aggregation. Here, we develop a synthetic method for preparation of N-doped carbon-coated MoS<inf>2</inf> (NC-MoS<inf>2</inf>) nanosheets composed of coating of polydopamine and a post carbonization process. Construction of carbon layers on the MoS<inf>2</inf> surface enables effective prevention of sheet aggregation and provide a rapid pathway for electron transfer. As-prepared NC-MoS<inf>2</inf> materials are then characterized by electrochemical measurements to demonstrate the superior performance of the supercapacitor electrodes. The NC-MoS<inf>2</inf> electrode exhibits improved electrochemical performance relative to the exfoliated MoS<inf>2</inf> sheets, with a high specific capacitance (158 F g<sup>-1</sup>), high rate capability (83% retention), and good cycling life (89% retention) during 1000 cycles.
