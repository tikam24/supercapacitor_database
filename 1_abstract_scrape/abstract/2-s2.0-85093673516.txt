Excellent electrode materials are often desired to improve the overall performance of supercapacitors and conversion components, especially electrode materials synthesized by anion replacement to achieve high electrochemical performance. Herein, a zinc–cobalt phosphide electrode material with excellent electrical conductivity is synthesized through a metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived method, followed by phosphating in a tube furnace. As a result, an exchange of phosphorus ions and oxygen ions occurs, yielding a high specific capacitance of 2115.5 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, as well as a superior rate capacity of 1086.5 F g-1 at 50 A g-1. After 7000 cycle tests, 80.3% of the initial specific capacitance is maintained. Phosphorus substitution leads to a narrowed band gap, resulting in outstanding electrical conductivity, as confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Subsequently, the self-assembled Zn0.33Co0.67P//Bi2O3 alkaline supercapacitor exhibits a high energy density of 83.05 Wh kg-1 (248.9 F g-1 at 1 A g-1) at a power density of 775.02 W kg-1. Meanwhile, a capacitance retention of 84.6% after 8000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g-1 is obtained. The outstanding performances of the electrode material in terms of electrical conductivity and electrochemical activity provide a new method for the design of high energy density alkaline supercapacitors (SCs).
