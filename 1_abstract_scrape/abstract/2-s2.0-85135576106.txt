Fiber-based supercapacitors (F-SCs) have inspired widespread interest in the fields of wearable technology, energy, and carbon neutralization due to their highly deformable flexibility, fast charging/discharging capability, long-term stability, and energy conservation ability. In this review, we summarize the latest developments for fabricating fibrous electrodes of F-SCs where advanced micro two-dimensional (2D) building blocks (e.g., MXene and graphene) are chemically assembled and constructed into ordered mesofibers and multifunctional macrofabrics. Diverse fundamental principles of 2D hybrid nanosheets with respect to surface controls, pseudocapacitive modifications, and microstructural manipulations, promoting rapid electron transfer and charge conduction, are introduced. Additionally, various spinning methods for assembling and fabricating sophisticated fibers with advanced nano/microstructures, including hierarchical skeletons, anisotropic backbones, surface/entire porous frameworks, and vertical-aligned networks, for boosting ionic kinetic transport/storage are presented. Likewise, the structure-activity relationships between the porous structure and electrochemical performance are clarified. Moreover, multifunctional fabrics in terms of high flexibilities/strengths, superior electrical conductivities, and stabilized operations, which realize large energy density, deformable capability, and robust stability under harsh conditions, are emphasized. In particular, the potential power-supply applications, including flexible electronic devices, self-powered functions, and energy-sensor systems, are highlighted. Finally, a short conclusion and outlook, along with the current challenges and future opportunities of next-generation F-SCs, are proposed.
