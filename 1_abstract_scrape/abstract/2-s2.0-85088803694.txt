Battery-type electrode materials such as NiS applied in Faradaic supercapacitors (FSs) could display poor performance with regard to rate-capability and cycling stability due to the inappropriate texture of the electrodes. Numerous works focussed on tuning the microscopic structure of electrode materials, but neglected the influence of the microscopic structure of current collectors such as nickel foam on the electrochemical performance of FSs. In this work, the performance of NiS is associated with the microscopic structure of nickel foams by decorating the 2D porous nanostructured NiS on a 2D nanoengineered skeleton-surface of nickel foams. It could be inferred from the characterization results that the synergistic effect of both 2D nanostructured NiS and nickel foam significantly promotes the rate-capability and stabilizes the performance of NiS. Asymmetric supercapacitors using the dually nanostructured NiS/nickel foam as positive electrode and AC as negative electrode exhibit both high energy and high power densities.
