Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a characterization technique that is gaining more and more importance in various fields of research and applications. The frequency range of investigation varies according to the type of application. In some fields (biology, medicine, energy) it is useful to be able to perform measurements at very low frequency values (down to a few mHz or even below). While impedance meters operating at frequencies in the range from a few tens of Hz up to a few MHz can be regarded as quite standard pieces of instrumentation commonly available in many laboratories, instrumentation for measurements at very low frequencies, although commercially available, is less common. The subject of this work is the design, realization and testing of a low frequency impedance measurement platform that has the advantage of being portable, rather inexpensive, and yet highly versatile. In our approach, we exploit a personal computer and a soundboard as a powerful system for digital signal generation and analysis that, with the help of low complexity and low-cost external hardware and a public domain software for the implementation of the core system, allow to tailor the platform for targeting specific applications with minimal effort. As an example, we will demonstrate the application of the system to the investigation of polypyrrole-based supercapacitor structures.
