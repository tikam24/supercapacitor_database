As the excellent characteristics of low cost and high theoretical capacitances, cobalt oxide has been widely investigated as supercapacitor electrode. In this work, we have reported a facile strategy for fabricating Co 3 O 4 nanorod arrays (NAs) by chemical bath deposition, each Co 3 O 4 nanorod has a flat tip and the diameter of the nanorod is about 450 nm. The nanocrystals were used to fabricate a three-electrode system, which was characterized by cyclic voltammograms, galvanostatic charge-discharge and electrochemical impedance in aqueous 3 M KOH electrolyte. The specific capacitance of electrode is more than 387.25 F g −1 (154.9 C g −1 ) at 1 A g −1 . All of these attractive results make the unique Co 3 O 4 NAs a promising electrode material for high-performance supercapacitors.
