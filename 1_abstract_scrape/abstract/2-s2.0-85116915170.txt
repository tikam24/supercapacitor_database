The supply voltage of traction systems fluctuates frequently due to acceleration and braking during urban rail train running process. In order to achieve better performance for ultracapacitor energy storage systems, a bilateral ultracapacitor energy storage system structure is adopted, and a method based on dynamic setting and coordination is proposed, in which the charge and discharge voltage thresholds of ultracapacitors are dynamically set and the energy flows are coordinated controlled between the bilateral ultracapacitor energy storage systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can achieve good energy-saving effect and stabilize the traction network voltage under the premise of balanced use of the ultracapacitor energy storage systems.
