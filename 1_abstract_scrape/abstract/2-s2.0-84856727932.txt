We demonstrate a new strategy for the fabrication of supercapacitor electrodes possessing high mass and area-specific capacitance for efficient charge storage, which can be extremely useful for the development of light, compact and high performance supercapacitors for a variety of high power demanding applications. High mass and electrode area specific capacitances were attained by using Hydrous Ruthenium Oxide (HRO)-Carbon Nanofiber (CNF) hybrid electrodes prepared by the deposition of HRO (∼31% Ru content) on both the outer and inner surfaces of a cylindrical hollow CNF having open tips. Electrochemical studies of the uniformly deposited HRO nanoparticles on the CNF surface showed a mass specific capacitance of 645 F g -1 and an electrode specific capacitance of 1.29 F cm -2 with a HRO-CNF material loading of 2 mg cm -2 in the supercapacitor electrodes. The mass specific capacitance of pure HRO is 301 F g -1, whereas the mass specific capacitance of HRO in the HRO-CNF electrode is ∼1300 F g -1, which is very close to the theoretical capacitance of HRO. This enhanced charge storage ability, high rate capability, better cyclic stability and low ESR of the HRO-CNF will be useful for the development of high performance supercapacitors. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
