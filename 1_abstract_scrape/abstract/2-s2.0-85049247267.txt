Polyaniline (PANI) hollow microspheres were fabricated by self-assembly method and further doped with cerium ions (Ce3+). The constitution and morphology of Ce3+-doped PANI (PANI/Ce3+) were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) etc. Furthermore, a 2016-type buckle capacitor was assembled and PANI/Ce3+ was employed as electrode material. The electrochemical properties of PANI/Ce3+ capacitor were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanotatic charge-discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and so on. The PANI/Ce3+ capacitor exhibited high specific capacitance and small resistance. The specific capacitance of PANI/Ce3+ was 248.2 F/g at current density of 1 mA/cm2.
