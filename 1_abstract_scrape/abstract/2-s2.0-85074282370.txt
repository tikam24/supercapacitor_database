Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are network-like frameworks composed of transition metals and organic ligands containing oxygen or nitrogen. Because of its highly controllable composition and ordered porous structure, it has broad application prospects in the field of material synthesis. In this work, Zn4(PYDC)4(DMF)2∙3DMF (ZPD) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method. Self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-T was then prepared by one-step carbonization. The results show that the self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-850 has a micro/mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 1520 m2 g−1 and a nitrogen content of 6.47%. When a current density is 1.0 A g−1, its specific capacitance is 265.1 F g−1. After 5000 times of constant current charging and discharging, the capacitance retention rate was 79.2%. Thus, self-doped nitrogen porous carbon ZPDC-850 exhibits excellent electrochemical properties and good cyclic stability. Therefore, the self-doped nitrogen porous carbon derived from MOFs can be a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.
