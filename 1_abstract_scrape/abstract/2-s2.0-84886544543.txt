One-step and template-free synthesis of polyaniline nanobuds (PANI NBs), synthesized using anodic electrochemical polymerization method, is reported at room temperature onto a conducting indium-tin-oxide glass substrate. The PANI NBs are characterized for their structural, morphological, and electrochromic properties. Scanning electron microscopy image reveals NBs type architecture, perpendicular to the substrate surface. These NBs are broader at their bottoms and narrower at the tops. Individual NB has confirmed 30 nm top diameter and 100-200 nm length. Electrochemical supercapacitive behavior of the PANI NBs electrode is investigated by measuring cyclic voltammetry curves. Moderate specific capacitance of 128 F/g is achieved in the potential range of - 0.2 to 1.0 V at 10 mV/s sweep rate in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Influence of inner and outer charges on a resultant specific capacitance is also investigated.
