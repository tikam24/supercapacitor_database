Nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons are considered promising candidates for supercapacitors and CO2sorbents. However, synthesis of mesoporous carbons usually requires expensive soft or hard templates. In this study, we demonstrate that cost-effective nitrogen-doped carbons can be synthesized through a one-pot method by using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), triethylamine (TEA) and tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) as the precursors. Thein situformed silica derived from TEOS serves as a hard template while TEA and TEAOH are the carbon and nitrogen sources. By removing the hard template, mesoporous carbons are generated. It was found that the carbon (TUD-700) carbonized at 700 °C has the largest pore volume (1.18 cm3g−1) and the largest surface area (1050 m2g−1). The specific capacitance of TUD-700 can reach 360 F g−1in the three-electrode system. The energy density and the power density of the assembled symmetric supercapacitor can reach 30.4 W h kg−1and 455.1 kW kg−1, respectively. TUD-700 and TUD-600 were also used as a tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) support to prepare “molecular basket” solid amine sorbents to capture CO2. The CO2uptake of 50A/TUD-700 can reach 3.53 mmol g−1. The TUD-700 based solid sorbents show better CO2capture performance than TUD-600 based sorbents due to the larger surface area and the larger pore volume.
