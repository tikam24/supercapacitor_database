The performance of supercapacitors with multiwalled carbon nanotubes deposited with conducting polymer as activate materials was greatly enhanced in contrast with electric double-layer supercapacitor with carbon nanotubes due to the conducting polymer's faradaic effect. They are promising as the secondary power sources in electric vehicles propulsion. Polypyrrole and poly(3-methylthiophene) were uniformly deposited onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes in organic system by chemical methods. A carbon nanotubes-polypyrrole composite-carbon nanotubes-poly(3-methyl-thiophene) composite based supercapacitor prototype (CNTs-pPy-CNTs-pMeT SCP), a carbon nanotubes-carbon nanotubes-polypyrrole based hybrid SCP (CNTs-CNTs-pPy SCP), a carbon nanotubes-carbon nanotubes-poly(3-methylthiophene) based hybrid SCP (CNTs-CNTs-pMeT SCP) as well as a CNTs-CNTs corresponding SCP were assembled in 1 M LiClO4 acetonitrile solution. Their voltammetry characteristics, galvanostatic discharge and AC. impedance spectra were carried out in two-electrode mode. Pseudocapacitance effects are found out from those SCPs with composite electrodes and their measured capacitances are 87, 45 and 72 F g-1 for CNTs-pPy-CNTs-pMeT SCP, CNTs-CNTs-pMeT SCP and CNTs-CNTs-pPy SCP, respectively. They are much larger than that of 21 F g-1 for the CNTs-CNTs corresponding SCP, which is a double-layer SCP. Their measured specific energy is 1.82, 0.88 and 1.33 W h kg-1 for those SCPs with composite electrodes. They are also much higher than that of 0.58 W h kg-1 for the CNTs-CNTs corresponding SCP.
