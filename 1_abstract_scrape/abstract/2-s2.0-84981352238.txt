The hybrid capacitor has high energy density compared to standard supercapacitors along with long-term cycling ability. This makes them attractive for applications where repeated current pulses are required such as in electric vehicles. This study tries to optimize the mass of electrode material used in an aqueous hybrid capacitor. A new concept known as the variable supercapacitor have been introduced in the paper. A novel structure for the hybrid capacitor was implemented which allowed the parameters of the hybrid capacitor to vary dynamically.
