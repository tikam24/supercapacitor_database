A super flexible copper/carbon nanofiber film electrode is successfully synthesized through a calcination process wholly under nitrogen atmosphere. It is found that the heating rate in the calcination process plays a crucial role in achieving foldable super flexibility. The as-obtained film electrode exhibits mechanical super flexibility with a maximum specific capacitance of 608 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and a capacity retention of 75.7% after 1000 cycles. Its flexible symmetric all-solid-state supercapacitor shows a superior areal capacitance of 88 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2 and a high energy density of 41 μWh cm−2 at a power density of 0.28 mW cm−2.
