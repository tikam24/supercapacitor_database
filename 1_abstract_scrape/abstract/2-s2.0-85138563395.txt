Sisal Fiber Carbon Papers (SFCPs) with high specific surface area was obtained using a simple hydrothermal, pressing and carbonization method. The effects of calcination temperature on morphology, structure, pore structure and electrochemical properties of SFCPs were systematically studied. The free-standing SFCPs were directly utilized as supercapacitive electrodes, and the results revealed that the SFCPs calcinated at 900 Â°C (SFCP-900) exhibit a better specific capacity than SFCP-800 and SFCP-1000. These results suggested that the SFCP-900 has potential applications in supercapacitors.
