This article presents a novel buckâ€“boost converter-based topology suitable for supercapacitors and grid-connected solar PV system applications. The proposed converter can handle a wide range of voltage variations at the input side, making it ideal for extracting most of the energy from supercapacitors or a solar PV system connected to the input side of the converter. The output voltage of the converter is non-inverting which makes the control easier. The design of passive components, continuous mode operation, and discontinuous mode operation are all thoroughly discussed. A low-power hardware prototype of three hundred watts is developed and tested in the laboratory to validate the theoretical aspects of the converter.
