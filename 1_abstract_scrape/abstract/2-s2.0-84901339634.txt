Aiming at the instantaneous supply interrupt and deep voltage sag of conventional UPQC (Unified Power Quality Conditioner), SESS(Supercapacitor Energy Storage System) is recommended as its DC storage unit. According to the topology of SESS-based UPQC, the influencing factors and target function of its optimal allocation are studied and the best working conditions of its coordinated power flow control are obtained. The characteristics and performances of SESS's main circuit are studied and the storage unit capacity and SESS control strategy are determined. PI and repetitive control is proposed as the unit control strategy of UPQC according to the working requirements of its serial-parallel converters. Simulative and experimental results show that the coordinated control between serial-parallel converters and SESS is realized as well as the target of power quality management.
