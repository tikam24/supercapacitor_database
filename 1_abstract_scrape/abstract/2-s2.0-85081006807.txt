Rational designing of a facile synthetic protocol for synchronously generating NiCo2O4 and conductive carbon is a great challenging for high-performance supercapacitors. Herein, a one-pot and scalable approach has been developed to in-situ construct oxygen-vacancy-rich NiCo2O4/nitrogen-deficient graphitic carbon nitride (Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4) hybrids. The in-depth investigations reveal that there is an intriguing interaction between NiCo2O4 and g-C3N4, which unexpectedly enables the generating of Ov-NiCo2O4 and transforming of g-C3N4 into ND-g-C3N4 structures. Moreover, the g-C3N4 plays the skeleton and template role to form the foam-like structure. Benefiting from abundant active species and improved electrical conductivity, the resultant Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4 exhibits an unrivalled specific capacitance of 1998 F g−1 (equalling 277.5 mAh g−1) at a current density of 2 A g−1 and excellent rate capability (78.66% capacity retention at 20 A g−1). Besides, the assembled Ov-NiCo2O4/ND-g-C3N4//activated carbon asymmetric supercapacitors deliver a maximum energy density of 70.22 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1, and a remarkable cycling stability with 95.22% retention even after 5000 cycles, outstripping most of reported NiCo2O4-based supercapacitors. Thus, this work sheds light on the developing of advanced pseudocapacitive materials for electrochemical energy storage.
