In this study, we intensively investigated the effect of conductive additive amount on electrochemical performance of organic supercapacitors. For this purpose, we assembled coin-type organic supercapacitor cells with a variation of conductive additive(carbon black) amount; carbon aerogel and polyvinylidene fluoride were employed as active material and binder, respectively. Carbon aerogel, which is a highly mesoporous and ultralight material, was prepared via pyrolysis of resorcinolformaldehyde gels synthesized from polycondensation of two starting materials using sodium carbonate as the base catalyst. Successful formation of carbon aerogel was well confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and N2 adsorptiondesorption analysis. Electrochemical performances of the assembled organic supercapacitor cells were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements. Amount of conductive additive was found to strongly affect the charge transfer resistance of the supercapacitor electrodes, leading to a different optimal amount of conductive additive in organic supercapacitor electrodes depending on the applied charge-discharge rate. A high-rate charge-discharge process required a relatively high amount of conductive additive. Through this work, we came to conclude that determining the optimal amount of conductive additive in developing an efficient organic supercapacitor should include a significant consideration of supercapacitor end use, especially the rate employed for the charge-discharge process.
