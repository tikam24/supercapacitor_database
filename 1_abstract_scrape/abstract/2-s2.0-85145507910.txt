Mixed transition metallic sulfides have attracted researchers’ attention due to their unique electronic and electrochemical properties for energy storage devices. Herein, we have investigated nickel manganese sulfides (Nix–Mnx–S) based binary anode material for supercapattery devices. The hydrothermal method was used to synthesize the Nix–Mnx–S-based nanomaterials with different Ni to Mn ratios. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller spectroscopy (BETS) is used to examine surface characteristics, crystallinity, elemental analysis, and homogeneity. The electrochemical measurement of the Nix–Mnx–S-based electrode material is first explored in three electrodes assembly while maintaining a 1 M KOH electrolyte environment. Among all the electrodes, Ni0.50Mn0.50 S demonstrated exceptional performance with a specific capacity of 713 C/g or 1188 F/g at the current density of 1.0 A/g. Lastly, the Ni0.50Mn0.50 S based nanomaterials are used as working electrode and activated carbon (AC) as reference electrode for the two electrodes assembly test (Ni0.50 Mn0.50 S//AC). Which showing a high energy density of 35.24 (Wh/Kg), power density of 3200 (W/Kg), extraordinary specific capacity 158.6 C/g with coulomb efficiency 91.6% and capacity retention 70% after 11,000 galvanostatic charging/discharging (GCD) cycles. Our findings provide a platform to improve the performance of asymmetric energy storage devices. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].
