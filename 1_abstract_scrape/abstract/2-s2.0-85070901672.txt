Polyalthia longifolia Seeds (PLS) derived activated carbon (AC) samples were prepared at different temperatures (600, 700, 800 and 900 °C) by the pyrolytic chemical activation route. The as-prepared PLS-ACs were characterized by spectral and analytical tools. The electrochemical characterization studies were performed by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) and Impedance spectroscopic techniques. A three-electrode system, consisting of the as-prepared PLS-AC samples coated nickel foil (working electrode), Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) and Pt-wire (counter electrode) in 1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) was constructed. The pronounced specific capacitance (Csp) value of 365 Fg−1 was achieved at current density of 1 Ag−1 with reference to PLS-AC sample pyrolyzed at 900 °C with 92% retention even after 5000 charge/discharge cycles, substantiating the significant recycling durability. Furthermore, the prominent electrochemical behaviour under the selected potential window was supportive of its capacitive nature. The low-cost high performance carbon materials, prepared from the bio-waste, exhibited enhanced Supercapacitance, suitable for power storage devices. Moreover, the fabricated symmetric device using PLS-9 showed the high energy density of 27.5 Wh kg−1 at the power density of 499 W kg−1. Thus, the highly porous PLS-9 electrode was noted to a promising candidate for high-performance supercapacitors.
