In the energy storage area of research, novel electrode materials and substrates play vital roles enhancing the performance of super capacitors. A carbon-based super capacitor is a great approach to the revolution and emerging trends in the field of energy storage applications. Activated carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotubes are the best electroactive materials that are synthesized from Pongammia pinnatta shell and its oil, respectively. As-prepared activated carbon and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) physical properties can be characterized by using surface area analysis, BET, X-ray diffraction measurement, XPS-spectrophotometery, FESEM, HR-TEM, and EDAX analysis. AC-MWCNTs symmetric supercapacitors can be fabricated using two different substrates, such as stainless steel and nickel foam. The electrochemical performance of AC-MWCNTs (25:75) SS and AC-MWCNTs (25:75) nickel foam electrodes was studied by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge–discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis. They were used in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The obtained results showed that the AC-MWCNTs (25:75) Ni F electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 127.060 Fg−1 at a current density of 0.5 mAg−1 in a two-electrode system. The obtained high specific energy and power densities are 17.64 Wh Kg−1 and 124.992 W Kg−1, respectively, at an applied voltage from 0 to 2.0 V. The AC-MWCNTs (25:75) Ni F electrode exhibits excellent specific capacitance (Csp), energy and power density and is greater than that of the AC-MWCNTs (25:75) SS electrode. The electrochemical performance of the AC-MWCNTs (25:75) nickel foam electrode is a suitable and promising energy storage device in future generations due to its high potential and enormous energy performance.
