Lithium-ion capacitors (LIC) constructed by combining a supercapacitor-like cathode and battery-like anode are expected to bridge a gap between low power density from lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and low energy density from the supercapacitors. In this study, we synthesize the Sn-Ni alloy by electrodeposition in the aqueous solution as an anode for LIC. The lower volume expansion rate of Sn-86 than pure Sn anode can be confirmed by in-operando investigation using an optically transparent cell during the 1st charging process. This is attribute to the co-deposited Ni can act as a buffer matrix to restrain volume expansion. For the full-cell test, the pre-lithiation condition of Sn-Ni was investigated with different depth of discharge levels. As a result, a LIC consisting of activated carbon (AC) cathode and Sn-86 exhibits a good cyclability for 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80% and coulombic efficiency of 98% at 3000th cycle. The Sn-Ni//AC LIC shows improved volumetric energy and power density than graphite//AC LIC. This study presents a new possibility of Sn-Ni alloy as an anode for the improved electrochemical performance of LIC.
