Graphene-based composite materials have extensive potential applications in many fields due to excellent properties, especially in supercapacitor. The structures of graphene-based composite supercapacitor materials were classified, the progress in research of different graphene-based composite supercapacitor materials was reviewed from the point of graphene-carbon based composites, graphene-conductive polymers composites and graphene-transition metal compound composites, and the relationship of optimizing the electrode structure and improving the performance of electrode were focused. Meanwhile, the applications of graphene-based composite materials in the fields of lithium ion battery, solar cell, catalysis were outlined. The development tendency of graphene-based composite electrode materials is to assemble excellent supercapacitors with high energy density, power density and long cycle life.
