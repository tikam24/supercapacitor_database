Composite material–based supercapacitors have recently gained considerable interest as reliable choices for energy-saving applications. Here, we report the effect of rGO composition on the electrochemical energy storage performance of novel nanostructured Y2ZnCoO6, synthesized via a controlled hydrothermal route. The Y2ZnCoO6/rGO nanocomposite exhibited significant improvement in specific capacitance of 301.2 Fg-1 in comparison to Y2ZnCoO6 electrode which showed specific capacitance of 209.5 Fg-1. A significant contribution in specific capacitance may be due to increase in the specific surface area of the Y2ZnCoO6/rGO nanocomposite (∼25 m2g-1) in comparison to Y2ZnCoO6 (∼19 m2g-1) electrode as confirmed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis. The cycle stability tested for 10,000 charging/discharging cycles on Y2ZnCoO6 and Y2ZnCoO6/rGO electrodes, exhibited good capacitance retention of ∼95% and ∼88%, respectively.
