The nanosized mixed metal oxides (Ca3Co2O6, CaMnO3 and Ca2CuO3) have been synthesized and their electrochemical performance as supercapacitor electrodes have been evaluated. All of them show good pseudocapacitance in KOH electrolyte with specific capacitance of 563, 384 and 275 F g-1 for Ca3Co2O6, CaMnO3 and Ca2CuO3, respectively. The charge kinetics of Ca3Co2O6 is further evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the results show the low resistivity of Ca3Co2O6 and its charge kinetic shows little variation after long continuous cycling. The present study signifies the successful application of nanosized mixed metal oxides as supercapacitor electrode.
