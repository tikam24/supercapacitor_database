Nickel-manganese oxide film with unique morphology was synthesized and its electrochemical performances were also investigated. The addition of nickel element affects significantly capacitive behaviors of the as-obtained powder. As an electrode material in supercapacitor, nickel-manganese oxide exhibited high specific capacitance of 407 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 98.4% retention after 1000 cycles. Its outstanding electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between nickel and manganese elements and its novel architecture.
