Metal oxides–based supercapacitors have attracted much attention due to their easy fabrication and ultra-high theoretical specific capacitance. Here, a novel ternary metal oxide (CoO-NiO-ZnO, CNZO) in situ grown on Ni foam (CNZO@Ni foam) is prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis and a subsequent annealing method. Compared with the corresponding binary and single metal oxides of CoO-ZnO, NiO-ZnO, CoO-NiO, CoO, NiO, and ZnO, this ternary metal oxide shows an ultra-high specific capacitance (areal capacitance) of 2115.5 F g−1 (4.23 F cm−2) at a current density of 1 A g−1 (2 mA cm−2). Further, a hybrid supercapacitor (HSC) is assembled by the CNZO@Ni foam//porous graphene hydrogel (PGH), which exhibits a wide potential window of 1.6 V, and a high energy density 53.67 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 800 W kg−1. Moreover, it also shows good cycling stability of 87.9% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. This work provides an efficient and facile way to fabricate HSCs based on ternary metal oxide nano-networks and PGH with an aqueous electrolyte for safe and high-energy-density supercapacitors.
