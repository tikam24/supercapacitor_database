Metallic 1T phase MoS2 nanosheets and their composite materials, with unique structure and unusual properties, have attracted increasing research interest in energy conversion/storage and catalysis in the past few years. In this work, an overview of the recent progress of metallic 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and their composite materials is presented. First, we focused on the controlled synthesis of 1T-MoS2 nanosheets and their composite materials using top-down and bottom-up approaches and their unusual properties while tuning the phase structure. Then, we discussed their promising applications in energy-related areas including hydrogen evolution reaction, supercapacitors, batteries, and photocatalysis. In addition, an in-depth understanding was provided on phase tuning of these advanced materials for improved performance. Finally, the existing challenges and future research in these emerging research areas are also described.
