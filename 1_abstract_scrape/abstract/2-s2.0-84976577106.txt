Ultrafine manganese oxide-decorated carbon nanofibers (MnOn-CNF, 1.3 < n < 2.0) as a new type of electrode materials are facilely fabricated by direct conversion of Mn, Zn-trimesic acid (H3BTC) metal organic framework fibers (Mn-ZnBTC). The construction and evolution of Mn-ZnBTC fibers are investigated by SEM and in situ high-energy XRD. The manganese oxides are highly dispersed onto the porous carbon nanofibers formed simultaneously, verified by TEM, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), Raman, ICP-AES and N2 adsorption techniques. As expected, the resulting MnOn-CNF composites are highly stable, and can be cycled up to 5000 times with a high capacitance retention ratio of 98% in electrochemical capacitor measurements. They show a high capacitance of up to 179 F g-1 per mass of the composite electrode, and a remarkable capacitance of up to 18290 F g-1 per active mass of the manganese(IV) oxide, significantly exceeding the theoretical specific capacitance of manganese(IV) oxide (1370 F g-1). The maximum energy density is up to 19.7 Wh kg-1 at the current density of 0.25 A g-1, even orders higher than those of reported electric double-layer capacitors and pseudocapacitors. The excellent capacitive performance can be ascribed to the joint effect of easy accessibility, high porosity, tight contact and superior conductivity integrated in final MnOn-CNF composites.
