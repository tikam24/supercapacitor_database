During re-evaluation of the data presented in this article, the authors noticed an error in Figure S1 b (in the Supporting Information), where the incorrect XRD pattern of NiMoO4 nanoflakes was provided. The correct XRD pattern (which corresponds to JCPDS card no. 45-0142) is shown in Figure 1 a and the corresponding SEM image is shown in Figure 1 b. This error arose as in rare cases NiMoO4 that gives an XRD pattern corresponding to 86-0362 is formed by structural conversion during the calcination process. However, under optimized experimental conditions only NiMoO4 that gives the 45-0142 pattern is formed. The spacing of adjacent lattice fringes of 0.24 nm therefore match the d value of the (400) crystal plane of NiMoO4 and not the (002) value, as given in Figure 5 d (the corrected image is given in Figure 2). The corrected Figure 2 b with the 86-0362 pattern replaced with 45-0142 is given in Figure 3. The authors apologize for this oversight and confirm that the conclusions are unchanged. 1 Figure (Figure presented.) a) XRD pattern of NiMoO4 nanoflakes with JCPDS 45-0142 and b) SEM image (corrected version of Figure S 1). 2 Figure (Figure presented.)
