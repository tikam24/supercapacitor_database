Nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels for high performance supercapacitors were synthesized using guanidine phosphate, guanidine carbonate and guanidine hydrochloride as the nitrogen source by a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal method. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy characterizations and nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis indicate that these nitrogen doped graphene aerogels have poorly ordering and hierarchical porous structures. Especially, the nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (HRGA) prepared using guanidine hydrochloride as the nitrogen source possesses a richer nitrogen content (9.7 at%), higher conductivity (11.2 S cm−1), and larger specific surface area (257.6 m2 g−1). Thus HRGA delivers a large specific capacitance of 176 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 and an energy density of 70 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 0.875 kW kg−1. The nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels with enhanced electrochemical performance provide a huge application potential in the energy storage field.
