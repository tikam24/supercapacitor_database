Ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with dimension-related chemical and physical properties, including large surface areas, high intrinsic porosities and abundant accessible active sites have attracted extensive interest in various functional electronic devices. In this review, we first introduce the special advantages of the ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets. Then, we discuss the classifications of typical synthetic methods, such as top-down method and bottom-up method. Subsequently, we summarize the research advances on the applications of ultrathin 2D MOFs for functional electronic devices, including battery, supercapacitor, chemiresistive sensor, capacitive sensor, amperometric sensor, luminescent sensor, field effect transistor and white light-emitting diode, etc. Finally, we provide the challenges and perspectives on future synthesis and extensive applications of ultrathin 2D MOF nanosheets.
