The operation performance of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as supercapacitors and batteries depends on the processes occurring at the electrochemical interfaces, where charge separation and chemical reactions occur. Here, we report about the tests of the neutron reflectometry cells specially designed for operando studies of structural changes at the electrochemical interfaces between solid electrodes and liquid electrolytes. The cells are compatible with anhydrous electrolytes with organic solvents, which are employed today in all lithium ion batteries and most supercapacitors. The sensitivity of neutron reflectometry applied at the time-of-flight (TOF) reflectometer at the pulsed reactor IBR-2 is discussed regarding the effect of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on metal electrode surface.
