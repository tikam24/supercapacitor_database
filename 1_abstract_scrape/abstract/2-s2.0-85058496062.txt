In this paper, we report a facile and cost-effective approach to synthesis carbon fiber paper (CFP) based electrode coated with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) by vacuum filtration and carbonization. The SEM image showed that graphene was deposited on each individual carbon fiber and the hybrid electrode paper retained its three dimensional structure which provided efficient percolation path ways for electrons. The specific capacitance of the hybrid paper reached 1076 mF cm−2 at 5 mV s−1 according to cyclic voltammetry measurement. Further, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor delivered a high capacitance of 344 mF cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2. In a word, this feasible method should be appropriate for the fabrication of carbon fiber paper based electrodes.
