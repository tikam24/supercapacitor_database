In the present work, we propose a novel promising route for synthesis of Co-doped manganese oxide nanostructure via successive ionic layer deposition method as cathode material of zinc-ion hybrid su-percapacitor. The synthesized nanolayers were analyzed by SEM, EDX and XRD. It was shown that the synthesized nanolayers were formed from ultrathin (6–8 nm) two-dimensional nanocrystals containing birnessite MnO2 and hausmannite Mn3 O4 crystal phases and having the morphology of “nanosheets”. Electrode based on nickel foam and Co-doped manganese oxide nanolayers exhibited a high specific capacity (514.5 F/g at 0.1 A/g) and excellent cycling stability (99 % capacity retention after 1000 charge-discharge cycles). Obtained results demonstrate that the 2D Co-doped manganese oxide is a promising material for effective zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor.
