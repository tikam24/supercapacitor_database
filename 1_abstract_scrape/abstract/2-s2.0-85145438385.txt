Electric vehicles are getting important in the recent market because of depleting fossil fuels and the environmental effects of IC engines. Battery technology used for electric vehicle (EV) applications are still developing. The performance of batteries needs to be improved for the application of EV s. Range anxiety, short life cycle, and large charging time are the main concerns in using a battery. Non- monotonic discharge of the battery is the main reason for degrading the performance and life of the battery. The non- monotonic discharge can be avoided using another energy storage device with fast charging and discharging characteristics. Battery and supercapacitor are having dissimilar but complementary characteristics. Li-ion battery has high energy density but poor power density while supercapacitor (SC) has high power density but poor energy density. The paper presents a comparative study of various topologies of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of two energy storage devices (battery and supercapacitor) for EV applications.
