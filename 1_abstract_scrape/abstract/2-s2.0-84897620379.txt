Patterning-assembly technology for energy storage systems can be a breakthrough for physicochemically limited energy storage systems. In this study, a concept of design with experimental proof is provided for an all-solid-state origami-type foldable supercapacitor by a novel patterning approach. The proposed system is composed of periodically assembled isolated electrodes (IEs) and sectionalized ion transferring paper (SITP), which are key factors for the densely packed series circuit analogues in the single system. The system shows a linear relationship between the potential window and the number of IEs, which does not have any limited asymptotic line. This system could increase energy and power simultaneously, which was conventionally not possible. Also, its folding characteristics accommodate highly stable stretching. These characteristics are proven by simulations based on ab-initio calculations and the finite-element method. Â© 2014 The Royal Society of Chemistry.
