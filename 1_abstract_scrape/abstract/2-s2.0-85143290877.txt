The graphene-based materials are promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices due to the intriguing properties, i.e., highly tunable surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and excellent mechanical behavior. This review summarizes recent development on graphene-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes, based on their macrostructural complexity, i.e., zero-dimensional (0D) (e.g., free-standing graphene dots and particles), one-dimensional (1D) (e.g., fiber-type and yarn-type structures), two-dimensional (2D) (e.g., graphenes and graphene-based nanocomposite films), and three-dimensional (3D) (e.g., graphene foam and hydrogel-based nanocomposites). There are extensive and on-going researches on the rationalization of their structures at varying scales and dimensions, development of effective and low-cost synthesis techniques, design and architecturing of graphene-based materials, as well as clarification of their electrochemical performance. There are several methods for producing graphene, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Graphene-based materials have great potential to be employed in supercapacitors due to their unique two-dimensional structure and inherent physical properties like excellent electrical conductivity and large area. This text summarizes recent developments within the sector of supercapacitors, including double-layer capacitors and quasi-capacitors. The pros and cons of using them in supercapacitors are discussed. Compared to traditional electrodes, graphene-based materials show some new properties and mechanisms within the method of energy storage and release. During this paper, we briefly describe carbon structures, particularly graphene, and also the history of graphene discovery, and briefly describe the synthesis methods, properties, characterization methods, and applications of graphene.
