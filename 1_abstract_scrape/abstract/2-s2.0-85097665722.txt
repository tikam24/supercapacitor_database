The progressive development of flexible transparent portable electronic devices is in urgent need of matching power sources. Flexible transparent supercapacitors (FTSCs) are the core resources due to their high optical transmittance, endurable mechanical flexibility, excellent electrochemical performance, and facilely accessible device configuration. This review organizes the rational design of nanostructured electrode materials toward FTSCs. First, the structure, mechanism, and property of FTSCs are introduced. Then, the design principles of diverse electrode materials are discussed to achieve flexible transparent conductive electrodes (FTCEs) with different figure of merits (both electrical FoMe and capacitive FoMc), mechanical strength, and environmental stability. Following the achievements in multifunctional FTSCs focusing on film-supercapacitors, micro-supercapacitors, electrochromic supercapacitors, photo-supercapacitors, and battery-like supercapacitors are also highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives on viable materials in the construction of FTSCs to power portable electronics are outlined.
