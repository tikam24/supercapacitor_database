Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have advanced in leaps and bounds thanks to their significant merits of low processing cost, simple device structure and fabrication, and high photoelectric conversion efficiency, which make them strong contenders for next generation photovoltaic (PV) technology. Nevertheless, owing to the intermittent and fluctuant nature of solar radiation, PSCs are constrained in providing sustainable and reliable power output needed in practice. With the aid of energy storage systems, such as supercapacitors (SCs) and lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), integrated solar power packs comprised of a PSC unit and a SC or LIB unit can self-charge under illumination and deliver stable off-grid power supply for external loads whenever needed. Recently, this new concept based on synergistic integration of complementary energy conversion and storage has aroused intense research interest in the scientific community. Many efforts have been made to assemble multifunctional self-charging power packs (SCPPs). This review highlights the progress in the emerging field of both integrated PSC-SC photocapacitors and PSC-LIB photobatteries in detail, including new device concepts, operation mechanisms, and the performance for each part and the whole device. We further analyze the existing challenges and limitations of the SCPPs and propose strategies and perspectives for future development.
