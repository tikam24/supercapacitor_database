Utilizing waste for harnessing energy is considered to be a sustainable approach to recompense the energy crisis. Herein, we report an easy and green method to remove a dye through adsorption on the surface of graphene. These nanostructured methylene blue/graphene (MB/G) materials are used for the investigation of electrochemical behaviours. The MB/G is found to demonstrate a specific capacitance of 185 F g-1 at 1 A g-1, which is almost four times higher than that of pure graphene (57 F g-1). Interestingly, the capacitance retention ratio remains high, at over 98.7% after 800 cycles. This journal is Â© the Partner Organisations 2014.
