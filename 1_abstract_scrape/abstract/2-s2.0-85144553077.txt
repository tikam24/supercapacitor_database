In this paper, an advanced power management approach is proposed to obtain the adequate power flow control of fusion microgrid (FMG) against variable sources. The FMG is the combination of PV array system and micro gas turbine as power delivered sources. PV system has intermittent input dynamics effects in power vacillations of fusion DC microgrid. Therefore, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), i.e., combination of battery energy storage system and supercapacitor to overcome such power fluctuations. The intermissive nature of PV system can impel the battery storage of HESS into overcharge/over discharge which again consequences in power vacillation of fusion microgrid. To avoid overcharge/over discharge of battery storage system, advanced power management system (APMS) has employed a state of charge (SOC) indicator which will protect the battery energy storage system. In this paper, to ensure the charging station voltage is constant at the DC bus terminal of FMG through a power balance between source and load with the proposed APMS. The projected method is corroborated with MATLAB /SIMULINK software.
