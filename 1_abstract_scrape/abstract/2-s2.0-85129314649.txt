A series of MoS2 and Mn metal organic frameworks (Mn-MOF) were synthesized by hydrothermal method, and then MoS2, Mn-MOF and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were mixed in different mass ratios and applied for supercapacitor. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) are used to investigate the electrochemical performance of MoS2/Mn-MOF/MWCNT materials with different mass ratios. The experimental results show that when the mass ratio of m(MoS2): m(Mn-MOF): m(MWCNT) is 1:4:1, the electrochemical performance of the MoS2/Mn-MOF/MWCNT composite is the best. The specific capacitance of optimal MoS2/Mn-MOF/MWCNT (1:4:1) reaches 862.73F g−1, which is noticeable higher than that of MoS2 (42.29F g−1), Mn-MOF (70.23F g−1) and MWCNT (347.27F g−1) materials. Moreover, the EIS test manifests that the MoS2/Mn-MOF/MWCNT (1:4:1) composite has a lower Rct value (2.566 Ω). Therefore, MoS2/Mn-MOF/MWCNT (1:4:1) has the best electrochemical performance among the all as-fabricated supercapacitor materials. This research provides an effective method for the development of Mn-based supercapacitor materials and improves the capacitance performance of MOFs materials.
