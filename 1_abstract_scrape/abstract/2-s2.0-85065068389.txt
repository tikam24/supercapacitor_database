This paper presents the results of research related to modeling of the effect of supercapacitor operating temperature on a fractional derivative order. The modeling task is conducted for three supercapacitors, and it involves a determination of the derivative order for their seven operating temperatures. The estimations are carried out based on measured step responses on supercapacitor terminals, separately for the supercapacitor charge and discharge cycles.
