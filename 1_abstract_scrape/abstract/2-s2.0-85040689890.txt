Tungsten oxide (WO3) nanostructures were synthesised using the microwave-assisted wet chemical method without any addition of surfactant for three different microwave irradiation times (10, 20 and 30 min). Then as-prepared nanostructures were characterised using various characterization techniques to know their structural, morphology and optical properties. The monoclinic and orthorhombic (WO3) crystal structure was obtained from the as-prepared nanostructures by using X-ray diffraction analysis and its calculated crystalline size were found to be increased from 14 to 18 nm on increasing microwave irradiation time. The functional groups were investigated by using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and the W–O chemical bonding nature was confirmed. The surface morphology was unclear using scanning electron microscope analysis, and a careful observation in high resolution transmission electron microscope studies shows that rod shaped structure. A blue-shifted optical absorption spectrum was observed by ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy analysis analysis and the bandgap energy value of WO3 was calculated as approximately 3.62 eV. The emission behaviours were investigated by using photoluminescence spectrofluorometer analysis and an enhanced defect reduced emission was obtained. Finally, the electrochemical properties were analyzed by using cyclic voltammogram and galvanostatic charge–discharge analysis analyses. The maximum capacitance was recorded at 264 F/g which was declined to 149 F/g with the growth of WO3 nanostructures size. Hence, the effect of microwave on structure and morphology, and consequent supercapacitor performances of WO3 were discussed in details.
