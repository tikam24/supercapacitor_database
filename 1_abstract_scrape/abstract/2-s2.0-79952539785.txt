The real times Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis which corresponds to the charge and discharge process was reported in order to evaluate the relationships between impedance and potential for new high specific energy electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLC). Also the Niquist plots were presented and the impedance of the EDLC was discussed in terms of complex capacitance. It was found that the high frequency impedance changed with its potential in charging or discharging process, the medium frequency impedance Rct belonged to the resistance of ions diffusion into micro pore or the inner of electrode material decreased with increasing charge voltage and had a certain capacitance of about 1F.
