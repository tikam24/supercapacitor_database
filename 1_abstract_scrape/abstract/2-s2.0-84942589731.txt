Hybrid capacitor composed of two electrodes immersed in an electrolytic solution with a separator located between the electrodes. Electrode materials store charge while electrolyte provides conductive medium for them. In hybrid capacitor, material for both electrodes are different from each other i.e. electrodes are asymmetric in nature. Due to asymmetric nature, hybrid capacitor results in higher value of energy density and specific capacitance. The value of capacitance, energy density and internal resistance are affected by the proportion of metal oxide. Metal oxides like manganese dioxide, stannic oxide, ruthenium dioxide and vanadium pentaoxide in combination with activated carbon is used in this research work for the development of hybrid capacitor. Selected metal oxide in combination with activated carbon is then varied in various proportions and its impacts are studied accordingly.
