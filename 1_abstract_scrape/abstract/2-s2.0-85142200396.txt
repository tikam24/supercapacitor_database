With the increasing demand for portable electronic devices, high-capacity supercapacitors have been widely concerned as excellent energy storage devices. Herein, ternary cobalt and copper sulfides (Co-Cu-S) are electrodeposited on the carbon cloth (CC@Ni-CoP@Co-Cu-S), which is modified by honeycomb-like cobalt and nickel phosphates (Co-Ni-P). The modification of honeycomb-like Ni-Co-P can provide a sufficient active site for the deposition of Co-Cu-S and realize high utilization of Co-Cu-S. Thus, the specific capacity of the supercapacitor is greatly improved. The specific capacity of CC@Co-Ni-P @Co-Cu-S is 0.85 F cm-2, quintupling that of CC@Co-Cu-S, and the capacity remains 94.3% after 100 cycles. In addition, CC@Co-Ni-P@Co-Cu-S has the best electrochemical performance when Co-Cu-S was deposited for eight cycles. This study fully demonstrates that Co-Ni-P modification greatly improves the specific capacity of the CC@Co-Cu-S electrode.
