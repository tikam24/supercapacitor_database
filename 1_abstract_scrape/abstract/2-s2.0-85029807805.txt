Electrochemical supercapacitors based on conducting polymers are promising energy storage devices which can combine the merits of both rechargeable batteries and conventional electrostatic capacitors. Herein, we demonstrate that the novel hybrid electrode material made of few-layered black phosphorus (BP) and polyaniline (PANI) can outperform the constructing components. BP/PANI nanocomposite demonstrates high specific capacitance of 354 F g-1 at a current density of 0.3 A g-1. The 2D morphology of BP nanosheets provides large-surface-area support for nucleation of PANI, thus offering more ion-accessible sites to the active material.
