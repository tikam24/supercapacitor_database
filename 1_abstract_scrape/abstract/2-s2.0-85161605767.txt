The integration of hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) for Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a promising solution for improving energy efficiency, reliability and battery lifetime of BEV. However, developing a power management control system is needed for sharing the electric power demand between the onboarded sources considering battery lifetime enhancing, driving range increase, and powertrain efficiency while fulfilling the electric power demand. To reduce the risk associated with the development time and cost, the model-based system engineering (MBSE) approach and system modeling language (SysML) are the key to addressing this challenge. This paper aims to present MBSE approach with SysML, which will give guidelines to develop an optimal design for an intelligent power management strategy for battery and supercapacitor EVs while using different diagrams such as: Requirement Diagram (RD), Block Definition Diagram (BDD), Internal Block Diagram (IBD),State Machine Diagram (SMD) and PFMS (Problem, Finality, Missions, System) diagram.
