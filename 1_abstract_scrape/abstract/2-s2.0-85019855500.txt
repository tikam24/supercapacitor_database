Complex nanostructured morphology of V2O5 has been grown on pliable stainless steel substrate (SS) through simple and inexpensive chemical bath deposition (CBD) for all-solid state flexible supercapacitor (SC). The structure and morphology of the synthesized V2O5 thin films revealed the formation of intermixed flakes. High specific capacitance of 735 F g−1 (at scan rate of 1 mV s−1) of V2O5 through liquid configuration motivated us to form complete flexible all-solid state symmetric supercapacitor (FASC) device. Remarkable specific capacitance of 358 F g−1. With 1.8 V wide potential window and high value of capacitive retention of 88% over 1000 cycles has been achieved for FASC. Furthermore, the origin of capacitive behavior from dual contributions of surface-controlled and diffusion-controlled charge components has been evaluated to identify the dominating nature in electrochemical reactions. As practical applicability, pliability of electrode has been tested at 175° bending angle along with the integration to large scale electrode dimension (11 ×4 cm2).
