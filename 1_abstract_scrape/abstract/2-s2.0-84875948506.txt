This paper reviews our research on the micro direct methanol fuel cells (μDMFC) first, including the anode design for power-free fuel delivering, the cathode design with capillary-based water drawn out for an air-breathing μDMFC, as well as a novel assembly method using multi-layer bonding technique on the μDMFC. Second, our research on micro supercapacitors will be introduced. A high-aspect-ratio interdigital structure for 3D micro supercapacitor is achieved by combining SU-8 photoresist with self-supporting active materials. Then, in order to develop an effective and direct way for batch fabrication of micro energy storage devices, we demonstrate an idea of incorporating nano templating method developed in material science into photolithography, which is the most commonly used semiconductor technology. The method can directly prototype operational micro devices at wafer level, especially micro supercapacitors as demonstrated. Copyright © 2013 by ECS - The Electrochemical Society.
