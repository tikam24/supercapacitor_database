Although the preparation of transition metal sulfides/oxides electrodes has been relatively perfected, it is still challenging to fabricate multi-component transition metal sulfides/oxides core-shell structure electrodes with excellent electrochemical performance. Herein, CoMoO4/MoO3@CuCoNi-S grown on nickel foam (NF) is first synthesized via facile hydrothermal and electrodeposition methods. The CoMoO4/MoO3@CuCoNi-S electrode presents an exceptional specific capacitance (2600.0 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and 68.3% of its initial capacitance at 10 A g−1. Moreover, a CoMoO4/MoO3@CuCoNi-S//active carbon (AC) device is assembled for determining its electrochemical application. It reveals a high energy density of 42.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 800.2 W kg−1, an extended voltage window of 1.6 V and excellent stability with 96.9% retention after 5000 cycles at 2 A g−1. This work offers a reference case for the development of multi-component transition metal sulfides/oxides core-shell structure composites for energy storage.
