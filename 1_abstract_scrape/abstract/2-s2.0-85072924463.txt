In recent years, with the global climate change and shortage of resources, environmental friendly renewable materials have received extensive attention. Cellulose is widely found in nature and it is a green, renewable resource. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) that prepared bychemical, mechanical, enzymatic, etc., have properties such as large specific surface area, high aspect ratio, and high crystallinity, transparent, film-forming, degradable and they have great potential applications in the field of flexible electronic materials. However, the following problems still exist in the development and application of cellulose nanofibrils: (1) the long preparation cycle, high energy consumption and high cost of the separation of cellulose nanofibrils from natural cellulose caused its scale production to face challenges; (2) cellulose nanofibrils has large specific surface area, easy to agglomerate, poor dispersibility in non-polar organic solvents and it has difficulties in composite application with polymers; (3) the surface active group of cellulose nanofibrils is mainly hydroxyl and has a single function, which limits the application of cellulose nanofibrils; (4) some properties of cellulose nanofibrils in flexible electronic materials such as folding resistance, water oxygen barrier properties, water repellency, weather resistance, and heat resistance need to be further improved. Domestic and foreign researches oncellulose nanofibrils preparation, modification and application in flexible electronic materials mainly focus on: (1) preparation of cellulose nanofibrils by exploring a novel and efficient environmentally friendly solvent system can effectively shorten the preparation cycle and the preparation process is green. (2) At present, the modification of cellulose nanofibrils and its main applications in the field of flexible electronics mainly focus on how to improve its thermal properties, dispersibility and compatibility with other composite materials. Through the small molecule chemical reaction, the introduced acetyl group and other groups can effectively increase its hydrophobicity, dispersibility and thermal properties in a non-polar solvent; by polymerization grafting reaction, the dispersion property in an organic solvent can be improved, and functional modification can also be realized according to the different materials; physical adsorption modification enhances hydrophobicity and improves dispersibility. (3) Cellulose nanofibrils has great application prospects in flexible electronic materials such as organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, supercapacitors, radio frequency identification, touch screens, transistors, etc. It is necessary to systematically expound its research status. This paper summarizes the preparation principle and methods of cellulose nanofibrils, and in order to enlarge its application scope, mainlysummarizes the modified methods of CNF, such as esterification, amidation, ion complexing, cationic, graft polymer and surfactant adsorption and so on, and then summarizes the research status of CNF as green electronic new material in flexible electronic, such as organic light-emitting devices, solar cells, supercapacitors, radio frequency identification, touch screens, transistors and so on analyzes the problems existingin the field and discusses its development prospects.
