A facile, green and highly efficient method for the decoration of carbon nanotubes with ZnO was developed for the fabrication of binder-free composite electrode for supercapacitor applications. The nano composite was prepared by using reactive magnetron sputtering in Ar/O2 environment. This approach leads to more uniform coating with tuneable thickness, which alters the electrochemical performance of the nano composite electrodes. The structure and surface morphology of the composite film have been studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The XRD study reveals the formation of Wurtzite ZnO structure. The electrochemical performance of nano composite electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry, chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance measurements in non-aqueous electrolyte. The nano composite electrode shows significant increase in the specific capacitance up to 48 F g-1 with an energy density 13.1 Wh kg-1 in the potential range -2 V to 1 V. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
