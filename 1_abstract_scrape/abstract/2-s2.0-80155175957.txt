In this paper, a real time model based DC power source emulator is presented. The emulator has a modular architecture including a high performance real time simulation core and a kilowatts level electrical power output module. It was designed for Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) tests of DC power train in electrical or hybrid electrical vehicles. The emulator architecture is introduced and two applications are presented: a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell stack emulation (low dynamics) and a supercapacitor bank emulation (high dynamics). The obtained results demonstrate that the designed DC power sources emulator is capable to emulate common DC power sources used in electrical or hybrid electrical vehicle. Â© 2011 IEEE.
