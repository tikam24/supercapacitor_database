The high specific surface area and the fine electrical conductivity are the vital impacts, but they are always a pair of mutually counterbalancing factors in carbon-based supercapacitors. Herein, a facile strategy of the combined CoCl2 catalytic graphitization and ZnCl2 activation is applied to synthesize porous carbonaceous materials with enriched nitrogen and oxygen doping from a cheap and abundant biowaste of peanut shells. The as-produced carbon materials possess high surface area (1745–2257 m2 g−1), naturally nitrogen/oxygen co-doping, and hierarchical porous structure. These physicochemical properties jointly endow these materials excellent supercapacitive performances: a high gravimetric specific capacitance of 343 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and enduring long-cycle performance of 90.9% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 in a 3-electrode system with 6 m KOH electrolyte as well as a superior energy density of 42 Wh kg−1 at the high power density of 375 W kg−1 in an organic electrolyte. This low-cost and facile approach shall open a new avenue to produce carbon materials with both high surface area and superior graphitization from the plentiful biomass for the potential energy storage applications.
