Transition-metal selenides (TMSs) have great potential in the synthesis of supercapacitor electrode materials due to their rich content and high specific capacity. However, the aggregation phenomenon of TMS materials in the process of charging and discharging will cause capacity attenuation, which seriously affects the service life and practical applications. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to design simple and efficient synthesis strategies to overcome these shortcomings. Hence, P-doped Cu3Se2 nanosheets are loaded on vertically aligned Cu2S nanorod arrays to synthesize CF/Cu2S@Cu3Se2/P nanocomposites with a unique core-shell heterostructure. Notably, the Cu2S precursors can be rapidly converted into Cu3Se2 nanorod arrays in situ in just 30 min at room temperature. The unique core-shell heterostructure effectively avoids the aggregation phenomenon, and the doped P elements further enhance the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials. Therefore, the as-prepared CF/Cu2S@Cu3Se2/P electrode exhibits a high areal capacitance of 5054 mF cm-2 (1099 C g-1) at 3 mA cm-2 and still retains 90.2% capacitance after 10 000 galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) cycles. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device assembled from synthetic CF/Cu2S@Cu3Se2/P and activated carbon (AC) possesses an energy density of 41.1 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 480.4 W kg-1. This work shows that the designed CF/Cu2S@Cu3Se2/P electrode has broad application prospects in the field of electrochemical energy storage.
