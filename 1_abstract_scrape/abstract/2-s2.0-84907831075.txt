Bicontinuous macroporous graphene foam composed of few-layered graphene sheets provides a highly conductive platform on which to deposit mesoporous polyaniline via incorporation of electrodeposition and inkjet techniques. The experimental results exhibit that the coating polyaniline thin layer on the surface of three-dimensional graphene foam via electrodeposition is of importance for changing the hydrophobic surface to a hydrophilic one and for the subsequent filling of the mesoporous polyaniline network into the macroporous graphene foam. The porous polyaniline network with high pseudocapacitance is highly efficient for adjusting the pore structure and capacitive properties of graphene foam. When used as electrode materials for supercapacitors, the resulted graphene foam-polyaniline network with high porosity renders a large areal capacitance of over 1700 mF cm-2, which is over two times the enhancement in comparison with the pure graphene foam and polyaniline thin layer coated one. The ultrahigh areal capacitance benefits from the synergistic effect of the good conductive graphene backbone and high pseudocapacitive polyaniline.
