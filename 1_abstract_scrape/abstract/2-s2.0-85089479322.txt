The manganese oxide is one of the promising material substitutes to ideal RuO2 used for supercapacitor application. Electrospinning techinque is used to deposite 1D nanofiber-like structure which provides high surface area and porosity. 1D structure gives easy pathway to electrons capable of storing the charges. Hence, the Mn2O3 nanofibers thin films deposited by electrospinning method are gaining huge attention for energy storage application.
