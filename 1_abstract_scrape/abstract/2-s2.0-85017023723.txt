Although pyrolysis holds promise for extracting biofuels from biomass, the low value of the biochar produced, combined with process energy requirements, make thermochemical conversion marginally viable. Likewise, while supercapacitors and fuel cells may satisfy growing demands for portable electronics and electric vehicles, current fossil-fuel based activated carbon electrodes are not sustainable. Both of these issues are addressed using a new approach to the integrated biorefinery. Pyrolysis of pistachio nutshell biomass yields a bio-oil high in benzenediols and pyrolysis gas enriched in methane and hydrogen. By impregnating the biochars produced via pyrolysis with potassium hydroxide, followed by heat treatment in an inert atmosphere, the total biofuel yield increased up to 25% while producing high surface area (>1900 m2/g) activated carbon biochar for use in electrochemical cells. Coin cell electrodes fabricated with these sustainable activated carbons provide almost 100% coulombic efficiency over 4000 charge-discharge cycles with a specific capacitance of 45 F/g at a scan rate of 1 mV/s using a Li-salt electrolyte. Such integrated processes will hasten the transition to a renewable energy future.
