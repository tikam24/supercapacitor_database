Two-dimensional nanomaterials, as one of the most widely used substrates for energy storage devices, have achieved great success in terms of the overall capacity. Despite the extensive research effort dedicated to this field, there are still major challenges concerning capacitance modulation and stability of the 2D materials that need to be overcome. Doping of the crystal structures, pillaring methods and 3D structuring of electrodes have been proposed to improve the material properties. However, these strategies are usually accompanied by a significant increase in the cost of the entire material preparation process and also a lack of the versatility for modification of the various types of the chemical structures. Hence in this work, versatile, cheap, and environmentally friendly method for the enhancement of the electrochemical parameter of various MXene-based supercapacitors (Ti3C2, Nb2C, and V2C), coated with functional and charged organic molecules (zwitterionsâ€”ZW) is introduced. The MXene-organic hybrid strategy significantly increases the ionic absorption (capacitance boost) and also forms a passivation layer on the oxidation-prone surface of the MXene through the covalent bonds. Therefore, this work demonstrates a new, cost-effective, and versatile approach (MXene-organic hybrid strategy) for the design and fabrication of hybrid MXene-base electrode materials for energy storage/conversion systems.
