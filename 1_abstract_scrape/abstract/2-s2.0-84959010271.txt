The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) electrodes were fabricated via electrophoretic deposition (EPD), press and screen printing methods, respectively. The electrochemical properties and electrosorption performance of the CNTs electrodes were tested, respectively. Inhere, screen printing, as a conventional method for fabricating supercapacitor electrodes, was used for fabricating the CDI electrodes for the first time. Such a comparison is reasonably envisaged not only to be used to further understanding the influence of fabrication method on the electrode performance, but also to form a fundamental basis for CDI applications.
