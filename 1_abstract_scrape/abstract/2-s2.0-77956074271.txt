In this paper, a battery-supercapacitor hybrid power system of electrical power buffers, which helps to improve a dynamic behaviour of power sources with diesel engines, is presented. The results of battery analyses are shown and it is emphasised that the combination of batteries and supercapacitors can minimise output mass and volume of power sources with diesel engine. The batteries facilitate extended high power supply and supercapacitors protect the batteries from the frequent high power peaks during battery discharging that significantly reduces battery lifetime. The values of benefits have been estimated for applying energy storage of many types of batteries. Paper gives brief outline the features of the experimental verification of batteries and discusses the basic topologies of dc-dc bi-directional converters. The scheme and detail of experimental workplace are shown in paper and tested using Agilent VEE.
