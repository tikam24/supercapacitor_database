This paper develops an electric vehicle switched-reluctance motor (SRM) drive powered by a battery/supercapacitor having grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-home (V2H)/vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functions. The power circuit of the motor drive is formed by a bidirectional two-quadrant front-end dc/dc converter and an SRM asymmetric bridge converter. Through proper control and setting of key parameters, good acceleration/deceleration, reversible driving, and braking characteristics are obtained. In idle condition, the proposed motor drive schematic can be rearranged to construct the integrated power converter to perform the following functions: 1) G2V charging mode: a single-phase two-stage switch-mode rectifier based charger is formed with power factor correction capability; 2) autonomous V2H discharging mode: the 60-Hz 220-V/110-V ac sources are generated by the developed single-phase three-wire inverter to power home appliances. Through the developed differential mode and common mode control schemes, well-regulated output voltages are achieved; 3) grid-connected V2G discharging mode: the programmed real power can be sent back to the utility grid.
