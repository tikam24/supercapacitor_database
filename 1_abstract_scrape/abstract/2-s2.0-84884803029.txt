According to the demand of wind farm power fluctuations stabilize and the characteristics of hybrid energy storage system. Taking vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) and supercapacitor (SC) as research object, a hybrid energy storage system optimal configuration model is builted. Combined with expert systems and improved genetic algorithm proposed a hybrid energy storage system to optimize the allocation method. The method first established desire output curve of the wind farm based on grid energy saving efficiency and static voltage stability indicators, then introduce coordinate control strategy based on expert system to improved genetic algorithm to get the result of optimal configuration and verify the correctness of this model and method. Finally, analysis the performance of VRB and SC in a typical day's wind farm output situation, verify the conclusions of experts coordinated control strategy can extend the vanadium battery life.
