The construction of flexible and stretchable supercapacitors with high energy density and superior stability is critical for modern wearable electronics but still remains considerably challenging. Herein we develop an ultrahigh-performance stretchable asymmetric supercapacitor (SASC) by using electrically and mechanically robust three-dimensional graphene frameworks as electrodes for the first time, in which three-dimensional graphene and a deliberately designed three-dimensional graphene/polyaniline composite are employed as the anode and cathode, respectively. The newly developed SASCs show the highest energy density of 77.8 W h kg-1 among all reported stretchable supercapacitors, and also deliver exceptional cycling stability with 95.6% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles and excellent electrochemical durability with 91.2% capacitance retention after 100 stretching cycles at a large strain of 100%. The practicability of our SASC has been further demonstrated by efficiently powering a light-emitting diode indicator (1.8 V, 10 mA) under repeated stretching of a SASC mounted on a finger. Moreover, by connecting three SASCs in series, the tandem device can even drive an STC89C51RC microcontroller-based complex circuit (5.0 V) to light a liquid crystal display.
