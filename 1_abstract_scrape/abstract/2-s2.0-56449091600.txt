In the paper the possibility of improving the energy recovered during the braking of railway vehicles and reduction of power peaks during accelerating are discussed. The energy available from the regenerative braking of the motor is stored into supercapacitor sets placed on board and reused subsequently for the acceleration of the train. This auxiliary storage system allows the reduction of the losses on the line, because the power peaks are shaved by supercapacitors and, hence, the rms power supplied is reduced. In addition, also the energy consumption of the train can be reduced respect to traditional convoys, especially if the characteristic duty-cycle presents many accelerations and braking periods as the case of subways trains. The set of supercapacitors needs the use of an intermediate dc/dc converter in order to harmonize the voltage with that of the dc-link of the drive and control the power flows of the supercapacitors. The mathematical model of the whole system and the control strategy of energy management are presented. The actual possibilities of the energy recovery are shown by means of numeric simulations and expressed in percentage respect to the energy drawn during accelerations. The control strategy has been experimentally validated on a scale system made of an asynchronous drive supplied by a dc source and a set of supercapacitors as auxiliary storage device. Â© 2008 IEEE.
