In this study, CuxS nanoplates are in-situ synthesized on the surface of copper wire (CW) as active materials (CW@CuxS) for supercapacitor electrodes, in which CW and Na2S are respectively used as copper and sulphur sources. The CW@CuxS electrode exhibits high specific capacitance up to 3.06 F cmâˆ’3, good cycling stability with nearly 80% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles, small charge transfer resistance, and low equivalent series resistance. In addition, the CW@CuxS electrode shows excellent flexibility applied to one-dimensional supercapacitors, as indicated by the relative stability of the specific capacitance in different bending states.
