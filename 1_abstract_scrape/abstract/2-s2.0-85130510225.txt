Polyoxometalates (POMs), nanosized-oxide clusters, have received much attention over recent years as an electrode material due to their unique characteristics including high protonic conductivity, acid tolerance, multi-electronic redox properties etc. In this study, the capacitive behavior of aluminum counter cation-based tungsten bronze (POM-Al) and its composites with MnO2 was studied. The as-synthesized materials were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-Vis. reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical techniques. POM-Al exhibited inferior capacitive performance, which dramatically changed upon the fusion of MnO2 with it. Only 5% of MnO2 in the composites enhances the specific capacitance of POM-Al by more than 7-times. This shows high promise of highly robust POMs for fabrication of acid electrolyte-based supercapacitors.
