A novel method, electrochemical catalytic oxidation via a ruthenium redox couple in an aqueous RuCl3 • xH2O solution rather than the anodic deposition of Ru oxides, was developed to modify the microstructure and electrochemical properties of activated carbon fabrics (ACFs). The variation in microstructures (i.e., specific surface area and mean pore size) for the modified ACFs was examined by means of nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms. The distribution of oxygen-containing functional groups within the modified ACFs was identified by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra. Effects of the electrochemical catalytic modification on the electrochemical characteristics and reversibility of ACFs were investigated systematically by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) in 0.5 M H2SO4. The total specific capacitance of ACFs reached a maximum (ca. 180 F/g measured at 10 mA/cm2) when they were catalytically modified at 1.15 V with a passed charge density of 5 C/cm2. These modified ACFs were demonstrated to be an excellent candidate for the supercapacitor application. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
