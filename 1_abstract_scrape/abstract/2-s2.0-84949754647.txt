Hybrid type supercapacitors store electrical energy through a combination of double layer charging and Faradic processes. The active electrode material plays a pivotal role on the performance of these supercapacitors. In this article, the use of different metal oxide-carbon nanomaterial-conducting polymer ternary nanocomposites as working electrode materials in hybrid supercapacitors is presented.
