A flexible Ni-Ni(OH)2/carbon nanofiber (CNF) composite material was fabricated via electrospinning followed by a high-temperature carbonization and hydrothermal process. The Ni-Ni(OH)2/CNFs calcined at 800°C exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, with high specific capacitance of 763 F g−1 (1 A g−1). Moreover, the material showed good stability, with 94% capacitance retention after 8000 cycles. This work proves that Ni-Ni(OH)2/CNFs are a promising candidate for use as a high-efficiency supercapacitor electrode material.
