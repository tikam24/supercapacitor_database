Manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanoparticles are prepared in a facile one pot reaction using oleylamine as solvent reducing and surface functionalizing agent. A simple mixture of as synthesized Mn3O 4 nanoparticles and reduced graphene oxide are tested as potential supercapacitor using cyclic voltammetry. The voltammograms are nearly perfect rectangular which indicates excellent capacitive nature of the nanoparticles-grapheme composite. A maximum specific capacitance of 170 Fg -1 is obtained in a potential range from-0.1 to 0.7 V which is higher than both reduced graphene oxide and Mn3O4 nanoparticles. Â© 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.
