Recently, much effort has been devoted to accomplish thin, lightweight and flexible energy-storage devices for wearable electronics. Here, we demonstrate a novel kind of thin all-solid-state supercapacitor configuration with an extremely simple process using two slightly separated stacked nanosheets-like Mn3O4 electrodes well solidified in the H2SO4-polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte. This integrate device shows a high specific capacitance of 127 F g-1 for the electrode materials with good power and energy density values. These flexible and all-solid-state Mn3O4 supercapacitors bring new design opportunities of device configuration for future energy-storage devices. Present investigation first time reported that Mn3O4 is one of the most promising materials for the fabrication of all solid state thin film supercapacitors (ASSTFSs). Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
