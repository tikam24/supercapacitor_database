Co3Se4 on nitrogen doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) with applications for supercapacitor and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is synthesized by pyrolysis and solvothermal processes. The catalyst due to improved electrical conductivity and increased rate of removal of H2 liberated, delivers a high HER activity, by reaching η10 at 174 mV and 240 mV, Tafel slope of 73.2 and 43.8 mV dec−1 in alkaline and acidic medium respectively. Co3Se4/N-CNT as supercapacitor electrodes, yields a capacitance of 114 F g−1 at a 2 mV s−1 scan rate, with an excellent capacitive retention of 96% of the initial capacitance after 5000 cycles.
