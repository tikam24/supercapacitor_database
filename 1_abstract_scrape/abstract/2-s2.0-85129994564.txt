Energy storage devices play a vital role in the current modern world to fulfill the needs of high-power triggered electronic appliances. Supercapacitors are emerging devices with the potential to lead the energy storage era. Herein, Bi(OH)3@Mo(OH)4 nanostructured active materials were coated on nickel foam electrodes using a versatile electrochemical deposition technique for high-performance supercapacitor applications. Through the synergistic effect of the elements of Bi and Mo, the nanostructured morphology, charge transfer capability, capacitor performance, and rate capability of the developed capacitor were significantly improved compared to those of Bi(OH)3 and Mo(OH)4 electrodes. The active electrodes exhibited a high areal specific capacitance of 759.5 mF/cm2 at a current density of 1 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. At scan rates exceeding 3 mV/s, the surface-controlled process contributed more than 60% capacity. Nyquist plots were obtained, and stability of the electrodes was also conducted. The electrodes demonstrated excellent charge transfer capabilities and cycling stability with 82.6% capacitance retention at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for 3,000 cycles. Hence, Bi(OH)3@Mo(OH)4 nanostructured active materials are potential candidates for high-performance supercapacitors.
