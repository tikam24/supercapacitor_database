This paper analyzes the procedure of charging a supercapacitor bank from low voltage with an induction machine and inverter. Specifically, the voltage drop on the supercapacitor at the beginning of this procedure, which could be a critical issue in application, was studied. The effect of inverter, supercapacitor and induction machine parameters was considered. Simulation and experimental results are presented to support the analysis. Â©2007 IEEE.
