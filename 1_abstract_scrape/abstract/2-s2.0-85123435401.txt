In this study, bare nickel oxide (NiO) and Mn2+ doped NiO nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared through the precipitation method. Samples were analyzed by XRD (X-ray diffraction), FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectra), SEM (scanning electron microscope), EDX (energy dispersive X-ray analysis), and CV (cyclic voltammetry) techniques. The XRD result indicates that the obtained samples of bare and doped NiO NPs show a face-centered cubic structure. SEM images established that the bare NiO NPs and Mn2+ doped NiO have a spherical shape. The formation of the NiO phase was confirmed by the existence of a peak at 436 cm-1 in FTIR. Electrochemical properties of bare and Mn2+ doped NiO NPs were investigated regarding their performance as an electrode in supercapacitors. The highest specific capacitance shows on bare NiO electrode 555 Fg-1 at 10mVs-1 scan rate. it shows that is a good electrode material for the supercapacitor.
