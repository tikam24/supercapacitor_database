In this study, we successfully prepare Cu3(BTC)2 (commonly known as HKUST-1 or MOF-199) in aqueous media as a green method. The morphology and crystallinity of the prepared sample were studied by XRD, FT-IR, SEM, BET, and TGA. The effects of loss of uncoordinated and coordinated water molecules on the capacitive properties of Cu3(BTC)2 were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge curves, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results show that removing the water molecules that are both uncoordinated and coordinated, enhances the areal capacitance of Cu3(BTC)2 MOF up to 80 mF cm−2 at a current density of 0.2 mA cm−2.
