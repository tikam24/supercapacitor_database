The development of high performance supercapacitors with high energy densities without sacrificing power densities has always been at the leading edge of the emerging field of renewable energy. Herein, the design and fabrication of innovative high performance binder-free electrodes consisting of coiled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and biomass-derived hydrothermal carbon spheres (HTCSs) as, respectively, positive and negative electrodes is reported. High performance asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs) were developed using novel 3D core/shell-like binary Ni-Co oxide (NCO) decorated coiled CNTs directly grown on Ni nano-cone arrays (NCAs) and HTCSs directly deposited on NCAs. Novel 3D structures of NCAs were synthesized via a facile and scalable cathodic electrodeposition route and coiled CNTs were directly grown on them by catalytic chemical vapour deposition (CVD) followed by a facile hydrothermal method to integrally decorate the coiled CNTs/NCAs by 3D flower-like NCO. A one-pot hydrothermal method is also used to direct the synthesis of biomass-derived HTCSs on NCAs to fabricate a novel binder-free negative electrode. The ASC based on NCO@coiled CNTs/NCAs//HTCSs/NCAs not only exhibits superior energy density (72.5 W h kg -1 ) at a reasonable power density of 1.4 kW kg -1 , but also represents remarkable cycling durability (retaining almost over 85% of its initial capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles). The fabricated ASC, therefore, seems to be a potent candidate for practical applications in future high performance energy storage systems.
