Nanostructured thin films of copper oxide (CuO) were deposited using a facile spray pyrolysis approach on glass substrates at controlled temperature setting of 400 °C. The creation of pure polycrystalline CuO with a tenorite transition, which has a monoclinic structural that is very viable for super-capacitors, was revealed by the X-ray diffraction analysis. The crystal structure of CuO film was improved with the γ-irradiation doses with a preferred orientation along (−111) before and after the irradiation. CuO thin film has a direct optical band gap according to the optical measurements, which generally increases with the gamma irradiation dose. The optical constants such as the dielectric constant's real and imaginary parts as well as the optical conductivity, the extinction coefficient, the refractive index, and the absorption coefficient have been measured and their values also decrease with the increase in irradiation dose. Utilizing cyclic voltammetry in a 1M KOH electrolyte, which demonstrates a maximum specific capacitance of 192.20 Fg-1 at a scan rate of 5 mVs−1, the electrochemical amazingly capabilities of CuO thin films were assessed. Importantly, CuO electrode impedance studies reveal that CuO is a viable material for super-capacitor applications.
