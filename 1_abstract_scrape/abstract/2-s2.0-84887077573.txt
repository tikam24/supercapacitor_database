Potentiostatic two step anodizing of titanium utilized for preparation of self organized titania nanotubes arrays with diameter of 150 nm. Then the new alginate method has been applied for incorporation of NiO into the nanotubes. The prepared hybrid materials have been characterized by various methods including field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry and cyclic voltammetry analyses. The X-ray diffraction patterns of samples were also studied by Rietveld's method. Results showed that the prepared electrode containing anatase, rutile and NiO phases with fraction of 70, 8, and 22%, respectively. It was found that by application of the new method, porous NiO uniformly coated on nanotubes surface and great enhancement of specific capacitance from 0.14 to 3.8 mF cm-2 could be obtained. The prepared nanocomposites are promising materials for supercapacitance application and also for solar energy harvesting systems. Â© World Scientific Publishing Company.
