Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is an important transparent thermoplastic polymer having appropriate strength, chemical, weathering, heat, and UV resistance. However, essential properties of this versatile polymer need to be enhanced for high-tech applications. Graphene has opened up a new vista for developing functional polymeric nanocomposite. Therefore, reinforcement of PMMA with graphene and related nanofiller has been focused in literature. This review basically highlights the fundamentals and characteristics of the significant classes of PMMA/graphene, PMMA/graphene oxide, and PMMA/graphite nanocomposite. Recent developments in the applications of PMMA/graphene-based nanofiller nanocomposite in biomedical, sensor, supercapacitor, flame retardant, and electromagnetic interference shielding materials were also comprehended.
