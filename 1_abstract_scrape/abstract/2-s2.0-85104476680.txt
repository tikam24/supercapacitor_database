The development of versatile functional composites is an intriguing and challenging approach to clean energy storage devices and electromagnetic pollution remediation. Herein, versatile bimetal sulfides nanoparticles-embedded N-doped 3D hierarchical carbonaceous aerogels was rationally constructed via controllable oxidation polymerization, mechanical blending and heat treatment methods. The encapsulation of bimetal NixSy/CoxSy nanoparticles and defects induced by N-doping can endow the fabricated aerogels with versatilities for excellent supercapacitors and microwave absorber. The dispersed and abundant active sites and easily diffused framework leads to remarkable electrochemical performances with a high specific capacitance of 2653.3 F g−1 at 1 A g−1 and excellent cycling stability of 89.2% at 10 A g−1 over 5000 cycles. More importantly, the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor of N-NixSy/CoxSy@C-900//AC displayed an energy density of 98.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 371 W k g−1. Moreover, taking advantage of the unique heterostructures and well impedance matching, as-fabricated composites exhibited outstanding microwave absorption performance. The minimum reflection loss (RL) of - 47.2 dB was achieved at 11.6 GHz with the thickness of 2.5 mm, and an effective frequency bandwidth (RL<-10 dB) could be gained up to 3.7 (9.8–13.5) GHz. This work presents potential application in supercapacitor and microwave absorption.
