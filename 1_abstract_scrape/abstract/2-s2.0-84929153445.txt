The effect of oxygen-plasma treatment on the capacitive behavior of electrospun carbon nanofibers is investigated. The plasma-modified fibers are enriched in oxygen functionalities, resulting in increased fiber wettability. Moreover, the plasma-treated nanofibers exhibit a specific capacitance of 377.0 F g<sup>-1</sup>, which is more than twice that of the nontreated nanofibers.
