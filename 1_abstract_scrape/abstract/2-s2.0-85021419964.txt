Regenerative braking technology is crucial for electric vehicle applications. Where, the motor is used as a generator to charge the vehicle's battery. However, the regenerated energy is not fully returned to the battery. Some power losses are experienced in between such as losses in the motor's armature and switching losses. The motor drive system described in this paper has an energy storage system comprised of a supercapacitor module and a lithium ion battery connected through a DC/DC converter to a dc motor. This allows efficient, high power transfer under regenerative braking and acceleration. Managing the power flow through the DC/DC converter and therefore the supercapacitor voltage is a key control parameter that affects the efficiency of the overall system.
