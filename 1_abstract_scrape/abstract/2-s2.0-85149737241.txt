Holding a promise of achieving high power and energy densities, Li-ion hybrid electrochemical capacitors present a crucial future direction for energy storage devices. However, technical challenges remain to appropriately couple both high-power capacitor-type and high-energy battery-type electrode materials within a same device. In addition, the current electrode materials in the device are usually prepared separately, which leads to lengthy preparation, time-consuming and high-cost. In this work, we report a simple method to prepare porous carbon materials (PC) with and without MnO nanoparticle cores, which function as very unique anode/cathode pairs for very high-performance Li ion hybrid supercapacitor. Taking the respective merits of high Li storage capacity from the MnO@C anode and high-rate performance from the PC cathode, the resulted device exhibits a remarkable energy density of 89 Wh·kg−1 (at 48 W·kg−1) and can reach a battery-inaccessible power density of 18 kW·kg−1 (at 45 Wh·kg−1).
