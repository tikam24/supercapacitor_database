## Introduction

- Importance of supercapacitor energy storage. Some definitions, classification and explanations about SC.
- Importance of SC materials + properties database. Also mention other materials databases made by previous researchers.
- Briefly explains the methods used like webscrapping, Regex, Language Models.
- Write about Training BatteryBERT models and its performance.
- Establish why SC database generation is Important and novellty of doing it.
- Scope of the work in the development of SC technology.


## Methods

- Relevant articles identification using Scopus search API with “Supercapacitor” as a query word.
- Web scrapping of Abstract using Scopus API along with the details.
- ChemDataExtractor to identify CEMs in the abstracts text.
- Regular Expression to Identify properties values.
- Relationship extraction and final DB creation using NLP and BERT language model by employing QA method.

## Results and Discussion

- Table summary of data Records
- Maximum and minimum value of individual properties.
- Series data (% of series data records), multiple values in the same paper.
- Flags (S- series data for 1 chemical name)
- Stacked bar chart: the number of published papers about supercapacitor materials over the last 20 years.
- Provide table for the hyperparameters of the models and also add performance score.
- Ven diagram of all the properties and number of properties

## Conclusion
